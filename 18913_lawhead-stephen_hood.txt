stephen r lawhead hood prologue the pig was young and wary a yearling boar timidly testing the wind for strange scents as it ventured out into the honeycoloured light of a fastfading day bran ap brychan prince of elfael had spent the entire day stalking the greenwood for a suitable prize and he meant to have this one eight years old and the kings sole heir he knew well enough that he would never be allowed to go out into the forest alone so rather than seek permission he had simply taken his bow and four arrows early that morning and stolen from the caer unnoticed this hunt like the young boar was dedicated to his mother the queen she loved the hunt and gloried in the wild beauty and visceral excitement of the chase even when she did not ride herself she would ready a welcome for the hunters with a saddle cup and music leading the women in song dont be afraid she told bran when as a toddling boy he had been dazzled and a little frightened by the noise and revelry we belong to the land look bran she lifted a slender hand toward the hills and the forest rising like a living rampart beyond all that you see is the work of our lords hand we rejoice in his provision stricken with a wasting fever queen rhian had been sick most of the summer and in his childish imaginings bran had determined that if he could present her with a stag or a boar that he had brought down all by himself she would laugh and sing as she always did and she would feel better she would be well again all it would take was a little more patience and still as stone he waited in the deepening shadow the young boar stepped nearer its small pointed ears erect and proud it took another step and stopped to sample the tender shoots of a mallow plant bran an arrow already nocked to the string pressed the bow forward feeling the tension in his shoulder and back just the way iwan said he should do not aim the arrow the older youth had instructed him just think it to the mark send it on your thought and if your thought is true so too will fly the arrow pressing the bow to the limit of his strength he took a steadying breath and released the string feeling the sharp tingle on his fingertips the arrow blazed across the distance striking the young pig low in the chest behind the front legs startled it flicked its tail rigid and turned to bolt into the wood but two steps later its legs tangled it stumbled and went down the stricken creature squealed once and tried to rise then subsided dead where it fell bran loosed a wild whoop of triumph the prize was his he ran to the pig and put his hand on the animals sleek slightly speckled haunch feeling the warmth there i am sorry my friend and i thank you he murmured as iwan had taught him i need your life to live it was only when he tried to shoulder his kill that bran realised his great mistake the dead weight of the animal was more than he could lift by himself with a sinking heart he stood gazing at his glorious prize as tears came to his eyes it was all for nothing if he could not carry the trophy home in triumph sinking down on the ground beside the warm carcass bran put his head in his hands he could not carry it and he would not leave it what was he going to do as he sat contemplating his predicament the sounds of the forest grew loud in his ears the chatter of a squirrel in a treetop the busy click and hum of insects the rustle of leaves the hushed flutter of wings above him and then bran bran started at the voice he glanced around hopefully here he called here i need help go back the voice seemed to come from above he raised his eyes to see a huge black bird watching him from a branch directly over his head it was only an old raven shoo go back said the bird go back i wont shouted bran he reached for a stick on the path picked it up drew back and threw it at the bothersome bird shut up the stick struck the ravens perch and the bird flew off with a cry that sounded to bran like laughter ha ha haw ha ha haw stupid bird he muttered turning again to the young pig beside him he remembered what he had seen other hunters do with small game releasing the string on his bow he gathered the creatures short legs and tied the hooves together with the cord then passing the stave through the bound hooves and gripping the stout length of oak in either hand he tried to lift it the carcass was still too heavy for him so he began to drag his prize through the forest using the bow it was slow going even on the wellworn path with frequent stops to rub the sweat from his eyes and catch his breath all the while the day dwindled around him no matter he would not give up clutching the bow stave in his hands he struggled on step by step tugging the young boar along the trail reaching the edge of the forest as the last gleam of twilight faded across the valley to the west bran the shout made him jump it was not a raven this time but a voice he knew he turned and looked down the slope toward the valley to see iwan coming toward him long legs paring the distance with swift strides here bran called waving his aching arms overhead here i am in the name of all the saints and angels the young man said when he came near enough to speak what do you think you are doing out here hunting replied bran indicating his kill with a hunters pride he said it strayed in front of my arrow see i see replied iwan giving the pig a cursory glance he turned and started away again we have to go its late and everyone is looking for you bran made no move to follow looking back iwan said leave it bran they are searching for you we must hurry no bran said not without the boar he stooped once more to the carcass seized the bow stave and started tugging again iwan returned took him roughly by the arm and pulled him away leave the stupid thing it is for my mother the boy shouted the tears starting hot and quick as the tears began to fall he bent his head and repeated more softly please it is for my mother weeping judas iwan relented with an exasperated sigh come then we will carry it together iwan took one end of the bow stave bran took the other and between them they lifted the carcass off the ground the wood bent but did not break and they started away againbran stumbling ever and again in a forlorn effort to keep pace with his longlegged friend night was upon them the caer but a brooding black eminence on its mound in the centre of the valley when a party of mounted searchers appeared he was hunting iwan informed them a hunter does not leave his prize the riders accepted this and the young boar was quickly secured behind the saddle of one of the horses bran and iwan were taken up behind other riders and the party rode for the caer the moment they arrived bran slid from the horse and ran to his mothers chamber behind the hall hurry he called bring the boar queen rhians chamber was lit with candles and two women stood over her bed when bran burst in he ran to her bedside and knelt down mam see what i brought you she opened her eyes and recognition came to her there you are my dearling they said they could not find you i went hunting he announced for you for me she whispered a fine thing that what did you find look he said proudly as iwan strode into the room with the pig slung over his shoulders oh bran she said the ghost of a smile touching her dry lips kiss me my brave hunter he bent his face to hers and felt the heat of her dry lips on his go now i will sleep a little she told him and i will dream of your triumph she closed her eyes then and bran was led from the room but she had smiled and that was worth all the world to him queen rhian did not waken in the morning by the next evening she was dead and bran never saw his mother smile again and although he continued to hone his skill with the bow he lost all interest in the hunt part one day of the wolf chapter i bran the shout rattled through the stoneflagged yard bran get your sorry tail out here were leaving redfaced with exasperation king brychan ap tewdwr climbed stiffly into the saddle narrowed eyes scanning the ranks of mounted men awaiting his command his feckless son was not amongst them turning to the warrior on the horse beside him he demanded iwan where is that boy i have not seen him lord replied the kings champion neither this morning nor at the table last night curse his impudence growled the king snatching the reins from the hand of his groom the one time i need him beside me and he flits off to bed that slut of his i will not suffer this insolence and i will not wait if it please you lord i will send one of the men to fetch him no it does not bloody please me roared brychan he can stay behind and the devil take him turning in the saddle he called for the gate to be opened the heavy timber doors of the fortress groaned and swung wide raising his hand he gave the signal ride out iwan cried his voice loud in the early morning calm king brychan lord of elfael departed with the thirtyfive cymry of his mounted warband at his back the warriors riding in twos and threes descended the rounded slope of the hill and fanned out across the shallow cupshaped valley fording the stream that cut across the meadow and following the cattle trail as it rose to meet the dark bristling rampart of the forest known to the folk of the valley as coed cadw the guarding wood at the edge of the forest brychan and his escort joined the road ancient deeprutted overgrown and sunken low between its high earthen banks the bare dirt track bent its way south and east over the rough hills and through the broad expanse of dense primeval forest until descending into the broad wye vale where it ran along the wide green waters of the easyflowing river farther on the road passed through the two principal towns of the region hereford an english market town and caer gloiu the ancient roman settlement in the wide marshy lowland estuary of mor hafren in four days this same road would bring them to lundein where the lord of elfael would face the most difficult trial of his long and arduous reign there was a time brychan observed bitterly when the last warrior to reach the meeting place was put to death by his comrades as punishment for his lack of zeal it was deemed the first fatality of the battle allow me to fetch the prince for you iwan offered he could catch up before the day is out i will not hear it brychan dismissed the suggestion with a sharp chop of his hand weve wasted too much breath on that worthless whelp i will deal with him when we return he said adding under his breath and he will wish to heaven he had never been born with an effort the aging king pushed all thoughts of his profligate son aside and settled into a sullen silence that lasted well into the day upon reaching the vale of wye the travellers descended the broad slope into the valley and proceeded along the river the road was good here and the water wide slow flowing and shallow around midday they stopped on the mossgrown banks to water the horses and take some food for themselves before moving on iwan had given the signal to remount and they were just pulling the heads of the horses away from the water when a jingling clop was heard on the road a moment later four riders appeared coming into view around the base of a highsided bluff one look at the long pallid faces beneath their burnished warcaps and the kings stomach tightened ffreinc grumbled brychan putting his hand to his sword they were norman marchogi and the british king and his subjects despised them utterly to arms men called iwan be on your guard upon seeing the british warband the norman riders halted in the road they wore conical helmets and despite the heat of the day heavy mail shirts over padded leather jerkins that reached down below their knees their shins were covered with polished steel greaves and leather gauntlets protected their hands wrists and forearms each carried a sword on his hip and a short spear tucked into a saddle pouch a narrow shield shaped like an elongated raindrop painted blue was slung upon each of their backs mount up iwan commanded swinging into the saddle brychan at the head of his troops called a greeting in his own tongue twisting his lips into an unaccustomed smile of welcome when his greeting was not returned he tried englishthe hated but necessary language used when dealing with the backward folk of the southlands one of the riders seemed to understand he made a curt reply in french and then turned and spurred his horse back the way he had come his three companions remained in place regarding the british warriors with wary contempt seeing his grudging attempt at welcome rebuffed lord brychan raised his reins and urged his mount forward ride on men he ordered and keep your eyes on the filthy devils at the british approach the three knights closed ranks blocking the road unwilling to suffer an insult however slight brychan commanded them to move aside the norman knights made no reply but remained planted firmly in the centre of the road brychan was on the point of ordering his warband to draw their swords and ride over the arrogant fools when iwan spoke up saying my lord our business in lundein will put an end to this unseemly harassment let us endure this last slight with good grace and heap shame on the heads of these cowardly swine you would surrender the road to them i would my lord replied the champion evenly we do not want the report of a fight to mar our petition in lundein brychan stared dark thunder at the ffreinc soldiers my lord said iwan i think it is best oh very well huffed the king at last turning to the warriors behind him he called to keep the peace we will go around as the britons prepared to yield the road the first norman rider returned and with him another man on a pale grey mount with a high leather saddle this one wore a blue cloak fastened at the throat with a large silver brooch you there he called in english what are you doing brychan halted and turned in the saddle do you speak to me i do speak to you the man insisted who are you and where are you going the man you address is rhi brychan lord and king of elfael replied iwan speaking up quickly we are about business of our own which takes us to lundein we seek no quarrel and would pass by in peace elfael wondered the man in the blue cloak unlike the others he carried no weapons and his gauntlets were white leather you are british that we are replied iwan what is your business in lundein it is our affair alone replied brychan irritably we ask only to journey on without dispute stay where you are replied the bluecloaked man i will summon my lord and seek his disposition in the matter the man put spurs to his mount and disappeared around the bend in the road the britons waited growing irritated and uneasy in the hot sun the bluecloaked man reappeared some moments later and with him was another also wearing blue but with a spotless white linen shirt and trousers of fine velvet younger than the others he wore his fair hair long to his shoulders like a womans with his sparse pale beard curling along the soft line of his jaw he appeared little more than a youngster preening in his fathers clothes like the others with him he carried a shield on his shoulder and a long sword on his hip his horse was black and it was larger than any plough horse brychan had ever seen you claim to be rhi brychan lord of elfael the newcomer asked in a voice so thickly accented the britons could barely make out what he said i make no claim sir replied brychan with terse courtesy the english thick on his tongue it is a very fact why do you ride to lundein with your warband inquired the pastyfaced youth can it be that you intend to make war on king william on no account sir replied iwan answering to spare his lord the indignity of this rude interrogation we go to swear fealty to the king of the ffreinc at this the two bluecloaked figures leaned near and put their heads together in consultation it is too late william will not see you who are you to speak for the king demanded iwan i say again this affair does not concern you added brychan you are wrong it has become my concern replied the young man in blue i am count falkes de braose and i have been given the commot of elfael he thrust his hand into his shirt and brought out a square of parchment this i have received in grant from the hand of king william himself liar roared brychan drawing his sword all thirtyfive of his warband likewise unsheathed their blades you have a choice the norman lord informed them imperiously give over your weapons and swear fealty to me or sneered brychan glaring contempt at the five ffreinc warriors before him or die like the very dogs you are replied the young man simply hie up shouted the british king slapping the rump of his horse with the flat of his sword the horse bolted forward take them iwan lofted his sword and circled it twice around his head to signal the warriors and the entire warband spurred their horses to attack the normans held their ground for two or three heartbeats and then turned as one and fled back along the road disappearing around the bend at the base of the bluff king brychan was first to reach the place he rounded the bend at a gallop flying headlong into an armed warhost of more than three hundred norman marchogi both footmen and knights waiting with weapons at the ready throwing the reins to the side the king wheeled his mount and headed for the riverbank ambush ambush he cried to those thundering up behind him its a trap the oncoming cymry seeing their king flee for the water with a score of marchogi behind him raced to cut them off they reached the enemy flank and careered into it at full gallop spears couched horses reared and plunged as they went over riders fell and were trampled the british charge punched a hole in the norman flank and carried them deep into the ranks using spears and swords they proceeded to cut a swathe through the dense thicket of enemy troops iwan leading the charge sliced the air with his spear thrusting again and again carving a crimson pathway through horseflesh and manflesh alike with deadly efficiency he took the fight to the betterarmed and betterprotected marchogi and soon outdistanced his own comrades twisting in the saddle he saw that the attack had bogged down behind him the norman knights having absorbed the initial shock of the charge were now surrounding the smaller cymry force it was time to break off lest the warband become engulfed with a flick of the reins iwan started back over the bodies of those he had cut down he had almost reached the main force of struggling cymry when two massive norman knights astride huge destriers closed the path before him swords raised they swooped down on him iwan thrust his spear at the one on the right only to have the shaft splintered by the one on the left throwing the ragged end into the normans face he drew his sword and pulling back hard on the reins turned his mount and slipped aside as the two closed within striking distance one of the knights lunged at him swinging wildly iwan felt the blade tip rake his upper back then he was away king brychan meanwhile reached the river and turned to face his attackersfour marchogi coming in hard behind levelled spears lashing out with his sword brychan struck at the first rider catching him a rattling blow along the top of the shield he then swung on the second slashing at the mans exposed leg the warrior gave out a yelp and threw his shield into brychans face the king smashed it aside with the pommel of his sword the shield swung away and down revealing the point of a spear brychan heaved himself back to avoid the thrust but the spear caught him in the lower gut just below his wide belt the blade burned as it pierced his body he loosed a savage roar and hacked wildly with his sword the shaft of the spear sheared away taking a few of the soldiers fingers with it raising his blade again the king turned to meet the next attacker but too late even as his elbow swung up an enemy blade thrust in he felt a cold sting and pain rippled up his arm his hand lost its grip the sword spun from his fingers as he swayed in the saddle recoiling from the blow iwan fighting free of the clash raced to his lords aid he saw the kings blade fall to the water as brychan reeled and then slumped the champion slashed the arm of one attacker and opened the side of another as he sped by then his way was blocked by a sudden swirl of norman attackers hacking with wild and determined energy he tried to force his way through by dint of strength alone but the enemy riders closed ranks against him his sword became a gleaming flash around him as he struck out again and again he dropped one knight whose misjudged thrust went wide and wounded another who desperately reined his horse away and out of range of the champions lethal blade as he turned to take the third attacker iwan glimpsed his king struggling to keep his saddle he saw brychan lurch forward and topple from his horse into the water the king struggled to his knees and beheld his champion fighting to reach him a short distance away ride he shouted flee you must warn the people rhi brychan made one last attempt to rise got his feet under him and took an unsteady step then collapsed the last thing iwan saw was the body of his king floating facedown in the turgid bloodstained waters of the wye chapter z kiss before i go bran murmured taking a handful of thick dark hair and pressing a curled lock to his lips just one no replied merian pushing him away away with you a kiss first he insisted inhaling the rosewater fragrance of her hair and skin if my father finds you here he will flay us both she said still resisting go nowbefore someone sees you a kiss only i swear bran whispered sliding close she regarded the young man beside her doubtfully certainly there was not another in all the valleys like him in looks grace and raw seductive appeal he knew no equal with his black hair high handsome brow and a ready smile that was as always a little lopsided and deceptively shythe mere sight of bran ap brychan caused female hearts young and old to flutter when he passed add to this a supple wit and a freeranging unfettered charm and the prince of elfael was easily the most ardently discussed bachelor amongst the marriageable young women of the region the fact that he also stood next in line to the kingship was not lost on any of them more than one lovesick young lady sighed herself to sleep at night in the fervent hope of winning bran ap brychans heart for her owncausing more than one determined father to vow to nail that wastrels head to the nearest doorpost if he ever caught him within a roman mile of his virgin daughters bed yet and yet there was a flightiness to his winsome ways a fickle inconstancy to even his most solemn affirmations a lack of fidelity in his ardour he possessed a waggish capriciousness that most often showed itself in a sly refusal to take seriously the genuine concerns of life bran flitted from one thing to the next as the whim took him never remaining long enough to reap the alltooinevitable consequences of his flings and frolics lithe and longlimbed habitually clothed in the darkest hues which gave him an appearance of austerityan impression completely overthrown by the puckish glint in his clear dark eyes and the sudden unpredictable and utterly provocative smilehe nevertheless gorged on an endless glut of indulgence forever helping himself to the best of everything his noble position could offer king brychans rake of a son was unashamedly pleased with himself a kiss my love and i will take wings bran whispered pressing himself closer still feeling both appalled and excited by the danger bran always brought with him merian closed her eyes and brushed his cheek with her lips there she said firmly pushing him away now off with you ah merian he said placing his head on her warm breast how can i go when to leave you is to leave my heart behind you promised she hissed in exasperation stiff arms forcing him away again there came the sound of a shuffling footstep outside the kitchen door hurry suddenly terrified she grabbed him by the sleeve and pulled him to his feet it might be my father let him come i am not afraid we will have this out once and for all bran no she pleaded if you have any thought for me at all do not let anyone find you here very well bran replied i go he leaned close and stole a lingering kiss then leapt to the window frame pushed open the shutter and prepared to jump until tonight my love he said over his shoulder then dropped to the ground in the yard outside merian rushed to the window and pulled the heavy wooden shutter closed then turned and began busying herself stirring up the embers on the hearth as the sleepnumbed cook shambled into the large dark room bran leaned back against the side of the house and listened to the voices drifting down from the room aboveto the cooks mumbled question and merians explanation of what she was doing in the kitchen before break of day he smiled to himself true he had not yet succeeded in winning his way into merians bed lord cadwgans fetching daughter was proving a match worthy of his wiles even so before summer was gone he would succeed of that he was certain oh but the season of warmth and light was everywhere in full retreat already the soft greens and yellows of summer were fading into autumn drab soon all too soon the fair bright days would give way to the endless grey of clouds and mist and icy windlashed rain that was a concern for another time now he must be on his way drawing the hood of his cloak over his head bran darted across the yard scaled the wall at its lowest span and ran to his horse which was tethered behind a hawthorn thicket next to the wall with the wind at his back and a little luck he would reach caer cadarn well before his father departed for lundein the day was breaking fair and the track was dry so he pushed his mount hard pelting down the broad hillsides splashing across the streams and flying up the steep wheelrutted trails luck was not with him however for he had just glimpsed the pale shimmer of the caers whitewashed wooden palisade in the distance when his horse pulled up lame the unfortunate beast jolted to a halt and refused to go farther no amount of coaxing could persuade the animal to move sliding from the saddle bran examined the left foreleg the shoe had torn awayprobably lost amidst the rocks of the last streambedand the hoof was split there was blood on the fetlock bran lowered the leg with a sigh and retrieving the reins began leading his limping mount along the track his father would be waiting now and he would be angry but then he thought when was lord brychan not angry for the last many yearsindeed ever since bran could rememberhis father had nursed one continual simmering rage it forever seethed just beneath the surface and was only too likely to boil over at the slightest provocation and then god help whoever or whatever was nearby objects were hurled against walls dogs were kicked and servants too everyone within shouting distance received the ready lash of their surly lords tongue bran arrived at the caer far later than he had intended slinking through the wideopen gate like a smith opening the forge furnace door he braced himself for the heat of his fathers angry blast but the yard was empty of all save gwrgi the lords halfblind staghound who came snuffling up to put his wet muzzle in brans palm everyone gone bran asked looking around the old dog licked the back of his hand just then his fathers steward stepped from the hall a dour and disapproving stilt of a man he loomed over all the comings and goings of the caer like a damp cloud and was never happy unless he could make someone else as miserable as himself you are too late he informed bran ripe satisfaction dripping from his thin lips i can see that maelgwnt said bran how long ago did they leave you wont catch them replied the steward if thats what youre thinking sometimes i wonder if you think at all get me a horse ordered bran why maelgwnt asked eyeing the mount standing inside the gate have you ruined another one just get me a horse i dont have time to argue of course sire right away sniffed the steward as soon as you tell me where to find one what do you mean demanded bran there are none with a grunt of impatience bran hurried to the stable at the far end of the long rectangular yard he found one of the grooms mucking out the stalls quick cefn i need a horse lord bran said the young servant im sorry there are none left theyve taken them all the whole warband was summoned the groom explained they needed every horse but the mares bran knew which horses he meant there were four broodmares to which five colts had been born in early spring the foals were of an age to wean but had not yet been removed from their mothers bring me the black bran commanded she will have to do what about hathr inquired the groom hathr threw a shoe and split a hoof hell need looking after for a few days and i must join my father on the road before the day is out lord brychan said we were not to use i need a horse cefn said bran cutting off his objection saddle the blackand hurry i must ride hard if i am to catch them while the groom set about preparing the mare bran hurried to the kitchen to find something to eat the cook and her two young helpers were busy shelling peas and protested the intrusion with smiles and winks and murmured endearments however bran cajoled and old mairead succumbed to his charm as she always did youll be king one day she chided and is this how you will fare snatching meals from the hearth and running off whoknowswhere all day im going to lundein mairead it is a far journey would you have your future king starve on the way or go abegging like a leper lord have mercy clucked the cook setting aside her chore never let it be said anyone went hungry from my hearth she ladled some fresh milk into a bowl into which she broke chunks of hard brown bread then sat him down on a stool while he ate she cut a few slices of new summer sausage and gave him two green apples which he stuffed into the pouch at his belt bran spooned down the milk and bread and then throwing the elderly servant a kiss bounded from the kitchen and back across the yard to the stable where cefn was just tightening the saddle cinch on his horse a world of thanks to you cefn you have saved my life olwen is the best broodmare we havesee you dont push her too hard called the groom as the prince clattered out into the yard bran gave him a breezy wave and the groom added under his breath and may our lord brychan have mercy on you out on the trail once more bran felt certain he could win his way back into his fathers good graces it might take a day or two but once the king saw how dutifully the prince was prepared to conduct himself in lundein brychan would not fail to restore his son to favour first however bran set himself to think up a plausible tale to help excuse his apparent absence thus he put his mind to spinning a story which if not entirely believable would at least be entertaining enough to lighten the kings foul mood this task occupied him as he rode easily along the path through the forest he had just started up the long meandering track leading to the high and thickly forested ridge that formed the western boundary of the broad wye vale and was thinking that with any luck at all he might still catch his father and the warband before dusk this thought dissolved instantly upon seeing a lone rider lurching toward him on a hobbling horse he was still some distance away but bran could see that the man was hunched forward in the saddle as if to urge his labouring mount to greater speed probably drunk rotten sot thought bran and doesnt realise his horse is dead on its feet well he would stop the emptyheaded lout and see if he could find out how far ahead his father might be closer something about the man seemed familiar as the rider drew nearer bran grew increasingly certain he knew the man and he was not wrong it was iwan chapter bernard de neufmarche stormed down the narrow corridor leading from the main hall to his private chambers deep in the protecting stone wall of the fortress his red velvet cloak was grey with the dust of travel his back throbbed with the dull persistent ache of fatigue and his mind was a spinning maelstrom of dark thoughts as black as his mood seven years lost he fumed ruined wasted and lost he had been patient prudent biding his time watching and waiting for precisely the right moment to strike and now in one precipitous act unprovoked and unforeseen the redhaired brigand of a king william had allied himself with that milksop baron de braose and his mewling nephew count falkes that was bad enough to make a disastrous business worse the irresponsible king had also reversed the longheld royal policy of his father and allowed de braose to launch an invasion into the interior of wales royal let to plunder wales was the very development neufmarche had been waiting for but now it had been ruined by the greedy grasping de braose mob their illconceived thrashing around the countryside would put the wily britons on their guard and any advancement on bernards part would now be met with stiffnecked resistance and accomplished only at considerable expense of troops and blood so be it waiting had brought him nothing and he would wait no longer at the door to his rooms he shouted for his chamberlain remey he cried my writing instruments at once flinging open the door he strode to the hearth snatched up a reed from the bundle and thrust it into the small sputtering fire he then carried the burning rush to the candletree atop the square oak table that occupied the centre of the room and began lighting the candles as the shadows shrank beneath the lambent light the baron dashed wine from a jar into his silver cup raised it to his lips and drank a deep thirsty draught he then shouted for his chamberlain again and collapsed into his chair seven years by the virgin he muttered he drank again and cried remey this time his summons was answered by the quick slap of soft boots on the flagstone threshold sire said the servant bustling into the room with his arms full of writing utensilsrolls of parchment an inkhorn a bundle of quills sealing wax and a knife i did not expect you to return so soon i trust everything went well no growled the baron irritably it did not go well it went very badly while i was paying court to the king de braose and his snivelling nephew were sending an army through my lands to snatch elfael and who knows what all else from under my nose remey sighed in commiseration an aging lackey with the face of a ferret and a long narrow head perpetually covered by a shapeless cap of thick grey felt he had been in the service of the neufmarche clan since he was a boy at le neufmarchenlions in beauvais he knew well his masters moods and appetites and was usually able to anticipate them with ease but today he had been caught napping and this annoyed him almost as much as the king had annoyed the baron the de braose are unscrupulous as we all know remey observed arranging the items he had brought on the table before the baron cut me a pen the baron ordered taking up a roll of parchment he sliced off a suitable square with his dagger and smoothed the prepared skin on the table before him remey meanwhile selected a fine long goose quill and expertly pared the tip on an angle and split it with the pen knife see if this will suffice he said offering the prepared writing instrument to his master bernard pulled the stopper from the inkhorn and dipped the pen he made a few preliminary swirls on the parchment and said it will do now bring me my dinner none of that broth mind ive ridden all day and im hungry i want meat and breadsome of that pie too and more wine at once my lord replied the servant leaving his master to his work by the time remey returned accompanied this time by two kitchen servants bearing trays of food and drink neufmarche was leaning back in his chair studying the document he had just composed listen to this said the baron and holding the parchment before his eyes he began to read what he had written remey held his head to one side as his master read it was a letter to the barons father in beauvais requesting a transfer of men and equipment to aid in the conquest of new territories in britain the resulting acquisitions will enlarge our holdings at least threefold bernard read with good land much of which is valley lowlands possessing tillable soil suitable for a variety of crops while the rest is mature forest which besides timber will provide excellent hunting here the baron broke off what do you think remey is it enough i should think so lord geoffrey was out here two years ago and is well aware of the desirability of the welsh lands i have no doubt he will send the required aid i concur decided bernard bending once more to the parchment he finished the letter and signed his name then rolling the parchment quickly he tied the bundle and sealed it pressing his heavy gold ring into the soft puddle of brown wax dripped from the stick in remeys hands there he said setting the bundle aside now bring me that tray and fill my cup when youve done that go find ormand of course sire replied the chamberlain gesturing for the two kitchen servants to place the trays of food before the baron while he refilled the silver cup from a flagon i believe i saw young ormand in the hall only a short while ago good said bernard spearing one of the hardcrusted pies from the tray with his knife tell him to prepare to ride out at first light this letter must reach beauvais before the month is out the baron bit into the cold pie and chewed thoughtfully he ate a little more and then took another long draught of wine wiped his mouth with the back of his hand and said now then go find my wife and tell her i have returned i have already spoken to my ladys maidservant sire replied remey starting for the door i will inform ormand that you wish to see him baron neufmarche was left alone to eat his meal in peace as the food and wine soothed his agitated soul he began to look more favourably on the conquest to come perhaps he thought i have been overhasty perhaps in the heat of temper he had allowed his anger to cloud his perception he might have lost elfael true enough but buellt was the real prize and it would be his and beyond buellt lay the ripe fertile heartland of dyfed and ceredigion it was all good landwild for the most part and undevelopedjust waiting for a man with the boldness of vision determination and ambition to make it prosper and produce bernard de neufinarche baron of the shires of gloucester and hereford imagined himself just that man yes the more he thought about it the more he was certain he was right despite the kings outrageous behaviour things were working out for the best after all under the proper circumstances elfael that small and undistinguished commot in the centre of the welsh hill country could ensnare the rash invaders in difficulties for years to come in fact with the timely application of a few simple principles of subterfuge the baron could ensure that little elfael would become the grasping de braose familys downfall the baron was basking in the warmth of this selfcongratulatory humour when he heard the latch on his door rattle the soft cough with which his visitor announced herself indicated that his wife had joined him his momentary feeling of pleasure dimmed and faded you have returned earlier than expected my lord she said her voice falling soft and low in the quiet of the room bernard took his time answering setting aside his cup he turned his head and looked at her pale and wan she appeared even more wraithlike than when he had last seen her only a few days ago her eyes were large darkrimmed circles in the ashen skin of her thin face and her long lank hair hung straight making her seem all the more frail and delicate you are looking well my lady he lied smiling he rose stiffly and offered her his chair thank you my lord she replied but sit you are at meat i will not disturb you i only wished to acknowledge your return she bowed slightly from the waist and turned to leave agnes stay he said and noticed the tremor that coursed through her body i have had my dinner and was just about to go to prayers she informed her husband but very well i will sit with you awhile if that is what you wish bernard removed his chair and placed it at the side of the table only if it is no trouble he said far from it she insisted it is a very pleasure in itself he seated her and then pulled another chair to his place wine he asked lifting the flagon i think not thank you head erect shoulders level slender back straight as a lance shaft she perched lightly on the edge of her chairas if she feared it might suddenly take wing beneath her negligible weight if you change your mind the baron refilled his cup and resumed his seat his wife was suffering to be sure and that was real enough even so he could not help feeling that she brought it on herself with her perverse unwillingness to adapt in the slightest measure to the demands of her new home and its alltoooften inhospitable climate she refused to dress more warmly or eat more heartilyas conditions warranted thus she lurched from one vague illness to another enduring febrile distempers agues fluxes and other mysterious maladies all with the resigned patience of an expiring saint remey said you summoned ormand yes i am sending him to beauvais with a letter for the duke he replied swirling the wine in his cup the conquest of wales has begun and i will not be left out of it i am requesting troopsmenat arms and as many knights as he can spare a letter for your father she asked the light leaping up in her eyes for the first time since she had entered the room do not bother ormand with such a taski will take the letter for you no replied bernard the journey is too arduous for you it is out of the question nonsense she countered the journey would do me a world of goodthe sea air and warmer weather would be just the elixir to restore me i need you here said the baron there is going to be a campaign in the spring and there is much to make ready he raised the silver cup to his lips repeating it is out of the question i am sorry lady agnes sat in silence for a moment studying her hands in her lap this campaign is important to you i suppose she wondered important what a question woman of course it is of the highest importance a successful outcome will extend our holdings into the very heart of wales the baron said growing excited at the thought our estates will increase threefold fivefoldand our revenues likewise id call that important wouldnt you he sneered then agnes suggested lightly i would think it equally important to ensure that success by securing the necessary troops of course answered bernard irritably it goes without sayingwhich is why i wrote the letter his wife lifted her thin shoulders in a shrug of studied indifference as you say he let the matter rest there for a moment but something in her tone suggested she knew more than she had said why he asked his suspicion getting the better of him at last oh she said turning her eyes to the fire once more no reason come now my dear let us have it out you have a thought in this matter i can tell and i will hear it you flatter me im sure husband she replied i am content but i am not he said anger edging into his tone what is in your mind do not raise your voice to me sire she snapped i assure you it is not seemly very well he said his voice loud in the chamber he glared at her for a moment and then tried again but see here it is folly to quarrel consider that i am overtired from a long journeyit is that making me sharp nothing more therefore let us be done with this foolishness he coaxed her with a smile now tell me my dear what is in your mind since you ask she said it occurs to me that if the campaign is as gravely important as you contend then i would not entrust such an undertaking to a mere equerry why not ormand is entirely trustworthy that is as may be she allowed primly but if you really need the troops then why place so much weight on a mere letter in the hand of an insignificant menial and what would you do id send a suitable emissary instead an emissary yes she agreed and what better emissary than the sole and beloved daughterinlaw of the duke himself she paused allowing her words to take effect duke geoffrey can easily refuse a letter in ormands hand she concluded as you and i know only too well but refuse me never bernard considered this for a moment tapping the silver base of his cup with a finger what she suggested was not entirely without merit he could already see certain advantages if she went she might obtain not only troops but money as well and it was true that the old duke could never deny his daughterinlaw anything he might fume and fret for a few days but he would succumb to her wishes in the end very well decided the baron abruptly you shall go ormand will accompany youand your maidservants of coursebut you will bear the letter yourself and read it to the duke when you judge him in a favourable mood to grant our request lady agnes smiled and inclined her head in acquiescence to his desires as always my husband your counsel is impeccable chapter bran stirred his mount to speed iwan he cried at the sound of his name the kings champion raised himself in the saddle and bran saw blood oozing down the warriors padded leather tunic bran the warrior gasped bran thank god listen iwan what has happened where are the others we were attacked at wye ford he said ffreincthree hundred or more sixty maybe seventy knights the rest footmen lurching sideways he seized the young prince by the arm bran you must ride he began but his eyes rolled up into his head he slumped and toppled from the saddle bran holding tight to his arm tried to lower his longtime friend more gently to the ground iwan landed hard nonetheless and sprawled between the horses bran slid off the mare and eased the wounded man onto his back iwan iwan he said trying to rouse him my father the warbandwhere are the others dead moaned iwan all all of them dead bran quickly retrieved a waterskin from its place behind his saddle here he said holding the skin to the warriors mouth drink a little it will restore you the battlechief sucked down a long thirsty draught and then shoved the skin away you must raise the alarm he said some vigour returning to his voice he clutched at bran and held him fast you must ride and warn the people warn everyone the king is dead and the ffreinc are coming how much time do we have asked bran enough pray god said the battlechief less if you stay go now bran hesitated unable to decide what should be done now iwan said pushing the prince away there is but time to hide the women and children we will go together i will help you go snarled iwan leave me not like this ignoring the wounded mans curses bran helped him to his feet and back into the saddle then taking up the reins of iwans horse he led them both back the way he had come owing to the battlechiefs wound they travelled more slowly than bran would have wished eventually reaching the western edge of the forest where he paused to allow the horses and wounded man to rest is there much pain he asked not so much iwan said pressing a hand to his chest ah a little well wait here awhile bran dismounted walked a few paces ahead and crouched beside the road scanning the valley for any sign of the enemy invaders the broad undulating lowlands of elfael spread before him shimmering gently in the blue haze of an early autumn day secluded green fertile a region of gentle wooded hills seamed through with clearrunning streams and brooks it lay pleasantly between the high bare stone crags of mountains to the north and east and the high moorland wastes to the south not the largest cantref beyond the marches in brans estimation it tendered in charm what it lacked in size in the near distance the kings fortress on its high mound whitewashed walls gleaming in the sunlight stood sentinel at the gateway to elfael which seemed to drowse in the heavy honeyed light so quiet so peacefulthe likelihood of anything disturbing such a deep and luxurious serenity seemed impossibly remote a mere cloud shadow passing over a sunbright meadow a little dimming of the light before the sun blazed forth again caer cadarn had been his familys home for eight generations and he had never imagined anything could ever change that bran satisfied himself that all was calmat least for the momentthen returned to his mount and swung into the saddle once more see anything asked iwan holloweyed his face was pale and dripping with sweat no ffreinc bran replied yet they started down into the valley at a trot bran did not stop at the hill fort but rode straight to llanelli the tiny monastery that occupied the heel of the valley and stood halfway between the fortress and glascwm the chief town of the neighbouring cantrefand the only settlement of any size in the entire region although merely an outpost of the larger abbey of saint dyfrig at glascwm the llanelli monastery served the people of elfael well the monks bran had decided not only would know best how to raise an alarm to warn the people but also would be able to help iwan the gates of the monastery were open so they rode through and halted in the bareearth yard outside the little timber and muddaubed church brother ffreol brother ffreol bran shouted he leapt from the saddle and ran to the door of the church a lone priest was kneeling before the altar an elderly man he turned as bran burst in upon his prayers lord bran said the old man rising shakily to his feet god be good to you where is brother ffreol i am sure i cannot say replied the aging monk he might be anywhere why all this shouting without reply bran seized the bell rope the bell pealed wildly in response to his frantic pulling and soon monks were hurrying to the church from every direction first through the door was brother cefan a local lad only slightly older than bran himself lord bran what is wrong where is ffreol demanded bran still tugging on the bell rope i need him he was in the scriptorium a short while ago replied the youth i dont know where he is now find him ordered bran hurry the young brother darted back through the door colliding with bishop asaph a dour humourless drone of advancing age and as bran had always considered middling ability you there he shouted striding into the church stop that you hear release that rope at once bran dropped the rope and spun around oh its you bran said the bishop his features arranging themselves in a frown of weary disapproval i might have guessed what pray is the meaning of this spirited summons no time to waste bishop said bran rushing up he snatched the churchman by the sleeve of his robe and pulled him out of the church and into the yard where twenty or so of the monasterys inhabitants were quickly gathering calm yourself said bishop asaph shaking himself free of brans grasp were all here so explain this commotion if you can the ffreinc are coming said bran three hundred marchogi they are on their way here now pointing to the battlechief sitting slumped in the saddle he said iwan fought them and hes wounded he needs help at once marchogi gasped the gathered monks glancing fearfully at one another but why tell us wondered the bishop your father should be the one to the king is dead bran said they murdered himand the rest of the warband with him everyone is dead we have no protection i do not understand sputtered the bishop what do you mean everyone fear snaked through the gathered monks the warband dead we are lost brother ffreol appeared pushing his way through the crowd bran i saw you ride in there is trouble what has happened the ffreinc are coming he said turning to meet the priest and pull him close three hundred marchogi theyre on their way to elfael now will rhi brychan fight them he already did said bran there was a battle on the road my father and his men have been killed iwan alone escaped to warn us he is injuredhere he said moving to the wounded champion help me get him down together with a few of the other brothers they eased the warrior down from his horse and laid him on the ground while brother galen the monastery physician began examining the wounds bran said we must raise the alarm there is still time for everyone to flee leave that with me i will see to it replied ffreol you must ride to caer cadarn and gather everything you care to save go nowand may god go with you wait a moment said the bishop raising his hand to stop them from hurrying off turning to bran he said why would the ffreinc come here your father has arranged to swear a treaty of peace with william the red and he was on his way to do just that snapped bran growing angry at the perfunctory insinuation that he was lying am i the red kings counsellor now that i should be privy to a ffreinc rogues thoughts he glared at the suspicious bishop calm yourself my son said asaph stiffly there is no need to mock i was only asking they will arrive in force bran said climbing into the saddle once more i will save what i can from the caer and return here for iwan and then wondered asaph we will flee while there is still time the bishop shook his head no bran you must ride to lundein instead you must finish what your father intended no replied bran it is impossible i cannot go to lundein and even if i did the king would never listen to me the king will listen the bishop insisted william is not unreasonable you must talk to him you must tell him what has happened and seek redress red william will not see me bran said brother ffreol he came to stand at the young mans stirrup and placed his hand on his leg as if to restrain him bishop asaph is right you will be king now william will certainly see you and when he does you must swear the treaty your father meant to undertake bran opened his mouth to object but bishop asaph stopped him saying a grave mistake has been made and the king must provide remedy you must obtain justice for your people mistake cried bran my father has been killed and his warband slaughtered not by william the bishop pointed out when the king hears what has happened he will punish the man who did this and make reparations bran rejected the advice out of hand the course they urged was childish and dangerous before he could begin to explain the utter folly of their plan asaph turned to the brothers who stood looking on and commanded them to take the alarm to the countryside and town the people are not to oppose the ffreinc by force instructed the bishop sternly this is a holy decree tell them enough blood has been shed alreadyand that needlessly we must not give the enemy cause to attack god willing this occupation will be brief but until it ends we will all endure it as best we can the bishop sent his messengers away saying go now and with all speed tell everyone you meet to spread the wordeach to his neighbour no one is to be overlooked the monks hurried off deserting the monastery on the run bran watched them go grave misgivings mounting by the moment now then said bishop asaph turning once more to bran you must reach lundein as quickly as possible the sooner this error can be remedied the less damage will result and the better for everyone you must leave at once this is madness bran told him well all be killed it is the only way ffreol asserted you must do it for the sake of elfael and the throne bran stared incredulously at the two churchmen every instinct told him to run to fly i will go with you offered ffreol whatever i can do to aid you in this trust it will be done good said the bishop satisfied with this arrangement now go both of you and may god lend you his own wisdom and the swiftness of very angels chapter acing up the ramp bran flew through the gates of caer cadarn he leapt from the saddle shouting before his feet touched the ground the disagreeable maelgwnt drifted into the yard what now he asked foundered another horse two in one daywhat will your father say i wonder my father is dead bran said his tone lashing and all who rode with him save iwan the stewards eyes narrowed as he tried to work out the likelihood of brans wild assertion if that is a jest it is a poor oneeven for you it is gods own truth bran snarled clutching the startled man by the arm he turned him around and marched swiftly toward the kings hall they were attacked by a ffreinc warhost that is on its way here now he explained they will come here first take the strongbox and silver to the monasterythe servants too leave no one behind the marchogi will take the fortress and everything in it for their own what about the livestock asked maelgwnt to the monastery replied bran dashing for the door use your head man anything worth savingtake it to llanelli the monks will keep it safe for us he ran through the hall to the armoury beyond a square thickwalled room with long slits for windows as he expected the best weapons were gone the warband had taken all but a few rusty bentbladed swords and some wellworn spears he selected the most serviceable of these and then turned to the rack of longbows hanging on the far wall for some reasonprobably for decorums sake in lundeinhis father had left all the warbows behind he picked one up tried it and slung it over his shoulder he tucked a redrusted sword into his belt grabbed up a sheaf of arrows and several of the least blunt spears and then raced to the stables dumping the weapons on the floor bran commanded cefn to saddle another of the mares when youre finished bring it to the yard brother ffreol is on his way here by foot i want to leave the moment he arrives cefn wan and distraught made no move to obey is it true the massacre bran asked yes its true ffreol and i ride now to lundein to see the red king swear allegiance and secure the return of our lands as soon as i leave run and find maelgwntdo everything he says were moving everything to the monastery never fear you will be safe there understand cefn nodded good hurry now there is not much time bran returned to the kitchen to find the old cook comforting her young helpers they were huddled beneath her ample arms like chicks beneath the wings of a hen and she held them patting their shoulders and stroking their heads mairead i need provisions bran said striding quickly into the room brother ffreol and i are riding to lundein at once bran oh bran wailed the woman rhi brychan is dead he is bran replied pulling the two whimpering girls from her grasp and all who rode with him gone he confirmed and we will mourn them properly when we have rid ourselves of these scabby ffreinc thieves but you must listen to me now as soon as i am gone maelgwnt will take everyone to llanelli stay there until i return the ffreinc will not harm you if you remain at the monastery with the monks do you hear me the woman nodded her eyes filled with unshed tears bran turned her and pushed her gently away off with you now hurry and bring the food to the yard next bran dashed to his fathers chamber and to the small wooden casket where the king kept his ready money the real treasure was kept in the strongbox that maelgwnt would see hidden at the monasterytwo hundred marks in english silver the smaller casket contained but a few marks used for buying at the market paying for favours bestowing largesse on the tenants and other occasional uses there were four bags of coins in all more than enough to see them safely to lundein and back bran scooped up the little leather bags stuffed them into his shirt then ran back out to the yard where brother ffreol was just coming through the gate leading iwan on horseback behind him iwan what are you doing here bran asked running to meet them you should stay at the monastery where they can tend you save your breath advised ffreol ive already tried to dissuade him but he refuses to heed a word i say i am going with you the battlechief declared flatly that is the end of it you are wounded bran pointed out needlessly not so badly that i cannot sit in a saddle answered the big man i want to see the look in the red kings eye when we stand before him and demand justice and he added if a witness to this outrage is required then you will have one bran opened his mouth to object once more but ffreol said let him be if he feels that way about it nothing we say will discourage him and stubborn as he is hed only follow us anyway glancing toward the stable bran muttered what is keeping cefn he shouted for the groom to hurry when that brought no response he started for the stable to see what was taking so long brother ffreol held him back saying calm yourself bran youve been running all day rest when you can we will be on our way soon enough not soon enough for me he cried racing off to the stable to help cefn finish saddling the horses they were leading two mares into the yard when mairead appeared with her two kitchen helpers each carrying a cloth sack bulging with provisions while the priest blessed the women and prayed over them bran and cefn arranged the tuck bags behind the saddles and strapped them down secreting the money in the folds come ffreol bran said taking the reins from the groom and mounting the saddle if they catch us here all is lost and may the lord make his face to shine upon you and give you his peace through all things whatsoever may befall you intoned the priest bestowing a kiss on the bowed head of each woman in turn amen now off with you help maelgwnt and then all of you hie to llanelli as soon as you can the sun was already low in the west by the time the three riders crossed the stream and started up the long rising slope toward the edge of the forest their shadows stretched long on the road going before them like spindly misshapen ghosts they rode in silence until entering the shady margin of the trees coed cadw the guarding wood was a dense tangle of ancient trees oak elm lime planeall the titans of the wood growing amongst and beneath these giants were younger smaller trees and thickets of hazel and beech the road itself was lined with blackberry brambles that formed a hedge wall along either side so thick and lush that three paces off the road in any direction and a person could no longer be seen from the path is it wise do you think asked the priest to keep to the road the marchogi are certain to be on it too i do not doubt it replied bran but going any other way would take far too long if we keep our wits about us we will hear them long before they hear us and we can easily get off the road and out of sight iwan his face tight with pain said nothing brother ffreol accepted brans assurances and they rode on do you think we should have seen the ffreinc by now asked the monk after a while if they had been in a hurry to reach elfael we would certainly have met them they probably stopped to make camp for the night god be praised you praise god for that i do admitted the monk it means the cymry have at least one night to hide their valuables and get to safety one night mocked bran as much as all that wars have turned on less the priest pointed out if the conquerors arrow had flown but a fingers breadth to the right of harolds eye the ffreinc would not be here now yes well it seems to me that if god really wanted praising hed have prevented the filthy ffreinc and their foul marchogi from coming here in the first place do you have the mind of god now that you know all things good and ill for each and every one of his creatures it does not take the mind of god replied bran carelessly to know that anytime a norman stands at your gate it is for ill and never good that is a doctrine more worthy than any bishop asaph ever professed jesu forgive you sighed the priest such irreverence irreverent or not it is true they fell silent and rode on as the sun sank lower the shadows on the trail gathered deepening beneath the trees and brushwood the sounds became hushed and furtive as the forest drew in upon itself for the night the road began to rise more steeply toward the spine of the ridge and bran slowed the pace in a little while the gloom had spread so that the gap between trees was as dark as the black boles themselves and the road shone as a ghostpale ribbon stretching dimly away into the deepening night i think we should stop suggested brother ffreol it will soon be too dark to see we could rest and eat something also i want to tend iwans wound bran was of a mind to ride all night but one look at the wounded warrior argued otherwise so he gave in and allowed the monk to have his way they picketed the horses and made camp at the base of an oak just out of sight of the road ate a few mouthfuls of bread and a little hard cheese and then settled down to sleep beneath the trees protecting limbs wrapped in his cloak bran slept uneasily rising again as it became light enough to tell tree from shadow he roused ffreol and then went to iwan who came awake at his touch how do you feel he asked kneeling beside the champion never better iwan said as he tried to sit up the pain hit him hard and slammed him back once more he grimaced and blew air through his mouth panting like a winded hound perhaps i will try that again he said through clenched teeth more slowly this time wait a moment said ffreol putting out his hand let me see your binding he pulled open the big mans shirt and looked at the bandage wrapped around his upper chest it is clean still there is little blood he announced greatly reassured then it is time we made a start when we have prayed said the monk oh very well sighed bran just get on with it the priest gathered his robe around him and folding his hands he closed his eyes and began to pray for the speedy and sure success of their mission bran followed the sound of his voice more than the words and imagined that he heard a low rhythmic drumming marking out the cadence he listened for a while before realising that he was not imagining the sound quiet he hissed someones coming ffreol helped iwan to his feet and the two disappeared into the underbrush bran darted to the horses and threw his cloak over their heads to keep them quiet then stood and held the cloak in place so the animals would not shake it off brother ffreol flat on the ground watched the narrow slice of road that he could see from beneath his bush ffreinc he whispered a few moments later scores of them he paused then added hundreds bran holding the horses heads heard the creak and rattle of wagon wheels followed by the dull hollow clop of hundreds of hooves and the tramp of leathershod feet a pulsing beat that seemed to go on and on and on at long last the sound gradually faded and the birdfretted silence of the forest returned i believe they have gone said ffreol softly he rose and brushed off his robe bran stood listening for a moment longer and when no one else appeared on the road he uncovered the horses heads working quickly and quietly he saddled the horses and then led the animals through the forest within sight of the road when after walking a fair distance no more marchogi appeared he allowed them to leave the forest path and return to the road the three travellers took to the saddle once more and bolted for lundein chapter by midmorning bran iwan and brother ffreol had begun the long sloping ascent of the ridge overlooking the vale of wye upon reaching the top they paused and looked down into the broad valley and the glittering sweep of the lazy green river in the distance they could see the dark flecks of birds circling and swooping in the cloudless sky bran saw them and his stomach tightened with apprehension as the men approached the river ford the strident calls of carrion feeders filled the airravens rooks and crows for the most part but there were others hawks buzzards and even an owl or two wheeled in tight circles above the trees bran stopped at the waters edge the soft ground of the riverbank was raggedly churned and chewed as if a herd of giant boar had undertaken to plough the water marge with their tusks there were no corpses to be seen but here and there flies buzzed in thick black clouds over congealing puddles where blood had collected in a horses hoofprint the air was heavy and rank with the sickly sweet stench of death bran dismounted and walked back toward the road where most of the fighting had taken place he looked down and saw that in the place where he stood the earth took on a deeper ruddy hue where a warriors lifeblood had stained the ground on which he died this is where it happened mused brother ffreol with quiet reverence this is where the warriors of elfael were overthrown aye confirmed iwan his face grim and grey with fatigue and pain this is where we were ambushed and massacred he lifted his hand and pointed to the wide bend of the river rhi brychan fell there he said by the time i reached him his body had been washed away bran mouth pressed into a thin white line stared at the water and said nothing once he might have felt a twinge of regret at his fathers passing but not now years of accumulated grievances had long ago removed his father from his affections sorrow alone could not surmount the rancour and bitterness nor span the aching distance between them he whispered a cold farewell and turned once more to the battleground images of chaos sprang into his minda desperate battle between woefully outnumbered and lightly armed britons and heavy hulking mailclad ffreinc knights he saw the blood haze hang like a mist in the air above the slaughter and heard the echoed clash of steel on steel of blade on wood and bone the fastfading shouts and screams of men and horses as they died looking toward the wood to the north he saw the birds flocking to their feeding frenzy squawking shrieking they fought and fluttered battering wings against one another in their greed grabbing up stones from the riverbank he ran to the place throwing rocks into the midst of the feathered scavengers as he ran reluctant to leave the mound on which they fed the scolding birds fluttered up and settled again as the angry stones sailed past stooping once more he took up another handful of rocks and screaming at the top of his lungs let fly one of the missiles struck a greedy redbeaked crow and snapped its neck the wounded bird flopped beating its wings in a last frantic effort to rise bran threw again and the bird lay still the hillock was covered with brush and branches cut from the thickets and trees along the riverbank pulling a stick from the pile bran began beating at the flesh eaters they hopped and dodged reluctant to give ground bran screaming like a demon lashed with the branch driving the scavengers away they fled with angry reluctance crying their outrage to the sky as bran pulled brushwood from the stack to lay bare a massed heap of corpses the stick in his hand fell away and bran staggered backward overwhelmed by the calamity that had taken the lives of his kinsmen and friends the birds had feasted well there were gaping hollows where eyes had been flesh had been stripped from faces ragged holes had been wrested in rib cages to expose the soft viscera human no longer they were merely so much rotting meat no these were men he knew they were friends riding companions fellow hunters drinking matessome of them from times before he could remember they had taught him trail craft had given him his first lessons with blunted wooden weapons made for him with their own hands they had picked him up when he fell from his horse corrected his aim when he practised with the bow and along the way taught him much of what he knew of life to see them now with their empty eyes and livid blackening faces their ruined bodies beginning to bloat was more than he could bear as he gazed in mute horror at the confused tangle of slashed and bloodied limbs and torsos something deep inside himself gave wayas if a ligament or sinew suddenly snapped under the strain of a load too heavy to bear his soul spun into a void of bloodred rage his vision narrowed and it seemed as if his surroundings had taken on a keener harder edge but were now viewed from a long way off it seemed to bran that he gazed at the world through a redtinged tunnel there was another hill nearbyalso crudely covered with brush and loppedoff tree branches bran ran to it uncovered it and without realising what he was doing climbed up onto the tangled jumble of bodies he sank to his knees and grasped the arms of the corpses with his hands tugging on them as if urging their sleeping owners to wake again and rise get up he shouted open your eyes he saw a face he recognised seizing the corpses arm he jerked on it crying evan wake up he saw another geronwy the ffreinc are here he began calling the names of those he remembered bryn ifan oryg gerallt idris madog get up all of you bran brother ffreol shocked and alarmed ran to pull him away bran for the love of god come down from there stumbling up over the dead the monk reached out and snagged bran by the sleeve and hauled him down dragging the prince back to solid ground and back to himself once more bran heard ffreols voice and felt the monks hands on him and awareness came flooding back the bloodtinged veil through which he viewed the world dimmed and faded and he was himself once more he felt weak and hollow like a man who has slaved all night in his sleep and awakened exhausted what were you doing up there demanded brother ffreol bran shook his head i thought i suddenly his stomach heaved he pitched forward on hands and knees and retched ffreol stood with him until he finished when bran could stand again the priest turned to the death mound and sank to his knees in the soft earth bran knelt beside him and iwan painfully dismounted and knelt beside his horse as brother ffreol spread his arms palms upward in abject supplication closing his eyes and turning his face to heaven the priest said merciful father our hearts are pierced with the sharp arrow of grief our words fail our souls quail our spirits recoil before the injustice of this hateful iniquity we are undone god and creator gather the souls of our kinsmen to your great hall forgive their sins and remember only their virtues and bind them to yourself with the strong bands of fellowship for ourselves mighty father i pray you keep us from the sin of hatred keep us from the sin of vengeance keep us from the sin of despair but protect us from the wicked schemes of our enemies walk with us now on this uncertain road send angels to go before us angels to go behind angels on either side angels above and belowguarding shielding encompassing he paused for a moment and then added may the holy one give us the courage of righteousness and grant us strength for this day and through all things whatsoever shall befall us amen bran kneeling beside him stared at the ground and tried to add his amen but the word clotted and died in his throat after a moment he raised his head and gazed for the last time on the heap of corpses before turning his face away then while bran bathed in the river to wash the stink of death and gore from his hands and clothes ffreol and iwan covered the bodies once more with freshcut branches of hazel and holly the better to keep the birds away bran finished and the three griefsick men remounted and rode on as the cacophony of carrion feeders renewed behind them just after midday they crossed the border into england and a short while later approached the english town of hereford the town was full of ffreinc now so they moved on quickly without stopping from hereford the road was wide and well used if deeply rutted they encountered few people and spoke to none pretending to be deep in conversation with one another whenever they saw anyone approaching all the while remaining watchful and wary beyond hereford the land sloped gently down toward the lowlands and the wide lundein estuary still some way beyond the distant horizon of rumpled cultivated hills as daylight began to fail they took refuge in a beech grove beside the road near the next ford while bran watered the horses ffreol prepared a meal from the provisions in their tuck bags they ate in silence and bran listened to the rooks flocking to the woods for the night the sound of their coarse calls renewed the horror of the day he saw the broken bodies of his friends once more with an effort he concentrated on the fire holding the hateful images at bay it will take time ffreol said the sound of his voice a distant buzz in brans ears but the memory will fade believe me at the sound of his voice bran struggled back from the brink the memory of this black day will fade ffreol was saying as he broke twigs and fed them to the fire it will vanish like a bad taste in your mouth one day it will be gone and you will be left with only the sweetness there was little sweetness sniffed bran my father the king was not an easy man i was talking about the othersyour friends in the warband bran acknowledged the remark with a grunt but you are right ffreol continued he snapped another twig brychan was not an easy man god be praised you have the chance to do something about that you can be a better king than your father no bran picked up the dried husk of a beechnut and tossed it into the fire as if consigning his own fragile future to the flames he cared little enough for the throne and all its attendant difficulties what difference did it make who was king anyway thats over now finished you will be king declared iwan stirring himself from his bleak reverie the kingdom will be restored never doubt it but bran did doubt it for most of his life he had maintained a keen disinterest in all things having to do with kingship he had never imagined himself occupying his fathers throne at caer cadarn or leading a host of men into battle those things like the other chores of nobility were the sole occupation of his father bran always had other pursuits so far as bran could tell to reign was merely to invite a perpetual round of frustration and aggravation that lasted from the moment one took the crown until it was laid aside only a powercrazed thug like his father would solicit such travail any way he looked at it sovreignty exacted a heavy price which bran had seen firsthand and which now that it came to it he found himself unwilling to pay you will be king iwan asserted again on my life you will bran reluctant to disappoint the injured champion with a facile denial held his tongue the three were silent again for a time watching the flames and listening to the sounds of the wood around them as its various denizens prepared for night finally bran asked what if they will not see us in lundein oh william the red will see us make no mistake iwan raised his head and regarded bran over the fluttering fire you are a subject lord come to swear fealty he will see you and be glad of it he will welcome you as one king welcomes another i am not the king bran pointed out you are heir to the throne replied the champion it is the same thing ffreol said when we return to elfael we will observe the proper rites and ceremonies but this will be the first duty of your reignto place elfael under the protection of the english throne and and all of us become bootlicking slaves of the stinking ffreinc bran said his tone bitter and biting what is the stupid bloody point we keep our land iwan retorted we keep our lives if god and king william allow sneered bran nay bran said ffreol we will pay tribute yes and count it a price worth paying to live our lives as we choose pay tribute to the very brutes that would plunder us if we didnt growled bran that stinks to high heaven does it stink worse than death asked iwan bran shamed by the taunt merely glared it is unjust granted ffreol trying to soothe but that is ever the way of things did you think it would be different asked iwan angrily saints and angels bran it was never going to be easy it could at least be fair muttered bran fair or not you must do all you can to protect our lands and the lives of our people ffreol told him to protect those least able to protect themselves that much at least has not changed that was ever the sole purpose and duty of kingship since the beginning of time it has not changed bran accepted this observation without further comment he stared gloomily into the fire wishing he had followed his first impulse to leave elfael and all its troubles as far behind as possible after a time iwan asked about lundein ffreol had been to the city several times on church business in years past and he described for bran and iwan what they might expect to find when they arrived as he talked night deepened around them and they continued to feed the fire until they grew too tired to keep their eyes open they then wrapped themselves in their cloaks and fell asleep in the quiet grove rising again at dawn the travellers shook the leaves and dew from their cloaks watered the horses and continued on the day passed much like the one before except that the settlements became more numerous and the english presence in the land became more marked until bran was convinced that they had left britain far behind and entered an alien country where the houses were small and dark and crabbed where grimfaced people dressed in curious garb made up of coarse duncoloured cloth stood and stared at passing travellers with suspicion in their dull peasant eyes despite the sunlight streaming down from a clear blue sky the land seemed dismal and unhappy even the animals in their woven willow enclosures appeared bedraggled and morose nor was the aspect to improve the farther south they went the more abject the countryside appeared settlements of all kinds became more numeroushow the english loved their villagesbut these were not wholesome places clustered together in what bran considered suffocating proximity anywhere the earth offered a flat space and a little running water the closeset hovels sprouted like noxious mushrooms on earth stripped of all trees and greenerywhich the muddwellers used to make humpbacked houses barns and byres for their livestock which they kept in muckfilled pens beside their low smoky dwellings thus a traveller could always smell an english town long before he reached it and bran could only shake his head in wonder at the thought of abiding in perpetual fug and stench in his opinion the people lived no better than the pigs they slopped slaughtered and fed upon as the sun began to lower the three riders crested the top of a broad hill and looked down into the vale of hafren and the gleaming arc of the hafren river a smudgy brown haze in the valley betrayed their destination for the night the town of gleawancaester which began life in ancient times as a simple outpost of the roman legio augusta xx owing to its pride of place by the river and the proximity of iron mines the town begun by legionary veterans had grown slowly over the centuries until the arrival of the english who transformed it into a market centre for the region the road into the vale widened as it neared the city which to brans eyes was worse than any he had seen so farif only because it was larger than any other they had yet passed squatting hard by the river with twisting narrow streets of crowded hovels clustered around a huge central market square of beaten earth gleawancaestercaer gloiu of the britonshad long ago outgrown the stout stone walls of the roman garrison which could still be seen in the lower courses of the citys recently refurbished fortress like the towns other defencesa wall and gate still unfinisheda new bridge of timber and stone bore testimony to ffreinc occupation norman bridges were wide and strong built to withstand heavy traffic and ensure that the steady stream of horses cattle and merchant wagons flowed unimpeded into and out of the markets bran noticed the increase in activity as they approached the bridge here and there tall cleanshaven ffreinc moved amongst the shorter swarthier english residents the sight of these horsefaced foreigners with their long straightcut hair and pale sunstarved flesh walking about with such toplofty arrogance made the gorge rise in his throat he forcibly turned his face away to keep from being sick before crossing the bridge they dismounted to stretch their legs and water the horses at a wooden trough set up next to a riverside well as they were waiting bran noticed two barefoot ragged little girls walking together carrying a basket of eggs between themno doubt bound for the market they fell in with the traffic moving across the bridge two men in short cloaks and tunics loitered at the rail and as the girls passed by one of the men grinning at his companion stuck out his foot tripping the nearest girl she fell sprawling onto the bridge planks the basket overturned spilling the eggs bran watching this confrontation develop immediately started toward the child when as the second girl bent to retrieve the basket the man kicked it from her grasp scattering eggs every which way bran was already on the bridge iwan glancing up from the trough took in the girls bran and the two thugs and shouted for bran to come back where is he going wondered ffreol looking around to make trouble muttered iwan the two little girls tearful now tried in vain to gather up the few unbroken eggs only to have them kicked from their hands or trodden on by passersbymuch to the delight of the louts on the bridge the toughs were so intent on their merriment that they failed to notice the slender welshman bearing down on them until bran lurching forward as if slipping on a broken egg stumbled up to the man who had tripped the girl the fellow made to shove bran away whereupon bran seized his arm spun him around and pushed him over the rail his surprised yelp was cut short as the duncoloured water closed over his head oops said bran how clumsy of me mon dieu objected the other backing away bran turned on him and drew him close what is that you say he asked you wish to join him bran leave him alone shouted ffreol as he pulled bran off the man he cant understand you let him go the oaf spared a quick glance at his friend sputtering and floundering in the river below then fled down the street i think he understood well enough observed bran come away said ffreol not yet said bran taking the purse at his belt he untied it and withdrew two silver pennies turning to the older of the two girls he wiped the remains of an eggshell from her cheek give those to your mother he said pressing the coins into the girls grubby fist closing her hand upon the coins he repeated for your mother brother ffreol picked up the empty basket and handed it to the younger girl he spoke a quick word in english and the two scampered away now unless you have any other battles you wish to fight in front of god and everybody he said taking bran by the arm let us get out of here before you draw a crowd well done said iwan his grin wide and sunny as bran and ffreol returned to the trough we are strangers here ffreol remonstrated what in the holy name of peter were you thinking only that heads can be as easily broken as eggs bran replied and that justice ought sometimes to protect those least able to protect themselves he glowered dark defiance at the priest or has that changed ffreol drew breath to object but thought better of it turning away abruptly he announced we have ridden far enough for one day we will spend the night here we will not objected iwan curling his lip in a sneer id rather sleep in a sty than stay in this stinking place it is crawling with vermin there is an abbey here and we will be welcome the priest pointed out an abbey filled with ffreinc no doubt bran grumbled you can stay there if you want ill not set foot in the place i agree said iwan his voice dulled with pain he sat on the edge of the trough hunched over his wound as if protecting it the monk fell silent and they mounted their horses and continued on they crossed the bridge and passed through the untidy sprawl of muddy streets and lowroofed hovels smoke from cooking fires filled the streets and all the people bran saw were either hurrying home with a bundle of firewood on their backs or carrying food to be prepareda freshly killed chicken to be roasted a scrap of bacon a few leeks a turnip or two seeing the food reminded bran that he had eaten very little in the last few days and his hunger came upon him with the force of a kick he scented the aroma of roasting meat on the evening air and his mouth began to water he was on the point of suggesting to brother ffreol that they should return to the centre of town and see if there might be an inn near the market square when the monk suddenly announced i know just the place he urged his horse to a trot and proceeded toward the old south gate this way the priest led his reluctant companions out through the gate and up the curving road as it ascended the steep riverbank shortly they came to a stand of trees growing atop the bluff above the river overlooking the town here it isjust as i remembered bran took one look at an odd eightsided timber structure with a high steeply pitched roof and a low door with a curiously curved lintel and said a barn youve brought us to a barn not a barn the monk assured him sliding from the saddle it is an old cell a priests cell bran said regarding the edifice doubtfully there was no cross atop the structure no window no outward markings of any kind to indicate its function are you sure the blessed saint ennion once lived here ffreol explained moving toward the door a long time ago bran shrugged who lives here now a friend taking hold of a braided cord that passed through one doorpost the monk gave the cord a strong tug a bell sounded from somewhere inside ffreol smiling in anticipation of a glad welcome pulled the cord again and said youll see chapter ffreol waited a moment and when no one answered he gave the braided cord a more determined pull the bell sounded once morea clean clear peal in the soft evening air bran looked around taking in the old oratory and its surroundings the cell stood at the head of a small grove of beech trees the ground was covered with thick grass through which an earthen pathway led down the hillside into the town in an earlier time it occupied the grove as a woodland shrine overlooking the river now it surveyed the squalid prospect of a busy market town with its herds and carts and the slowmoving boats bearing iron ore to be loaded onto ships waiting at the larger docks downriver when a third pull on the bell rope brought no response ffreol turned and scratched his head he must be away can we not just let ourselves in asked bran perhaps allowed ffreol putting his hand to the leather strap that served for a latch he pulled and the door opened inward he pushed it farther and stuck in his head pax vobiscum he shouted and waited for an answer there is no one here we will wait inside iwan wincing with pain was helped to dismount and taken inside to rest bran gathered up the reins of the horses and led them into the grove behind the cell the animals were quickly unsaddled and tethered beneath the trees so they could graze he found a leather bucket and hauled water from a stoup beside the cell when he had finished watering the horses and settled them for the night he joined the others in the oratory by this time ffreol had a small fire going in the hearth that occupied one corner of the single large room it was bran thought an odd dwellinghalf house half church there was a sleeping place and a stonelined hearth but also an altar with a large wooden cross and a single wax candle a solitary narrow window opened in the wall high above the altar and a chain of sausages hung from an iron hook beside the hearth directly above a low threelegged stool next to the stool was a pair of leather shoes with thick wooden solesthe kind worn by those who work the mines crumbs of bread freckled both the altar and the hearthstones and the smell of boiled onions mingled with incense ffreol approached the altar knelt and said a prayer of blessing for the keeper of the cell i hope nothing has happened to old faganus he said when he finished saints and sinners are we all said a gruff voice from the open doorway old faganus is long dead and buried startled bran turned quickly his hand reaching for his knife a quick lash of a stout oak staff caught him on the arm easy son advised the owner of the staff i will behave if you will into the cell stepped a very short very fat man the crown of his head came only to brans armpit and his bulk filled the doorway in which he stood dressed in the threadbare brown robes of a mendicant priest he balanced his generous girth on two absurdly thin bandy legs his shoulders sloped and his back was slightly bent giving him a stooped almost dwarfish appearance however his thickmuscled arms and chest looked as if he could crush ale casks in his brawny embrace he carried a slender staff of unworked oak in one hand and held a brace of hares by a leather strap with the other his tonsure was outgrown and in need of reshaving his bare feet were filthy and caked with river mud some of which had found its way to his full fleshy jowls he regarded his three intruders with bold and unflinching dark eyes as ready to wallop them as welcome them god be good to you said ffreol from the altar are you priest here now who might you be demanded the rotund cleric he was one of the order of begging brothers which the ffreinc called freres and the english called friars they were all but unknown amongst the cymry we might be the king of england and his barons replied iwan rising painfully my friend asked you a question quick as a flick of a whip the oak staff swung out catching iwan on the meaty part of the shoulder he started forward but the priest thumped him with the knob end of the staff in the centre of the chest the champion crumpled as if struck by lightning he fell to his knees gasping for breath it was only a wee tap was it not the priest said in amazement turning wide eyes to bran and ffreol i swear on sweet marys wedding veil it was only a tap he was wounded in a battle several days ago bran said kneeling beside the injured warrior he helped raise him to his feet oh my soul i didnt mean to hurt the big un he sighed to ffreol he said aye i am priest here now who are you i am brother ffreol of llanelli in elfael never heard of it declared the brownrobed priest it is in cymru bran offered in a snide tone which you sons of saecsens call wales careful boy snipped the priest come over highhanded with me and ill give you a thump to remind you of your manners dont think i wont go on then bran taunted thrusting forward ill have that stick of yours so far up your peace cried ffreol rushing forward to place himself between bran and the brown priest we mean no harm pray forgive my quicktempered friends we have suffered a grave calamity in the last days and i fear it has clouded our better judgement this last was said with a glare of disapproval at bran and iwan please forgive us very well since you ask the priest granted with a sudden smile i forgive you laying his staff aside he said so now we know whence you came but we still lack names for you all do they have proper names in elfael or are they in such short supply that you must hoard them and keep them to yourselves allow me to present bran ap brychan prince and heir of elfael said ffreol drawing himself upright and this is iwan ap iestyn champion and battlechief hail and welcome friends replied the little friar raising his hands in declamation the blessings of a warm hearth beneath a dry roof are yours tonight may it be so always now it was brans turn to be amazed how is it that you speak cymry the brown priest gave him a wink and here was i thinking you hotheaded sons of the valleys were as stupid as stumps he chuckled and shook his head it took you long enough indeed sire i speak the tongue of the blessed but youre english bran pointed out aye english as the sky is blue said the friar but i was carried off as a boy to powys was i not i was put to work in a copper mine up there and slaved away until i was old enough and bold enough to escape almost froze to death i did for it was a full harsh winter but the brothers at llandewi took me in did they not and that is where i found my vocation and took my vows he smiled a winsome toothy grin and bowed his round belly almost touching his knees i am brother aethelfrith he declared proudly thirty years in gods service to iwan he said im sorry if i smacked you too hard no harm done brother eathel aelith iwan stuttered trying to get his british tongue around the saxon name aethelfrith the priest repeated it means nobility and peace or some such nonsense he grinned at his guests here now what have you brought me brought you asked bran we havent brought you anything everyone who seeks shelter here brings me something explained the priest we didnt know we were coming said bran yet here you are the fat priest stuck out his hand perhaps a coin might suffice said ffreol we would be grateful for a meal and a bed aye a coin is acceptable allowed aethelfrith doubtfully two is better of course three now for three pennies i sing a psalm and say a prayer for all of youand we will have wine with our dinner three it is agreed ffreol the brown priest turned to bran expectantly and held out his hand bran irked by the friars brash insistence frowned you want the money now oh aye with a pained sigh bran turned his back on the priest and drew the purse from his belt opening the drawstring he shook out a handful of coins looking for any dipped coins amongst the whole he found two half pennies and was looking for a third when aethelfrith appeared beside him and said splendid ill take those before bran could stop him the priest had snatched up three bright new pennies here boyo he said handing bran the two fat hares on the strap you get these coneys skinned and cleaned and ready to roast when i get back wait said bran trying to snatch back the coins give those back hurry now said aethelfrith darting away with surprising speed on his ludicrous bowed legs it will be dark soon and i mean to have a feast tonight bran followed him to the door are you certain youre a priest bran called after him but the only reply he heard was a bark of cheerful laughter resigned to his task bran went out and found a nearby stone and set to work skinning and gutting the hares ffreol soon joined him and sat down to watch strange fellow he observed after a time most thieves are more honest brother ffreol chuckled he is a good hand with that staff when his victim is unarmed perhaps allowed bran dully he stripped the fur from one plump animal if id had a sword in my hand be of good cheer said ffreol this is a fortuitous meeting i feel it we now have a friend in this place and that is well worth a coin or two three corrected bran and all of them new ffreol nodded and then said he will repay that debt a thousand times overten thousand something in his friends tone made bran glance up sharply why do you say that ffreol offered a small reticent smile and shrugged it is nothinga feeling only bran resumed his chore and ffreol watched him work the two sat in companionable silence as evening enfolded them in a gentle twilight the hares were gutted and washed by the time friar aethelfrith returned with a bag on his back and a small cask under each arm i did not know if you preferred wine or ale he announced so i bought both handing one of the casks to bran he gave the other to ffreol and then opening the bag drew out a fine loaf of freshbaked bread and a great hunk of pale yellow cheese three moons if a day since i had fresh bread he confided three threes of moons since i had a drink of wine offering bran another of his preposterous bows he said a blessing on the lord of the feast may his days never cease and his tribe increase bran smiled in spite of himself and declared bring the jars and let the banquet begin they returned to the oratory where iwan reclining beside the hearth had built up the fire to a bright crackling blaze while aethelfrith scurried around readying their supper ffreol found wooden cups and poured out the ale their host paused long enough to suck down a cup and then returned to his preparations spitting the fat hares and placing them at the fireside for iwan to tend he then brought a wooden trencher with broken bread and bitesized chunks of cheese and four long fireforks which he passed to his guests they sat around the hearth and toasted bread and cheese and drank to each others health while waiting for the meat to cook slowly the cares of the last days began to release their hold on bran and his companions a toast said iwan at one point raising his cup i drink to our good host aethleth he stumbled at the hurdle of the name once more he tried again but the effort proved beyond him casting an eye over the plump priest he said fat little bag of vittles that he is i will call him tuck friar tuck to you boyo retorted the priest with a laugh cocking his head to one side he said and it is iwan is it not what is that in couth speech he tapped his chin with a stubby finger its john i think yes john so overgrown infant that he is i will call him little john he raised his cup sloshing ale over the rim so now i lift my cup to little john and to his friends may you always have ale enough to wet your tongues wit enough to know friend from foe and strength enough for every fight ffreol moved as much by the camaraderie around the hearth as by the contents of his cup raised his voice in solemn priestly declamation saying i am not lying when i say that i have feasted in the halls of kings but rarely have i supped with a nobler company than sits beneath this humble roof tonight lofting his cup he said gods blessing on us brothers all chapter the sun was high and warm by the time the men were ready to depart aethelfriths oratory bran and iwan bade the priest farewell and brother ffreol bestowed a blessing saying may the grace and peace of christ be upon you and the shielding of all the saints be around you and nine holy angels aid and uphold you through all things he then raised himself to the saddle saying do not drink all the wine brother save some for our return god willing we will join you again on our way home then you had better hurry about your business aethelfrith called that wine will not last long bran eager to be away slapped the reins and trotted out onto the road ffreol and iwan followed dose behind and the three resumed their journey to lundein the horses were just finding their stride when they heard a familiar voice piping wait wait turning around in the saddle bran saw the bandylegged friar running after them thinking they had forgotten something he pulled up im coming with you aethelfrith declared bran regarded the mans disgraceful robe bare feet ragged tonsure and untidy beard he glanced at ffreol and shook his head your offer is thoughtful to be sure replied brother ffreol but we would not burden you with our affairs maybe not he allowed but god wants me to go god wants you to go iwan scoffed lightly you speak for god now do you no the priest allowed but i know he wants me to go and how pray do you know this aethelfrith offered a diffident smile he told me well replied the battlechief lightly until he tells nie i say you stay here and guard the wine cask ffreol lifted a hand in farewell and the three started off again but after only a few dozen paces bran looked around again to see the plump priest hurrying after them robes lifted high his bowed legs churning go back he called not bothering to stop i cannot replied aethelfrith it is not your voice i heed but gods i am compelled to come with you i think we should take him brother ffreol said he is too slow afoot bran pointed out he could never keep pace true agreed ffreol as the priest came puffing up reaching down his hand he said you can ride with me tuck aethelfrith took the offered hand and began wriggling labouriously up onto the back of the horse what said iwan indicating bran and himself he said are we not to have a say in this say whatever you like aethelfrith replied i am certain god is willing to listen iwan grumbled but bran laughed stung you he chuckled eh little john for five days they journeyed on following the road as it bent its way south and east over the broad lowland hills from whose tops could be seen a land of green and golden fields strewn with the smudgy brown blots of innumerable settlements they travelled more slowly with four owing to the extra weight they had to stop and rest the horses more frequently but what he cost them in time tuck made up in songs and rhymes and stories about the saintsand this made the journey more enjoyable the countryside became ever more densely populatedroads lanes and trackways seamed the valleys and the crosstopped steeples of churches adorned every hilltop over all hung the odour of the dung heap pungent and heavy in the sultry air by the time the sprawl of lundein appeared beyond the wide gleaming sweep of the thames bran was heartily sick of england and already longing to return to elfael ordinarily he would not have endured such a misery in silence but the sight of the city brought the reason for their sojourn fresh to mind and his soul sank beneath the weight of an infinitely greater grief he merely bit his lip and passed through the wretched realm his gaze level his face hard on its way into the city the road widened to resemble a broad bare wheelrutted expanse hemmed in on each side by row upon row of houses many flanked by narrow yards out of which merchants and craftsmen pursued their various trades carters carpenters and wheelwrights bartered with customers ankle deep in wood shavings blacksmiths hammered glowing rods on anvils to produce andirons fire grates ploughshares door bands and hinges chains and horseshoes corders sat in their doorways winding jute into hanks that rose in mounded coils at their feet potters ferried planks lined with sundried pitchers jars and bowls to their nearby kilns everywhere bran looked people seemed to be intensely busy but he saw no place that looked at all friendly to strangers they rode on and soon came to a low house fronting the river several dozen barrels were lined up outside the entrance beside the road some of the barrels were topped with boards behind which a young woman with hair the colour of spun gold and a bright red kerchief across her bare shoulders dispensed jars of ale to a small gathering of thirsty travellers without a second thought bran turned aside dismounted and walked to the board pax vobiscum he said dusting off his latin she gave him a nod and patted the board with her handa sign he took to mean she wanted to see his money first as bran dug out his purse and searched for a suitable coin the others joined him allow me said aethelfrith pushing up beside him he brought out an english penny coin of the realm he said holding the small silver disc between thumb and forefinger and for this we should eat like kings as well should we not he handed the money to the alewife four jars good woman he said in english and fill them full to overflowing there is food too asked bran as the woman poured out three large jars from a nearby pitcher inside the house replied the cleric following brans gaze he added but well not be going in there why not it seems a good enough place he could smell the aroma of roast pork and onions on the light evening breeze oh aye a good enough place to practise iniquity perhaps or lose your purseif not your life he shook his head at the implied depravity but we have a bed waiting for us where we will not be set upon by anything more onerous than a psalm you know of such a place asked ffreol there is a monastery just across the river friar aethelfrith informed them the abbey of saint mary the virgin i have stayed there before they will give us a bowl and bed for the night aethelfriths silver penny held good for four more jars and half a loaf of bread sliced and smeared with pork drippings which only served to rouse their appetites halfway through the second jar bran had begun to feel as if lundein might not be as bad as his first impression had led him to believe he became more certain when he caught the young alewife watching him she offered him a saucy smile and gave a little toss of her head indicating that he should follow with a nod and a wink she disappeared around the back of the house with bran a few steps behind her as bran came near she lifted her skirt a little and extended her leg to reveal a shapely ankle it is a lovely river is it not observed aethelfrith falling into step beside him it is not the river i am looking at said bran go back and finish your ale and i will join you when ive finished here oh replied the friar i think youve had enough already waving to the young woman he took bran by the arm and steered him back the way they had come evening is upon us he observed well be going on im hungry said bran glancing back at the alewife he saw that she had gone inside we should eat something aye we will agreed tuck but not here they rejoined the others and bran returned to his jar avoiding the stern glance of brother ffreol drink up my friends ordered tuck it is time we were moving along with a last look toward the inn bran drained his cup and reluctantly followed the others back to their mounts and climbed back into the saddle how many times have you been to lundein he asked as they continued their slow plod into the city oh a fair few aethelfrith replied four or five times i think though the last time was when old king william was on the throne he paused to consider seven years ago perhaps at kings bridge they stopped in the road bran had never seen a bridge so wide and long and despite the crowds now hurrying to their homes on the other side of the river he was not certain he wanted to venture out too far he was on the point of dismounting to lead his horse across when aethelfrith saw his hesitation five hundred men on horseback cross this bridge every day he called and oxcarts by the score it will yet bear a few more i was merely admiring the handiwork bran told him he gave his mount a slap and started across indeed it was ingeniously constructed with beams of good solid oak and iron spikes it neither swayed nor creaked as they crossed all the same he was happy to reach the far side where aethelfrith now afoot began leading them up one narrow shadowed street and down another until the three welshmen had lost all sense of direction i know it is here somewhere said aethelfrith they paused at a small crossroads to consider where to look next the twisting streets were filling up with smoke from the hearth fires of the houses round about night is upon us ffreol pointed out if we cannot find it in the daylight we will fare no better in the dark we are near insisted the fat little priest i remember this place do i not just then a bell rang out a clear distinct tone in the still evening air ah cried aethelfrith that will be the call to vespers this way following the sound of the bell they soon arrived at a gate in a stone wall here he said hurrying to the gate this is the placei told you i would remember so you did replied bran how could we have doubted the mendicant priest pulled a small rope that passed through a hole in the wooden door another bell tinkled softly and presently the door swung open a thin roundshouldered priest dressed in a long robe of undyed wool stepped out to greet them one glance at the two priests in their robes and he said welcome brothers peace and welcome a quick word with the porter and their lodgings for the night were arranged they ate soup with the brothers in the refectory and while ffreol and aethelfrith attended the night vigil with the resident monks bran and iwan went to the cell provided for them and fell asleep on fleececovered straw mats upon arising with the bell the next morning bran saw that ffreol and aethelfrith were already at prayer he pulled on his boots brushed the straw from his cloak and went out into the abbey yard to wait until the holy office was finished while he waited he rehearsed in his mind what they should say to william the red now that the fateful day had dawned bran found himself lost for words and dwarfed by the awful knowledge of how much depended upon his ability to persuade the english king of the injustice being perpetrated on his people his heart sank lower and lower as he contemplated the dreary future before him an impoverished lackey to a ffreinc bounder whose reputation for profligate spending was exceeded only by his whoring and drinking when at last ffreol and aethelfrith emerged from the chapel bran had decided he would swear an oath to the devil himself if it would keep the vile invaders from elfael the travellers took their leave and passing beyond the monastery gates entered the streets of the city to make their way to the white tower as the kings stronghold was known bran could see the pale stone structure rising above the rooftops of the low mean houses sheltering in the shadows of the fortress walls at the gates brother ffreol declared brans nobility and announced their intent to the porter who directed them into the yard and showed them where to tie their horses they were then met by a liveried servant who conducted them into the fortress itself and to a large anteroom lined with benches on which a score or more menmostly ffreinc but some englishwere already waiting others were standing in clumps and knots the length of the room the thought of having to wait his turn until all had been seen cast bran into a dismal mood they settled in a far corner of the room every now and then a courtier would appear summon one or more petitioners and take them away for good or ill those summoned never returned to the anteroom so the mood remained one of hopeful if somewhat desperate optimism i have heard of people waiting twenty days or more to speak to the king friar aethelfrith confided as he cast his glance around the room at the men lining the benches we will not bide that long bran declared but he sank a little further into gloom at the thought some of those in the room did indeed look as if they might have taken up more or less permanent residence there they brought out food from wellstocked tuck bags some slept and others whiled away the time playing at dice morning passed and the day slowly crept away it was after midday and brans stomach had begun reminding him that he had eaten nothing but soup and hard bread since the day before when the door at the end of the great vestibule opened and a courtier in yellow leggings and a short tunic and mantle of bright green entered passing slowly along the benches and eyeing the petitioners who looked up hopefully at his approach bran stood we want to see the king he said in his best latin yes replied the man and what is the nature of your business here we want to see the king to be sure the court official glanced at those attending bran and said you four are together we are replied bran the question is why would you see the king we have come to seek redress for a crime committed in the kings name bran explained the officials glance sharpened what sort of crime the slaughter of our lord and his warband and the seizure of our lands volunteered brother ffreol taking his place beside bran indeed the courtier became grave when did this happen not more than ten days ago replied bran the courtier regarded the men before him and made up his mind come we will see the king now you will follow me the official led them through the wooden door and into the next room which although smaller than the anteroom they had just left was whitewashed and strewn with fresh straw at one end was a fireplace and opposite the hearth was an enormous tapestry hung from an iron rod the handworked cloth depicted the risen christ on his heavenly throne holding an orb and sceptre the centre of the room was altogether taken up by a stout table at which sat three men in highbacked chairs the two men at each end of the table wore robes of deep brown and skullcaps of white linen the man in the centre was dressed in a robe of black satin trimmed with fox fur his skullcap was red silk and almost the same colour as his long flowing locks he also wore a thick gold chain around his neck attached to which were a cross and a polished crystal lens before the men were piles of parchments and pots containing goose quills and ink and all three were writing on squares of parchment before them the scratch of their pens was the only sound in the room yes said one of the men as the four approached the table he did not raise his eyes from his writing what is it murder and the unlawful seizure of lands intoned the courtier this is not a matter for the royal court replied the man dismissively dipping his pen you must take it up with the court of the assizor i thought perhaps this particular case might interest you my lord bishop the courtier said interesting or not we do not adjudicate criminal cases sighed the man you must place the matter before the assizes before the courtier could make a reply bran said we appeal to the kings justice because the crime was committed in the kings name at this the man in the red skullcap glanced up interest quickened eyes keen and rapacious as a hawks in the kings name did you say yes replied bran truly the mans eyes narrowed you are welsh british yes what is your name here stands before you bran ap brychan prince and heir to the throne of elfael said iwan speaking up to save his future king the embarrassment of having to affirm his own nobility i see the man in the red silk cap leaned back in his chair the gold cross on his chest had rubies to mark the places where nails had been driven into the saviours hands and feet he raised the crystal lens and held it before a sharp blue eye tell me what happened forgive me sir are you the king asked bran my lord we have no time for such as this they are began the man in the white skullcap his objection was silenced by a flick of his superiors hand king william has been called away to normandie explained the man in the red skullcap i am cardinal ranulf of bayeux chief justiciar of england i am authorised to deal with all domestic matters in the kings absence you may speak to me as you would speak to his majesty offering a mirthless smile the cardinal said pray continue i would hear more of this alleged crime bran nodded and licked his lips nine days ago my father lord brychan of elfael set off for lundein to swear allegiance to king william he was ambushed on the road by ffreinc marchogi who killed him and all who were with him save one my father and the warband of elfael were massacred and their bodies left to rot beside the road my sympathies said ranulf may i ask how you know the men who committed this crime were as you call them ffreinc marchogi bran put out a hand to iwan this man survived and witnessed all that took place he is the only one to escape with his life is this true wondered the cardinal it is my lord every word affirmed iwan the leader of this force is a man named falkes de braose he claims to have received elfael by a grant from king william ranulf of bayeux raised the long white quill and held it lengthwise between his hands as if studying it for imperfections it is true that his majesty has recently issued a number of such grants the cardinal told them turning to his assistant on the left he said bring me the de braose grant without a word the man in the chair beside him rose and crossed the room disappearing through a door behind the tapestry there would seem to be some confusion here allowed the cardinal when his man had gone but we will soon find the cause regarding the three before him he added we keep good records it is the norman way friar aethelfrith stifled a hoot of contempt for the mans insinuation instead he beamed beatifically and loosed a soft fart a moment later the cardinals assistant returned bearing a square of parchment bound by a red satin riband this he untied and placed before his superior who took it up and began to read aloud very quickly skipping over unimportant parts be it known this day by the power and enfranchisement ah he said here it is he then read out the pertinent passage for the petitioners granted to william de braose baron lord of the rape of bramber in recognition for his support and enduring loyalty the lands comprising the welsh commot elfael so called entitled free and clear for himself and his heirs in perpetuity in exchange for the sum of two hundred marks we were sold for two hundred marks wondered iwan a token sum replied the cardinal dryly it is customary the norman way no doubt put in aethelfrith but it is count falkes de braose who has taken the land bran pointed out not the baron baron william de braose is his uncle i believe said the cardinal but yes that is undoubtedly where the confusion has arisen there is no provision for falkes to assume control of the land as he is not a direct heir the baron himself must occupy the land or forfeit his claim therefore as chief justiciar i will allow this grant to be rescinded i do thank you my lord said bran sweet relief surging through him i am much obliged the cardinal raised his hand please hear me out i will allow the grant to be revoked for a payment to the crown of six hundred marks six hundred gasped bran it was given to de braose for two hundred in recognition of his loyalty and support during the rebellion of the barons intoned the cardinal yes for you it will be six hundred and fealty sworn to king william that is robbery snapped bran the cardinals eyes snapped quick fire it is a bargain boy he stared at bran for a moment and then pulled the parchment to himself adding in any case that is my decision the matter will be held in abeyance until such time as the money is paid he gestured to his assistant who began writing an addendum to the grant bran stared at the churchman and felt the despair melt away in a sudden surge of whitehot rage his vision became bloodtinged and hard he saw the bland face and shrewd eyes the mans flaming red hair and it was all he could do to keep from seizing the imperious cleric pulling him bodily across the table and beating the superior smirk off that smug face with his fists rigid as a stump hands clenched in rage he stared at the courtiers as his grip on reality slipped away in a bloodtinted vision he saw a tub of oil at his feet and before anyone could stop him he snatched up the tub and emptied it over the table drenching the cardinal his clerks and their stacks of parchment as the irate courtiers spluttered bran calmly withdrew an oilsoaked parchment from the pile he held it to a torch in a wall sconce and set it ablaze he blew on it to strengthen the flame then tossed it back onto the table the oil flared igniting the table parchments and men in a single conflagration the clerks pawed at the flames with their hands and succeeded only in spreading them the cardinal gripped with terror cried out like a child as tongues of fire leapt to his hair and turned the rich fox fur trim into a collar of living flame bran glimpsed himself standing gaunt and grim as the howling clerics fled the room each oilsoaked footprint alighting behind them as they ran he saw ranulf of bayeuxs face bubble and crack like the skin of a pig on a spit and as the cardinal fought for his last breath abeyance my lord said ffreol forgive me but does that mean baron de braose keeps the land at the sound of ffreols voice bran came to himself once more he felt drained and somewhat lightheaded without awaiting the cardinals reply he turned on his heel and strode from the chamber until the money is paid yes cardinal ranulf replied to ffreol he reached for a small bronze bell to summon the porter do not bother to return here until you have the silver in hand he rang the bell to end the audience saying god grant you a good day and pleasant journey home chapter nd a pleasant journey home minced aethelfrith in rude parody of cardinal ranulf bring me my staff and i will give that bloated toad a pleasant journey hence bran scowling darkly said nothing and walked on through the gates leaving the white tower without a backward glance the unfairness the monstrous injustice of the cardinals demand sent waves of anger surging through him into his mind flashed the memory of a time years ago when a similar injustice had driven him down and defeated him bran had been out with some of the men as they rode along the top of a ridgeway they spied in the valley below a band of irish raiders herding stolen cattle across the cantref outnumbered and lightly armed bran had let the raiders pass unchallenged and then hurried back to the caer to tell his father they met the king in the yard along with the rest of the warriors of the warband you let them goand yet dare to show your face to me growled the king when bran told him what had happened we would have been slaughtered outright bran explained backing away there were too many of them you worthless little coward the king shouted the warriors gathered in the yard looked on as the king drew back his hand and let fly catching bran on the side of the head the blow sent the boy spinning to the ground better to die in battle than live as a coward the king roared get up lose ten good men for the sake of a few cows countered bran climbing to his feet only a fool would think that was better you snivelling brat roared brychan lashing out again bran stood to the blow this time which only enraged his father the more the king struck him again and yet againuntil bran unable to bear the abuse any longer turned and fled the yard sobbing with pain and frustration the bruises from that encounter lasted a long time the humiliation longer still any ambition bran might have held for the crown died that day the throne of elfael could crumble to dust for all he cared they did not stay in lundein again that night but fled the city sprawl as if pursued by demons the moon rose nearly full and the sky remained clear so they rode on through the night stopping only a little before dawn to rest the horses and sleep bran had little to say the next day or the day after they reached the oratory and brother aethelfrith prevailed upon them to spend the night under his roof and for the sake of wounded iwan bran agreed while the friar scurried about to prepare a meal for his guests bran and ffreol took care of the horses and settled them for the night it isnt fair muttered bran securing the tether line to the slender trunk of a beech tree he turned to ffreol and exclaimed i still dont see how the king could sell us like that who gave him the right red william replied the monk raising his eyebrows at the sudden outburst from the allbutsilent bran aye red william he has no authority over cymru the ffreinc claim that kingship descends from god ffreol pointed out william avows divine right for his actions what has england to do with us bran demanded why cant they leave us alone answer that replied the monk sagely and you answer the riddle of the ages throughout the long history of our race no tribe or nation has ever been able to simply leave us alone that night bran sat in the corner by the hearth sipping wine in sombre silence brooding over the unfairness of the ffreinc king the inequity of a world where the whims of one fickle man could doom so many and the seemingly limitless injusticeslarge and small of life in general and why was everyone looking to him to put it right for the sake of elfael and the throne ffreol had said well the throne of elfael had done nothing for himsave provide him with a distant and disapproving father remove the throne of elfael take away elfael itself and all her people would the world be so different would the world even notice the loss besides if god in his wisdom had bestowed his blessing on king william favouring the ffreinc ascendancy with divine approval who were any of them to disagree when heaven joined battle against you who could stand arly the next morning the three thanked friar aethelfrith for his help bade him farewell and resumed the homeward journey they rode through that day and the next and it was not until late on the third day that they came in sight of the great rumpled swath of forest that formed the border between england and cymru the dark mood that had dogged them since lundein began to lift at last once amongst the sheltering trees of coed cadw the oppression of england and its rapacious king dwindled to mere annoyance the forest had weathered the ravages of men and their petty concerns from the beginning of time and would prevail what was one redhaired ffreinc tyrant against that it is only money after all observed ffreol optimism making him expansive we have only to pay them and elfael is safe once more if silver is what the red king wants said iwan joining in silver is what he will get we will buy back our land from the greedy ffreinc bastards bran said there are two hundred marks in my fathers strongbox that is a start and a good one declared iwan all three fell silent for a moment how will we get the rest iwan asked at last voicing the thought all three shared we will go to the people and tell them what is required said bran we will raise it that may not be so easy cautioned brother ffreol if you could somehow empty every silver coin from every pocket purse and crock in elfael you might get another hundred marks at most to his dismay bran realised that was only too true lord brychan was the wealthiest man in three cantrefs and he had never possessed more than three hundred marks all at once in the best of times six hundred marks cardinal ranulf might as well have asked for the moon or a hatful of stars he was just as likely to get one as the other unwilling to succumb to despair again so soon bran gave the mare a slap and picked up the pace soon he was racing through the darkening wood speeding along the road feeling the cool evening air on his face after a time his mount began to tire so at the next ford ing place bran reined up he slid from the saddle and led the horse a little way along the stream where the animal could drink he cupped a few handfuls of water to his mouth and drew his wet hands over the back of his neck the water cooled his temper somewhat it would be dark soon he noticed already the shadows were thickening and the forest was growing hushed with the coming of night bran was still kneeling at the stream gazing at the darkening forest when ffreol and iwan arrived they dismounted and led their horses to the water a fine chase said ffreol i have not ridden like that since i was a boy squatting down beside bran he put a hand to the young mans shoulder and said well find a way to raise the money bran never fear bran nodded it will be dark soon iwan pointed out we will not reach caer cadarn tonight well lay up at the next good place we find said bran he started to climb into the saddle but ffreol said it is vespers come both of you join me and we will continue after prayers they knelt beside the ford then and ffreol raised his hands saying i am bending my knee in the eye of the father who created me in the eye of the son who befriended me in the eye of the spirit who walks with me in companionship and affection through thine own anointed one god bestow upon us fullness in our need brother ffreols voice flowed out over the stream and along the water bran listened and his mind began to wander iwans hissed warning brought him back with a start listen the champion held up his hand for silence did you hear that i heard nothing but the sound of my own voice replied the priest he closed his eyes and resumed his prayer grant us this night your peace there came a shout behind them arret the three rose and turned as one to see four ffreinc marchogi on the road behind them weapons drawn the soldiers advanced walking warily their expressions grave in the dim light ride shouted iwan darting to his horse hie the cry died in his throat for even as the three prepared to flee five more marchogi stepped from the surrounding wood their blades glimmered dimly in the dusky light even so iwan wounded as he was would have challenged them and taken his chances but ffreol prevented him iwan no theyll kill you they mean to kill us anyway replied the warrior carelessly we must fight no ffreol put out a restraining hand and pulled him back let me talk to them before iwan could protest the monk stepped forward stretching out empty hands he walked a few paces to meet the advancing knights pax vobiscum he called continuing in latin he said peace to you this night please put up your swords you have nothing to fear from us one of the ffreinc made a reply that neither bran nor iwan understood the priest repeated himself speaking more slowly he stepped closer holding out his hands to show that he had no weapons the knight who had spoken moved to intercept him the point of his sword flicked the air ffreol took another step then stopped and looked down ffreol called bran the monk made no answer but half turned as he glanced back toward bran and iwan even in the failing light bran could see that blood covered the front of the monks robe ffreol himself appeared confused by this he looked down again and then his hands found the gaping rent in his throat he clutched at the wound and blood spilled over his fingers pax vobiscum he spluttered then crashed to his knees in the road you filthy scum screamed bran leaping to the saddle he drew his sword and spurred his horse forward to put himself between the wounded priest and the ffreinc attackers he was instantly surrounded bran made but one sweeping slash with his blade before he was hauled kicking from the saddle fighting free of the hands that gripped him he struggled to where brother ffreol lay on his side the monk reached out a hand and brought brans face close to his lips god keep you he whispered his voice a fading whisper ffreol cried bran no the priest gave out a little sigh and laid his head upon the road bran fell upon the body clutching the priests face between his hands he shouted ffreol ffreol but his friend and confessor was dead then bran felt the hands of his captors on him they hauled him to his feet and dragged him away jerking his head around he saw iwan thrashing wildly with his sword as the marchogi swarmed around him here bran shouted to me to me that was all he could get out before he was flung to the ground and pinned there with a boot on his neck his face shoved into the dirt he tried to wrestle free but received a sharp kick in the ribs and then the air was driven from his lungs by a knee in his back with a last desperate effort he twisted on the ground seized the leg of the marchogi and pulled him down grasping the soldiers helmet bran yanked it off and began pummelling the startled soldier with it in his mind it was not a nameless ffreinc soldier he bludgeoned senseless but ruthless king william himself in the frenzy of the fight bran felt the handle of the soldiers knife drew it and raised his arm to plunge the point into the knights throat as the blade slashed down however the marchogi fell on him pulling him away cheating him of the kill screaming and writhing in their grasp kicking and clawing like an animal caught in a net bran tried to fight free then one of the knights raised the butt of a spear and the night exploded in a shower of stars and pain as blow after blow rained down upon him chapter io you are welsh yes a briton bruised bloodied and bound at the wrists by a rope that looped around his neck bran was dragged roughly forward and forced to his knees before a man standing in the wavering pool of light from a handheld torch dressed in a long tunic of yellow linen with a short blue cloak and boots of soft brown leather he carried neither sword nor spear and the others deferred to him bran took him to be their lord are you a briton he spoke english with the curious flattened nasal tone of the ffreinc answer me he nodded to one of the soldiers who gave bran a quick kick in the ribs the pain of the blow roused bran he lifted his head to gaze with loathing at his inquisitor i think you are welsh yes the ffreinc noble said unwilling to dignify the word bran merely nodded what were you doing on the road asked the man travelling mumbled bran his voice sounded strange and loud in his ears his head throbbed from the knocks he had taken at night my friends and iwe had business in lundein we were on our way home he raised accusing eyes to his ffreinc interrogator the man your soldiers killed was a priest you bloody bran lunged forward but the soldier holding the rope yanked him back he was forced down on his knees once more you will all rot in hell perhaps admitted the man we think he was a spy he was a man of god you murdering bastard and the other one what about the other one asked bran did you kill him too he has eluded capture that was something at least let me go bran said you have no right to hold me ive done nothing it is for my lord to hold or release you as he sees fit said the ffreinc nobleman i am his seneschal who is your lord i demand to speak to him speak to him you shall welshman replied the seneschal you are coming with us turning to the marchogi holding the torches he said liezle bran spent the rest of the night tied to a tree nursing a battered skull and a consuming hatred of the ffreinc his friend brother ffreol cut down like a dog in the road and himself taken captive this added to the gross injustice of cardinal ranulfs demands overthrew the balance of brans minda balance already made precarious by the loss of his father and the warband he passed in and out of consciousness his dreams merging with reality until he could no longer tell one from the other in his mind he walked a dark forest pathway longbow in hand and a quiver of arrows on his hip over and over again he heard the sound of hoofbeats and a ffreinc knight would thunder out of the darkness brandishing a sword as the knight closed on him blade held high bran would slowly raise the bow and send an arrow into his attackers heart the shock of the impact lifted the rider from the saddle and pinned him to a tree the horse would gallop past and bran would walk on this same event repeated itself throughout the long night as bran moved through his dream leaving an endless string of corpses dangling in the forest sometime before morning the moon set and bran heard an owl cry in the treetop above him he came awake then and found himself bound fast to a stout elm tree but uncertain how he had come to be there groggily like a man emerging from a drunken stupor he looked around there were ffreinc soldiers sleeping on the ground nearby he saw their inert bodies and his first thought was that he had killed them but no they breathed still they were alive and he was a captive his head beat with a steady throb his ribs burned where he had been kicked there was a nasty metallic taste in his mouth as if he had been sucking on rusty iron his shirt was wet where he had sweat through it and the night air was cold where the cloth clung to his skin he ached from head to heel when the owl called again memory came flooding back in a confused rush of images an enemy soldier writhing and moaning his face a battered bloody pulp mailed soldiers swarming out of the shadows the body of his friend ffreol crumpled in the road grasping at words as life fled through a slit in his throat a blade glinting swift and sharp in the moonlight iwan horse rearing sword sweeping a wide lethal arc as he galloped away a ffreinc helmet greasy with blood lifted high against a pale summer moon so it was true not all of it was a dream he could still tell the difference that was some small comfort at least he told himself he had to keep his wits about him if he was to survive and on that thought he dosed his eyes and called upon saint michael to help him in his time of need the ffreinc marchogi broke camp abruptly bran was tied to his own horse as the troops made directly for caer cadarn the invaders moved slowly burdened as they were with oxdrawn wagons full of weapons tools and provisions alongside the menatarms were otherssmiths and builders a few of the invaders had women and children with them they were not raiders bran concluded but armed settlers they were coming to elfael and they meant to stay once free of the forest the long slow cavalcade passed through an apparently empty land no one worked the fields no one was seen on the road or even around the few farms and settlements scattered amongst the distant hillsides bran took this to mean that the monks had been able to raise the alarm and spread the word the people had fled to the monastery at llanelli at their approach to the caer the ffreinc seneschal rode ahead to inform his lord of their arrival by the time they started up the ramp the gates were open everything in the caer appeared to be in good ordernothing out of place no signs of destruction or pillage it appeared as though the new residents had simply replaced the old continuing the steady march of life in the caer without missing a step the marchogi threw bran still bound into the tiny root cellar beneath the kitchen and there he languished through the rest of the day the cool damp dark complemented his misery and he embraced it mourning his losses and cursing the infinite cruelty of fate he cursed the ffreinc and cursed his father too why oh why had rhi brychan held out so long if he had sworn fealty to red william when peace was first offeredas cadwgan in the neighbouring cantref of eiwas and other british kings had long since donethen at least the throne of elfael would still be free and his father the warband and brother ffreol would still be alive true elfael would be subject to the ffreinc and much the poorer for it but they would still have their land and their lives why had rhi brychan refused the conquerors repeated offers of peace stubbornness bran decided pure mean pigheaded stubbornness and spite brans mother had always been able to moderate her husbands harsher views even as she lightened his darker moods queen rhian had provided the levity and love that bran remembered in his early years with her death that necessary balance and influence ceased never to be replaced by another at first young bran had done what he could to imitate his mothers engaging waysto be the one to brighten the kings dour disposition he learned riddles and songs and made up amusing stories to tell but of course it was not the same without his queen the king had grown increasingly severe always a demanding man brychan had become a bitter exacting dissatisfied tyrant finding fault with everyone and everything nothing was ever good enough certainly nothing bran ever did was good enough young bran striving to please and yearning for the approving touch of a fathers hand only ever saw that hand raised in anger thus he learned at an early age that since he could never please his father he might as well please himself that is the course he had pursued ever sincemuch to his fathers annoyance and eventual despair so now the king was dead from the day the conqueror seized the throne of the english overlords brychan had resisted having to suffer the english was bad enough their centurieslong presence in britain was to him still a fresh wound into which salt was rubbed almost daily brychan like his celtic fathers reckoned time not in years or decades but in whole generations if he looked back to a time when britain and the britons were the sole masters of their island realm he also looked forward to a day when the cymry would be free again thus when william duke of normandie settled his bulk on harolds throne that fateful christmas day rhi brychan vowed he would die before swearing allegiance to any ffreinc usurper at long last thought bran that oftrepeated boast had been challengedand the challenge made good brychan was dead his warriors with him and the pale highhanded foreigners ran rampant through the land how now father bran reflected bitterly is this what you hoped to achieve the vile enemy sits on your throne and your heir squats in the pit are you proud of your legacy it was not until the following morning that bran was finally released and marched to his fathers great hall he was brought to stand before a slender young man not much older than himself who despite the mild summer day sat hunched by the hearth warming his white hands at the flames as if it were the dead of winter dressed in a spotless blue tunic and yellow mantle the thinfaced fellow observed brans scuffed and battered appearance with a grimace of disgust you will answer meif you can briton said the young man his latin though heavily accented could at least be understood what is your name the sight of the fairhaired interloper sitting in the chair rhi brychan used for a throne offended bran in a way he would not have thought possible when he failed to reply quickly enough the young man who apparently was lord and leader of the invaders rose from his seat drew back his arm and gave bran a sharp backhanded slap across the mouth hatred leapt up hot and quick bran swallowed it down with an effort i am called gwrgi he answered taking the first name that came to mind where is your home ty gwyn bran lied in brycheiniog you are a nobleman i think decided the norman lord his downy beard and soft dark eyes gave him a look of mild innocencelike a lamb or a yearling calf no replied bran his denial firm i am not a nobleman yes asserted his inquisitor i think you are he reached out and took hold of brans sleeve rubbing the cloth between his fingers as if to appraise its worth a prince perhaps or at least a knight i am a merchant bran replied with dull insistence i think the ffreinc lord concluded you are not he gave his narrow head a decisive shake making his curls bounce all noblemen claim to be commoners when captured you would be foolish to do otherwise when bran said nothing the norman drew back his hand and let fly again catching bran on the cheek just below the eye the heavy gold ring on the young mans finger tore the flesh blood welled up and trickled down the side of his face i am not a nobleman muttered bran through clenched teeth i am a merchant a pity sniffed the young lord turning away noblemen we ransombeggars thieves and spies we kill he nodded to his attending soldiers take him away no wait shouted bran ransom you want money silver i can get it the ffreinc lord spoke a word to his men they halted still holding bran tightly between them how much inquired the young lord a little replied bran enough the norman gathered his blue cloak around his shoulders and studied his captive for a moment i think you are lying welshman the word was a slur in his mouth but no matter we can always kill you later he turned away and resumed his place by the fire i am count falkes de braose he announced settling himself in the chair once more am lord of this place now so mind your tongue and we shall i yet come to a satisfactory agreement bran determined to appear pliant and dutiful answered respectfully that is my fervent hope count de braose good then let us arrange your ransom replied the count the amount you must pay will depend on your answers to my questions i understand bran said trying to sound agreeable i will answer as well as i can where were you and that priest going when my men found you on the road we were returning from lundein replied bran brother ffreol had business with the monastery there and i was hoping to buy some cloth to sell in the markets hereabouts this business of yours compelled you to ride at night why we had been away a long time answered bran and brother ffreol was anxious to get home he had an important message for his bishop or so he said i think you were spies de braose announced bran shook his head no what about the other one was he a merchant too iwan said bran iwan is a friend he rode with us to provide protection a task at which he failed miserably observed the count he escaped but we will find himand when we do he will be made to pay for his crimes bran took this to mean he had injured or killed at least one of the marchogi in the skirmish on the road only a coward would kill a priest observed bran since you require men to pay for their crimes why not begin with your own the count leaned forward dangerously if you wish to keep your tongue you will speak with more respect he sat back and smoothed his tunic with his long fingers now then you knew my men were attacked by your people on that same road some days ago i was in lundein as i said bran replied i heard nothing of it no wondered the count holding his head to one side i can tell you the attack was crushed utterly the lord of this place and his pitifully few warriors were wiped out three hundred against thirty bran replied bitterness sharpening his tone it would not have been difficult careful chided the count are you certain you knew nothing of this battle not a word bran told him trying to sound both sincere and disinterested but i know how many men the king of elfael had at his command and you say you know nothing of the priests business no he did not tell mewhy would he i am no priest bran remarked churchmen can be very secretive when it suits them could it have something to do with the money the priest was carrying inquired the count he gestured to a nearby table and the four bags of coins lying there bran glanced at the table the thieving ffreinc had of course searched the horses and found the money bran had hidden amongst the provisions it is possible allowed bran i did not think priests carry so much money otherwise no agreed de braose they do not he frowned apparently deciding there was nothing more to be learned very well he said at last about the ransom it will be fifty marks bran felt bitter laughter rising in his throat cardinal ranulf wanted six hundred what was fifty more fifty marks he repeated determined not to allow the enemy the pleasure of seeing him squirm bran shrugged and adopted a thoughtful air a heavy price for one who is neither lord nor landholder de braose regarded him with an appraising look you think it too high what value would you place on your life i could get ten marks bran told him trying to make himself sound reasonable maybe twelve twentyfive fifteen maybe bran offered reluctantly but it would take time how much time four days said bran pursing his lips in close calculation five would be better you have one the norman lord decided and the ransom will be twenty marks twenty then agreed bran reluctantly but i will need a horse de braose shook his head slowly you will go afoot if i am not to have a horse i will certainly need more time said bran he would have the money before the morning was out but did not want the ffreinc to know that either you can find the ransom or you cannot concluded de braose making up his mind you have one dayno more and you must swear on the cross that you will return here with the money then i am free to go asked bran surprised that it should be so easy swear it said de braose bran looked his enemy in the eye and said i do swear on the cross of christ that i will return with money enough to purchase my ransom he glanced at the two knights standing by the door i can go now de braose inclined his long head yes and i urge you to make haste bring the money to me before sunset if you fail you will be caught and your life will be forfeit do you understand me of course bran turned on his heel and strode away it was all he could do to refrain from breaking into a run the moment he left the hall to maintain the pretence he calmly crossed the yard under the gaze of the marchogi and strode from the caer he suspected that his new overlords watched him from the fortress so he continued his purposeful unbroken stride until the trees along the river at the valley bottom took him from sight then he ran all the way to llanelli to tell bishop asaph the grievous news about brother ffreol chapter ii where is everyone shouted bran dashing through the gate and into the tidy spare yard of the llanelli monastery he had expected the yard to be full to overflowing with familiar faces of cowering frightened cymry seeking refuge from the invaders lord bran thank god you are safe replied brother eilbeg the porter hurrying after him bran turned on him what happened to those i sent here he demanded theyve been taken to saint dyfrigs bishop asaph thought they would be better cared for at the abbey until it is safe to return where is the bishop at prayer sire replied the monk he looked through the door behind bran as if hoping to see someone else then asked where is brother ffreol bran made no answer but sped to the chapel where he found bishop asaph on his knees before the altar hands outstretched my lord said bran abruptly i have news the bishop concluded his prayer and turned to see who it was that interrupted his communion one quick glance at brans bruised face told him there had been more trouble how bad is it asked the bishop grasping the edge of the altar to pull himself to his feet as bad as can be bran replied brother ffreol is dead iwan escaped but they are searching for him to kill him the bishops shoulders dropped and he sagged against the near wall he put a hand out to steady himself and paused a long moment eyes closed his lips moving in a silent prayer bran waited and when the bishop had composed himself he quickly explained how they had been caught on the road by marchogi who had killed the good brother without provocation and you asked asaph you fought free bran shook his head they took me captive and brought me to the caer i was released to raise ransom for myself the bishop shook his head sadly he gazed at bran as if trying to fathom the depths of such outrageous events cut down in the road you say for no reason no reason at all confirmed bran they are murderous ffreinc bastardsthat is all the reason they need did he suffer at all no replied bran with a quick shake of his head his death was quick there was little pain asaph gazed back at him with damp doleful eyes and fingered the knotted ends of his cincture and yet they let you simply walk away the count thinks i am a nobleman asaphs wizened face creased in a frown of incomprehension but you are a nobleman i told him otherwisealthough he refused to believe me what will you do now i agreed to give him twenty marks in exchange for my freedom i am honourbound to bring him the money otherwise he would never have let me go we must go to ffreol murmured the bishop starting for the chapel door we must go find his body and did you hear me demanded bran gripping the bishops shoulder tightly he spun the old man around i said i need the money the ransom yeshow much do you need twenty marks in silver repeated bran quickly the strongboxmy fathers treasure boxwhere is it there should be more than enough to pay the sudden expression of anxiety on the bishops face stopped him the bishop looked away the strongbox asaph bran said his voice low and tense where is it count de braose has taken it the bishop replied what cried bran you were supposed to hide it from them they came here the count and some of his menthey asked if we had any treasure replied the churchman they wanted it i had to give it to them fool shouted bran in the name of all that is holy why bran i could not lie answered asaph growing indignant lying is a venal sin love in the heart truth on the lipsthat is our rule you just gave it to them bran glared at the sanctimonious cleric anger flicking like a whip from his gaze youve just killed me do you know that i hardly think listen to me you old goat spat bran i must pay de braose the ransom by sunset today or i will be hunted down and executed where am i going to find that money now the bishop unrepentant raised a finger heavenward god will provide he already did snarled bran the money was here and you let them take it he growled with frustration and stalked to the open doorway of the chapel then turned back suddenly i need a horse that will be difficult i do not care how difficult it is unless you want to see me dead this time tomorrow you will find a horse at once do you understand me where will you go north answered bran decisively ffreol would still be alive and i would be safe there now if we had not listened to you the bishop bent his head accepting the reproach bran said my mothers kinsmen are in gwynedd when i tell them what has happened here they will take me in but i need a horse and supplies to travel saint ernins abbey serves the northern cantrefs observed the bishop if you need help you can call on them just get me that horse commanded bran taking the cleric roughly by the arm and steering him toward the door i will see what i can find the bishop left shaking his head and murmuring poor ffreol we must go and claim his body so that he can be buried here amongst his brothers bran walked alongside him urging the elderly churchman to a quicker pace yes yes he agreed you must claim the body by all means but first the horseotherwise you will be digging two graves this time tomorrow the bishop nodded and hurried away bran watched him for a moment and then walked to the small guest lodge beside the gate he looked around the nearempty cell in one corner was a bed made of rushes overspread with a sheepskin he crossed to the bed lay down and overcome by the accumulated exertions of the last days closed his eyes and sank into a blessedly dreamless sleep it was late when he woke again the sun was well down and the shadows stretched long across the empty yard the bishop he soon learned had sent three monks in search of a horse none of the three had yet returned the bishop himself had taken a party with an oxcart to retrieve the body of brother ffreol there was nothing to do so he returned to the guest lodge to stew over the stupidity of churchmen and rue his rotten luck he sprawled on the bench outside the chapter house listening to the intermittent bell as it tolled the offices little by little the oncebright day faded to a dull yellow haze he dozed and awoke to yet another bell presently the monks began appearing in twos and threes they entered the yard hurrying from their various chores that bell what was it bran asked one of the brothers as he passed it is only vespers sire replied the priest respectfully brans heart sank at the word vespers eventide prayerthe day gone and he was still within shouting distance of the caer he slumped back against the muddaubed wall and stuck his feet out in front of him asaph was worse than useless and he felt a ripe fool for trusting him if he had known the silly old man had given his fathers treasure to de braosesimply handed it over by jobs boneshe could have lit out for the northern border the moment the count set him free he was on the point of fleeing llanelli when an errant breeze brought a savoury aroma from the cookhouse and he suddenly remembered how hungry he was an instant later he was on his feet and moving toward the refectory he would eat and then go nothing was easier than cadging a meal from brother bedo the kitchener a cheerful redfaced lump with watery eyes and a permanent stoop from bending over his pots and steaming cauldrons no creature that begged a crust was ever turned away from his door lord bran bless me its you he said pulling bran into the room and sitting him down on a threelegged stool at the table i heard what happened to you on the roada sorry business a full sorry business indeed gods truth brother ffreol was one of our best you know he would have been bishop one day he wouldif not abbot also he was my confessor volunteered bran he was a friend and a good man i dont suppose it could have been helped asked the kitchener placing a wooden trencher of roast meat and bread on the table before bran there was nothing to be done bran said even if hed had a hundred warriors at his back it would not have made the slightest difference ah so well bedo poured out a jar of thin ale into a small leather cup bless himand bless you too that you were there to comfort him at his dying breath bran accepted the monks words without comment there had been precious little comforting in ffreols last moments the chaos of that terrible night rose before him once more and brans eyesight dimmed with tears he finished his meal without further talk then thanked the brother and went out already planning the route he would take through the valley away from the caer and count de braoses ransom demand the moon had risen above the far hills when bran slipped through the gate he had walked only a few dozen paces when he heard someone calling after him lord bran wait he looked around to see three dusty footsore monks leading a swaybacked plough horse what is that asked bran regarding the animal doubtfully my lord the monk said it is the best we could find anyone with a seemly mount has sent it away and the ffreinc have already taken the rest the monk regarded the horse wearily it may not be much but trust me it is this or nothing worse than nothing bran grumbled snatching the halter rope from the monks hands he clambered up onto the beasts bony back tell the bishop i have gone i will send word from gwynedd with that he departed on his pathetic mount bran had never ridden a beast as slow and stumblefooted as the one he now sat atop the creature plodded along in the dying moonlight head down nose almost touching the ground despite brans most ardent insistence piteous begging and harrowing threats the animal refused to assume a pace swifter than a hoofdragging amble thus night was all but spent by the time bran came in sight of caer rhodl the fortress of merians father king cadwgan rising up out of the mists of the morning that would be tethering the plough horse to a rowan bush in a gully beside the track bran ran the rest of the way on foot he scaled the low wall at his customary place and dropped into the empty yard the caer was silent the watchmen as usual were asleep quick and silent as a shadow bran darted across the dark expanse of yard to the far corner of the house merians room was at the back its single small window opening onto the kitchen herb garden he crept along the side of the house until he came to her window and then pressing his ear to the rough wooden shutter paused to listen hearing nothing he pulled on the shutter it swung open easily and he paused again when nothing stirred inside he whispered merian and waited then whispered again slightly louder merian be quick this time his call was answered by the sound of a hushed footfall and the rustle of clothing in a moment merians face appeared in the window pale in the dim light you should not have come she said i wont let you innot tonight there was a battle he told her my father has been killedthe entire warband with him the ffreinc have taken elfael oh bran she gasped how did it happen they have a grant from king william they are taking everything but this is terrible she said are you hurt i was not in the battle he said but they are searching for me what are you going to do im leaving for gwyneddnow at once i have kinsmen there but i need a horse you want me to give you a horse merian shook her head i cannot i dare not my father would scream the roof down i will pay him said bran or find a way to return it please merian is there not some other way he raised a hand and squeezed her arm please merian youre the only one who can help me now he gazed at her in the glowing light of a rising sun and in spite of himself felt his desire quicken on a sudden inspiration he said i love you merian come with me we will go together you and ifar away from all of this bran think what youre saying she pulled free i cannot just run away nor can you leaning forward as far as the small window would allow she clutched at him listen to me bran you must go back it is the people of elfael who will need you now and in the days to come you will be king you must think of your people the ffreinc will kill me protested bran shh she said placing her fingertips to his lips someone will hear you i failed to pay the ransom bran explained speaking more softly if i go back to elfael emptyhanded theyll kill methey mean to kill me anyway i think the only reason im still alive is because they want the money first come she said making up her mind we must go to my father you must tell him what you have told me he will know what to do your father hates me bran rejected the idea outright no i am not going back elfael is lost i have to get away now while i still have a chance he raised a hand to stroke her cheek come with me merian we can be together bran listen be reasonable let my father help you will he give twenty marks to free me merian bit her lip doubtfully no sneered bran i thought not hed sooner see my head on a pike he will go with you and talk to them he stands in good stead with baron neufmarche the ffreinc will listen to him he will help you im leaving merian bran backed away from the window it was a mistake to come here just wait there she said and disappeared suddenly she was back an instant later here take this she said reaching out she dropped a small leather bag into his hand it chinked as he caught it it is not much she said but it is all i have i need a weapon he said tucking the bag away can you get me a sword or a spear both would be best let me see she darted away again and was gone longer this time bran waited the sky brightened the rising sun bathed his back with its warming rays it would be daylight before he could start out and that would mean finding a way north that avoided as much of elfael as possible he was pondering this when merian returned to the window i couldnt get a sword she said but i found this it belongs to my brother she pushed the polished ashwood shaft of a longbow out to him followed by a sheaf of arrows bran took the weapons thanked her coolly and stepped away from the window farewell merian he said raising a hand in parting please dont go reaching out she strained after him brushing his fingertips with her own think of your people bran she said her voice pleading they need you how can you help them in gwynedd i love you merian he said still backing away remember me bran no she called wait but he was already running for his life chapter by the time bran reached the stream separating the two cantrefs the sun was burning through the mist that swathed the forest to the east and collected in the hollows of the lowlands astride his slow horse he cursed his luck he had considered simply taking a horse from cadwgans stable but could not think how to do so without waking one of the stable hands and even if he had been able to achieve that adding the wrath of lord cadwgan to his woes was not a prospect to be warmly embraced the last thing he needed just now was an irate kings search party hot on his heels despite his slow pace he rode easily along the valley bottom through fields glistening with early morning dew the crops were ripe and soon the harvest season would be upon them long before the first scythe touched a barley stalk however bran would be far away beyond the forest and mountain fastness to the north enjoying the warmth and safety of a kinsmans hearth there were bran considered as he clopped along two ways to gwynedd through the cymraic heartland elfael straddled both and neither was very good the first and most direct way was straight across elfael to coed cadw and then through dense woodland all the way to the mountains they were not high mountains but they were rough broken crags of shattered stone and difficult to crossall the more so for a man alone and without adequate supplies the second route was less direct it meant skirting the southern border of elfael and working patiently through the intricate interlacing of low hills and hidden valleys to the west before turning north along the coast this second route was slower and passed uncomfortably close to caer cadarn before bending away to the west there was a risk that he might be seen still it kept him out of the treacherous mountain pathways and made best use of his mounts limited value as a steady plodder bran did not relish the idea of passing so close to the unfriendly ffreinc but it could not be helped he considered laying up somewhere and waiting until nightfall however the idea of trying to remain hidden under de braoses nose and then thrashing around the countryside in the dark lacked the allure of ready flight the day was new he reckoned and he would pass caer cadarn at the nearest point while it was still early morning and the invaders would most likely be otherwise occupied perhaps they were not even looking for him yet he reached the boundary stream but did not cross instead he turned his slow steed west and in the interest of keeping well out of sight of caer cadarn followed the narrow waterway as it snaked through the gorsy lowlands that formed the border between elfael and brycheiniog to the south in time the stream would swing around to the northwest entering maelienydd a region of rough hills and cramped valleys that he hoped to cross as quickly as possible then he would head for arwstli angling north all the while toward powys and so work his way cantref by cantref to gwynedd and a glad welcome amongst his mothers people bran was thinking about how distraught and outraged his kinsmen would be upon learning the news of his fathers cruel murder and the loss of elfael when the distant echo of a scream brought him up short he tried telling himself he had imagined it only and was halfway down the path toward believing that when the terrified shriek came again a womans voice carried on the breeze and though faint clearly signifying terrible distress bran halted listened again and then turned his mount in the direction of the cry he crossed the stream into the far southwestern toe of elfael over the nearest hill he saw the first threads of black smoke rising in the clear morning air he crested the hill and looked over into the valley on the other side where he saw the settlement called nant cwm a fairsized holding comprised of a large house and a yard with several barns and a few outbuildings even from a distance he could see that it was under attack smoke was spewing from the door of the barn and from the roof of the house there were five saddled horses in the yard between the house and barn but no riders then as bran watched a man burst from the front door of the house almost flying he ran a few steps his feet tangled then fell sprawling on his side right behind him came his attackerstwo ffreinc menatarms with drawn swords two more marchogi emerged from the house dragging a woman between them bran saw the hated ffreinc and his anger flared white hot in an instant snatching up the bow merian had given him he grabbed the sheaf of arrows and before he knew his feet had touched ground he was racing down the hill toward the settlement in the yard the farmer cried out throwing his hands before him clearly pleading for his life the two ffreinc standing over him raised their swords the woman screamed again struggling in the grasp of her captors the farmer shouted again and tried to rise bran saw the swords glint hard and bright in the sun as they slashed and fell the farmer writhed in a vain attempt to avoid the blows the fierce blades slashed again and the man lay still at the farmers death brans vision hardened to a single piercing beam and the world flashed crimson he bit his lip to keep from crying out his rage as he flew toward the fight as soon as he judged he was within the longbows range he squatted down and opened the cloth bundle there were but six arrows every arrow would have to count bran nocked the first onto the string pulled the feathered shaft close to his cheek and took aimhis target the nearer of the two soldiers struggling with the farmers wife just as he was about to let fly the farmhouse door opened and out of the burning building ran a young boy of perhaps six or seven summers one of the marchogi shouted and from around the far side of the house another ffreinc soldier appeared with a sword in one hand and the leash of an enormous hunting dog in the other this was the commandera knight with a round steel helmet and a long hauberk of ringed mail the knight saw the boy escaping across the yard and gave a shout when the child failed to stop he loosed the hound with staggering speed the snarling slavvering beast ran down the boy the mother screamed as the hound fully as big as her son closed on the fleeing child the hound leapt and the terrified boy stumbled bran let fly in the same instant the arrow whirred as it streaked home burying itself in the hounds slender neck even as the beasts jaws snatched at the childs unprotected throat the dog crumpled and rolled to the side teeth still gnashing forelegs raking the air as the whimpering boy climbed to his feet the ffreinc menatarms searched the surrounding hills for the source of the unexpected arrow the knight who had released the dog was the first to spot bran crouching on the hill above the settlement he shouted a command to his marchogi pointing toward the hillside with his sword he was still pointing when an arrowlike a weird feathered flowersprouted in the middle of his mailclad stomach the sword spun from his hand and the knight crashed to his knees clutching the shaft of the arrow he gave out a roar of pain and outrage and the two soldiers standing over the dead farmer leapt to life they charged at a run blades high across the yard and up the hill bran working with uncanny calm placed another arrow on the string took his time to pull hold and aim when he let fly the missile sang to its mark the first warrior was struck and spun completely around by the force of the arrow the second ran on a few more steps then halted abruptly jerked to his full height by the slender oak shaft that slammed into his chest next bran turned his attention to the two marchogi holding the woman no one was struggling now all three were staring in flatfooted disbelief at the lone archer crouching on the hillside by the time bran had another arrow on the string and was taking aim the two had released the woman and were running for the horses one of the marchogi had the presence of mind to try to cut off any possible pursuit he gathered the reins of the riderless horses leapt into the saddle and fled the slaughter ground bran raced down to the farmyard pausing at the foot of the hill to release another arrow he drew and loosed at the nearest of the two fleeing riders the arrow flew straight and true sizzling through the air to sink its sharp metal head deep between the shoulders of the ffreinc warrior who arched his back and flung his arms wide as if to embrace the sky the galloping horse ran on a few more steps and the warrior slumped sideways and plunged heavily to the ground brans last arrow streaked toward the sole remaining soldier as he gained the low rise at the far end of the yard lashing his mount hard the rider swerved at the last instant as the missile ripped by slashing through the tall grass the fleeing warrior sped on and did not look back bran hurried to the farmwife who was on her knees clutching her wailing son you must get away from here he told her urgency making him sharp they might come back in force the woman just stared at him you must go he insisted do you understand she nodded and still holding tight to her child turned her tearful gaze back to the yard where her husband lay bran saw the look and relented he allowed her a moment and then took her gently by the shoulder and turned her to face him they will come back he said softening his tone you must get away while you can i have no place to go cried the woman turning again to the twisted bloody body of her dead husband oh gyredd her face crumpled and she began to weep lady you will mourn him in good time bran said but later when you are safe you must think of your child now and do what is best for him taking the crying boy into his arms he walked quickly to the horse on the hill urging the woman to hurry its rider slain the animal had stopped running and was now grazing contentedly if he considered taking the good horse for himself and giving the plough horse to the farmwife one look at the woman struggling valiantly to bear up under the calamity that had befallen her abolished any such thought here was a woman with a boy so much like himself at that age they could have been brothers here is what you will do bran said speaking slowly you will take the lad and ride to the abbey the monks at saint dyfrigs will take care of you until it is safe to return or until you find somewhere else to go he helped her onto the horse holding the boy as she limbed into the saddle go now he commanded lifting the child and placing him in the saddle in front of his mother tell them what happened here and they will take care of you putting his hand to the bridle bran ran the horse to the top of the rise where he could get a clear view of the countryside around there were no marchogi to be seen so he pointed the woman in the direction of the monastery take good care of your mother lad he told the boy then gave the horse a slap on the rump to send them off do not stop until you reach the abbey he called i will see to things here god bless you said the woman turning in the saddle as the horse jolted into motion bran watched until they were well away and then hurried back to the farm he dragged the dead farmer to the grassy hillside then fetched a wooden shovel from the barn the fire had been hastily set and the flames had already burned down to smouldering ash leaving the barn intact working quickly he dug a shallow grave in the green grass at the foot of the hill then rolled the body into the long depression and began piling the soft earth over the corpse he left the shovel at the head of the grave to mark the place and then ran to retrieve his arrows pulling them from the bodies was a grim task but they were too valuable to waste and he had no way to replace them despite his care one of them broke when he tried to worry it free from the rib cage of the dead soldier and the one that had missed its target could not be found in the end he had to settle for recovering but four of the six he wiped the iron heads on the grass bundled them up again and then hurried to retrieve his shamblefooted mount grabbing a handful of mane he swung up onto the swaybacked creature once more and with much kicking and cursing clopped away he did not get far upon reaching the top of the hill he glanced back toward the settlement at that moment five marchogi on horseback crested the rise beyond nant cwm the riders paused as if searching out a direction to follow bran halted and sat very still hoping they would not see him this hope like all the others he had conceived since the ffreinc arrived died as it was born even as he watched one of the riders raised an arm and pointed in his direction bran did not wait to see more he slapped the reins hard across the withers of his plough horse mount and kicked back hard with his heels the startled animal responded with a gratifying burst of speed that carried him over the crest of the hill and out of sight of the riders once over the hilltop the nag slowed and stopped and bran swiftly scanned the descent for his best chance of escape the slope fell away steeply to the stream he had been following on the other side the land opened onto a meadow grazing landflat and bereft of any rock or tree big enough to hide behind away to the northeast rose the thick dark line of coed cadw he turned his face to the north kicked his mount to life once more and rode for the strong protecting wall of the forest chapter the ancient woodland rampart rose before him in vast dark folds like a great bristling pelt covering the deep rocky roots of yr wyddfa the region of snows in the north his rickety mount trotted along at a pace resembling a canter and still some distance away from the nearest trees bran despaired of reaching them before his galloping pursuers overtook him midway between himself and the forest a course of rock jutted up out of the mounded earth forming a narrow spine of stone that ran all the way to the forest tiring quickly now his slowfooted animal resumed its customary amble bran slung the bow across his chest and gripping his clutch of arrows slid off the beasts back and sent it on as it sauntered away without him he bounded to the rocky outcrop and ducked behind it he knew the marchogi would not follow a riderless horse and the lazy animal would not wander far but he hoped the slight misdirection would distract them at least long enough to allow him to reach the shelter of the forest once amongst the trees he had no doubt at all that he could elude pursuit without difficulty the forest was a place he knew well crouching low to keep his head below the jagged line of rock bran worked his way quickly up the rising slope toward the tree line pausing now and again to scan the open ground behind him he saw no sign of the marchogi and took heart perhaps they had given up the chase and returned to pillage the farm instead the last few hundred paces rose up a steep embankment at the top of which lay the forest edge bran paused and gathered himself for the last mad scramble gulping air he tried to calm his racing heart as with a final glance behind him he ran to the escarpment it took longer than he thought to reach it but clambering over the grey lichencovered rocks on hands and knees he eventually gained the top pulling himself up the last rise with his hands and gripping the arrow bundle with his teeth the trees lay just ahead he put his head down and staggered on he had taken but a halfdozen steps when a ffreinc rider appeared from the edge of the forest and stepped directly into his path bran did not have time even to raise his bow before the warrior was on him sword drawn the soldier spoke a command that bran could not understand and indicated that bran was to turn around and start back the way he had come instead bran ran toward him dove under the belly of the horse and legs churning continued running the rider gave a shout and put spurs to his mount bran flew to the forest this first rider cried after him and his shout was answered by another a second rider appeared racing along the margin of the forest to cut off brans flight before he could reach the wood desperation lent him speed he gained the entrance to the dark refuge of coed cadw as two more riders joined the chase the rippling thud of the horses hooves thrummed on the turf punctuated by gusting blasts of air through the galloping animals nostrils on the riders came whooping and shouting as they converged on his trail readying their spears as if he were a deer for the kill they were loud and they were overconfident and they had not enough wit to know to quit the saddle before entering the wood realising this bran stopped dead on the trail and turned to face his attacker the oncoming rider gave out a wild shriek of triumph and heaved his lance bran saw the spearhead spin as the lance left the riders hand he gave a simple feint to the side and the spear sliced the air where his head had been the rider cursed and came on drawing his sword whirling around bran retrieved the spear and turning back knelt and planted the butt of the shaft in the ground as the charger sped forwardtoo fast to elude the trap unable to stop the hapless animal ran onto the blade with a scream of agony the horse plunged on a few more strides before it became tangled in the undergrowth and went down in a heap of flailing hooves and thrashing legs the rider was thrown over the neck of his mount and landed on hands and knees bran rushed to the stunned knight ripped the knife from his belt and with a shriek like the cry of a banshee plunged the blade into the exposed flesh of the mans neck between his helmet and mail shirt the knight struggled to his knees clawing at the blade as bran ran for the shelter of the trees a few strides into the wood the main trail split into several smaller paths fanning out into the tangle of trees and undergrowth bran chose one that passed between two closegrown treeswide enough to admit him but narrow enough to hinder a rider his feet were already on the path and he was through the gap when the second rider reached the place he heard a frustrated shout behind him and the tormented whinny of a horse bran glanced back to see that the rider had halted because his mount was tangled in the branches of a lowlying bramble thicket and the warrior was having difficulty extricating himself unslinging his bow bran shook the arrows from the bundle and snatched one from the ground he pressed the bow forward took aim and let fly the missile sped through the trees and took the rider in the chest just below the collarbone the force of the impact slammed the warrior backward in the saddle but he kept his seat bran sent a second arrow after the first it flew wide of the mark by a mere hairsbreadth he had two arrows left he bent down to snatch them up and as he straightened he glimpsed a blur of movement out of the corner of his eye the spear sped through the air bran tried to leap aside but the steeltipped length of ash was expertly thrown and the blade caught him midstride striking high on the right shoulder the force of the throw knocked him off his feet and sent him sprawling forward bran fell hard and heard something snap beneath him he had landed on the arrows breaking one of the slender shafts in the fall one arrow left gasping for breath he rolled onto his side and the spear came free the rider drove in fast behind his throw sword drawn and raised high ready to part brans head from his shoulders bran crouching in the path picked up the bow and the last arrow he nocked the shaft to the string pressing the longbow forward in the same swift motion the wound in his shoulder erupted with a ferocious agony bran gasped aloud his body convulsed and his fingers released their grip on the string the arrow scudded off along the trail to no effect he threw down the bow picked up the ffreinc lance that had wounded him and stumbled from the path pushing deeper into the wood the coarse shouts of his attackers grew louder and more urgent as they ordered their pursuit the branches were now too close grown and tangled the trail too narrow for men on horseback bran sensed the marchogi were dismounting they would continue the chase on foot using their momentary inattention he turned off the trail and dove into the undergrowth moving as quickly and quietly as possible he slipped through the crowded ranks of slender young hazel and beech trees scrambling over the fallen trunks of far older elms until he came to another wider path he paused to listen the voices of his pursuers reached him from the trail he had left behind soon they would realise their quarry was no longer on the path they pursued when that happened they would spread out and begin a slower more careful search he put his hand to his injured shoulder and probed the wound with his fingers the ache was fierce and fiery and blood was trickling down his back in a sticky rivulet it would be best to find some way to bind the wound lest one of the pursuers see the blood and pick up his trail that way luckily he thought with grim satisfaction the marchogi no longer had a dog with them as if in answer to this thought there came a sound that turned his bowels to water the hoarse baying of a hound on scent it was still some way off but once the animal reached the trailhead the hunt would be all but finished turning away bran lurched on following the path as it twisted and turned pressing ever deeper into the wood he ran listening to the cry of the hound grow louder by degrees keenly alert for something anything that might throw the beast off his scent then all at once the sound ended the forest went quiet bran stopped his shoulder was aflame and cold sweat beaded on his brow he waited drawing air deep into his lungs trying to steady his racing heart suddenly the hound gave out a long rising howl that was followed instantly by a shout from one of the soldiers the dog had found his trail again bran staggered forward once more he knew he could not long elude his pursuers nowa few moments more or less and the chase would end and then just ahead he spied a low opening in the brush and beneath it dark wellchurned earth the telltale sign of a run used by wild pigs he dove for it and scrambled forward on hands and knees dragging the spear with him his pursuers were still on the trail he had just quit he drove himself on wriggling through the undergrowth around rocks and over roots lowhanging branches tore at him snagging his clothing and skin the hound reached the end of the pig run and hesitated at first the marchogi assumed the dog had been distracted by the scent of the pigs there was a shout and a yelp as they dragged the dog away from the entrance to the run and moved on down the trail bran gathered himself for another push pulling himself up by the shaft of the spear he lurched aheadfour heartbeats later the hound loosed another rising howl and the chase resumed behind him gritting his teeth against the pain bran ran on above the crashing and thrashing in the wood behind him he heard something else the liquid murmur of falling water bran followed the sound and in a moment came to a small boulderstrewn clearing a swiftflowing stream cut through its centre coursing around the base of the huge round mosscovered stones bran picked his way amongst the rocks only to find that the path ended in a sheer drop the stream plunged into a pool beneath the stony ledge on which bran was standing the waters gathered in the pool and then flowed away into the hidden heart of coed cadw bran gazed at the pool and realised that like the path his flight had ended too with his back to the waterfall he turned to make his last stand his breath came in shaky gasps sweat flowed down his face and neck the shaft of the spear was slick with his blood he wiped his hands on his clothes and tightened his grip on the spear as the marchogi approached their voices loud in the silence of the forest they reached the clearing all at oncethe hound and three menbursting into the glade in a blind rush two soldiers held spears and the third grasped the leash of the hound the dog saw bran and began straining at its lead snarling with slavering fury and clawing the air to reach him the soldiers hesitated uncertain where they were bran saw the cast of their eyes as they took in the rocks the waterfall and then himself standing perfectly still on a stone above the fall the dog handler shouted to the others the knight on his left raised his spear and drew back his arm bran readied himself to dodge the throw there came a shout and a fourth man entered the rockfilled hollow behind the others he wielded a sword and the front of his hauberk was stained with blood from the arrow wound beneath his collarbone he made a motion with his hand and the marchogi under his command spread out bran tightened his grip on the spear and braced himself for the attack the man with the sword raised his hand but before he could give the signal there was a sharp snap like that of a slap in the face the hound suddenly and unexpectedly free of its broken leash bounded toward bran its jaws agape bran turned to meet the hound one of the soldiers seeing bran move launched his spear both dog and spear reached bran at the same time bran jerked his body to the side the spear sailed harmlessly by but the jaws of the hound closed on his arm bran dropped his spear and threw his free arm around the neck of the dog trying to strangle the animal as its teeth ripped into the skin and tendons of his arm two more spears were already in the air the first found its mark passing through the dog and striking bran the hound gave out a yelp and bran felt a wicked sting in the centre of his chest wounded his vision suddenly blurred with the pain bran fought to keep his balance on the rock ledge too late he saw the glint in the air of a spear streaking toward him thrown high it missed his throat but sliced through the soft part of his cheek as it grazed along his jaw the jolt rocked him backward he teetered on the ledge for an instant and then still clasping the dying dog like a shield before his body he plunged over the waterfall and into the pool below the last thing he saw was the face of one of his attackers peering cautiously over the edge of the fall then bran closed his eyes and let the stream bear him away part two in coed cadw chapter lrian took the news of brans death hardmuch harder than she herself might have predicted had she ever dreamed such a possibility could occur true she heartily resented bran ap brychan for running away and deserting his people in their time of need she might have forgiven him all else if not for that on the other hand she knew him to be a selfish reckless manipulating rascal thus though utterly irritated and angry with him she had not been at all surprised by his decision to flee she told herself that she would never see him again even so never in her most resentful disposition did she conceivemuch less wishthat any harm would come to him that he had been caught and killed trying to escape filled her with morbid anguish the newsreported by her fathers steward and overheard by her as he related the latest marketplace gossip to the cook and scullery girlshit her like a blow to the stomach unable to breathe she sagged against the doorpost and stifled a cry with her fist sometime later when summoned to her fathers chamber where she was informed she was able to bear up without betraying the true depth of her feelings shocked horrified mournful and leaden with sorrow merian moved through the first awful day feeling as if the ground she trod was no longer solid beneath her feetas if the very earth was fragile delicate and thin as the shell of a robins egg and as if any moment the crust on which she stood might shatter and she would instantly plunge from the world of light and air into the utter perpetual suffocating darkness of the tomb soon everyone in king cadwgans court was talking of nothing else but brans sad but really onlytoopredictable demise that was harder still for merian she put on a brave face she tried to appear as if the news of bran and the misfortune that had befallen elfael meant little to her or rather that it meant merely as much as bad news from other places ever meant to anyone not directly concernedas if lamentable though it surely was the fate of the wayward son of a neighbouring king ultimately was nothing to do with her yes she would agree isnt it awful those poor peoplewhat will they do she told herself time and again that bran had been an unreliable friend at best that his apparent interest in her was nothing more than carnal which was entirely true and that his sad death had at the very least delivered her from a life of profound and perpetual unhappiness these things and more she told herselfspoke them aloud even but no matter how often she rehearsed the reasons she should be relieved to be free of bran ap brychan she could not make herself believe them nor for all the truth of her assertions could she make herself feel less wretched she kept a tight rein on herself when others were nearby she neither wept nor sobbed not one sorrowing sigh escaped her lips her features remained composed thoughtful perhaps but not distraught less yet griefstricken anyone observing merian might have thought her distracted or concerned knowing that nothing good could come of any overt display of emotion where bran was concerned she swallowed her grief and behaved as if the news of brans death was a thing of negligible significance amidst the more troubling news of the murder of brychan ap tewdwr and all his warband and the unwarranted ffreinc advance into neighbouring elfael here if only here she and her stern father agreed the ffreinc had no right to kill a sitting king and seize his cantre it is a bad business king cadwgan told her shaking his grey head very bad it should not have happened and william rufus should answer but brychan had been warned more than once to make his peace i urged him to go to lundein long ago years ago we all did would he listen he was a hellbent bloodyminded fool father merian objected it is beneath you to speak ill of the dead and bad luck besides beneath me wondered cadwgan daughter it is kindness itself i knew the man and of times would have called him my friend you know that on saint becumas knees i swear that man could be so maddeningly pigheadedand mean with it if there was ever a man with a colder heart i dont want to know him he raised an admonishing finger to his daughter mark my words girl now that brychan and his reprobate son are gone we will soon count it a blessing in disguise father she protested once more her voice quivering slightly you should not say such things if i speak my mind it is not out of malice you know me better than that i hope though we may not like it that is gods own truth brychans son was a rogue and his death saved a hangmans fee i will not stay and listen to this declared merian as she turned quickly and hurried away what did i say called her father after her if anyone has cause to mourn bran ap brychans death it is the hangman who was cheated out of his pay merians mother was more sympathetic but no more comforting i know it is hard to accept said queen anora threading her embroidery needle when someone you know has died he was such a handsome boyif only he had been better brought up he might have made a good king alas his mother died so young rhian was a beauty and kindness itselfif a little flighty so they say still its a pity she was not there to raise him she sighed then went back to her needle you can thank god you were not allowed to receive him in company i know mother said merian glumly turning her face away how well i know soon you will forget all about him she offered her daughter a hopeful smile time will heal and the hurt will pass mark my words the pain will pass merian knew her parents were right though she would not have expressed her opinions quite so harshly even so she could not make her heart believe the things they said it went on aching and nothing anyone said soothed the pain in the end merian determined to keep her thoughts like her grief to herself each day she went about her chores as if the raw wound of sorrow was already skinning over she attended her weaving with care and patience she helped the women prepare the animal skins that would become furs to adorn winter cloaks and tunics she stood barefoot in the warm sun and raked the newly harvested beans over the drying floor she twirled the spindle between her deft fingers to spin newcarded wool into thread watching the skein grow as she wound it round and round though she laboured with diligence she did not feel the thread pass through her fingertips nor the rake in her hands she did not smell the strong curing salts she rubbed into the skins her fingers gathered the wool of their own accord without her guidance each day she completed her duties with her usual careas if the thought of bran hunted down and speared to death like some poor fearcrazed animal was not the sole occupation of her thoughts as if the anguish at his passing was not continually churning in her gentle heart and if each night she cried silently in her bed each morning she rose fresh faced and resolved not to allow any of these secret feelings to manifest themselves in word or deed in this she made good as the weeks passed she thought less about bran and his miserable death and more about the fate of his leaderless people of course they were not as garran her elder brother so helpfully pointed outleaderless they have a new king nowwilliam rufus he told her and his subject lord count de braose is their ruler de braose is a vile murderer merian snapped that may be garran granted with irritating magnanimity but he has been given the conimot by the king and he delighted in pointing out the crown is divinely appointed by god the king is justice and his word is law the king is himself a usurper she countered as were most of those before him replied her brother smug in his argument facts are facts dear sister the saxon stole the land from us and now the ffreinc have stolen it from them we possess what we hold by king williams sufferance he is our sovereign lord now and it is no good wishing otherwise so you had best make peace with how things are you make peace with how things are she answered haughtily i will remain true to our own kind then you will continue to live in the past garran scoffed the old ways are over for us times are changing merian the ffreinc are showing us the way to peace and prosperity they are showing us the way to hell she shouted storming from his presence that young prince bran had died needlessly was bad enough that he had been killed trying to flee was shameful yes but anyone might have done the same in his place what she found impossible to comprehend or accept was her brothers implied assertion that their norman overlords were somehow justified in their crime by the innate superiority of their customs or character or whatever it was her brother found so enamouring the ffreinc are brutes and they are wrong she insisted to herself and that king william of theirs is the biggest brute of all after that last exchange she refused to talk to anyone further regarding the tragedy that had befallen bran and elfael she kept her thoughts to herself and buried her feelings deep in the fastness of her heart chapter is baron de neufmarche along with twenty menatarms accompanied his wife to the ship waiting at hamtun docks although he had used the ship le cygne in the past and knew both the captain and pilot by name he nevertheless inspected the vessel bow to stern before allowing his wife to board he supervised the loading of men horses provisions and weaponshis wife would travel with ormand his seneschal and a guard of seven men inside a small casket made of elm wood lady agnes carried the letter he had written to his father and the gift of a gold buckle received from the conqueror himself in recognition of the barons loyalty during the season of northern discontent in the years following the invasion once agnes was established in her quarters beneath the ships main deck the baron bade his wife farewell the tide is on the rise godspeed lady wife he said raising her hand to his lips he kissed her cold fingers and added i wish you a mild and pleasant winter and a glad christmas it may be that i can return before the snow she ventured hope lending a lightness to her voice we could observe christmas together nobernard shook his head firmlyit is far too dangerous winter gales make the sea treacherous if anything should happen to you i could not forgive myself he smiled enjoy your sojourn at homeit is brief enough time will pass swiftly and we will celebrate the success of your undertaking with the addition of a new estate tres bien replied lady agnes have a care for yourself my husband she leaned close and put her lips against his cheek until we meet again adieu mon cheri the pilot called down from the deck above that the tide was beginning to run the baron kissed his wife once more and returned to the wharf a short time later the tide had risen sufficiently to put out to sea the captain called for a crewman to cast off the ropes were loosed and the ship pushed on poles away from the dock once in the centre of the river the vessel was caught by the current turned and headed out into the estuary and the unprotected sea beyond bernard watched all this from the wooden dock only when the ship raised sail and cleared the headland at the wide river mouth did he return to his waiting horse and give the order to start for home the journey took two days and by the time he reached his westernmost castle at hereford he had decided to make a sortie into welsh territory into the cantref of brycheiniog to see what he could learn of the land he meant to possess ran no longer knew how long he had been dragging his wounded body through the underbrush whole days passed in blind ing flashes of pain and shuddering sickness he could feel his strength departing his lucid times growing fewer and further apart he could no longer count on his senses to steer him aright he heard the voices of people who were not there and often what he saw before him was on nearer examination mere phantasm following his plunge into the pool he had been swept downstream a fair distance the current carried him along highsided banks overhung with leafless branches and great mosscovered limbs deeper and ever deeper into the forest until finally washing him into the shallows of a green pool surrounded by the wrecks of enormous trees the boles of which had toppled and fallen over one another like the colossal pillars of a desolated temple the warm shallow water revived him and he opened his eyes to find himself surrounded by halfsunk waterlogged trunks and broken boughs green slime formed a thick sludge on the surface of the pool and the air was rank with the stench of fetid stagnant water and decay and black with shifting clouds of mayflies bran struggled upright and on hands and knees hauled himself over a sunken log and into the soft soggy embrace of a peat bog where he collapsed a quivering painwracked lump evening was fast upon him when he had finally roused himself that first day and aching in every joint and muscle gathered his feet beneath him and climbed up on unsteady legs following a deer trail he lurched like a halfdrowned creature from the swamp and staggered into the haven of the greenwood his chief concern that first night was finding shelter where he could rest and bind his wounds he did not know how badly he was injuredonly that he was alive and grateful to be so once he found shelter he would remove his tunic and see what he could do to bandage himself after he had rested and regained his strength he would make his way to the nearest habitation and secure the aid of his fellow cymry to continue his flight to safe haven in the north as twilight cast a purple gloom over the forest at the end of that first day bran found a great oak with a hollowedout cavity down in the earth beneath the roots the place had been used by a bear or badger the earthy musk of the creature still lingered in the cavity but the hole was dry and warm and bran fell asleep the moment he lay down his head he woke with a burning thirst and lightheaded from hunger his wounds throbbed and his muscles were stiff there was nothing for his hunger but he could hear the soft burble of a brook nearby and easing himself upright he made his unsteady way to the mosscarpeted bank he knelt and with some difficulty because of the cut that ran along the side of his face stretching from cheekbone to ear cupped water to his mouth the inside of his cheek was as raw as sliced meat and his tongue traced an undulating line like a thick bloodsoaked string the cold water made the inside of his mouth sting and brought tears to his eyes but he quenched his thirst as best he could and then carefully removed his tunic and mantle to better assess his injuries he could not see the cut in his upper back but by reaching around cautiously he was able to feel that it had stopped bleeding the deep rent in his chest was easier to examine caked with dried blood that he gently washed away the cut was ragged and ratty the skin puckered along the edges the wound ached with a persistent throb the bones had been nicked when the blade forced his ribs apart but he did not think any had been broken lastly he examined the bite on his arm the limb was tenderthe hounds teeth had broken the skin nothing worsethe flesh swollen and sore but the ragged half circle of raised red puncture wounds did not seem to be festering he bathed his arm in the brook and washed the dried blood from his chest and stomach he tried to bathe the spear cut on his upper back but succeeded only in dribbling water over his shoulders and making himself cold he drew on his clothes and contemplated the choices before him so far as he could see he had but two courses return to elfael and try to find someone to take him in or continue on to gwynedd and hope to find help somewhere along the way before he reached the mountains the land to the north was rough and inhospitable to a man alone even if he had the great good fortune of making it through the forest unaided the chances of finding help were remote elfael on the other hand was very nearly deserted most of his countrymen had fled and the ffreinc were seeking his blood it came to him that he could do no better than try to take his own advice and go to saint dyfrigs to seek sanctuary with the monks the decision was easily made and he gathered what strength he could muster and set out with any luck he allowed himself to think days end would find him behind friendly walls resting in the guest lodge brans luck had so far proved as irksomely elusive as the trail it served him no better now the forest pathways crossed one another in bewildering profusion each one leading on to othersover and under fallen trunks down steep grades into rills and narrow defiles up sharpangled ridges and scrubcovered hillsides hunger had long since become a constant gnawing pain in his stomach he could drink from the streams and brooks he encountered but nourishing food was scarce there were mushrooms in extravagant overabundance but most he knew were poisonous and he did not trust himself to recognise the good ones finding nothing else he chewed hazel twigs just to have something in his mouth hungry painriddled he allowed his mind to wander he imagined himself received into the safety of the abbey and wel comed to a dinner of roast lamb braised leeks and oat bread and ale this comforting dream awakened a ferocious appetite that refused to subsideeven when he tried to appease it with sour blackberries gobbled by the purple handful from a bramble bush in his haste he bit the inside of his cheek breaking open the wound afresh and driving him to his knees in agony he lay for a long time on the ground rocking back and forth in misery until he became aware that he was being watched what asked a voice somewhere above him what raising his eyes bran saw a big black rook on a branch directly over his head the bird regarded him with a shiny bead of an eye what he dimly remembered a story about a starving prophet fed by crows bring me bread what asked the bird stretching its wings bread bran said his voice a breathless groan bring me some bread the rook cocked its head to one side what stupid bird angered by the rooks refusal to aid in his revival bran dragged himself to his feet once more the bird started at the movement it flew off shrieking its cry of die die echoing through the wood bran looked around and realised with a sinking heart that he had dreamed most of the day away he moved on then dejected and afraid to trust his increasingly unreliable judgement the wounds to his chest and back throbbed with every step and were hot to the touch as daylight deteriorated around him his steps slowed to an exhausted shuffle hunger burned like a flame in his gut and it hurt his chest to breathe the long day ended leaving him worse off than when it had begun and night closed over him like a fist he closed his eyes beneath the limbs of a sheltering elm and spent an uncomfortable night on the ground when he rose again the next morning he was just as weary as when he lay down climbing to his feet on that second day he felt fear circling him like a preying beast he remembered thinking that if he did not find a trail out of the wood this day might be his last that was when he had decided to follow the next stream he found thinking that it would eventually lead to the river that ran through the middle of elfael this he did and at first it seemed his determination would be rewarded for the forest thinned and he glimpsed open sky ahead closer he saw sunlight on green grass and imagined the valley spreading beyond he limped toward the place and as he passed the last trees stepped out into a wide meadowat the centre of which was a shimmering pool dragonflies flitted around the waters edge and larks soared high above the stream he had been following emptied itself into the pool and so far as he could tell did not emerge again it had taken him the better part of two days to reach another dead end and now as he gazed around him he knew his strength was gone hope crushed to a cold cinder bran staggered stiff legged through the long grass to stand gazing down into the water too tired to do anything but stand after a time he lowered himself painfully down to kneel at the waters edge drank a few mouthfuls then sat down beside the pool he would rest a little before moving on he fell back in the grass and closed his eyes giving way to the fatigue that paralysed him when he woke again it was dark the moon was high above a line of clouds moving in from the northwest exhausted still he closed his eyes and went back to sleep it rained before morning but bran did not rise and that was how the old woman found him the next day she hobbled from the forest on her stout legs and stood for a long time contemplating the wreck of him dost thou ever seek half measures she asked glancing skyward whether tis meet or ill i know not but heavy was the hand that broke this reed she paused as if listening oh aye she muttered aye and ever aye your servant obeys with that she removed the motheaten rag that was her cloak and placed it over the wounded man then she retreated to the forest the way she had come it was midday before she returned leading two ragged men pulling a handcart she directed them to the place where she had found the unconscious young man he was where she left him still covered by her cloak we could dig a grave suggested one of the men upon observing the wounded strangers pale bloodless flesh i do believe twould be a mercy nay nay she said take him to my hearth he needs more than hearth care observed the man scratching a bristly jaw this un needs holy unction go to cynvar the old woman replied if thou wouldst but stir thyself to actionand yon stump with theeshe indicated the second man still standing beside the cart methinks we mayest yet hold deaths angel at bay you know best hudolion replied the man he motioned to his fellow and the two lifted the stranger into the cart the movement caused the wounded man to moan softly but he did not waken gently gently chided the old woman i have work enough without thee breaking his bones she laid a wrinkled hand against the pale young strangers wounded cheek and then touched two fingers to his cold brow peace beloved she crooned in my grasp i hold thee and i will not let thee go turning to the men once more she said grows the grass beneath thy feet about thy business lads be quick chapter count falkes de braose anticipated the arrival of his cousin with all the fret and ferment of a maid awaiting a suitor he could not remain seated for more than a few moments at a time before he leapt to his feet and ran to inspect some detail he had already seen and approved twice over ill at ease in his own skin he started at every stray sound and each new apprehension caused his heart to sink what if earl philip arrived late what if he met trouble on the way what if he did not arrive at all he fussed over the furnishings of his new stronghold were they adequate were they too spare would he be considered niggardlyor worse yet a spendthrift he worried about the preparation of the feast was the fare sumptuous enough was the wine palatable was the meat well seasoned was the bread too hard the soup too thin the ale too sweet or too sour how many men would come with philip how long would they stay when these and all the other worries overwhelmed him he grew resentful of the torment what cause did philip have to be angry with him after all he had taken elfael with but a bare handful of casualties most of the footmen had not even used their weapons his first campaign and it was an absolute triumph what more could anyone ask by the time philip earl of gloucester arrived with his retinue late in the day falkes was limp with nervous exhaustion cousin boomed philip striding across the pennonfestooned yard of caer cadarn he was a tall longlegged man with dark hair and an expanding bald spot that he kept hidden beneath a cap trimmed in marten fur his riding gauntlets were trimmed in the same fur as were the tops of his boots it is good to see you i do declare it how long has it been three years four welcome uttered falkes in a strangled cry he loped across the yard with unsteady strides i pray you had an uneventful journeypeaceful that is it was gods grace it was answered philip pulling his kinsman into a rough embrace but you noware you well he cast a quizzical eye over his younger cousin you seem pale and fevered it is nothingan ague born of anticipationit will pass falkes turned and flapped a hand in the vague direction of the hall valroix palace it is not he apologised but consider it yours for as long as you desire to stay philip cast a dubious glance at the crude timber structure well so long as it keeps the rain off i am satisfied then come let us share the welcome cup and you can tell me how things stand at court falkes started across the yard then remembered himself and stopped how is uncle is he well it is a shame he could not accompany you i should like to properly thank him for entrusting the settlement of his newest commot to me father is well and he is pleased never fear replied philip de braose removing his gauntlets he tucked them in his belt he would have liked nothing better than to accompany me but the king has come to rely on him so that he will not abide the baron to remain out of sight for more than a day or two before calling him to attendance nevertheless the baron has instructed me to bring him a full account of your deeds and acquisitions bien sur you shall have it said falkes nervousness making his voice a little too loud turning to the knights and menatarms in philips company he called messires you are most welcome here quarters have been arranged and a feast has been prepared for your arrival but first it would please me if you would join me in raising a cup of wine he then led his guests into the great hall the walls of which had been newly washed until they gleamed as white as the seven maidens fresh green rushes had been strewn over the sandscoured wooden floor permeating the enormous room with a clean scent of mown hay a great heap of logs was blazing on the hearth at one end of the room where on an iron spit half an ox was slowly roasting the juices sizzling in a pan snugged in the glowing coals several boardandtrestle tables had been erected draped in cloths and decked with fir branches as the men settled on the long benches the steward and his serving boys filled an assortment of vessels with wine drawn from a tun brought from aquitaine when each of the guests was in possession of a cup their host raised his chalice and called my friends let us drink to king william and his continued good health long may he reign king william they all cried and downed the first of many such cups that night with the men thus fortified the celebration soon turned into a revel and count falkess anxiety slowly gave way to a pleasant wineinduced contentment cousin philip seemed happy with his efforts and would certainly return to his uncle with a good report as the evening wore on falkes became more and more the jovial host urging his guests to eat and drink their fill and when they had done so he invited his own men and some of their wives to join the festivities those who knew how to play music brought their instruments and there was singing and dancing which filled the hall and lasted far into the night accordingly it was not until late the next day that falkes and philip found opportunity to sit down together you have done well cousin philip asserted father always said that elfael was a plum ripe for the plucking how right he was agreed falkes readily i hope you will tell him how grateful i am for his confidence i look forward to an early demonstration of my loyalty and thanks rest assured i will tell him know you he has charged me to convey a secretall being well i hope you think it so said falkes it could not be better replied philip therefore i am eager to inform you that the baron intends to make elfael his staging ground for the conquest of the territories which territories wondered falkes selyf maelienydd and buellt three commots falkes exclaimed that is ambitious falkes had no idea his uncle entertained such farreaching plans but then with the endorsement of the king what was to prevent baron de braose from laying claim to the whole of wales ambitious to be sure avowed philip pleasantly my father is intent and he is determined moreover he has the fortune to make it possible i would never doubt it good replied philip as if a knotty issue had been decided to this end the baron requires you to undertake a survey of the land to be completed before spring before spring repeated falkes struggling to keep up but we have only just begun to establish zut said philip brushing aside his objection before it could be spoken aloud the baron will send his own men to perform the survey you need only aid them with an appropriate guard to ensure their safety while they work i see the pale count nodded thoughtfully and what is this survey to determine the baron requires three castles to be builtone on the border to the north one south and one weston sites best suited for controlling the territories beyond each of those borders this the surveyors will determine three castles mused falkes stroking his thin silky beard the cost of such an undertaking would be staggering he hoped he would not be expected to help pay for the project philip seeing the shadow of apprehension flit across his cousins face quickly explained you will appreciate he continued that the building will be funded out of the barons own treasury falkes breathed easier for the reassurance what about the people of elfael he wondered what about them i assume they will be required to supply ready labour of coursewe must have workers in sufficient number they may resist i dont see how they can declared philip you said the king and his son have already been removed along with their menatarms if you were to encounter any meaningful resistance you would certainly have done so by now whatever opposition we meet from here on will be easily overcome despite his cousins effortless assurance falkes remained sceptical he had no clear idea how many of the original inhabitants remained in elfael most seemed to have fled but it was difficult to determine their numbers for even in the best of times they rarely stayed in one place preferring to wander here and there as the whim took them much like the cattle they raised and which formed their chief livelihood be that as it may those few who remained in the scattered farms and steadings were certain to have something to say about invaders taking their property even if it was mostly grazing land you can tell your father my uncle that he will find everything in good order by next spring god willing in the meantime i will await the arrival of the surveyorsand what is more i will accompany them personally to see that all is carried out according to the barons wishes they talked of the work to be done the materials to be obtained the number of men who would be needed and so on in all that followed count falkes paid most stringent attentionespecially when it came to the labourers who would be required it was common practise amongst the ffreinc to entice the local population of conquered lands to help with construction work for a little pay parcels of land or promises of preferential dealings an ample workforce could often be gathered from the immediate area the custom had been applied to rousing effect amongst the saxons this is how the conqueror and his barons had accomplished so much so quickly in the subjugation and domination of england there was no reason why the same practise should not also work in wales the prospect of ready silver went a long way toward slaking any lingering thirst for rebellion often those who shouted the loudest about rising up against the invaders were the same ones who profited most handily from the invasion god knows baron de braoses renowned treasury had won more battles than his soldiers and could be relied upon to do so again and as everyone knew the welsh for all their prideful bluster were just as greedy for gain as the most grasping lackland saxon it was with this in mind that the two kinsmen rode out the following day to view the commot philip wanted to get a better idea of the region and see firsthand the land that had so quickly fallen under their control the day began well with a high bright sky and a fresh breeze pushing low clouds out of the west autumn was advancing everywhere the land was slumping down toward its winter rest the leaves on the trees had turned and were flying from the branches like golden birds across a pale blue sky away in the distance always in the distance defining the boundary of the commot towered the greenblack wall of the forest looming like a line of clouds dark and turbulent heralding the advance of a coming storm the two noblemen each accompanied by a knight and three menatarms rode easily together through the valley and across the rolling hills they passed by the little monastery at llanelli and paused to examine the setting of the place and the construction of the various buildings before riding on they also visited one of elfaels few farflung settlements cradled amongst the branching valleys this one huddled in the wind shadow of the areas highest hill consisted of a house and barn a granary and a coop for chickens it like so many others was abandoned the people had gonewhere falkes had no idea after visiting a few of the dwellings they returned to their horses a pisspoor place observed earl philip climbing back into the saddle i would not allow one of my dogs to live here he shook his head are they all like this more or less replied falkes they are mostly herdsmen from what i can tell they follow their cattle and these holdings are often abandoned for months at a time what about the farms the crops wondered philip taking up the reins there are few enough of those answered falkes turning his horse back onto the trackway most of the open land is used for grazing that will change decided philip this soil is richlook at the grass lush and thick as it is you could grow an abundance of grain hereenough to feed an army which is precisely what will be needed replied falkes urging his mount forward he thought about the barons plans to subdue the next commots two or three armies they rode to the top of the hill above the settlement and looked out over the empty valley with its narrow stream snaking through the deep green grass rippling in the wind in his minds eye earl philip could see farms and villages springing up throughout the territory there would be millsfor wood and wool and grainand storehouses barns and granaries there would be dwellings for the farmers the workers the craftsmen tanners chandlers wainwrights ironsmiths weavers bakers dyers carpenters butchers fullers leatherers and all the rest there would be churches too one for each village and town and perhaps a monastery or two as well maybe in time an abbey a good place mused falkes yes his cousin smiled and nodded and it is a good thing we have come he let his gaze sweep over the hilltops and up to the blue vault of heaven and felt the warm sun on his face elfael is a rough gem but with work it will polish well to be sure agreed falkes god willing oh god has already willed it philip assured him as sure as william is king there is no doubt about that he paused then added none whatsoever chapter the day following the feast of saint edmundthree weeks after earl philips visit and the weather had turned raw the wind was rising out of the north gusting sharply pushing low dirty clouds over the hills count falkess thin frame was aching with the chill and he longed to turn around and ride back to the scorching great fire he kept blazing in the hearth but the barons men were still disputing over the map they were making and he did not want to appear irresolute or less than fully supportive of his uncles grand enterprise there were four of theman architect a surveyor and two apprenticesand although falkes could not be sure he suspected that in addition to their charting activities they were also spies the questions they asked and the interest they took in his affairs put the count on his guard he knew only too well that he enjoyed his present position through the sufferance of baron de braose not a day went by that he did not ponder how to further advance his uncles good opinion of him and his abilities for as elfael had been given so elfael could be taken away without it he would become again what he had been one more impoverished nobleman desperate to win the favour of his betters fate had reached down and plucked him from the heaving ranks of desperate nobility against every expectation he had been singled out for advancement and granted this chance to make good spoil this and falkes knew another opportunity would never come his way for him it was elfael or nothing thus he must ever and always remain vigilant and ruthless in his dealings with the welsh under his rule nor could he afford to show any weakness to his countrymen however insignificant that might give the baron cause to send him back to normandie in disgrace although his cousin philip heartily assured him that his uncle the baron applauded his accomplishments falkes reckoned he would not be secure in his position as lord of elfael until the de braose banner flew unopposed over the surrounding commots so despite the bonecracking cold a most miserable falkes remained with his visitors sitting on his horse and shivering in the damp wind the surveying party had arrived the day before when the first wains rolled down into the shallow bowl of the valley bumping across the stream that was now a swiftrunning torrent the highsided woodenwheeled vehicles toiled up the slope and came to a stop at the foot of the mound on which the fortress stood the wagons five in all were full of tools and supplies for the men who would oversee the construction of the three castles baron de braose had commissioned building work would not begin until the spring but the baron was anxious to waste not a single day he wanted everything to be ready when the masons and their teams of apprentices arrived with the thaw by the time the wildflowers brushed the hilltops with gold the foundations of each defensive tower would be established when the stars of the equinox shone over the sites the ditches would be man deep and the walls shoulder high by midsummer the central mound would belly to the sky and stone curtains twice the height of the workmen would crown the hillcrests and when the time came for the master mason to call his men to pack their tools and load the wains to return to their families in wintancaester oxenforde and gleawancaester the walls and keep bailey donjon and ditch would be halffinished for now however the wagons and animals would remain in sight of caer cadarn where their drivers would camp in the lee of the fortress to shelter from the perpetual wind and icy rain that roared down out of the northwest all winter long count falkess menatarms would be kept busy hunting for the table while the footmen and servants foraged for wood to keep the fires ablaze in hearth and fire ring of caer and camp it was not at all a convivial country falkes decided for although winter had yet to arrive in force the count had never been so cold in all his life curse the barons impatience if only the invasion of elfael could have waited until the spring as it was falkes and his men had come so late to wales that they had not had time to adequately prepare for the season of snow and ice falkes found he had seriously underestimated the severity of the british weather his clotheshe wore two or three tunics and mantles at a time along with his heaviest cloakwere too thin and made of the wrong stuff his fingers and toes suffered perpetual chilblains he stamped his way around the fortress clapping his hands and flapping his arms across his chest to keep warm by night he took to his bed after supper and burrowed deep under the fleeces and skins and cloaks that served him for bedclothes in his dank windfretted chamber just this morning he had awakened in his bed aghast to find that frost had formed on the bedclothes overnight he swore an oath that he would not sleep another night in that room if it meant he had to bed down with the servants and dogs beside the hearth in the great hall so be it the only time his hands and feet were ever warm was when he sat in his chair before the hearth with arms and legs outstretched toward the firea position he could maintain only for a few moments altogether but those were moments of pure bliss in what looked to be a long grinding bitter wintermore ordeal than season it was not until the light was beginning to fail and the surveyor could no longer read the chart he was making that the builders decided to stop for the day and return to caer cadarn the count was the first to turn his horse and head for home as the work party came in sight of the fortress the skies opened and rain began hammering down in driving sheets falkes lashed his mount to speed and covered the remaining distance at a gallop he raced up the long ramp through the gates and into the yard to find a half dozen unfamiliar horses tethered to the rail outside the stable who has come he asked throwing the reins of his mount to the head stabler it is baron neufmarche of hereford replied the groom he arrived only a short while ago neufmarche here mon dieu this is a worry thought the count what could he possibly want with me dashing back across the rainscoured yard a very wet falkes de braose entered the great hall there standing before a gloriously radiant hearth was his uncles compatriot and chief rival accompanied by five of his men knights every one baron neufmarche called falkes he shrugged off his sodden cloak and tossed it to a waiting servant this is an unexpected pleasure he brayed trying to sound far more gracious than he felt at the moment striding quickly forward he rubbed the warmth back into his long hands welcome welcome messires to you all my dear count de braose replied the baron with a polite bow of courtesy pray forgive our intrusionwe were on our way north but this vile weather has driven us to shelter i hope we do not trespass on your hospitality please replied falkes oozing cordiality i am honoured he glanced around to see the cups in the hands of his guests i see my servants have seen to your refreshment bon yes your seneschal is most obliging the baron assured him taking up a spare cup already poured he handed it to the count here drink and warm yourself by the fire you have had an inclement ride feeling uncomfortably like a guest in his own house falkes nevertheless thanked the baron and accepted the cup withdrawing a poker from the fire he plunged it into the wine the hot iron sizzled and sputtered the count then raised his steaming cup and said to king william several cups later when a meal had been prepared and they all sat down together the count at last discovered the errand that brought the baron to his door and it had nothing to do with seeking shelter from the rain i have long wished to visit the earl of rhuddland the baron informed him spearing a piece of roast beef with his knife i confess i may have waited too far into the autumn but affairs at court kept me in lundien longer than i anticipated he lifted a shoulder cest la vie count falkes allowed himself a sly secret smile he knew baron neufmarche had been summoned by king william to attend him in lundein and kept waiting several days before finally being sent away william the red had still not completely forgiven the contrary noblemen who had upheld his brother roberts claim to the throne legitimate though it undoubtedly was when the dust of revolt had settled william had tacitly pardoned those he considered rebels returning them to rank and favouralthough he could not resist harassing them in small ways just to prove the point the delay neufmarche complained of had allowed the counts uncle to make good the de braose clans first foray into wales without interference from the lords of neighbouring territories while neufinarche was idling in lundien count falkes had with uncommon swiftness and ease conquered elfael the whole campaign had been closely planned to avoid extraneous entanglements from the likes of rival lords such as neufinarche for if baron de braose had had to beg neufmarche for permission to cross his lands that lay between norman england and the welsh provinces falkes was fairly certain they would all be waiting still you have done well the baron said gazing around the hall approvingly and in a very short time i take it the welsh gave you no trouble very little affirmed falkes there is a monastery nearby with a few monks and some women and children in hiding the rest seem to have scattered to the hills i expect we wont see them until the spring he cut into a plump roast fowl on the wooden trencher before him by then we will be well fortified hereabouts and opposition will be futile he sliced into the succulent breast of the bird raised a bite on his knife and nibbled daintily neufmarche caught the veiled reference to increased fortification no one builds fortresses to hold down a few monks and some women and children he thought and guessed the rest they are a strange people he observed and several of his knights grunted their agreement sly and secretive bien sir falkes replied he chewed thoughtfully and asked trying to sound casual do you plan to make a foray yourself the bluntness of the question caught the baron off guard me i have no plans he lied but now that you mention it the thought has crossed my mind he raised his cup to give himself time to think and then continued i confess your example gives me heart if i imagined that acquiring land would be so easy i might give it some serious consideration he paused as if entertaining the possibility of an attack in wales for the very first time busy as i am ruling the estates under my command im not at all certain a campaign just now would be wise you would know better than i falkes conceded this is my first experience ruling an estate of any size no doubt i have much to learn you are too modest neufmarche replied with a wide expansive smile from what i have seen you learn very quickly he drained his cup and held it aloft a servant appeared and refilled it at once i drink to your every success and i to yours mon ami said count falkes de braose and i to yours the next morning the baron departed with an invitation for falkes to visit him whenever he passed through his lands in herefordshire i will look forward to it with keenest pleasure said the count as he waved his visitors away he then hurried to his chamber where he drafted a hasty letter to his uncle informing him of the progress with the ongoing survey of the building sitesas well as his adversarys unannounced visit falkes sealed the letter and dispatched a messenger the moment his guests were out of sight chapter ngharad stirred the simmering contents of the cauldron with a long wooden spoon and listened to the slow plip plip plip of the rain falling from the rim of stone onto the wet leaves at the entrance to the cave she took up the bound sprig of a plant she had gathered during the summer and with a deft motion rolled the dry leaves back and forth between her palms crumbling the herb into the broth the aroma of her potion was growing ever more pungent in the close air of the cave every now and then she would cast a glance toward the fleecewrapped bundle lying on a bed of pine boughs and covered with moss and deer pelts sometimes the man inside the bundle would moan softly but for the most part his sleep was as silent as the dead her skill with healing unguents and potions extended to that small mercy if nothing more when the infusion was ready she lifted the cauldron from the fire and carried it to a nearby rock where it was left to cool then taking up an armful of twigs from the heap just inside the cave entrance she returned to her place by the fire one for the great king on his throne so white she said tossing a twig onto the embers she waited until the small branch flared into flame then reached for another saying two for the son the king begat this curious ritual continued for some timetaking up a twig and consigning it to the flames with a little verse spoken in a childs rhythmic singsongand the simple chant reached the young man in his painfretted sleep three for the errant goose both swift and wild four for pangur ban the cat five for the martyrs undefiledaye five for the martyrs undefiled she paused and cupped a hand above the fire for a moment allowing the smoke to gather then turned her palm releasing a little white cloud as the smoke floated up and dispersed she continued her verse six for the virgins who watch and wait seven for the bards in halls of oak eight for the patches on padraigs cloak nine for the lepers at the gate ten for the rays of loves pure lightaye ten for the rays of loves pure light though the young man did not wake the softly droning words and the simple rhythm seemed to soothe him his breathing slowed and deepened and his stiff muscles eased angharad heard the change in his breathing and smiled to herself she went to test the heat of the potion in the cauldron it was still hot but no longer bubbling picking up the big copper kettle she carried it to where bran lay drew her threelegged stool near and began gently pulling away the fleeces that covered him his flesh was dull and waxen his wounds livid and angry the right side of his face was roundly swollen the skin discoloured the teeth marks on his arm where the hound had fastened its jaws were puncture wounds deep but cleanas was the slash between his shoulder blades painful as any of these wounds might have been none were lifethreatening rather it was the ragged gash in the centre of his chest that worried her most the iron blade had not pricked a lung nor pierced the watery sac of the heart but the lance head had driven cloth from his tunic and hair from the hound deep into the cut these things in her experience could make even insignificant injuries fester and turn sour bringing on fever delirium and finally death she sighed as she placed her fingertips on the bulbous swelling the flesh was hot beneath her gentle fingertips oozing watery blood and yellow pus he had been wandering a few days before she had found him and the wounds had already begun to go rancid therefore she had taken great pains to prepare the proper infusion with which to wash the wound and had gathered the instruments to enlarge it so she could carefully dig out any scraps of foreign matter angharad had expected him to come to her injured she had foreseen the fight and knew the outcome but the wounds he had suffered would tax her skill sorely he was a strong one his strength green and potent even so he would need all of it and more besides if he was to survive bending to the cauldron she took up a bit of clean cloth from a neat stack she had prepared she folded the cloth and soaked it in the hot liquid and then gently gently applied it to the gash in his chest the heat caused him to moan in his sleep but he did not wake she let the cloth remain and taking up another soaked it and placed it on the side of his face when the second cloth had been carefully arranged she returned to the first removed it placed it back in the cauldron and began again so it went all through the night the old woman remained hunched on her little stool moving with slow purpose from one wound to the next removing the cloth dipping it and replacing it when the potion in the cauldron cooled she returned it to the embers of her fire and brought it back to the boil heat was needed to draw out the poison of the wounds while she worked she sangan old song in the elder tongue something she had learned from her own banfaith many many years agothe tale of bran the blessed and his journey to tir na nog it was a song about a champion who after a long sojourn in the otherworld had returned to perform the hero feat for his people a tale full of hope longing and triumphfitting she thought for the man beneath her care as dawn seeped into the rainy sky to the east angharad finished she set aside the cauldron and rose slowly arching her back to ease the ache there then she knelt once more and taking up a handful of dried moss placed it gently over the young mans wounds before covering him with the sheepskins later that day she would begin the purification procedure all over again and the next day too and perhaps the next but for now it was enough she rose and returned the cauldron to the edge of the fire ring and settling herself once more on the threelegged stool she pulled her cloak around her shoulders and closed her eyes on the day bran did not know how long he had been lying in the dark listening to the rain a day perhaps many days try as he might he could not remember ever hearing such a sound before he could vaguely remember what rain was and what it looked like but so far as he could recall this was the first time he had ever heard it patter down on earth and rocks and drip from the canopy of leaves to the sodden forest pathways below unable to move he was content to lie with his eyes closed listening to the oddly musical sound he did not want to open his eyes for fear of what he might see flitting through his shattered memory were weird and worrisome images a snarling dog that snapped at his throat a body floating in a pool a blackshadowed hole in the ground that was both stronghold and tomb and a hideous decrepit old woman bearing a steaming cauldron it was a nightmare he told himself the dreams of a painhaunted man and nothing more he knew he was badly injured he did not know how this had come to be nor even how he knew it to be true nevertheless he accepted this fact without question then again perhaps it was part of the same nightmare as the old cronewho could say however it was the woman seemed to be intimately connected with another curious image that kept spinning through his mind that of himself wrapped in soft white fleece and lying fulllength on a bed of pine boughs and moss covered by deerskins now and then the image changed taking on the quality of a dreama peculiar reverie made familiar through repetition in this dream he hovered in the air like a hawk gazing down upon his own body from some place high above at first he did not know who this hapless fellow in the rude bed might be the young mans face was round and oddly misshapen one side purple black and bloated beyond all recognition his skin was dull and lustreless and of an awful waxy colour no breath stirred the unfor tunates lungs the poor wretch was dead bran concluded and that is when the old woman had first appeared a hag with a bent back and a face like a dried apple she limped to the dead mans bed carrying the gurgling pot fresh from the fire she leaned low and peered into the fellows face shaking her head slowly as she carefully positioned the cauldron and settled herself crosslegged on the ground beside him then rocking back and forth she began to sing bran thought he had heard the song before but could not say where and then abruptly the dream endedalways at the same place the injured man and the old woman simply vanished in a blinding white haze and most upsetting bran found himself waking in the dark and occupying the injured mans place this distressing transformation did not upset him as much as it might have because of the overwhelming sympathy bran felt for the unfortunate fellow not only did he feel sorry for the young man but he felt as if they might have been friends in the past at the same time he resented the repulsive old womans intrusions if not for her bran imagined he and the wounded man would have been free to leave that dark place and roam at will in the fields of light he knew about these faroff fields because he had seen them caught fleeting glimpses of them in his other dreams in these dreams he was often flying soaring above an endless landscape of softly rounded hills over which the most wonderful delicate crystalline rays of sunlight played in evershifting coloursas if the soft summer breeze had become somehow visible as it drifted over the tall grass in richly variegated hues to delight the eye nor was this all for accompanying the blithe colours was a soft flutelike music buoyant as goose down on the breeze faroff as the remembered echo of a whisper soft and sweet and low it gradually modulated from one note to the next in fine harmony the first time he saw the fields of light the sight made his heart ache with yearning he wanted nothing more than to go there to explore that wondrous place but something prevented him once in his dream he had made a determined rush toward the glorious fields and it appeared he would at last succeed in reaching them but the old woman suddenly arose before himit was angharad he knew her by the quick glance of her dark eyeexcept that she was no longer the hideous hag who dwelt in the darksome hole gone were her bent back and filthy tangles of stringy hair gone her withered limbs gone her coarsewoven shapeless dress the woman before him was beauty made flesh her tresses were long and golden hued her skin flawless soft and supple her gown was woven of glistening white samite and trimmed in ermine the slippers on her feet were scarlet silk beaded with tiny pearls she gazed upon him with large dark eyes that held a look of mild disapproval he moved to step past her but she simply raised her hand where do you go mo croi she asked her voice falling like gentle laughter on his ear he opened his mouth to frame a reply but could make no sound come she said smiling return with me now it is not yet time for you to leave reaching out she touched him lightly on the arm turning him to lead him away he resisted still staring at the wonderful fields beyond dearest heart she said pressing luscious lips to his ear yon meadow will remain but you cannot come return you must we have work to do so she led him back from the edge of the field back to the warm darkness and the slow plip plip plip of the falling rain sometime laterhe could not say how longbran heard singing it was the voice from his dream and this time he opened his eyes to dim shadows moving gently on the rock walls of his primitive chamber slowly he turned his head toward the sound and there she was although it was dark as a dovecote inside the cave he could see her lumpen ungainly form as she stood silhouetted by the fitful flickering flames she was as hideous as the hag of his recent nightmares but as he knew now she was no dream she like the hole in the ground where he lay was only too real who are you asked bran his head throbbed with the effort of forming the words and his voice cracked barely a whisper the old woman did not turn or look around but continued stirring the foulsmelling brew it was some time before bran could work up the strength to ask again with slightly more breath woman who are you at this the crone dropped her stirring stick and turned her wrinkled face to peer at him over a hunched shoulder regarding him with a sharp black birdlike eye her manner put bran in mind of a crow examining a possible meal or a bright bauble to steal away to a treetop nest can you speak asked bran each word sent a peal of agony crashing through his head and he winced the side of his face felt as stiff and unyielding as a plank of oak aye speak and sing she replied and her voice was far less unpleasant than her appearance suggested the question is methinks can thee bran opened his mouth but a reply seemed too much effort he simply shook his headand instantly wished he had not moved at all for even this slight motion sent towering waves of pain and nausea surging through his gut he closed his eyes and waited for the unpleasantness to pass and the world to right itself once more i thought not the old woman told him thou best not speak until i bid thee she turned from him then and he watched her as she rose slowly and bending from her wide hips removed the pot from the flames and set it on a nearby rock to cool she then came to his bed where she sat for some time gazing at him with that direct unsettling glance at length she said thou art hungry some broth have i made thee bran unable to make a coherent reply merely blinked his eyes in silent assent she busied herself by the fire returning a short time later with a wooden bowl taking up a spoon made from a stags horn she dipped it into the bowl and brought it to brans mouth parting his lips with a gentle yet insistent pressure barely able to open his mouth he allowed some of the lukewarm liquid to slide over his teeth and down his throat it had a dusky herbrich flavour that reminded him of a greenwood glen in deep autumn she lifted the spoon once more and he sucked down the broth there and may it well become you she said soothingly thou mayest yet make good your return to tir na nog an inexplicable sense of pride and accomplishment flushed his cheeks and he suddenly found himself eager to please her with this trifling display of infant skill the broth although thin and clear was strangely filling and bran found that after only a few more sips from the spoon he could hold no more the food settled his stomach and exhausted with the small effort expended he closed his eyes and slept when he woke again it was brighter in the cave and he was hungry again as before the old woman was there to serve him some of the herbal broth he ate gratefully but without trying to speak and then slept after his meal life proceeded like this for many days he would wake to find his guardian beside him ready to feed him his broth whereupon after only a few sips from the stag horn spoon he would be overcome by the urge to sleep upon waking he would find himself better refreshed than before and what is more bran not only found that he was eating more each time but also suspected that the intervals between sleeping and eating were shorter the comforting routine was interrupted one day when bran awoke to find himself alone in the cave he moved his head to look around but the hag was nowhere to be seen the pitpat drip of water that had accompanied his waking moments for the last many days was gone alone and unobserved he decided to stand up slowly cautiously he levered himself onto the elbow of his good arm his shoulders were stiff and his chest ached even the tiniest movement set off a crippling surge of agony that left him panting at each attack he would pause eyes squeezed shut clutching his chest until the waves of pain receded and he could see straight again on the ground near his bed was a shallow iron basin full of water guarding against any sudden moves he stretched out his hand and was able to hook two fingers over the rim and pull the heavy vessel loser when the water stopped sloshing around the basin he leaned over it and looked in the face staring back at him was woefully misshapen the right side was puffy and discoloured and a jagged black line ran from the lower lip to the earlobe the flesh along this lightningstrike line was pinched and puckered beneath a rough beard which had been unevenly shaved to keep the hair away from the wound angry at what he saw reflected in the water he gave the basin a shove and instantly regretted it the violent movement caused another upwelling of pain greater than any before he could not bear it and fell back tears streaming down the sides of his face he moaned and that started him coughing which opened the wound in his chest the next thing he knew he was coughing up blood the stuff came bubbling up his throat thick and sweet and spilled over his chin he gagged and hacked spitting blood in a fine red mist over himself each cough brought forth another and he could not catch his breath just when he thought he would choke to death on his own blood the old woman appeared beside him what hast thou done she asked kneeling beside him unable to reply he wheezed and spluttered blood welling up over his teeth with a quick motion angharad tore aside the sheepskin covering and placed a gentle hand on his chest peace she whispered like a mother to a distraught and unquiet child power of moon have i over thee power of sun have i over thee power of stars have i over thee power of rain have i over thee power of wind have i over thee power of heaven have i over thee power of heaven have i over thee in the power of god to heal thee she moved her hand over his chest her fingertips softly brushing the injured flesh closed for thee thy wound and stanched thy blood as christ bled upon the cross so closeth he thy wound for thee she intoned her voice a caress a part of this hurt on the high mountains a part of this hurt on the grassdeep meadow a part of this hurt on the heathered moors a part of this hurt on the great surging sea that has best means to bear it this hurt on the great surging sea she herself has the best means to bear it for thee away away away under angharads warm touch the pain subsided his lungs eased their laboured pumping and his breathing calmed bran lay back his chin and chest glistening with gore and mouthed the words thank you taking a bit of rag she soaked it in the basin and began washing him clean working patiently and slowly she hummed as she worked and bran felt himself relaxing under her gentle ministrations now wilt thou sleep the old woman told him when she finished eyelids heavy he closed his eyes and sank into the soft dark timeless place where his dreams kindled and flared with strange visions of impossible feats of people he knew but had never met of things past or perhaps yet to comewhen the king and queen gave life and love to the people when bards lauded the deeds of heroes when the land bestowed its gifts in abundance when god looked with favour upon his children and hearts were glad over all he dreamed that night there loomed the shape of a strange bird with a long beak and a face as smooth and hard and black as charred bone chapter pring could not come soon enough for falkes de braose the count ached for an end to the roofrattling teethchattering cold of the most inhospitable winter he had ever knownand it had only just begun as he shivered in his chair wrapped in cloaks and robesa very hillock of duncoloured woolhe consoled himself with the thought that when winter came next year he would be firmly ensconced in his own private chamber in a newly built stone keep in blissful dreams he conjured snug woodpanelled rooms hung with heavy tapestries to keep out the searching fingers of the frigid wind and a downfilled bed set before a blazing hearth all his own he would never again suffer the dank drear of the great hall with its drafts and smoke and freezing damp he would not abide another winter swaddled like a grotesquely oversized worm waiting for spring so it could shrug off its cocoon next winter a ready supply of fuel would be laid in he would determine how much was required and then treble the amount this daily struggle to squeeze inadequate warmth from wet timber was slow insanity and the count vowed never to endure it again this time next year he would laugh at the rain and cheerfully thumb his nose at each snowflake as it floated to the ground meanwhile he waited in perpetual dudgeon for the spring thaw studying the plans drawn by the master architect for the barons new borderland castles one facing the yettobeconquered northwestern territories one to anchor the centre and the lands to the south and one to defend the backs of the other two from any attacks arising from the east the castles were with only slight variations all the same but falkes studied each sheaf of drawings with painstaking care trying to think of improvements to the designs that he could suggest and that might win his uncles approval so far he had come up with only one increasing the size of the cistern that captured rainwater for use in times of emergency as this detail was not likely to impress his uncle he kept at his scrutiny and dreamed of warmer climes five days after the feast of saint benedict a messenger arrived with a letter from the baron good news i hope said falkes to the courier taking receipt of the wrapped parchment will you stay my lord baron requires an answer without delay replied the man shaking rainwater from his cloak and boots does he indeed falkes his interest sufficiently piqued waved the courier away to the cookhouse alone again he broke the seal unrolled the small scrap of parchment and settled back in his chair holding the crabbed script before his eyes he read the letter through to the end and then scanned it again to make sure he had not missed anything the message was simple enough his uncle eager to strengthen his grasp on elfael so that he could begin his longanticipated invasion into fresh territories desired the construction of his new castles to begin without further delay the baron was sending masons and skilled workers at once further many of these would be bringing their families eliminating the need to return home when the building season ended thus allowing them to work longer before winter brought a halt to their labours therefore baron de braose wanted his nephew to put every available resource of time and energy into building a town and establishing a market so that the workers and their families would have a place to live while the construction continued a town spluttered falkes he wants an entire town raised before next winter the baron concluded his letter saying that he knew he could rely on his nephew to carry out his command with utmost zeal and purpose and that when the baron arrived on saint michaels day to inspect the work he trusted he would find all ready and in good order falkes was still sitting in his chair with a stunned expression on his long face when the messenger returned my lord asked the man approaching uncertainly falkes stirred and glanced up yes oh it is you did you find something to eat thank you sire i have had a good meal well replied falkes absently i am glad to hear it i suppose you want to get back so i his voice trailed off as he sat gazing into the flames on the hearth ahem coughed the messenger after a moment if you please sire what reply am i to make to the baron raising the letter to his eyes once more falkes took a deep breath and said you may tell the baron that his nephew is eager to carry out his wishes and will press ahead with all speed tell him his voice grew small at the thought of the enormity of the task before him pardon asked the messenger you were saying yes yes resumed the count irritably tell the baron his nephew wishes him success in all his undertakings no tell him tell the baron nothing wait but a little and i will compose a proper reply he flicked his long fingers at the messenger you may go see to your mount bowing quickly the messenger departed falkes went to his table took up his pen and wrote a coolly compliant answer to his uncles demand on the same parchment then rolled and resealed it and called for a servant to take the letter to the waiting messenger he heard the clatter of ironshod hooves in the courtyard a short time later and closing his eyes leaned his head against the back of his chair an entire town to raise in one summer impossible it could not be done was his uncle insane the baron himself with all his men and money could surely not accomplish such a thing he slumped farther into his chair and pulled the woollen cloaks more tightly under his chin as hopelessness wrapped its dark tendrils around him three castles to erect and now a complete town as well his own dream of a warm chamber in a newly enlarged fortress receded at an alarming pace by the blessed virgin a town so lost in his despair was he that it was not until the next day that falkes found a way out of the dilemma it did not have to be a whole town that would come in time and in good order for now the undertaking could be something much more modest a market square a meeting hall a few houses and of course a church constructing even that much would be difficult enoughwhere was he to find the labourers why a church alone would require as many men as he had ready to hand where would he find the rest the church alone he thought and the thought brought him upright in his chair yes of course why the answer was staring him full in the face he rose and leaving the warmth of his hall behind rushed out into the snowcovered yard calling for his seneschal orval orval he cried bring me bishop asaph the summons came while the bishop was conducting an audit of food supplies with the kitchener it was turning into a hard winter and this years harvest had been poor the monastery was still sheltering a dozen or so people who for one reason or another could not escape to saint dyfrigs thus the bishop was concerned about the stock of food on hand and wanted to know how long it would last together with brother brocmal he was examining the monasterys modest storerooms making an exact accounting when the riders arrived to fetch him bishop asaph called the porter running across the yard the ffreincthe ffreinc have come for you calm yourself brother asaph said deliver your charge with some measure of decorum if you please the porter gulped down a mouthful of air three riders in de braose livery have come he said they have a horse for you and say you are to accompany them to caer cadarn i see well go back and tell them i am busy just now but will attend them as soon as i have finished they said i was to bring you at once countered the porter if you refused they said they would come and drag you away by your ears did they indeed exclaimed the bishop well i will save them the trouble handing the tally scroll to the kitchener he said continue with the accounting brother brocmal while i deal with our impatient guests of course bishop replied brother brocmal asaph returned with the porter and found three marchogi on horseback waiting with a saddled fourth horse pax vobiscum said the bishop i am father asaph how may i be of assistance he spoke his best latin slowly so they would understand count de braose wants you said the foremost rider so i have been given to understand replied the bishop who explained that he was in the midst of a necessary undertaking and would come as soon as he was finished no said the horseman he wants you now now explained the bishop still smiling is not convenient i will come when my duties allow he doesnt care if it is convenient replied the soldier we have orders to bring you without delay he nodded to his two companions who began dismounting oh very well said asaph moving quickly to the waiting horse the sooner gone the sooner finished with the help of the porter the bishop mounted the saddle and took up the reins well are you coming he asked in a voice thick with sarcasm apparently it does not do to keep the count waiting without another word the marchogi turned their mounts and rode from the yard out into a dazzling sunbright day the soldiers led the way across the snowcovered valley and the bishop followed at an unhurried pace letting his mind wander as it would he was still trying to get the measure of these new overlords and each encounter taught him a new lesson in how to deal with the ffreinc invaders strictly speaking they were not ffreinc or franks at all they were normans there was a differencenot that any of the britons he knew cared for such fine distinctions to the people of the valleys beyond the march the tall strangers were invaders from francethat was all they knew or needed to know to the britons be they ffreinc angevin or norman they were merely the latest in a long line of wouldbe conquerors before the normans there were the english and before the english the danes and the saxons before them and each invader had carved out dominions for themselves and had gradually been gathered in and woven into the manycoloured mantle that was the island of the mighty these normans were from what he knew of them ambitious and industrious capable of great acts of piety and even greater brutality they built churches wherever they went and filled them on holy days with devout worshippers who nevertheless lived like hellions the rest of the time it was said of the ffreinc that they would blithely burn a village slaughter all the men and hang all the women and children and then hurry off to church lest they miss a mass be that as it may the normans were christian at leastwhich was more than could be said for the danes or english when they had first arrived on britains fair shores that being the case the church had decided that the normans were to be treated as brothers in christalbeit as one would treat a domineering wildly violent and unpredictable older brother there was so far as bishop asaph could see no other alternative had he not urged king brychanif once then a thousand times over the yearsto acknowledge the conqueror swear fealty pay his taxes and do what he could to allow his people to live in peace what asaph could hear the king cry in outrage am i to kneel and kiss the rosy rump of that usurping knave and me a king in my own country let me be roasted alive before i stoop to pucker well he had sown his patch and reaped his reward god save himand his feckless son too now that was a very shame profligate recklessly licentious and dissolute the prince may have beenno mistake about it he was all that and moreyet he had qualities his father lacked hidden though they might have been were they hidden so deeply as to never be recovered that was the question he had often asked himself alas the question was moot and would so forever remain with brans death the old era passed and a new had begun like it or not the ffreinc were a fact of life and they were here to stay the path was as clear as the choice before him his only hope of guiding his scattered flock through the storms ahead was to curry favour with the ruling powers bishop asaph intended to get along with them however he could and hopeand prayfor the best it was in this frame of mind that llanellis deferential senior cleric entered the fortress where count falkes de braose sat blowing on numb fingers in his damp smokefilled hall beside a sputtering fire of green wood ah bishop asaph said the count glancing around as the churchman was led into the hall it is good to see you again i trust you are well falkes sniffed and drew a sleeve under his runny nose yes answered the bishop stiffly well enough i on the other hand seem destined to endure no end of suffering opined the count what with one thing and anotherand this vile weather on top of it all and yet despite your sufferings you remain alive to complain observed the bishop his voice taking on the chill of the room in falkess presence he felt anew the loss of brother ffreol and the death of brannot to mention the massacre at wye ford ffreols death had been an accidentthat was what he had been told the slaughter of the king and warband was regrettably a consequence of war he would have to accept brans death was in his mind without justification that the prince had been killed trying to escape without paying the ransom was he considered beside the point whatever anyone thought of the young man he was elfaels rightful king and should have been accorded due respect and courtesy mind your tongue priest if you value it at all threatened de braose who promptly sneezed i am in no mood for your insolence duly chastised asaph folded his hands and said i was told you required my assistance how may i be of service waving a long hand toward the empty chair on the other side of the fireplace de boase said sit down and i will tell you when the churchman had taken his seat the count declared it has been determined that elfael needs a town a town the bishop repeated as it happens i have long advocated a similar plan have you indeed sniffed falkes well then we agree it is to be a market town he went on to explain what would be required and when the cleric listened misgiving mounting with every breath when the count paused to sneeze once more the bishop spoke up pray excuse me my lord but who do you expect to build this town your people of course confirmed the count stretching his hands toward the fire who else but this is impossible declared asaph we cannot build you an entire town in a single summer the counts eyes narrowed dangerously it will profit both of us be that as it may it cannot be done objected the churchman even if we possessed a ready supply of tools and material who would do the building be at ease said the count you are growing distraught over nothing have i not already said that we will use as much existing building work as possible we will begin with that and add only what is necessary it does not have to be a city minda small market village will do what existing buildings do you mean i mean replied the count with exaggerated patience those buildings already establishedthe church and outbuildings and whatnot but but cried the bishop in a strangled voice that is my monastery you are talking about oui agreed the count placidly we will begin there those structures can easily be converted to other uses we need only raise a few houses a grange hall smithery and such like your monastery serves what a paltry handful of monks my town will become a centre of commerce and prosperity for the whole valley where is the difficulty the difficulty count de braose replied the bishop fighting to keep his voice level is that i will no longer have a monastery your monastery is no longer required stated the count we need a market town not a monkery there has been a monastery in this valley for eleven generations asaph pointed out he raised his hands and shook his head vehemently no i will not preside over its destruction it is out of the question the churchmans outright and obstinate refusal irritated de braose he felt the warmth of anger rising in him and his voice grew hushed au contraire bishop he said it is the question see here we must have a town and quickly people are coming to settle in the valley we need a town he paused gathered his nerves and then continued in a more conciliatory tone the labourers will be drawn from the residents of the valley and the materials will be supplied from the woods and stone fields of elfael i have already undertaken the requisition of the necessary tools and equipment as well as oxen and wagons for transport anything else that you require will be likewise supplied all that remains he said in conclusion is for you to supply the men they will be ready to work as soon as the last snow has melted is that clear which men do you imagine i command demanded the bishop in his anger at being thrown out of his beloved monastery there are no men he snapped only a paltry handful of monks the welsh said falkes the people of elfael your countrymenthat is who i mean the men of elfael are gone scoffed the bishop the best were slaughtered on their way to lundein he said pointedly and the rest fled the only ones left are those who had nowhere else to go and if they have any sense at all they will stay far away from this valley the count glared from beneath his brows courtesy priest warned de braose sarcasm ill becomes you count de braose appealed the bishop every ablebodied man gathered his family and his flocks and fled the valley the moment you and your soldiers arrived there are no men then you must find some said falkes growing weary of the bishops unwillingness to see things from his point of view i do not care where you find them but find them you will and if i decline to aid you in this then replied falkes his voice falling to a whisper you will quickly learn how i repay disloyalty i assure you it can be extremely unpleasant bishop asaph stared in disbelief you would threaten a priest of christ the young count shrugged and this after i delivered the kings treasury to you this is how i am to be repaid we agreed that the church would not be harmed you gave me your word your church will be in a town said the count where is the harm we are under the authority of rome asaph pointed out you hold no power over us i hold a royal grant for this commot any interference in the establishment of my rule will be reckoned treason which is punishable by death he spread his hands as if to indicate that the matter was beyond his immediate control but we need not dwell on such unhappy things you have plenty of time to make the right decision you cannot do this blurted the bishop in the name of god you cannot oh i think you will find that i can replied falkes one way or another there will be a town in this valley you can help me or you and your precious monks will perish the choice my dear bishop is yours chapter winter laid siege to the forest and set up encampment on the hilltops and valleys throughout elfael the tiny branchframed patch of sky that could be seen from the mouth of the cave was often obscured cast over with heavy snowladen clouds bran warm beneath layered furs and skins would sometimes wake in the night and listen to the gale as it shrieked through the naked trees outside beating the bare branches together and sending the snow drifting high and deep over the forest trails and trackways the cave however fierce the storm outside remained dry and surprisingly comfortable bran spent his days dozing and planning his eventual departure when he grew strong enough to leave this place he would resume his flight to the north having no other plan that was as good as any for now however he remained content to sleep and eat and recover his strength sometimes he would wake to find himself alone but angharad always returned by days endoften with a fat hare or two slung over her shoulder and once with half a small deer which she hung from an iron hook set in the rock at the entrance to the cave in the evenings she cooked their simple meals and tended his wounds while the pot bubbled on the fire and at night each night of that long winter the cave was transformed no longer a rockbound hole in a cliff face it became a shining gateway into another world for each night after they had eaten angharad sang the first time it took bran by surprise without any hint or warning of what was to come the old woman disappeared into the dark interior of the cave and returned bearing a harp finely made of walnut and elm wood with pegs of oak the curve of its shapely prow was polished smooth by years of handling bran watched as she carefully brushed away the dust with the hem of her mantle tightened the strings and tuned the instrument then settled on her stool her head bent near as if in dose communion with an old friend a frown of concentration on her puckered face angharad had begun to playand brans bemusement turned to astonished delight the music those gnarled old fingers coaxed from the harp strings that night was pure enchantment woven tapestries of melody wonder made audible and when she opened her mouth to sing bran felt himself lifted out of himself and transported to places he never knew existed like the ancient harp cradled in her lap angharads voice took on a beauty and quality far surpassing the rude instrument at once agile and sure and gentle the old womans singing voice possessed a fluid supple strengthnow soaring like the wind over the faroff mountains now a bird in flight now a cresting wave rolling upon the shore and was it not strange that when angharad sang she herself was subtly changed no longer the gray hag in a tattered robe she assumed a more noble almost regal aspect a dignity her shabby surroundings ordinarily denied or at least obscured from view wellaccustomed to her presence now bran was no longer repulsed by her appearance in the same way he no longer noticed her odd archaic way of speaking with her thee and thou and wouldst and goest and all the rest neither her aspect nor her speech seemed remarkable he accepted both the same way he recognized her healing skill they seemed natural to her and most naturally her in fact as bran soon came to appreciate with a harp in her weathered hands angharad became more herself extraordinary as it was to bran that first nights performance was merely the seeding of a disused well or the clearing of a brushfilled spring to let fresh new waters flow thereafter as night after night she took her place on the stool and cradled the harp to her bosom angharads voice like fine gold began to take on added luster through use a voice so rare bran mused must come from somewhere else from some other time or place from some other worldperhaps from the very world angharads songs described the world angharad sang into being was the elder world the realm of princely warriors and their noble lovers she sang of longforgotten heroes kings and conquerors of warrior queens and ladies of such beauty that nations rose and fell at the fleeting glance of a limpid eye of dangerous deeds and queer enchantments of men and women of ancient renown at whose names the heart rose and the blood raced faster she sang of arianrhod pryderi llew danu and carridwen and all their glorious adventures of pwyll and rhiannon and their impossible love of taliesin arthur pendragon and wise myrddin embries whose fame made britain the island of the mighty she sang of the cauldron of rebirth the isle of the everliving and the making of manysplendoured albion one night bran realised that he had not heard such tales since he was a child this he thought was why the songs touched him so deeply not since the death of his mother had anyone sung to him this is why he listened to them all with the same awed attention caught up in the stories he lived them as they took life within him he became bladudd the blighted prince who sojourned seven years in unjust servitude he became the lowly swineherd tucmal who challenged the giant champion ogygia to mortal combat he flew with doomed yspilladan on his beautiful wings of swan feathers and wax he spent a lonely lifetime in hopeless pining for the love of beautiful inconstant blodeuwedd he was a warrior standing shoulder to shoulder with brave meldryn mawr to fight against dread lord nudd and his demon horde in a land of ice and snow all these and many more did bran become after each nights song angharad laid aside the harp and sat for a time gazing into the fire as if into a window through which she could see the very things she sang about after a time her body would give a little shake and she would come to herself again like one emerging from a spell sometimes the sense of what he had heard eluded himshe could tell by the frown that knitted his brow and tugged at the corner of his mouth that he had not understood so wrapping her arms around her knees as she sat on her threelegged stool she would gaze into the fire and talk about the story and its inner meaningthe spirit of the song angharad called it as brans knowledge grew so did his appreciation of the stories themselves he began to behold possibilities and portents glimmerings of distant hope flashes of miracle the things he heard in angharads songs were more than mere fancythe stuff itinerant minstrels pliedthey were tokens of knowledge in another deeper rarer form perhaps they were even a form of power but one long dormant at the very least these songs were markers along a sacred and ancient pathway that led deep into the heart of the land and its peoplehis land his peoplea spirit and life that would be crushed out of existence beneath the heavy unfeeling rule of the coldhearted ffreinc it snowed the day bran finally regained his feet leaning heavily on the old woman he shuffled with agonizing slowness to the mouth of the cave to stand and watch silent white flakes drift down from the close grey sky to cover the forest in a fine seamless garment of glistening white he felt the cold air on his face and hands and drew it deep into his lungs shivering with the icy tingle the sensation made him cough it still hurt but the coughing no longer made him gasp with pain he braved it for the chance to simply stand and watch the swirling flakes spin and dance as they floated to earth after being so long abed with nothing to look at but the dull grey rock walls of the cave bran considered that he had rarely seen anything so beautiful the dizzying sweep and curl and gyre of the falling flakes made him smile as he turned his lightdazzled eyes to the sky the old woman seemed to approve of the pleasure he took in the sight she bore him up with her sturdy peasant strength watching the enjoyment flit across brans thin haggard features when he grew tired angharad fetched him a staff she returned with a sturdy length of hawthorn placing it in his hands she indicated that bran should go and relieve himself he hobbled gingerly out into the little clearing the snow fell on him the fat wet flakes stinging sweetly as they alighted on his exposed skin stuck and instantly melted although it felt odd standing in the snow within sight of the old woman at the mouth the cave bran was glad to be able to stand like a man on his own two feet once more and not have to squat on a pot like a child he returned to the cave shaking and sweating and tottering like an invalid no longer able to lift his feet but beaming as if he had journeyed to the very edge of the earth and lived to tell the tale the old woman did not rush out to help him but waited at the cave mouth for each stumbling step to bring him back when he entered the cave she took his face between her rough hands and blew her warm breath upon him you can speak she told him if you will up until that moment bran did not feel he had anything to say but now all the pentup words came bubbling up in a confused and tangled rush only to stick in his throat he stood swaying on the staff his tongue tingling with halfformed thoughts and questions struggling to frame the words until she laid a sooty finger on his lips and said time enough for all your questions anon but sit down now and rest she did not lead him back to his bed as he expected but sat him on her threelegged stool beside the fire ring while he warmed himself she made a meal for thema stew with meat this time a nice fat hare along with some leeks and wild turnips and dried mushrooms gathered through the autumn and dried in the sun when she had cut up everything and tossed it into the cauldron she took a few handfuls of ground wheat some salt water honey dried berries and dried herbs and began making up little cakes with dough left over from the last batches bran sat and watched her deft fingers prepare the food and his thoughts slowed and clarified what is your name he asked at last and was surprised to hear a voice that sounded much like the one he knew as his own she smiled without glancing up and continued kneading the dough for a moment before answering she shaped a small loaf and set it to warm and rise on a stone near the fire then looking him full in the face she replied i am angharad are you a gwrach he asked a sorceress she bent to her work once more and bran thought she would not answer please i mean no disrespect he said only it seems to me that no one can do what you do without the aid of powerful magic he paused watching her mix the flour and then asked again truly are you a sorceress i am as you see me she replied she shaped another small loaf and put it beside the first different people see different things what do you see embarrassed now to tell her what he really thought that he saw a repulsive crone with bits of leaf and seeds in her hair that he saw a grotesque hag with smokedarkened skin in a filthy greasestained rag of a dress that he saw a hunchbacked shambling wreck of a human beingbran swallowed his blunt observations and instead replied i see the woman who with great skill and wisdom has saved my life i ask you now she replied rolling the dough between her calloused palms was it a life worth the saving i do hope you think so he replied angharad stopped her work her face grew still as she regarded him with an intensity like the lick of a naked flame over his skin it is my most fervent hope she said her voice solemn as a pledge what is more all of elfael joins me in that hope bran feeling suddenly very unworthy of such esteem lowered his gaze to the fire and said no more that night many more days passed and brans strength slowly increased restless and frustrated by his inability to move about as he would like he sat and moped by the fire idly feeding twigs and bark and branches to the flames he knew he was not well enough to leave yet and even if he could have limped more than a few paces without exhausting himself winter with its blizzards and blasts still raged that did not hinder him from wishing he could go and making plans to leave angharad he knew would not prevent him she had said as much and he had no reason to believe otherwise indeed she seemed more than sympathetic to his plight for she too nursed a lowsmouldering hatred for the ffreinc who had seized elfael killed the king and wiped out the warband outlanders she called them whose presence was an offence under heaven a stink in the nostrils of god while bran shared this view he could not see himself effecting any significant change in the situation even if he had been so inclined as the matter stood he was a man marked for death if he was caught in elfael again bran knew count de braose would not hesitate to finish what he had almost succeeded in accomplishing at the forests edge the fear of that attack would come swarming out of the night to kindle in him an intense passion to escape to flee to a safe haven in the north to leave elfael and never look back other times he saw himself standing over the body of count de braose his lance blade deep in his effete enemys guts occasionally bran imagined there might be a way to unite those two conflicting ambitions perhaps he could fly away to safety persuade his kinsmen in the north to join with him and return to elfael with a conquering warhost to drive the ffreinc invaders from the land this last idea was late in coming his impulse from the beginning had been escape and it still claimed first place in his thoughts the notion of staying to fight for his land and people had occurred to him in due courseseeded no doubt by the stories angharad told stories that filled his head with all kinds of new and unfamiliar thoughts one morning bran rose early to find his wizened guardian gone and himself alone feeling rested and able he set himself the task of walking from the cave to the edge of the clearing the day was clear and bright the sun newly risen the air crisp he drew a deep breath and felt the tightness in his chest and sideas if inner cords still bound him his shoulder ached with the cold but he was used to it now and it no longer bothered him his legs felt strong enough so he began to walkslowly with exaggerated care the ground sloped down from the mouth of the cave and he saw the path trodden by angharad on her errands and judging by the other tracks in the welltrampled snow a multitude of forest creatures as well he hobbled across the open expanse and arrived in good order at the edge of the clearing flushed with the exhilaration of this small achievement he decided to press himself a little further he entered the forest walking with greater confidence along the wellpacked snow track it felt good to move and stretch the downhill path was gentle and soon he reached a small rill the stream was covered by a thin layer of translucent ice he could hear water running underneath the track turned and ran alongside the stream without thinking he followed in a little while he came to a place where the ground dropped away steeply the water entered a deep cutting carved into the slope and disappeared in a series of stony cascades the path followed this ravine but it was far too steep for bran so he turned and started back the way he had come when he reached the place where the path joined the stream he continued on soon reaching another impasse on his left hand a rocky shelf jutted up twice his height on his right the stream flowed at the bottom of a rough defile and dead ahead the trunk of a fallen elm blocked the path like a gnarled black barkcovered wall he did not trust his ability to clamber over the fallen login his present condition he did not dare risk it he had no choice but to retrace his steps so he turned around and started back to the cave it was then he learned that he had walked farther than he intended and also that he had seriously misjudged the slight uphill climb the rise was steep and the snow slick underfoot twice he slipped and fell he caught himself both times but each fall was accompanied by a sharp tearing sensationas if his wounds were being ripped open once more the second time he paused on his hands and knees in the snow and waited until the waves of pain subsided after that he proceeded much more carefully but the exertion soon taxed his rapidly tiring muscles he was forced to stop to rest and catch his breath every few dozen paces despite the cold he began to sweat his tunic and mantle were soon soaked through and his damp clothes grew clammy and froze chilling him to the bone by the time the cave came into sight he was shaking with cold and gasping with pain head down wheezing like a wounded bear bran shuffled the last hundred paces to the cave staggered in and collapsed on his bed he lay a long time shivering too weak to pull the fleeces over himself this was how angharad found him sometime later when she returned with a double brace of woodcocks bran sensed a movement and opened his eyes to see her bending over him the birds dangling in her hand and her brow creased with concern you went out she said simply i did he said his voice husky with fatigue he clenched his jaw tightly to keep his teeth from chattering you should not have done so laying aside the birds she straightened his limbs in his bed then arranged the fleeces over him i am sorry he murmured sinking gratefully beneath the coverings he closed his eyes and shivered angharad built up the fire again and set about preparing the woodcocks for their supper bran dozed on and off through the rest of the day when he finally roused himself once more it was dark outside the cave was warm and filled with the aroma of roasting meat he sat up stiffly and rubbed his chest the wound was sore and he felt a burning deep inside the old woman saw him struggle to rise and came to him you will stay abed she told him no he said far more forcefully than he felt i want to get up you have overtired yourself and must rest now tonight you will stay abed i wont argue he said accepting her judgement but will you still sing to me angharad smiled one would almost think you liked my singing she replied that night after supper bran lay in his bed aching and sore skin flushed with fever barely able to keep his eyes open but he listened to that incomparable voice and as before the cave disappeared and he travelled to that elder realm where angharads tales took life that night he listened as for the first time she sang him a tale of king raven chapter ngharad settled herself beside bran on her threelegged stool she plucked a harp string and silenced it with the flat of her hand closing her eyes she held her head to one side as if listening to a voice he could not hear he watched her shadow on the cave wall gently wavering in the firelight as she cradled the harp to her breast and began to stroke the lowest stringsoftly gently releasing a rich sonorous note into the silence of the cave angharad began to singa low whisper of exhaled breath that gathered force to become an inarticulate moan deep in her throat the harp note pulsed quicker and the moan became a cry the cry became a word and the word a name rhi bran bran heard it and the small hairs on his arms stood up again and again angharad invoked the name and bran felt his heart quicken rhi bran king ravenhis own name and his rightful titlebut cast in a newer fiercer almost frightening light angharads fingers stroked a melody from the harp her voice rose to meet it and the tale of king raven began this is what she sang in the elder time when the dew of creation was still fresh on the ground bran bendigedig awakened in this worldsrealm a beautiful boy he grew to be a handsome man renowned amongst his people for his courage and valour and his valour was such that it was exceeded only by his virtue which was exceeded only by his wisdom which was itself exceeded only by his honesty bran the blessed he was called and no one who saw him doubted that if ever there was a man touched by the all wise and granted every boon in abundance it was he thus he possessed all that was needful for a life of utter joy and delight save one thing only a single blessing eluded him and that was contentment bran bendigedigs heart was restless always seeking never findingfor if it was known what would satisfy his unquiet heart that knowledge was more completely hidden than a single drop of water in all the oceans of the world and the knowledge of his lack grew to become a fire deep inside him that burned his bones and filled his mouth with the taste of ashes one day when he could endure his discontent no longer he put on his best boots kissed his mother and father farewell and began to walk i will not stop walking until i have found the thing which will quell my restless heart and fill this hunger in my soul thus he began a journey through many lands through kingdoms and dominions of every kind at the end of seven years he reached a distant shore and gazed across a narrow sea where he beheld the fairest island that he or anyone else had ever seen its white cliffs glowed in the dying sunlight like a wall of fine pale gold and larks soared high above the greentopped hills singing in the gentle evening air he wanted nothing more than to go to the island without delay but night was coming and he knew he could not reach the far shore in time so he settled down to spend the night on the strand intending to cross over the narrow sea with the next mornings new light unable to sleep he lay on the beach all night long listening to the fitful wash of the waves over the pebbles feeling as if his heart would burst for restlessness when the sun rose again he rose with it and looked out at the manysplendoured island as it lay before him in the midst of the silver sea then as the rising sun struck the white cliffs setting them aglow with a light that dazzled the eyes bran struck out drawing himself up to full height he grew until his head brushed the clouds whereupon he waded out into the narrow sea which reached only to the knot of his belt he reached the opposite shore in nine great strides emerging from the water at his normal height he spread his arms to the sun and while he stood waiting for the bright rays to dry his clothes he heard the most delightful music and he turned to see a lady on a milkwhite horse approaching a little way off the music arose from a flute that she played as she cantered along the waters edge in the sweet honeyed light of the rising sun her hair shone with the brightness of a flame and her skin was firm and soft her limbs were fine and straight her gown was yellow satin edged in blue and her eyes were green as new grass or apples in summer as she came near she caught sight of bran standing alone on the strand and she stopped playing i give you good greeting sir she said her voice so light and melodious melted bran in his innermost parts what is your name i am bran bendigedig said he i am a stranger here yet you are welcome said the lady i see that you are beguiled by the sight of this fair island that i am bran confessed but no less than by the sight of you my lady if ever i boast of seeing a fairer face in all this wide world may i die a liars death what is your name would that you had asked me anything else she told him sadly for i am under a strong geas never to reveal my name to anyone until the day of albions release if that is all that prevents you then take heart bran replied boldly for the moment she spoke those first words in his ear he knew beyond all doubt that the thing required to bring contentment to his restless heart was the name of the lady before himjust to know her name and knowing it to possess it and possessing it to hold her beside him forever with her as his wife his heart would find peace at last only tell me who or what albion might be bran said and i will achieve its release before the sun has run its course would that you had promised anything else the lady told him albion is the name of this place and it is the fairest island known ten years ago a plague came to these shores and it is this which now devastates the island every morning i come to the seastrand in the timebetweentimes in the hope of finding someone who can break the wicked spell that holds albion in thrall today your search has ended replied bran his confidence undimmed only tell me what to do and it will be done though your spirit may be bold and your hand strong albions release will take more than that many great men have tried but none have succeeded for the plague is no ordinary illness or disease it is an evil enchantment and it takes the form of a race of giants who by their mighty strength cause such havoc and devastation that my heart quails at the mere mention of them fear for nothing noble lady bran said the all wise in his boundless wisdom has granted me every good gift and i can do wonderfully well whatever i put my hand to at this the lady smiled and oh her smile was even more radiant than the sunlight on the shining cliffs the day you deliver albion i will give you my nameand more than that if you only ask then rest assured replied bran that on that very day i will return to ask for your hand and morei will ask for your heart also the lady bent her shapely neck in assent and then told him what he had to do to release albion from the evil spell and break the geas that bound her bran the blessed listened well to all she said then bidding her farewell he started off he came to a river that the lady had told him to expect then followed it to the centre of the isle for three days and nights he walked stopping only now and then to drink from the pure waters of the river for his heart burned within him at the thought of marrying the most beautiful woman in the world as the sun rose on the fourth day he came to a great dark woodthe forest from which all other forests in the world had their beginning he entered the forest and just as the lady had told him after walking three more days he came to a glade where two roads crossed he strode to the centre of the crossroads and sat down to wait after a time he heard the sound of someone approaching and looked up to see an old man with a white beard hobbling toward him the man was bent low to the ground beneath heavy bundles of sticks he was carrying so low that his beard swept the ground before him seeing this man whom the lady had told him to expect bran jumped up and hailed him you there you see before you a man of purpose who would speak to you and you see before you a man who was once a king in his own country the man replied a little respect would become you my lord forgive me replied bran may i come near and speak to you you may approachnot that i could prevent you answered the old man nevertheless he motioned bran to come near what is your name asked the old man i am bran bendigedig he answered i have come to seek the release of albion from the plague that assails it too bad for you said the bentbacked man straining beneath his load of sticks many good men have tried to break the spell as many as have tried that many have failed it may be as you say offered bran but i doubt there are two men like me in all the world if there is another i have never heard of him he explained how he had met the noble lady on the strand and had pledged himself to win her hand i ween that you are a bold man perhaps even a lucky one said the aged noble but though you were an army of likeminded hardy men you would still fail the enchantment that besets albion cannot be broken except by one thing and one thing alone what is that thing asked bran tell me and then stand back and watch what i will do it is not for me to say replied the former lord pointing to the road that led deeper into the forest the old man said go down that road until you come to a great forest and continue on until you come to a glade in the centre of the wood you will know it by a mound that is in the centre of the glade in the centre of the mound is a standing stone and at the foot of the standing stone you will find a fountain beside the fountain is a slab of white marble and on the slab you will find a silver bowl attached by a chain so that it may not be stolen away dip a bowl of water from the fountain and dash it upon the marble slab then stand aside and wait be patient and it will be revealed to you what to do bran thanked the man and journeyed on along the forest road in a little while he began seeing signs of devastation of which the noble lady had warned him houses burned fields trampled flat hills gouged out streams diverted from their natural courses whole trees uprooted overturned and thrust back into the hole with roots above and branches below the mutilated bodies of dead animals lay everywhere on the ground their limbs rent their bodies torn asunder away to the east a great fire burned a swathe through the high wooded hills blotting out the sun and turning the sky black with smoke bran looked upon this appalling destruction who could do such a thing he wondered and his heart moved within him with anger and sorrow for the ruined land he moved on walking through desolation so bleak it made tears well up in his eyes to think what had been so cruelly destroyed after two days he came to the glade in the centre of the forest there as the old man had said he saw an enormous mound and from the centre of this mound rose a tall slender standing stone bran ascended the mound and stood before the narrow stone there at his feet he saw a clearrunning fountain and beside it the marble slab with the silver bowl attached by a thick chain kneeling down he dipped the silver bowl into the fountain filled it and then dashed the water over the pale stone instantly there came a peal of thunder loud enough to shake the ground the wind blew with uncommon fury and hail fell from the sky so fiercely did it fall that bran feared it would beat through his skin and flesh to crack his very bones clinging to the standing stone he pressed himself hard against it for shelter covered his head with his arms and bore the assault as best he could in a short while the hail and wind abated and the thunder echoed away he heard then a grinding noiselike that of a millstone as it crushes the hard seeds of grain he looked and saw a crevice open in the ground and a yellow vapour issuing from the gap like a foul breath in the midst of the yellow fumes there appeared a womanso old and withered that she looked as if she might be made of sticks wrapped in a dried leather sack her hairwhat little remainedwas a tangled ratty mass of leaves and twigs moss and feathers and bird droppings her mouth was a slack gash in the lower part of her face through which bran could see but a single rotten tooth her clothing was a filthy rag so threadbare it resembled cobwebs and so small her withered dugs showed above one end and her spindly thighs below the other her face was more skull than visage her eyes sunken deep in their sockets where they gleamed like two shiny stones bran took but a single brief look before turning away swallowing his disgust as she advanced toward him you there she called her voice cracking like a dry husk do you know what you have done do you have any idea halfshielding his eyes with his hand bran offered a sickly smile and answered i have done that which was required of me nothing more oh have you now queried the hag by heavens lights you will soon wish you had not done that woman said bran i am wishing that already tell me your name and what it is that you want said the woman and i will see if there is any help for you i am bran bendigedig and i have come to break the vile enchantment that ravages albion i did not ask why you have come the old crone laughed i asked what it is that you want i was born with an unquiet heart that has never been satisfiednot that it is any of your affair bran told her silence screeched the woman in a voice so loud that bran clapped his hands over his ears lest he lose his hearing respect is a valuable treasure that costs nothing if you would keep your tongue see that it learns some courtesy forgive me bran spluttered it was not my wish to offend you if i spoke harshly just then it was merely from impatience you see i have met a noble lady who is all my hearts desire and i have set myself to win her if i can to do that i have vowed to rid albion of the plague that even now wreaks such havoc on this fairest of islands the wretched hag put her face close to bransso close that bran could smell the stink she gave off and had to pinch his nostrils shut she squinted her eyes with the intensity of her scrutiny is that what you are about she asked at last i am replied bran if you can help me i will be in your debt if not only tell me someone who can and i will trouble you no more you ask my help said the ancient woman and though you may not know it you could not have asked a better creature under heaven for help you shall receivethough it comes at a cost it is ever the way of things sighed bran what is the price i will tell you how to break the wicked enchantment that binds albionand i hope you succeed for unless you do albion is lost and will soon be a wasteland and the price asked bran feeling the restlessness beginning to mount like a sneeze inside him the price is this that on the day albion is released you will take the place of the man the giants have killed that is no burden to me remarked bran with relief i thought it would be more there are some who think the cost too great she shrugged her skinny shoulders and bran could almost hear them creak nevertheless that is the price do you agree i do said bran the blessed in truth i would pay whatever you asked to break the curse and win my hearts desire done done crowed the old woman in triumph then listen well and do exactly as i say laying her bony fingers on brans strong arm the hag led him from the mound and into the ruined forest they passed through death and devastation that would have made the very stones weep and walked on until they came to a high hill that was topped by a magnificent white fortress at the base of the hill flowed a river once sparkling and clear it now ran ruddy brown with the blood of the slaughtered pointing to the fortress the hag said up there you will find the tribe of giants who have enthralled this fair island and whose presence is a very plague kill them all and the spell will be broken and your triumph will be assured if that is all replied bran grandly why did you not tell me sooner it is as good as done he made to start off at once the ancient crone prevented him saying wait there is more you should know also that the giants have slain the lord of the forest and taken possession of his cauldron called the cauldron of rebirth on account of its miraculous virtue that whatever living creature man or animal it matters not though he were dead and dismembered mutilated torn into a thousand pieces and those pieces eaten if any part of the corpse is put into the cauldron when it is on the boil life will return and the creature will emerge hale and whole once more amazed bran exclaimed truly that is a wonder rest assured that i will stop at nothing to reclaim this remarkable vessel do so promised the hag and your deepest desire will be granted off he went crossing the river of blood and ascending the high hill as bran drew closer he saw that the white fortress was not as he had assumed built of choice marble but of the skulls and bones of murdered beasts and humans used like so much rubble to erect the high white walls turrets and towers a sickening smell rose from the bones which though it made him gag also raised brans fury against the giants boldly he approached the gate and boldly entered there was neither guard nor porter to prevent him so he strode across the courtyard and entered the hall however much the courtyard stank the odour inside the hall was that much worse from the hall he could hear the sound of a great roister he crept to the massive door peered inside and instantly wished he had not he saw seven giants the least of which was three times the height of any human man and the greatest amongst them was three times the height of the smallest each giant was a gruesomely ugly brute with pale blotchy skin shaggy long hair that hung down his broad back in nasty tangled hanks and a single large eyebrow across his thick overhanging forehead each giant was more hideous than the last with fat fleshy lips and an enormous long nose shaped like the beak of a malformed bird their necks were short and squat their arms ridiculously long and their legs thin through the shank and fat at the thigh they all carried clubs of iron which any two human men would have found a burden to lift three long tables filled the hall and on those tables was a feast of roast meat of every kind of creature under heaven which the giants ate with ravenous abandon while they aterending the carcasses with their hands stuffing the meat down their stubby necks spitting out the bones and then washing it all down with great greedy draughts of rendered lard and fat drawn from a score of vats around the hallthey laughed and sang in disagreeable voices and raised such a revel that brans head throbbed like a beaten drum with the noise the blessed bran stood for a moment gazing upon the carnage of the feast and felt an implacable rage rise inside him then across the hall he spied an enormous kettle of burnished bronze and copper silver and goldso large it could easily hold sixteen human men at once or three teams of oxen or nine horses or seven stags three deer and a fawn a fire of oak logs blazed away beneath the prodigious vessel seeing this bran thought the prize is within my grasp and taking a deep breath he stepped boldly through the door giants he called the feast is over you have eaten your last corpse i give you fair warningdoom is upon you the giants were startled to hear this loud voice and they were even more surprised when they saw the tiny man who made such a bold and foolish claim they laughed in their beards and blew their noses at him two of them bared their horrible backsides and the others mocked him with rude gestures up rose the chief of the monstrous clan and he was the most repulsive brute of them all taller than seven normal men he was greasy with the blood of the meat he had been gorging sneering he opened his gate of a mouth and bellowed what you lack in size you make up for in stupidity ive eaten five of your race already today and will gladly count you amongst them what is your name little man call me silidons for such i am said bran hiding his true name behind a word that means nobody you will have to kill me first and i have never lost a fight i entered then you cannot have entered many today we will put you to the test so saying the giant lifted his massive hand and commanded two of his nearest fellows forward seize him show this imbecile how we deal with anyone foolish enough to oppose us the two giants rose and lumbered forth their fleshy lips wide in distorted grins bran stepped forward and as he did so he grew in size to half again his height another step doubled his size now the crown of his head came up to the giants chests the giants saw this and were astonished but undaunted is that the best you can do they laughed taking up their iron clubs they swung at bran first one way and then the other bran leapt over the first and ducked under the second then leaping straight up into the air he lashed out with his foot and caught one of the giants in the middle of the forehead the great brute dropped his club and grabbed his head snatching up the enormous weapon bran swung with all his might and crushed the skull of the giant who gave out a throaty groan and lay still seeing his comrade bested so easily infuriated the second attacker roaring with rage he whirled his heavy club around his head and smashed it down cracking the flagstones bran stepped neatly aside as the club struck the floor then quickly climbed the broad shaft as if it were an iron mounting block when the giant lifted the club bran leapt into the brutes face and drove both fists into the giants eyes the ghastly creature screamed and fell to his knees clutching his eyes with both hands calmly bran picked up the club and swung hard the brute pitched forward onto his face and rose no more looking around he called who will be next crazed with fear and spitting with rage the remaining giants rose as one and charged bran who ran to meet them growing bigger with every step until he was a head taller than the tallest four blows were thrown one after another and four giants fell leaving only the enormous chieftain still on his feet not only bigger he was also quicker than the others and before bran could turn he reached out and seized bran by the throat drawing a deep breath bran willed his neck to become a column of white granite with all his strength the giant chieftain could not break that thick column meanwhile bran took hold of the giants protruding ears grabbing one in each hand he yanked hard pulling the giant chieftain forward and driving the point of his granite chin right between the odious monsters bulging eyes the giants knees buckled and he tumbled backwards like a toppled pine tree striking his head on the stone floor and expiring before he could draw his next breath triumphant bran strode to the hearth and plucked the stillbubbling cauldron from the flames grasping the miraculous pot in his strong arms of stone bran walked from the castle of bone back to the world outside where he once again met the ancient hag who was waiting for him the hag jumped up and scurried to meet him truly you are a mighty champion she cried from this day you are my husband bran glanced at her askance lady if lady you be i am no such thing he declared you said i would achieve my greatest desire and marriage to you is far from that and even if i were so minded i could not for i am promised to another the wildhaired hag opened her gaping toothless mouth and laughed in brans face man of little understanding do you not know that whoever possesses the cauldron of rebirth is the lord of the forest he is my husband and i am his wife reaching out she seized him with her scaly clawlike hands and pressed her drooling lips close to his face repulsed bran reared back and shook off her grip he started to run away but she pursued him with uncanny swiftness bran changed himself into a stag and bolted away at speed but the hag became a wolf and raced after him when bran saw that he could not elude her that way he changed into a rabbit the hag changed into a fox and matched him stride for stride when he saw that she was gaining on him bran changed into an otter slid into the clearrunning stream and swam away the hag however changed into a great salmon and caught him by the tail bran felt the hags teeth biting into him and leapt from the stream dragging the salmon with him once out of the water the salmon loosed its hold and instantly bran turned into a raven and flew away but the hag now become an eagle flew up seized him in her strong talons and pulled him from the sky you led me on a fine chase but i have caught you my proud raven she cackled with glee resuming her former repulsive shape and now you must marry me squirming and pecking at the bony fingers clasped tightly around him bran still in the form of a raven cried i never will i have promised myself to another even now she is waiting for me on the shining shore bran bran said the hag do you not know that i am that selfsame woman smiling grotesquely she told him all that had happened to him since meeting him that very morning on the strand where she went every day in the guise of a beautiful lady to search for a champion to become her mate it was myself you promised to take to wife she concluded now lie with me and do your duty as a husband horrified bran cried out i never will since you refuse said the old woman still clutching him between her hands you leave me no choice with that she spat into her right hand and rubbed her spittle on brans sleek head saying a raven you are and a raven you shall remainuntil the day you fulfil your vow to take me to wife the hag released bran then and he found that though he could still change his shape at willnow one creature now anotherhe always assumed the form of a raven in the end thus he took up his duties as rhi bran the hud lord of the forest whom some call the dark enchanter of the wood and from that day to this he abides as a great black raven still the last note faded into silence laying aside the harp angharad gazed at the rapt young man before her and said that is the song of king raven dream on it my son and let it be a healing dream to you part three the may dance chapter warm winds from the sea brought an early spring and a wet one from saint davids day to the feast of saint john the sky remained a low slategrey expanse of dribbling rain that swelled the streams and rivers throughout the marches then the skies finally cleared and the land dried beneath a sun so bright and warm that the miserable outlanders in their rusting mail almost forgot the hardships of the winter past the first wildflowers appeared and with them wagons full of tools and building materials rolling into the valley from baron de braoses extensive holdings in the south the old dirt trackways were not yet firm enough but baron de braose was eager to begin so the first wagons to reach the valley churned the soft earth into deep muddy trenches to swamp all those who would come after from morning to night the balmy air was filled with the calls of the drivers the crack of whips and the bawling of the oxen as they struggled to haul the heavyladen vehicles through the muck the cymry also returned to the lower valleys from their winter sanctuaries in the high hills although most had fled the cantref a few remainedfarmers for the most part who could not like the sheep and cattle herders simply take their property elsewhereand a few of the more stubborn herdsmen who had contemplated their choices over the winter and concluded that they were unwilling to give up good grazing land to the ffreinc the farmers began readying their fields for sowing and the herdsmen returned to the pastures following the ageold pattern of the clans from time past rememberingworking through the season of sun and warmth storing up for the season of rain and ice when they took their ease in communal dwellings around a shared hearththe people of the region silently reasserted their claim to the land of their ancestors for the first time since the arrival of the ffreinc elfael began to assume something of its former aspect count falkes de braose considered the reappearance of the british a good sign it meant he thought that the people had decided to accept life under his rule and would recognise him as their new overlord he still intended to press them into helping build the town the baron requiredand the castles too if neededbut beyond that he had no other plans for them so long as they did what they were told and with swift obedience he and the local population would achieve a peaceable association of course any opposition to his rule would be met with fierce retaliationstill that was the way of the world and only to be expected no anticipating a solid season of industrya town to raise and border fortifications to be establishedthe count sent a messenger to the monastery to remind bishop asaph of his duty to supply british labourers to supplement the ranks of builders the baron would provide he then busied himself with supervising the allotment of tools and materials for the various sites together with the architect and master mason he inspected each of the sites to make sure that nothing had been overlooked and all was in readiness he personally marked out the boundaries for the various towers and castle ditch enclosures spending long days beneath the blue cloudcrowded sky and counted it work well done he wanted to be ready when the barons promised builders arrived time was short and there was much to be done before the autumn storms brought an end to the years labour nothing would be allowed to impede the progress he meant to make only too aware that his future hung by the slender thread of his uncle the barons good pleasure falkes agonised over his arrangements he ate little and slept less worrying himself into a state of near exhaustion over the details large and small on a sunny windblown morning the master mason approached falkes on one of his visits to the building sites if it please you sire i would like to begin tomorrow he said having supervised the raising of no fewer than seven castles in normandie master gernaud with his red face beneath his battered straw hat and faded yellow sweat rag around his neckwas a solid veteran of the building trade these were to be the first castles he had raised outside france nothing would please me more the count replied pray begin master gernaud and may god speed your work we will soon have need of the rough labourers the mason pointed out it has been arranged replied the count with confidence you shall have them two days passed however and none of the required british volunteers appeared when after a few more days not a single british worker had come to any of the building sites falkes de braose sent for bishop asaph and demanded to know why have you spoken to them asked falkes leaning on the back of his oversized chair the hall was empty save for the count and his guest every available handexcepting his personal servants and a few soldiers required to keep the fortress in orderhad been sent to help with the construction i have done as you required replied the churchman in a tone suggesting he could do no more than that did you tell them we must have the town established each day delayed is another day we must work in the winter cold i told them said asaph then where are they queried falkes growing irate at the inconvenience perpetrated by the absent locals why dont they come they are farmers not quarrymen or masons it is ploughing season and the fields must be prepared for sowing they dare not delay otherwise there will be no harvest he paused plucked up his courage and added last years harvest was very poor as you know and unless they are allowed to put in their crops the people will starve they are hungry enough already what cried falkes do you suggest this is in any way my fault they fled their holdings the ignorant louts were in no danger but they fled anyway the blame lies with them i merely state the fact that the farmers of elfael were prevented from gathering in the harvest last year and now there is precious little ready food in the valleys they should have thought of that before they ran off and abandoned their fields falkes cried slapping the back of the chair with his long hands what of their cattle let them slaughter a few of those if theyre hungry the cattle are the only wealth they possess lord count they cannot slaughter them anyway the herds must be built up through the summer if there is to be food enough to see them through the winter this is not my concern falkes insisted this problem is of their own making and will not be laid at my door count de braose said the bishop in a conciliatory tone they are simple folk and they were afraid of your troops their king and warband had just been slain they feared for their lives what did you expectthat they would rush with glad hosannas to welcome you that tongue of yours will get you hanged yet priest warned de braose wagging a long finger in warning i would guard it if i were you will that help raise your castles asked asaph i merely point out that if they ran away it was for good reason they are afraid and nothing they have seen from you has changed that i meant them no harm insisted the count growing petulant nor do i mean them harm now but the town will be raised and the fortresses will be built this commot will be settled and civilised and that is the end of it crossing his arms over his narrow chest falkes thrust out his chin as if daring the churchman to disagree bishop asaph squeezed between the rock of the counts demands and the hard place of his peoples obstinate resistance to any such scheme decided there was no harm in trying to mitigate the damage and ingratiate himself with the count i see you are determined he said might i offer a suggestion if you must granted falkes it is only this why not wait until the fields have been sown and planted suggested the churchman once the crops are in the people will be more amenable to helping with the building grant them a reprieve until the sowing is finished they will thank you for it and it will demonstrate your fairness and good faith dieu d fend delay the building that i will not do cried falkes he took three quick strides and then turned on the bishop once more here now i give you one more day to inform the people and assemble the required labourersthe two strongest men from each family or settlement they will come to your monastery where they will be met and assigned to one of the building sites glaring at the frowning cleric he said is that understood of course the bishop replied diffidently but what if they refuse to come i can only relay your demands i am not their lord but i am snapped falkes and yours as well when the bishop made no reply he asked if they fail to comply they will be punished i will tell them see that you do falkes dismissed the churchman then as asaph reached the door the count added i will come to the monastery yard at dawn tomorrow the workers will be ready the bishop nodded departing without another word upon arriving at the monastery he commanded the porter to sound the bell and convene the monks who were quickly dispatched to the four corners of the cantref to carry the counts summons to the people when count de braose and his men arrived at the monastery the next morning they found fifteen surly men and four quarrelsome boys standing in the mostly empty yard with their bishop the count rode through the gate took one look at the desultory crew and cried what is this all where are the others there are no others replied bishop asaph i distinctly said two from every holding complained the count i thought i made that dear some of the holdings are so small that there is only one man explained the bishop indicating the sullen gathering he said these represent every holding in elfael looking at the unhappy faces around him he asked the count did you think there would be more there must be more roared falkes de braose work is already falling behind for lack of labourers we must have more that is as it may be but i have done as you commanded it is not enough then perhaps you should have invaded a more populous cantref snipped the cleric do not mock me growled the count turning away he strode to his horse find more workers bring them in bring everybody inwomen too bring them all i want them here tomorrow morning my lord count said the bishop i beg you to reconsider the ploughing will soon be finished that is of utmost concern and it cannot wait my town cannot wait shouted falkes raising himself to the saddle he said i will not be commanded by the likes of you have fifty workers here tomorrow morning or one holding will burn count de braose cried the bishop you cannot mean that surely i do most certainly mean exactly what i say i have been too lenient with you people but that leniency is about to end but you must reconsider must must the count sneered stepping his horse close to the cleric who shrank away who are you to tell me what i must or must not do have the fifty or lose a farm with that the count wheeled his horse and rode from the yard as the ffreinc reached the gate one of the boys picked up a stone and let fly striking the count in the middle of the back falkes whirled around angrily but could not tell who had thrown the rock all were standing with hands at their sides staring with dour contempt men as well as boys unwilling to allow the insult to stand falkes rode back to confront them who threw the stone he demanded when no one answered he called to the bishop make them tell me they do not speak latin replied the churchman coolly they only speak cymry and a little saxon then you ask for me priest said the count and be quick about it i want an answer the bishop addressed the group and there was a brief discussion it seems that no one saw anything count the cleric reported but they all vow to keep a close watch for such disgraceful behaviour in the future do they indeed well for one at least there will be no future indicating a smirking lad standing off to one side the count spoke a command in ffreinc to his soldiers and instantly two of the marchogi dismounted and rounded on the panicstricken youth the elder britons leapt forward to intervene but were prevented by the swiftly drawn swords of the remaining soldiers after a momentary scuffle and much shouting the offending youngster was marched to the centre of the yard where he was made to stand while the count drawing his sword approached his quivering bawling prisoner wait stop cried the bishop no please dont kill him asaph rushed forward to place himself between the count and his victim but two of the soldiers caught him and dragged him back please spare the child he will work for you all summer if you spare him do not kill him i beg you count de braose tested the blade and then raised his arm and with a fury born of frustration yanked down the boys trousers and struck the boys exposed backside with the flat of his swordonce twice and again thin red welts appeared on the pale white skin and the boy began to wail with impotent fury satisfied with the punishment the count sheathed his sword then raised his foot and placed his boot against the crying lads wounded rump and gave him a hard shove the boy his legs tangled in his trousers stumbled and fell on his chin in the dirt where he lay weeping hot tears of pain and humiliation the count turned from his victim strode to his horse and mounted the saddle once more tomorrow i want fifty men here ready to work he announced fifty do you hear he paused as the bishop translated his words fifty workmen or by heaven a farm will burn his words were still ringing in the yard as he and his soldiers rode out the next morning there were twentyeight workers waiting when the counts men arrived and most of those were monks as the entire monasterysave aged brother clyro who was too old to be of much use at heavy labourrallied to the cause bishop asaph hastened to explain the deficit and promised more workers the next day but the count was not of a mood to listen since the tally was short the required number the count ordered his soldiers to ride to the nearest farm and put it to the torch later the smoke from the burning darkened the sky to the west and the following day eighteen more cymryten men six women and two more boysjoined the labour force bringing the total to fortysix only four shy of the number decreed by the count falkes de braose and his men entered the yard to find the bishop on his knees before a sulky and fearful gathering of native cymry and monks the bishop pleaded with the count to rescind his order and accept those who had come as sufficient fulfilment of his demand when that failed to sway the implacable overlord asaph stretched himself out on the ground before the count and begged for one more day to find workers to make up the number the count ignored his entreaties and ordered another holding to be burned that night the monks offered prayers of deliverance all night long the next morning four more workers appearedtwo of them women with babes in armsbringing up the total to the required fifty and no more farms were destroyed chapter ith the onset of warmer weather bran felt more and more restless confined to the cave angharad observed his discontent and on fine days allowed him to sit outside on a rock in the sun but she never let him venture too far and he was rarely out of her sight for more than a moment or two at a time bran was still weaker than he knew and his eagerness to resume his flight to the north made him prone to overtax himself he mistook convalescence for indolence and resented it seldom missing an opportunity to let angharad know he felt himself a prisoner under her care this was natural enough she knew but there was more lately brans sleep had grown fitful and erratic several times as dawn light broke in the east he had called out when she rose and went to him he was asleep still but sweating and breathing hard the reason angharad suspected was that the story was working on him his acceptance of the tale that night had been complete weak from his wandering in the snow his fatigue had left him in an unusually receptive conditionunusual that is for one so strongwilled and naturally contrary he had been in that state of alert serenity the bards called the trwyddo ennyd the seeding time and which they recognised as a singular moment for learning this condition of attentive repose allowed the song to sink deep into brans being passing beneath his alltooready defences now it was under his skin burrowing deep into his bones seeping into his soul changing him from the inside out though he did not know it there would come a day when the meaning would break upon him maybe sooner maybe later but it would come and for this as much as for the progress of his healing angharad watched him so that she would be there when it happened she also made plans one day as bran sat outside in a pool of warm sunlight angharad appeared with an ashwood stave in her hand she came to where he sat and said stand up bran yawning he did so and she placed the length of wood against his shoulder what is this he asked measuring me for a druid staff in his restlessness he had begun mocking her quaintly antiquated ways the wise woman knew the source of his impatience and astutely ignored it nay nay she said you would have to spend seventeen years at least before you could hold one of thoseand you would have had to begin before your seventh summer this she said placing the stave in his hands is your next occupation herding sheep if that is your desire i had something else in mind but the choice is yours he looked at the slender length of wood almost as long as he was tall it had a good heft and balance a bow he guessed you want me to make a bow she smiled and here i was thinking you slowwitted yes i want you to make a bow bran examined the length of ash once more he held it up and looked down its length here and there it bent slightly out of truenot so badly that it could not be workedbut that was not the problem no he said at last it cannot be done the old woman looked at the stave and then at bran why not master bran do not call me that he said roughly i am a nobleman remember a princenot a common tradesman you ceased being a prince when you abandoned your people she said though her voice was quiet her manner was unforgiving and bran felt the nowfamiliar rush of shame it was not the first time she had berated him for his plan to flee elfael laying a hand on the stave she said tell me why the wood cannot be worked it is too green replied bran petulance making his voice low explain please if you knew anything about making a longbow you would know that you cannot simply cut a branch and begin shaping you must first season the wood cure it a year at least otherwise it will warp as it dries and will never bend properly he made to hand the length of ash back to her you can make a druid staff out of it perhaps but not a bow and what leads you to think i have not already seasoned this wood have you bran asked a year not a year no she said well then he shrugged and again tried to give the stave back to her two years she told him i kept it wrapped in leather so it would not dry too quickly two years he repeated suspiciously i dont believe you in truth he did believe her he simply did not care to consider the more farreaching implications of her remark angharad had turned away and was moving toward the cave sit she said i will bring you the tools bran settled himself on the rock once more he had made a bow only twice as a lad but he had seen them made countless times his fathers warriors regularly filled their winter days as well as the hall itself with sawdust and wood shavings as they sat around the fire regaling each other with their impossible boasts and lies for battle the longbow was the prime weapon of choice for all true sons of prydein and a fair few of her fearless daughters too in skilled hands a stout warbow was a formidable weaponlight durable easily made with materials ready to hand and above all devastatingly deadly bran like most every child who had grown up in the secluded valleys and rough hills of the west had been taught the bowmans art from the time he could stand on his own two unsteady legs as a boy he had often gone to sleep with raw throbbing fingers and aching arms at seven years he had earned a permanent scar on his left wrist from the lash of the bowstring all summer at eight he had brought down a young boar all by himselfa gift for his dying mother although hunting had ceased to interest him after that he had continued to practise with the warband and by his thirteenth year he could pull a mans bow and put a fowlers arrow through the eye of a crow perched on a standing stone three hundred paces away this was not a skill unique to himself every warrior he knew could do the sameas well as any farmer worth his salt the ability to direct an arrow with accuracy over implausible lengths was a common but no less highly prized facility and one which made best use of another of the weapons considerable qualities it allowed a combatant to strike from a distance silently if need bea virtue unequalled by any other weapon bran knew when angharad shortly reappeared with an adz a pumice stone and several wellhoned chisels and knives from her trove of unknown treasures somewhere deep in the cave bran set to work tentatively at first but with growing confidence as his hands remembered their craft soon he was toiling away happily sitting on his rock in the warm sun stripping the bark from the admittedly wellseasoned length of ash as he worked he listened to the birds in the greening trees round about and attuned his ears to the forest sounds this became as she had intended his principal occupation as the days passed angharad noticed that when he was working on the bow bran fretted less and was more content on days when it rained he sat in the cave entrance beneath the overhanging ledge and laboured there slowly the slender length of ash took form beneath his hands he worked with deliberate care there was no hurry after all he knew he was not yet fit enough for the journey across the mountains it would be high summer when that day came and by then the bow would be finished and ready to use bran still planned on leaving as soon as his wrinkled physician pronounced him hale and whole once more he would wish her farewell and leave the forest and elfael without looking back but one day as he thought about his plan something awakened inside hima vague uneasiness almost like a grinding in the pit of his stomach it was a mildly disagreeable feeling and he quickly turned his attention to something else from that moment however the discomfort returned whenever his thoughts happened to touch on the point of his leaving at first he considered it a form of discontent a daylight manifestation of the same restlessness he often experienced at night even so the subtle anxiety was growing and all too soon bran began experiencing a bitter unpleasant taste in his mouth whenever he thought about any aspect of his future whatsoever unwilling to confront the pain fermenting inside him bran pushed down the disagreeable feeling and ignored it but there deep in the inner core of his hidden heart it festered and grew as he worked the woodshaping it smoothing it slowly creating just the right curve along the belly and back so that it would bend uniformly along its lengthand he forgot the blight that was spreading in his soul when at last he had the stave shaped just right he brought it to angharad passing it to her with an absurdly inordinate sense of achievement he could not stop grinning as she held the smooth ashwood bow in her rough square hands and tested the bend with her weight well he asked unable to contain himself any longer what do you think i think i was right to call you master bran she replied you have a craftsmans aptitude for the tools it is good is it not he said reaching out to stroke the smooth tightgrained wood the stave was excellent you worked it well she told him handing it back i cannot say when ive seen a finer bow ash is good he allowed although yew is better glancing up he caught angharads eye and added i dont blame you mind it is difficult to find a serviceable limb ah well just you finish this she told him i want to see if you can hunt with it he caught the challenge in her words you think i could not bring down a stag or a boar even maybe a small one she allowed teasing if it was also slow of foot and weakhearted i do not hunt anymore he told her but if i did id bring back the biggest swiftest strongest stag youve ever seena genuine lord of the forest she regarded him with a curious birdbright eye his use of the term tantalised could it be that her pupil was ready for the next step on his journey finish the bow first master bran she said and then well see what we shall see completing his work on the bow took longer than he expected obtaining the rawhide for the grip slicing it thin and braiding it so that it could be wound tightly around the centre of the stave was the work of several days making the bowstring proved an even more imposing task bran had never made a bowstring those were always provided by one of the women of the caer faced with this chore he was not entirely certain which material was best or where it might be found he consulted angharad they used hemp he told her also flaxi think but i dont know where they got it hemp is easy enough to find given a little time i could get flax too which would you prefer either he said whichever can be got soonest you shall have it two days later angharad presented him with a bound bundle of dried hemp stalks you will have to strip it and beat it to get the threads she told him i can show you the next sunny day found them outside the cave cutting off the leaves and small stems and then beating the long fibrous stalks on a flat stone once the stalks began to break down it was easy work to pull the loosened threads away the long outer fibres were tough and hairy but the inner ones were finer and these bran carefully collected into a tidy coiled heap now they must be twisted bran told her selecting a few of the better strands he tied them to a willow branch while angharad slowly steadily turned the branch bran patiently wound the long threadlike fibres over one another carefully adding in new ones as he went along to increase the length the process was repeated until he had six long strings of twisted strands which were then tightly and painstakingly braided together to make two bowstrings of three braided strands each determining the length of the bowstring took some time too bran had to string and unstring the bow a dozen times before he was happy with the bend and suppleness of the draw when he finished he proclaimed himself satisfied with the result and declared now for the arrows making arrows was not a chore he had ever undertaken either but like the other tasks he had watched it done often enough to know the process willow is easiest to work but difficult to find in suitable lengths he mused aloud before the fire while angharad cooked their supper beech and birch also ash alder and hornbeam are sturdier oak is the most difficult to shape but it is strongest of all it is also heavier so the arrows do not fly as fargood for hunting bigger animals though he added and for battle of course each of those trees abounds in the forest angharad offered tomorrow we can go out together and find some branches very well agreed bran it would be the first time he had been allowed to walk into the forest since the winter ramble that had sent him back to his sickbed even so he did not want to appear too excited lest angharad change her mind if you think im ready bran she said gently you are not a prisoner here he nodded adopting a diffident air but inwardly he was very much a prisoner yearning for release the next day they walked a short distance into the wood to select suitable branches from various trees the arrow tips will be difficult to make bran offered swinging the axe as they walked along if i could get back into the caer id soon have all the arrowheads i needed arrows too what about flint the idea of a stonetipped arrow was so oldfashioned it made bran chuckle i doubt if anyone alive in all of britain still knows how to make an arrowhead of flint now it was angharads turn to laugh there is one in the island of the mighty who remembers bran stopped walking and stared after her who are you angharad when she did not answer he hurried to catch her i mean it who are you that you know all these things and i have already told you tell me again angharad stopped turned and faced him will you listen this time and listening will you believe i will try she shook her head no you are not ready she resumed her pace angharad bawled bran in frustration please anyway what difference does it make whether i believe or not just tell me angharad stopped again it makes a world of difference she declared solemnly it matters so much that sometimes it takes my breath away greater than life or death greater than this world and the world to come there is no end to the amount of difference it can make she moved on but bran did not follow you speak in riddles how am i to understand you when you talk like that angharad turned on him with a sudden fury that forced him back a step what did you do with your life master bran she demanded accusingly more to the point what will you do with your life now that you have it back bran started to protest but shut his mouth even as he drew breath to speak it was futile to challenge herbetter to keep quiet answer me that she told him and then i will answer you bran glared back at her what reply could he make that she would not revile nothing to say inquired angharad with sweet insincerity i thought not think long before you speak again her words stung him like a slap and they did more they ripped open the hole into which he had pushed all the festering blackness in his soulsoon to come welling up with a vengeance chapter lthough spies had long ago confirmed his suspicionsthree castles were being erected on the borders of elfael baron neufmarche wished to see the de braose bastionbuilding venture for himself now that warmer weather had come to the valleys he thought it time to pay another visit to the count along the way he could visit his british minions and see how the spring planting progressed as overlord of a subject people it never hurt to make an unannounced appearance now and then to better judge the mood and temper of those beneath his rule lord cadwgan had given him little trouble during his reign and for that the baron was shrewd enough to be grateful but with the longawaited expansion into welsh territory begun neufmarche thought it would be best to see how things stood on the ground reward loyalty and industry and snuff out any sparks of discontent before they could catch fire with this in mind the baron struck out one bright morning with a small entourage for caer rhodl the stronghold of king cadwgan upon his arrival two days later the welsh king received him with polite if subdued courtesy my lord neufmarche said cadwgan emerging from his hall i wonder that you did not send your steward ahead so i would know to expect you then you would have received a proper welcome my thanks all the same but i did not know i was coming here myself lied the baron with a genial smile i was already on the road when i decided to make this stop i expect no ceremony here ride with mei have it in mind to inspect the fields the king called for horses to be saddled so that he and his steward and a few warriors of his retinue could accompany the baron together they rode out from the stronghold into the countryside winter was hard hereabouts asked the baron amiably hard enough replied the king harder for those in the next cantref he indicated elfael to the north with a slight lift of his chin aye he continued as if just considering it for the first time they lost the harvest and that was bad enough but now they have been prevented from planting truly wondered baron neufmarche with genuine curiosity any word of others difficulties interested him why is that do you know its that new countthat kinsman of de braose first he runs them all off and now that he has them back hes herded them together and hes making them work on his accursed fortresses he is building fortresses wondered the baron he gazed at the king with an innocent expression aye three of them replied the king grimly thats what i hear he concluded and i have no reason to believe otherwise very ambitious granted baron neufmarche i would not think he needed such fortification to govern little elfael nay its his uncle the baron who has eyes on the cantrefs to the north and west he means to take as much as he can grab so it would seem aye and i know it greedy bastards swore cadwgan they cannot even rule the commot theyve been given what do they want with more land the king spat again and shook his head slowlyas if contemplating a ruin that could easily be avoided mark my words nothing good will come of this the baron sighed i fear you could be right upon reaching the holding the baron made a thorough inspection asked many questions of the farmersabout the last harvest the new planting the adequacy of the spring rainsand walked out into one of the fields where he bent down and rubbed dirt between his hands as if testing the worth of the soil at the end of his survey he professed himself well pleased with the farmers efforts and called to his seneschal to send the head of the settlement two casks of good dark ale as a token of his thanks and good wishes the baron and the king rode on to the next holding where the herdsmen were grazing cattle the baron asked how the cattle had fared during the winter and how it was going with the spring calving and whether they would see a good increase this year he received a favourable reply in each case and after concluding his enquiry ordered two more casks of ale to be sent to the settlement then turning their horses the party rode back to the caer where king cadwgan commanded his cooks to prepare a festive supper in honour of his overlords unexpected though not altogether unwelcome visit the baron had made cadwgan feel like a knowledgeable confidant a trusted advisor and for that he ordered the best of what he had to offer beeswax candles for the board fine woven cloths to dress the table silver plates on which to eat and silver cups for the wine he had been saving for such an occasion and choice slices from the haunch of venison aging in the larder fresh straw was to be spread on the floor and a fragrant fire of apple wood and heather lit in the hearth you will put your feet beneath my board tonight cadwgan told him and allow me to show you true cymry hospitality i would like nothing better replied the baron pleased with how well his scheme was coming together the king ordered his steward to conduct the baron to a chamber for his use and to prepare water for washing when you are ready come join me in the hall i will have a jar waiting the baron dutifully obeyed his host and after refreshing himself in his room returned a little while later to the hall where he was delighted to see that two beautiful young women had joined them they were standing on each side of the hearth where a fire brightly burned baron neufmarche announced the king i present my daughter merian and her cousin essylt merian slightly older of the two tall and willowy with long dark hair was wearing a simple gown of pale green linen her cousin essylt fair with a pleasant plump face and a delicate mouth was dressed in a gown the colour of fresh butter both possessed an air of demure yet guileless confidence merian regarded him with frank appraisal as she extended a small wooden trencher with pieces of bread torn from a loaf be welcome here baron neufmarche she said in a voice so soft and low that it sent a pang of longing through the barons tough heart may you want for nothing while you are here said essylt stepping forward with a small dish of salt in her cupped hands i am charmed my ladies professed the baron speaking the complete truth for the first time that day taking a piece of bread from the offered board he dipped it in the salt and ate it peace to this house tonight he said offering his hand your servant baron neufmarche replied the kings daughter she accepted the barons hand performed a graceful curtsy and bowed her head her long dark curls parted slightly exposing the nape of a slender neck and the curve of a shapely shoulder as i am yours said the baron delighted by the splendid young woman although he also accepted the courtesy of the young woman called essylt his eyes never left the darkhaired beauty before him father tells me you approve of the fieldwork said merian not waiting to be addressed indeed replied the baron it is good work and well done and the herdsthey were also to your liking i have rarely seen better answered the baron politely your people know their cattleas i have always said i am pleased well then i expect we shall see an increase in our taxes again this year she said with a crisp smile here now objected her father quickly he gave the forthright young woman a glance of fierce disapproval to the baron he said please forgive my daughter she is of a contrary mind and sometimes forgets her place that is true acknowledged merian lightly i do humbly beg your pardon so saying she offered another little bow which although performed with simple grace was in no way deferential pardon granted replied the baron lightly despite the glancing sting of her remarkwhich would certainly have earned a less winsome subject stiff punishmentthe baron found it easy to forgive her and was glad for the opportunity to do so her direct uncomplicated manner was refreshing it put him in mind of a spirited young horse that has yet to be trained to the halter he would he considered give much to be the man to bring her to saddle the two young women were sent to fetch the jars the king had ordered they returned with overflowing cups which they offered the king and his noble guest the two made to retreat then but the baron said please stay join us to the king he said i find the company of ladies often a pleasant thing when taking my evening meal queer as the request might be cadwgan was not about to offend his guestthere were matters he wished to negotiate before the night was finishedso he lauded the idea of course of course i was just about to suggest the same thing myself merian essylt you will stay merian fetch your mother and tell her we will all dine together tonight merian dipped her head in acquiescence to this odd suggestion so neither her father nor his guest saw her large dark eyes roll in derision the king then offered a health to the baron and to king william may god bless his soul hear hear seconded the baron with far more zeal than he felt in truth he still nursed a grudge against the king for the humiliation suffered at red williams hands when the baron had last been summoned to court still he drank heartily and asked after his subject lords interest in hunting the conversation grew warm and lively then queen anora joined them after a while to say that dinner was ready and they all could be seated the dining party moved to the board then and baron bernard contrived to have merian sit beside him the party dined well if not extravagantly and the baron enjoyed himself far more than at any time in recent memory the nearness of the enchanting creature next to him proved as stimulating as any cup of wine and he availed himself of every opportunity to engage the young ladys attention by passing along news of royal affairs in lundein which he imagined would be of interest to her as they were to every young lady he had ever known the meal ended all too soon the baron unable to think how to prolong it bade his host a good night and retired to his chamber where he lay awake a long time thinking about king cadwgans lovely darkhaired daughter chapter bran and angharad spent the next days collecting branches suitable for arrows the best of these were bundled and carried back to the clearing outside the cave where bran set to work trimming off leaves and twigs stripping bark arranging the raw lengths in the sun and turning them as they dried he worked alone with calm purposeful intent outwardly placid his heart was nevertheless in turmoilunquiet gnawing inwardly on itself with ravenous discontentas if starving he hungered for something he could not name meanwhile angharad dug chunks of flint from a nearby riverbank to make points for brans arrows with a tidy heap of rocks before her she settled herself crosslegged on the ground a folded square of sheepskin on one knee then taking up a piece of flint she placed it on the pad of sheepskin and using a small copper hammer began tapping from time to time she would use an eggshaped piece of sandstone to smooth the piece she was working on occasionally she chose the front tooth of a cow to apply pressure along the worked edge to flake off a tiny bit of flint with practised precision angharad shaped each small point working in companionable silence she and bran bent to their respective tasks with only the sound of her slow rhythmic tap tap tap between them when bran had fifteen shafts finished and angharad an equal number of flint tips they began gathering feathers for the flightsgoose and red kite and swan the goose and swan they picked up at disused nests beside the river which lay a half days walk to the northwest of the cave the red kite feathers they got from another nest this one in a stately elm at the edge of a forest meadow together they cut the feathers stripped one side trimmed them to length and then bound the prepared flight to the end of the shaft with narrow strips of leather bran carefully notched the other end and slotted in one of angharads flint tips which was securely bound with wet rawhide the resulting arrow looked to bran like something from an era beyond recall but it was perfectly balanced and he expected would fly well enough with a few serviceable arrows to tuck into his belt the next thing was to try the longbow his first attempt to draw the bowstring sent crippling pain through his chest and shoulder it was such a surprise that he let out a yelp and almost dropped the weapon the arrow spun from the string and slid through the grass before striking the root of a tree he tried two more times before giving up dejected and sore why downcast master bran angharad chided when she found him slumped against the rock outside the cave a little later did you expect to attain your former strength in one day on his next attempt he lengthened the string to make the bow easier to draw and tried again this improved the outcome somewhat but not by muchthe arrow flew in an absurdly rounded arc to fall a few dozen paces away a child might produce a similar effect but it was progress after a few more equally dismal attempts his shoulder began to ache so he put the bow away and went in search of more branches to make arrows this was to become his habit by day working with the bow slowly increasing his strength struggling to reclaim his shattered skills until the ache in his shoulder or chest became too great to ignore and then putting aside the bow to go off in search of arrow wood or dig in the cliff side for good flints if he appeared to toil away happily enough by day each evening he felt the change come over him with the drawing in of the night always he sat at the fireside staring at the flames moody peevish petulant angharad still sang to him but bran could no longer concentrate on the songs ever and again he drifted in his mind to a dark and lonely place invariably becoming lost in it and overwhelmed by sudden palpable feelings of hopelessness and despair finally one night as angharad sang the tale of rhonabwys dream he raised his head and shouted do you have to play that stupid harp all the time and the singing why cant you just shut up for once the old woman paused the melody still ringing from the harp strings she held her head to one side and regarded him intently as if she had just heard the echo of a word long expected and stop staring at me bran snapped just leave me to myself so she said quietly laying aside the harp we come to it at last bran turned his face away her habit of simply accepting his outbursts was maddening angharad gathered her ragged skirts and stood she shuffled around the fire ring to stand before him the time has come master bran follow me no he said stubbornly and stop calling me that i will call you by a better name when you have earned one you ugly old crone he growled savagely you are nothing i cannot stand another moment of your insane mumbling i am leaving he glared at her fists clenched on his knees tomorrow i will go and nothing you say can stop me if that is your choice i will not prevent you she told him moving to the mouth of the cave she paused and beckoned him tonight however you will come with me i have something to show you with that she turned on her heel and went out into the night she waited for a moment and when he did not come she called him again reluctantly and with much bitter complaining bran emerged from the cave it was dark and the pathways she walked could not be seen yet somehow her feet unerringly found the way bran soon stopped grumbling and concentrated instead on keeping up with the old woman and avoiding the branches that reached out and slapped at him they walked for some time and as bran began to tire much of the anger dissipated where are we going he asked at last sweating now slightly winded is it much farther if it is i need to rest no she told him just over the top of the next rise sighing heavily he moved ontrudging along head down hands loose feet dragging they mounted the long rising incline of a ridge at the crest of which the trees thinned around them once over the ridgetop the ground sloped away sharply and bran found himself standing at the edge of the forest looking down into a shallow bowlshaped valley barely discernible in the light of a pale halfmoon just clearing the treetops to the southeast so this is what you dragged me out here to see he asked his eyes caught a gleam of light below and then another as he looked down into the valley he began seeing more lights tiny flecks glints and shards of light moving slowly over the surface of the ground in a weird slow dance what he began stopped and gaped again in the name of saint dafyd what is that it is happening all over elfael angharad said indicating the nightdark land with a wide sweep of her arm it is the may dance the may dance repeated bran without understanding your people are ploughing their fields ploughing by night he said turning toward her why and why so late in the season they are made to labour for count de braose all day the old woman explained night is the only time they have to put in the crops so they toil by lantern light planting the fields but it is too late bran pointed out the crops will never mature to harvest before winter that is likely angharad agreed but starvation is assured if they do nothing she turned once more to the slowly swinging lights glimmering across the valley they dance with death she said what else can they do bran stiffened at the words he gazed at the moving lights and felt his anger rising why did you show me this he shouted suddenly so that you will know and what am i supposed to do about it he said tell me that what am i supposed to do help them angharad said softly no not me i can do nothing he insisted turning away abruptly he strode off retreating back into the forest i am leaving tomorrow he shouted over his shoulder and nothing you say can stop me angharad watched him for a moment then turning her face to the sky she murmured you see you see how it is with him everything is a fight a wild boar would be less headstrongand more charming she paused as if listening to an unheard voice then sighed your servant obeys retracing her steps she made her way back to the cave determined to make good his vow bran rose at dawn to bid angharad farewell a nights sleep had softened his mood if not his resolve he regretted shouting at her and sought to make amends he said kindly i will be forever grateful to you for saving my life i will never forget you nor i you master bran he smiled at her use of the disdained name unable to put words to the volatile mix of emotions churning in his heart he stood silent for a moment lest he say something he would regret then turned to collect his bow and arrows well i will go now if that is your choice glancing around quickly he said you know that i do not wish to leave this way oh i believe you do the old woman replied this is your way and you are ever used to having your way in all things why should this leaving be different from any other her reproach annoyed him afresh but he had promised himself that nothing she could say would change his mind or alter his course why do you torment me this way he said in a tone heavy with resignation what do you want from me what do i want she threw back at him only thisi want you to be the man you were born to be how do you know what i was born to be you were born to be a king angharad replied simply you were born to lead your people beyond that god only knows king raged bran lashing out with a fury that surprised even himself my father was the king he was a heavyhanded tyrant who thought only of himself and how the world had wronged him you want me to be like him not like him angharad countered better she held the young man with her uncompromising gaze hear me now bran ap brychan you are not your father you could be twice the king he wasand ten times the manif you so desired and you hear me angharad said bran his voice rising with his temper i do not want to be king the old womans eyes searched his face what did he do to you master bran that you fear it so i am not afraid he insisted it is just his voice faltered how could he express a lifetime of hurt and humiliation of need and neglect in mere words i dont want it i never wanted it he said turning away from the old woman at last find someone else there is no one else master bran she said without a king the people will die elfael will die bran uttered an inarticulate growl of frustration and turning away again strode quickly to the cave entrance farewell angharad i will remember you go your way master bran but if you think about me at all remember only this a raven you are and a raven you will remainuntil you fulfil your vow bran stopped in the cave entrance and gave a bitter laugh i made no vow angharad he said her name a slur in his mouth just you remember that with swift strides his long legs carried him from the cave angry and determined to put as much distance as possible between himself and angharads unreasonable expectations he walked far into the forest before it occurred to him that he had not the slightest idea where he was going as many times as he had been out gathering materials to make arrows he had paid little heed to directions and pathways and last night when angharad led him to the valley overlookfrom which he would certainly be able to find his way it had been dark and the pathway unseen already tired he stopped walking and sat down on a fallen log to rest and think the matter through the simplest solution of course would be to return to the cave and demand that angharad lead him to the valley that smacked too much of humiliation and he rejected the idea outright he would exhaust all other possibilities before confronting that disagreeable old hag again after trying to work out a direction from the sun he rose from his perch and set off once more this time he walked more slowly and tried to spy out any familiar features that might guide him although he found no end of pathwaysruns used by deer and wild pigs and even an old charcoal burners trackwaythe trails were so intertwined and tangled crossing over one another circling back and crossing again that he only succeeded in disorienting himself further he moved with more deliberate care now reading direction from the moss on the trees certainly he thought if he kept moving north he would eventually reach the high open heathlands and beyond them the mountains all he had to do was get clear of the trees morning lengthened and the day warmed beneath a fulsome sun and bran began to grow hungry how had he forgotten to bring provisions despite months of thinking of nothing but escape now that the day had come he was appalled to discover how little he had actually prepared he had no food no water no money nor even any idea which way to go he looked at the bow in his hand and marvelled that he had remembered to bring that well he could get something to eat at the first settlement just as soon as he found a way out of this accursed forest shouldering his bow he trudged on with a growing hunger in his belly to match his unquiet heart chapter i was bad enough having to stand by and watch as his beloved monastery was destroyed piecemeal but the tacit enslavement of his people was more than he could bear elfaels men and women toiled like beasts of burdendigging the defensive ditches building the earthen ramparts carrying stone and timber to raise the barons strongholds and pulling down buildings clearing rubble and salvaging materials for the town from dawns first light to evenings last gleam they drudged for the baron then often as not they went home to work their own fields by the light of the moon when it shone and by torchlight and bonfires when it did not the bishop pitied them what choice did they have to refuse to work meant the loss of another holdinga prospect no one could abide so they worked and muttered strong curses under their breath for the ffreinc outlanders this was not the way it was supposed to be he and the count had an understanding an agreement the bishop had lived up to his part of the bargain he had delivered the treasure of elfaels king to count de braose in good faith had offered no resistance and counselled the same amongst his flock he had accepted count de braose as the new authority in elfael and had trusted him to do right by the cymry under his rule but the ffreinc did not deal fairly they took what they wanted and behaved as they pleased never giving a thought to the cymry now languishing under their reign it could not continue the scant rations left from the previous winter were dwindling rapidly and in some places in the valley the cymry were beginning to run out of food something must be done and with both lord and heir dead it fell to bishop asaph to do it joining brother clyro in the chapel he announced i have decided to speak to count de braose i want you to remain in the chapel and uphold me before the throne of mercy how would you have me pray father asked old brother clyro that god would remove this oppression or that god would turn the hearts of the oppressors toward peace a pedantic unimaginative man a scribe and a scholar he could be counted on to carry out the bishops instructions to the letter but as ever insisted on knowing the precise nature of those instructions pray for a softening of count de braoses heart the bishop sighed humouring him a turning from his ways and for food to sustain the people through this ordeal it will be done replied clyro with a nod leaving the elderly cleric in the chapel bishop asaph walked through the building site that had once been the monastery yard and struck off along the dirt road to the caer the day had grown warm and he was thirsty by the time he reached the fortress the place was all but deserted save for a crippled stable hand who in the absence of the others who were aiding construction of the town had been pressed into duty as a porter bishop asaph to see count de braose the cleric declared presenting himself before the servant who smelled of the stable it is a matter of highest importance i demand audience with the count at once the porters laugh as he limped across the yard was all the reply he received and in the end the bishop was made to wait in the yard until the count consented to receive him while he was waiting however another visitor arrived a norman lord by the look of him astride a fine big horse and splendidly arrayed with an escort of two retainers and three soldiers he was asaph decided most likely a count or perhaps even a baron clearly a man of some importance thus it was with some surprise that the bishop heard himself hailed by the noble visitor you there the stranger called in a tone well suited to command come here i would speak to you the bishop dutifully obeyed your servant my lord you are welsh yes asked the stranger in good if slightly accented latin i am of the cymry my lord answered the bishop that is correct and a priest i am father asaph bishop of what is left of the monastery of llanelli replied the churchman whom do i have the pleasure of addressing i am bernard de neufmarche baron of gloucester and hereford indicating that the bishop was to follow the baron led the churchman aside out of the hearing of his own men and the counts overcurious porter tell me how do the people hereabouts fare the question was so unexpected that the bishop could only ask which people your peoplethe welsh how do they fare under the counts rule poorly answered the bishop without hesitation they fare poorly indeed sire they are forced to work for the count building his strongholds yet he does not feed themnor do they have any food of their own asaph went on to explain about the meagre harvest of the previous year and how the counts ambitious building scheme had interfered with this years planting he concluded saying that is why i have cometo make entreaty with the count to release grain from his stores to feed the people baron neufmarche listened to all the churchman had to say nodding solemnly to himself word of this has reached me he confided with your permission bishop i will see what i can do truly wondered asaph greatly impressed but why should you do anything for us neufmarche merely leaned close and in a lowered voice said because it pleases me but see that it remains a secret between ourselves understood the bishop considered the barons words for a moment then agreed as you say he replied i praise god for your kind intervention the baron rejoined his men and they were conducted directly to the hall leaving a bewildered bishop to stand in the yard father of light he prayed something has just happened which passes all understandingat least i cannot make any sense of it yet strong redeemer i pray that the meaning will be for good and not ill for all of us who wait on the lords deliverance in this time of testing the bishop remained in a corner of the yard lifting his voice in prayer he was still praying when a little later count falkess seneschal came looking for them my lord will deal with you now orval told him and started away again at once the bishop followed the seneschal to the door of the hall and was conducted inside where the count was seated in his customary chair beside the hearth baron neufmarche was also in attendance standing a little to one side the visiting baron appeared to pay no heed to the bishop as he continued talking quietly to his own men pax vobis cum said the bishop raising his hand palm outward and making the sign of the cross yes yes said the count as if irritated by his visitors display of piety get on with it as you can see i am busy i have important guests i will be brief replied the bishop simply put the people are hungry you cannot make them work all day without food and if they have none of their own then you must feed them count de braose stared at the cleric for a moment his lip curling with displeasure my dear confused bishop began the count after a moment your complaint is unfounded i think not objected the bishop it is the very truth the count lifted a long languid hand and raised a finger in the first place he said if your people have no food it is their own fault merely the natural consequence of abandoning their land and leaving good crops in the field this was entirely without cause as we have already established another finger joined the first secondly it is not i do beg your pardon interrupted neufmarche stepping forward turning away from his knights he addressed the count directly i could not help overhearingbut am i to understand that you make your subjects work for you yet refuse to feed them it is a fact declared the bishop he has enslaved the entire valley and provides nothing for the people enslaved snorted the count you dare use that word it is an unfortunate circumstance corrected the count turning his attention to the baron he said do you undertake to feed all your subjects baron no replied the baron not all of themonly those who render me good service the ox or horse that pulls plough or wagon is fedit is the same for any man who labours on my behalf the count twitched with growing discomfort well and good he allowed but this is a predicament of their own making a hard lesson it may be but they will learn it all the same i rule here now the count said facing the bishop once more and the sooner they accept this the better and who will you rule asked the baron when your subjects have starved to death advancing a few paces toward the bishop the baron made a small bow of deference and said i am baron neufmarche and i stand ready to supply grain meat and other provisions if it would aid you in this present difficulty i thank you and my people thank you sire said the bishop careful not to let on that they had already spoken of the matter in private our prayers for deliverance are answered what objected the count am i to have nothing to say about this of course allowed neufmarche i would never intrude in the affairs of another lord in his realm i merely make the offer as a gesture of goodwill if you prefer to give them the grain out of your own stores that is entirely your decision the bishop hands folded as if in prayer turned hopeful eyes to the count awaiting his answer falkes hesitated tapping the arms of his chair with his long fingers it is true that the storehouses are nearly empty and that we shall have to bring in supplies very soon therefore he said making up his mind i accept your offer of goodwill neufmarche splendid cried the baron let us consider this the first step along the road toward a peaceful and harmonious alliance we are neighbours after all and we should look toward the satisfaction of our mutual interests i will dispatch the supplies immediately upon my return to hereford seeing in baron neufmarche a resourceful new ally and emboldened by his presence the bishop plucked up his courage and announced there is yet one more matter i would bring before you lord count knowing himself the subject of the barons scrutiny falkes sighed go on then the two farms you burnedspecial provision must be made for the farmers and their families they have lost everything i want tools and supplies to be replaced at once so they can rebuild hearing this the baron swung toward the count you burned their farms the count aghast to find himself trapped between two accusers rose abruptly from his chair as if it had suddenly become too hot i burned some barns nothing more blustered the count nervously the threat was merely an enticement to obedience it would not have happened if they had complied with my request those families had little enough already and that little has been taken from them i demand redress said asaph far more forcefully than he would have dared had it not been for the baron looking on oh very well said count falkes a sickly smile spreading on his lips he turned to the baron who returned his gaze with stern disapproval they will be given tools and other supplies so they can rebuild regarding the bishop the baron said are you satisfied when the tools and supplies have been delivered to the church said the bishop i will consider the matter concluded well then said baron neufmarche he turned to an extremely agitated count falkes and offered a sop i think we can put this unfortunate incident behind us and welcome a more salutary future he spoke as a parent coaxing a wayward child back into the warm bosom of family fellowship the count was not slow to snatch a chance to regain a measure of dignity nothing would please me more baron to the bishop he said if there is nothing else you are dismissed neufmarche and i have business to discuss asaph made a stiff bow and withdrew quietly leaving the noblemen to their talk once outside he departed caer cadarn in a rush to bring the good news of the barons kindness to the people chapter by the end of his second day in the forest bran was footsore weary and voraciously hungry twice he had sighted deer twice loosed an arrow and missed his shoulder still pained him and it would take many more days of practise before he recovered his easy mastery of the weapon he had retrieved one arrow but the other had been lostalong with any hope of a meal and though the berries on the brambles and raspberry canes were still green and bitter he was proud enough to refuse the growing impulse to return to the cave and beg angharads help the notion smelled of weakness and surrender and he rejected it outright so as the twilight shadows deepened in the leafbound glades he drank his fill from a clearrunning stream and prepared to spend another night in the forest he found the disused den of a roe deer in a hollow beneath the roots of an ancient oak and crawled in he lay back in the dry leaves and observed a spider enshroud a trapped cricket in a cocoon of silk and leave it dangling suspended by a single strand above his head as bran watched he listened to the sounds of the woodland transforming itself for night as the birds flocked to roost and nights children began to awaken mice and voles badgers foxes batsall with their particular voicesand it seemed to him then as never before that a forest was more than a place to hunt and gather timber or else better avoided more than a stand of mossheavy trees more than a sweetwater spring bubbling up from the roots of a distant mountain more than a smoothpebbled pool gleaming radiant as a jewel in a green hidden dell or a flowerstrewn meadow surrounded by a slender host of white swaying birches or a badger delving in the dark earth beneath a roughbarked elm or a fox kit eluding a diving hawk more than a proud stag standing watch over his clan more than these the forest was itself a living thing its life made up of all the smaller lives contained within its borders this realization proved so strong that it startled him and he marvelled at its potency it was perhaps the first time a thought like this had ever taken hold in bran and after the initial jolt passed he found himself enjoying the unique freshness of the raw ideadivining the spirit of the greene wood he called it he turned it over and over in his mind exploring its dimensions delighting in its imaginative potential it occurred to him that angharad was largely responsible for this new way of thinking that with her songs and stories and her oldfashioned earthy ways she had awakened in him a new kind of sight or understanding surely angharad had bewitched him charmed him with some strange arboreal enchantment that made the forest seem a realm over which he might gain some small dominion angharad the hudolion the enchantress of the wood had worked her wiles on him and he was in her thrall rather than fear or dread the conviction produced a sudden exultation he felt inexplicably that he had passed some trial gained some mastery achieved some virtue and although he could not yet put a name to the thing he had accomplished he gloried in it all the same he lay back in the hollow of the great oaks roots as if embraced by strong encircling arms it seemed to him that he was no longer a stranger in the forest an intruder in a foreign realm he belonged here he could be at home here in this place he could move as freely as a king in his caer a lord of a leaf and branch and living things like the hero of the story rhi bran he fell asleep with that thought still turning in his mind deep in the night he dreamed that he stood on the high crest of a craggy hill rising in the centre of the forest the wind swirling around him suddenly he felt the urge to fly and stretching out his arms he lifted them high to his amazement his arms sprouted long black feathers the wind gusted and he was lifted up and borne aloft rising up and up into the clear blue cymraic sky out over the forest he sailed looking down he saw the massed treetops far belowa thick green rough and rumpled skin with the threads of streams seamed through it like veins he saw the silvery glint of a lake and the bare domes of rock peaks away in the misty distance he saw the wide green sweep of the vale of elfael with its handful of farms and settlements scattered over a rolling rumpled land that glowed like a gemstone beneath the light of an untroubled sun higher and still higher he soared revelling in his flight sailing over the vast extent of the greenwood from somewhere far below there arose a crya wild ragged wail like that of a terrorised child who will not be comforted or consoled the sound grew until it assaulted heaven with its insistence unable to ignore it he sailed out over the valley to see what could cause such anguish scanning the ground far below a movement on the margin of the forest caught his eye he circled lower for a closer look hunters they had dogs with them and were armed with lances and swords that they should violate the sanctity of his realm angered bran and he determined to drive them away he swooped down ready to defend his woodland kingdom only to realise too late that it was himself they were hunting he plummeted instantly to earth landing on the path some little way ahead of the invading men the sharpsighted dogs saw him and howled to be released as bran gathered himself to flee the hunters loosed the hounds bran ran into the forest found a dark nook beneath a rock and crawled in to hide but the dogs had got his scent and they came running baying for his blood bran awakened with the sound of barking still echoing through the trees a soft mist curled amongst the roots of the trees and dew glistened on the lower leaves and on the grassy path the long rising note came again and close behind the very beast itself a lean longlegged grey hunting hound with clipped ears and a shaggy pelt bounding with great galloping strides through the morning fog seizing his bow bran nocked an arrow and drew back the string he was on the point of loosing the missile when a small boy appeared racing after the dog barefoot dirtyfaced with long tangled dark hair the lad appeared to be no more than six or seven years old he saw bran the same instant bran saw him the boy glimpsed the weapon in brans hands and halted just as brans fingers released the string in the same instant a voice cried pull up distracted by the shout brans aim faltered and the arrow went wide the hound leapt colliding with bran and carrying him to the ground bran crossed his arms over his neck to protect his throat as the dog licked his face it took a moment for bran to understand that he was not being attacked taking hold of the dogs ironstudded collar he tried to free himself from the beasts eager attentions but it stood on his chest holding him to the ground off cried bran get off look at you now said angharad as she came to stand over him and is this not how i first found you i surrender bran told her get him off the old woman gestured to the boy who came running and pulled the dog away bran rolled to his feet and brushed at the dogs muddy footprints angharad smiled and reached down to help him i thought you were away to the north country and the safety of a rich kinsmans hearth she said her smile brimming with merry mischief how is it that you are still forest bound you would know that better than i replied bran embarrassed to be so easily found he nevertheless welcomed the sight of the old woman aye she agreed i would but we have had this discussion before i think she extended her hand and bran saw that she held a cloth bundle your fast is over master bran come let us eat together one last time bran chastened by his luckless wandering through the forest dutifully fell into step behind the old woman as she led her little party a short distance to a glade and there spread out a meal of cold meat nuts dried fruit mushrooms honey cakes and eggs the three of them ate quietly angharad divided the meat and shared it out between them when the edge of his hunger had been blunted bran turned to the boy who seemed curiously familiar to him and asked whats your name the boy raised big dark eyes to him but made no reply thinking the boy had not understood him bran asked again and this time the lad raised a dirty finger to his lips and shook his head he is telling you he cannot speak explained angharad i call him gwion bach he is a kinsman of yours not mine she replied lightly he belongs to the forest one of many who live here when i told him i was going to find you he insisted on coming too i think he knows you bran examined the boy more closely the attack in the farmyardcould it be the same boy one of many he repeated after a moment and are there many more now that the ffreinc have come she answered handing the boy a small boiled egg which he peeled and popped into his mouth with a smack of his lips bran considered this for a moment and then said you knew i would be here you knew i would not be able to find my way out of the wood alone he did not accuse her of laying a spell on him but it was in his mind you knew and still you let me go it was your decision i said i would not prevent you he smiled and shook his head i am a fool angharad as we both know but you could have told me the way out oh aye she agreed cheerfully but you did not ask growing suddenly serious she regarded him with a look of unsettling directness what is your desire bran their meal finished it was time once more for them to part what will you do bran regarded the old woman before him wrinkled and stooped she might be but shrewd as a den of weasels in her mouth the question was more than it seemed he hesitated feeling that much depended on the answer what answer could he give despite his newfound appreciation of the forest he knew the ffreinc would kill him on sight seeking refuge amongst his mothers kinsmen was still a good plan in the months he had been living with angharad no better scheme had come to him nor did anything more useful occur to him now i will go to my people he replied and the words thudded to the ground like an admission of defeat if that is what you wish the old woman allowed as graciously as bran could have hoped then follow me and i will lead you to the place where you can find them gathering up the remains of the meal angharad set off with bran following and little gwion bach and the dog running along behind they walked at an unhurried pace along barely discernible trails that angharad read with ease after a time bran noticed that the trees grew taller the spaces between them narrower and more shadowed the sun became a mere glimmer of shattered gold in the dense leaf canopy overhead the trail became soft underfoot thick with moss and damp leaves the very air grew heavier and more redolent of earth and water and softly decaying wood here and there he heard the tiny rustlings of creatures that lived in shady nooks everywherearound this rock on the other side of that holly bush beyond the purple beech wall he heard the sound of water dripping off branches trickling along unseen courses the morning passed and they paused to rest and drink from a brook no wider than a mans foot angharad passed out handfuls of hazelnuts from the bag she carried a good day observed bran he owed his life to the old woman who had saved him and as much as he wanted to part on good terms he also wanted her to understand why he had to leave a good day to begin a journey he added aye she replied it is that her answer though agreeable did not provide him the opening he sought and he could think of no way to broach the subject he fell silent and they continued on a short while later pressing ever deeper into the forest the farther they went the darker wilder and more ancient the woodland became the smaller treesbeeches birch and hawthorngave way to the larger woodland lords hornbeam plane and elm the immense boles rose like pillars from the earth to uphold tremendous limbs which formed a timber ceiling of intertwined branches it would be possible bran imagined to move through this part of the forest without ever setting foot on the ground deeper they went and deeper grew the shadows and more silent the surrounding wood with a hush that was at once peaceful and slightly ominousas if the woodland solitude was wary of trespass and imposed a guarded watch on strangers brans senses quickened he imagined eyes on him observing him marking him as he passed the impression grew with every step until he began darting glances right and left the dense wood defied sight the tangles of branch and vine were impenetrable finally the old woman stopped and bran caught the scent of smoke on the air where are we he asked extending a hand she pointed to an enormous oak that had been struck by lightning during a storm long ago halfhollow now the trunk had split and splayed outward to form a natural arch the path on which they stood led through the centre of the blastriven oak i am to go through there a quick nod was the only answer he received drawing himself up he stepped to the fireblackened arch passing through the strange portal and into the unknown chapter tepping through the dark arch bran found himself holding his breath as if he were plunging into the sea or leaping from a wall from which he could not see the ground below on the other side of the oak arch was a hedge wall through which passed a narrow path two quick strides brought him through the hedge and into an enormous gladea great wide greensward of a valley in the heart of the wood bounded by a ring of towering trees that formed a stout palisade of solid oak around the mossybanked clearing and there spread out across the floor of the dell was a camp with dwellings unlike any bran had ever seen made of brushwood and branches the antlers of stags and hinds woven grass bark bone and hide some were little more than branches bent over a hollow in the ground others were more substantial shelters of such weird and fanciful construction that bran was at once entranced and a little unsettled by the sight he did not see the people who inhabited these queer dwellings but having heard him coming a long way off they saw him moments before bran emerged from the arch of the hedge wall beyond the shattered oak women whisked children out of sight men disappeared behind trees and huts and the settlement that only moments before had been astir with activity now appeared deserted is anybody here called bran as if awaiting his signal the menfolk emerged from hiding some carrying sticks and tools for weapons seeing that he was alone they approached there were bran estimated quickly perhaps thirty men and older boys ragged their clothes patched and wornlike those the farmers gave the stickmen in the fields to frighten the birds pax vobiscum bran called when that brought no response he repeated it in cymry hedd a dy the men continued advancing silent wary as deer they closed ranks dark eyes watching the stranger who had appeared without warning in their midst sefyll called angharad taking her place beside bran her appearance halted the advance one of the menfolk returned the greeting hudolion he was joined by others and suddenly everyone was calling hudoles and hudolion ignoring bran they hurried to greet the old woman as she scrambled gingerly down the mossy bank into the shallow basin of the glade the respect and adulation provoked by her appearance impressed bran clearly she had some place of honour in this rough outcast clan welcome hudolion called one of the men advancing through the knot of people gathered around her tall and lean there was something of the wolf about him he wore a short red cloak folded over his shoulder in the manner of a roman soldier of old the others parted to let him through and as he took his place before the old woman he touched the back of a grimy hand to his forehead in the ancient sign of submission and salutation greetings siarles she said greetings everyone lifting a hand to bran she said do you not recognise prince bran ap brychan when you see him the man called siarles stepped nearer for a closer look he peered into brans face uncertainly cool grey eyes moving over the young mans features he then turned to those behind him call the bigun he commanded and a slender youth with a downy moustache raced away i do not siarles said turning once more to bran and angharad but if it is as you say then he will the youth ran to one of the larger huts and called to someone inside a moment later a large wellmuscled man stepped from the low entrance of the hut as he straightened bran saw his face for the first time iwan cried bran rushing to meet him bran mary and joseph in a manger bran a grin spread across his broad face his thick moustache twitched with pleasure seizing bran he gathered him in a crushing embrace bran ap brychan he said i never thought to see you again if it had not been for angharad no one ever would bran confessed gazing up into the face of his fathers champion by heaven it is good to see you iwan raised his hand high and called out in a voice that resounded through the glade hear me everyone before you stands bran ap brychan heir to the throne of elfael make him welcome then turning once more to bran the warrior dapped his hand to the young mans shoulder humble it may be iwan said but my hearth will be all the merrier with you for company i would be honoured bran told him come we will share a cup announced iwan i am that anxious to hear how you fared all this time without me the former champion turned on his heel and started back to his hut bran caught angharad by the arm and whispered you did not tell them i was coming the choice my son was always yours alone she replied you knew this would happen he insisted you must have known all along you said you wanted to go to your people extending a gnarled hand to the bedraggled gathering before him she said here are your people bran how strange she was this old woman standing before himat once aged and ageless the dark eyes gazing out at him from that wrinkled visage were as keen as blades her mind sharper still bran was he knew at her mercy and always had been who are you angharad he asked you asked me once she replied but you were not ready to receive the answer are you ready now i ami mean i think so then come angharad said it will not take long iwan will wait she led him to a round moss and brackencovered hut in the centre of the settlement the hide of a red ox served for a door and here she paused saying if you enter master bran you must leave your unbelief outside i will he told her so far as i am able i will she regarded him without expression and then smiled i suppose that will have to do to the others who had followed them she said go about your business siarles tell iwan we will join him soon i would speak to bran alone a moment the people moved off reluctantly angharad gave bran a little bow and drawing aside the red oxhide said be welcome here prince of elfael bran stepped into the dim interior of the odd dwelling although dark it was surprisingly ample and comfortable light filtered in through a single hole in the roof directly over the stonelined fire pit in the centre of the room the furnishings were spare a single threelegged stool a row of woven grass baskets along the curving wall and a bed of reeds and fleeces were the only belongings in the room these bran took in with a single glance as he entered a second look revealed another item he did not see until his eyes had better adjusted to the dusky interior a robe made entirely of feathers all of them black drawn to the peculiar garment he ran his hand over the glossy plumage what is this it is the bird spirit cloak replied the old woman come sit down she indicated a place opposite her at the fire ring they called you hudolion bran said settling himself crosslegged on a grass mat are you he asked are you an enchantress i have been called many things she replied simply hag whore leper witch i am each of these and none banfaith of elfael true bard of britain these titles are also mine call me what you will i am myself alone the last of my kind in her words bran heard the echo of a longforgotten time a time when britain belonged to britons alone and when its sons and daughters walked beneath free skies the old woman exhaled gently and closed her eyes she was silent for a long moment and then drew a deep breath when she spoke again her voice had changed taking on the timbre and cadence of one of her songs not for angharad the friendly hearth the silverstrung harp or tore of gold she said almost singing the words in the forest she resides living like the wild thingsthe nimble fox elusive bear or phantom wolf like these her fourfooted sisters the forest is her shelter and her stronghold she exhaled again and another long pause ensued bran accustomed to the old womans queer moods and eccentric ways knew better than to interrupt her he waited in silence for her to continue oh beloved yes the greenwood is her caer but it is not her home she said after a moment angharad was born to a more exalted position she was born to bless the hall of a king with her song to adorn and complete a noble sovereign with her strengthening presence but the world has turned the kings grown small and the bards sing no more listen do not turn away there was a time once long ago when the bards were lauded in the halls of kings when rulers of the cymry dispensed gold rings and jewelled armbands to the chieftains of song when all men listened to the old tales gloried in them and so magnified their understanding a time when lord and lady alike heeded the head of wisdom and sought the counsel of the learned in all things alas that time is gone everywhere kings quarrel amongst themselves wasting their substance on trivialities and the meaningless pursuit of power each one striving to rise at the expense of the other they are maggots in manure fighting for supremacy of the dung heap meanwhile the enemy goes from strength to strength the invader waxes mighty while the gwr gwyr the true men melt away like mist on a sunbright morning the day of the wolf has dawned the dire shape of its coming was seen and foretold its arrival awaited with fear and dread at long last it is here and there are none who can turn it aside hear me rhi bran the red king stretches out his hand across the land grasping seizing rending he will not be satisfied until all lies under his dominion or until he awakens from his sleep of death and acknowledges the law of love and justice laid down before the foundations of the world she spoke with eyes shut her head weaving from side to side as if listening to a melody bran could not hear i am angharad and here in the forest i watch and wait for as i live and breathe the promise of my birth will yet be proved by the grace of the christ my druid i will yet compose a song to be sung before a king worthy of his praise then slowly opening her eyes she gazed at bran directly do you believe me when i say this i do believe replied bran without hesitation more than anything else he had ever wanted he ached for those words somehow to be true ishop asaph stood in the door of his old wooden chapel watching the labourers break a hole in the wall of his former chapter house which was to become the residence of count de braoses chief magistrate and tax collectoran ominous development to be sure but of a piece with the multitude of changes taking place throughout elfael almost daily the monastery yard had slowly become the market square of the new town and the various monastic buildings either converted to accommodate new uses or pulled down to make way for bigger more serviceable buildings one row of monks cells was being removed to make way for a blacksmith forge and granary the long low wattleanddaub refectory was to be a guildhall and the modest scriptorium a town treasury that there were no guilds in elfael seemed not to matter that no one paid taxes was apparently beside the point the guilds would come in due course the taxman too lamentable though the thought surely was the bishop could not give it more than fleeting consideration his mind was occupied with the far more urgent matter of feeding his hungry people the grain promised by baron neufmarche had not yet arrived and asaph had determined to go to count de braose and see what might be done he had hoped his next audience with the count would be on more amiable terms but the prospect of better dealings seemed always to remain just beyond his grasp he tightened the laces of his shoes then made his way through the building site that had been his homegods homeand walked out across the valley to caer cadarn upon presenting himself at the fortress gate he was as he had come to expect made to tarry in the yard until the count deigned to see him here the bishop of llanelli loitered in the sun like a friendless farmhand with muck on his feet while the count sat at meat he resented this treatment but tried not to take offence he decided to recite a psalm instead twenty psalms later the counts seneschal finally came for him at the door to the audience chamber asaph thanked orval and composed himself smoothing his robe and adjusting his belt stepping through the opened door bishop asaph found the count hunched over a table laden with the halfempty plates of the meal just finished and squares of parchment on which were drawn plans for defensive fortifications forgive me bishop if i do not offer you refreshment said the count distractedly i am otherwise occupied as you see i would not presume upon your attentions said the bishop tartly you can be sure that i would not come here at all if need did not demand it falkes glanced up sharply pray what are you prattling about now we were promised provisions said the bishop when why when baron neufmarche was here it has been almost a month now and the need grows ever neufmarche promised grain yes i remember count de braose returned to the drawings before him what of it my lord count said the bishop his palms growing wet with apprehension it has not arrived has it not sniffed the count well perhaps he has forgotten the baron promised to send the supplies immediately upon his return to hereford it has been as i say almost a month now and the need is greater than ever the people are at the end of their resourcesthey faint with hunger the children cry in some settlements they are already starving if relief is not forthcoming they will die in that case replied the count picking up a scrap of parchment and holding it at arms length before his face i suggest you take up the matter with the baron himself it is his affair not mine but we are finished here interrupted count falkes you may go aghast and confounded bishop asaph stood in silence for a moment my lord do you mean to say that nothing has been sent have you taken root inquired the count the matter is concluded you are dismissed go the churchman turned and walked stiffly from the room by the time he reached the monastery some semblance of reason had returned and he had determined that the count was right the baron had made the promise and must be held to account therefore he would go to the baron and demand a reckoning if he left at once he could be in hereford in four or five days he would obtain an audience he would implore he would plead he would beg the baron to make good his vow and release the promised food and supplies without delay chapter il took the two aging priests of llanelli more than a week to reach the neufmarche stronghold in hereford though bishop asaph fervently hoped to travel more swiftly he could not go faster than doddering brother clyro could walk nor could he bring himself to deny the needy who upon seeing the passing monks ran to beg them for prayers and blessings weary and footsore they reached hereford toward evening of the eighth day and found their way to the abbey of saints james and john where they took beds for the night they were led by the porter to the guest lodge and provided with basins of water to wash and later joined the priests for prayers and a simple supper before going to sleep after prime the next morning the bishop left his companion at prayer and made his way to the barons fortress set on a bluff overlooking the river wye the castle could be seen for miles in every direction an impressive structure built of stone and enclosed by a deep steepsided ditch filled with water diverted from the river it was not the first fortress on this site the previous one had been burned to the ground long ago during a battle with the english the ffreinc had rebuilt it but in stone this time larger stronger bristling with battlements walls and towers it was built to last its latest inhabitant had extended the grounds around the stronghold to include common grazing lands cattle pens granaries and barns the bishop paused before entering the castle gate great of might he murmured lifting a hand toward heaven you know our need let relief be swiftly granted amen he then proceeded through the gate where he was met by a gatekeeper in a short red tunic pax vobiscum said the bishop god with you answered the gateman taking in the bishops robe and tonsure what is your business here father i seek audience with baron neufmarche if you please you may tell him that bishop asaph of elfael is here on a matter of highest importance the servant nodded and led the cleric across a wooden bridge over the water ditch through another gate and into an inner yard where he waited while the gatekeeper announced his presence to a page who conveyed the request for an audience to the baron while he awaited the barons summons bishop asaph watched the people around him as they went about their daily affairs he found himself thinking about what a strange race they were these ffreinc made up of many contradictions industrious and resourceful they typically pursued their interests with firmness of purpose and an admirable ardour yet from what he had seen of the marchogi in elfael they could just as quickly abandon themselves to dejection and despondency when events betrayed them devout stalwart and reverent in the best of times they also seemed inordinately subject to weird caprices and silly superstitions a handsome people hale and strong bodied with long straight limbs and clear eyes set in broad open facesthey nevertheless seemed to suffer from a rare abundance of infirmities maladies and ailments all these things and arrogant too they were the bishop concluded fiercely ambitious in appetite for acquisition insatiable in intensity for mastery rapacious in aspiration for achievement merciless in desire for domination inexorable however and he had always to remember this they could be fairminded and loyal and when it suited them they displayed a laudable sense of justiceat least with their own the english and cymry were treated poorly for the most part it was true but the capacity for evenhanded tolerance was not entirely lacking the bishop hoped he would encounter some of this fairness in his dealings with the baron today presently the page returned to announce that the baron would be pleased to see him at once and asaph was brought into a large stoneflagged anteroom where he was offered a cup of wine and some bread before making his way into the barons audience chamberan enormous oakpanelled room with a narrow arched window of leaded glass that kept out the wind but allowed the light to come streaming through bishop asaph boomed the baron as the priest was announced pax vobiscum he crossed the chamber in long quick strides and held out his hand in the peculiar greeting of ffreinc noblemen it is good to see you again the bishop grasped the offered hand somewhat awkwardly you should have told me you were coming i would have had a dinner prepared in your honour but come come sit with me i will have some refreshment brought and we will eat together the effusive greeting banished bishop asaphs worst fears thank you baron neufmarche but your servant was kind enough to offer me bread and wine just now i would not presume to keep you from your affairs a moment longer than necessary so earnest observed the baron lightly it is a most welcome interruption bishop you have an advocate in me i hope you know that you cannot imagine how it gratifies me to hear those words baron neufmarche you are very kind neufmarche brushed aside the compliment it is nothing however i can see that you are troubledand i think it must be something serious indeed to bring you from your beautiful valley he gestured his guest to a chair beside his own here my friend sit down and tell me what is distressing you to be blunt it is about the food supplies you promised to send yes i trust they were put to good use i assure you the grain and meat were the finest i could lay hands to at short notice i am certain they were bishop asaph conceded but we never received them nothing nothing at all wondered the baron asaph shook his head slowly how is that possible that is what i have come to discover replied the bishop who then told of his conversation with count falkes in short concluded the bishop the count gave me to know in no uncertain terms that the supplies had never been sentor if they had they never arrived he suggested i take up the matter with youthe bishop spread his handsso here i am i see the baron pursed his lips in a frown of vexation and ran a broad hand through his long dark hair this is most disturbing i made arrangements for the supplies the same day i returned from elfael and was glad to do it why the wagoners reported a successful delivery with no difficulties along the way i do believe you baron the bishop assured him it can only be that de braose has taken the food and kept it for himself so it would seem baron neufmarche concurred rising from his chair he crossed to the door in quick strides opened it and summoned the servant waiting outside bring remey here at once the man hurried away and the baron returned to his guest this will soon be put right what do you intendif i may be so bold i intend to send another consignment immediately declared the baron what is more i intend to make certain that it reaches you this time i will give orders that the food is to be delivered to you and no one else baron neufmarche sighed asaph feeling the weight of care lift from his shoulders you have no idea how much this means to me it is a blessing of the highest order it is nothing of the kind protested neufmarche if i had been more diligent this would not have happened and you would not have had to undertake such an onerous errand i am sorry he paused then his voice becoming grave he said i can see now that we have no ally in count de braose he is duplicitous and deceitful and his word can no longer be trusted alas it is true confirmed asaph readily we must watch him closely you and i the baron continued i have received word of shall we say certain undertakings involving the count and his uncle he offered a brief confidential smile but never fear my friend trust that i will do whatever i can to intercede for you before the bishop could think what to say the door opened and a thin man in a soft red hat entered the room ah there you are called the baron remey you will recall the supplies we sent to count falkes in elfael yes i do my lord of course i saw to it personally at your request how many wagons did we send the old servant placed a finger to his lips for a moment and then said five i believe three of grain and two more loaded with meat and various other necessaries that is correct remey confirmed the baron i want you to ready another consignment of the same he paused glancing at the bishop then added and double it this time ten wagons gasped bishop asaph this went far beyond his most fervent hopes my lord baron this is most generousindeed more than generous your largesse is as noble as it is needful think nothing of it the baron replied grandly i am only too glad to be of some small service now then perhaps i can persuade you to share a little sustenance with me before you return to elfael in fact if you would consent to stay a day or so you may depart with the first wagons nothing would please us more replied the bishop almost giddy with relief and tonight brother clyro and i will hold vigil for you and extol your name before the throne of grace you are too kind bishop i am certain i do not deserve such praise on the contrary i will spread word of your munificence from one end of elfael to the other so that all our people will know who to thank for their provision tears started to his eyes and he dabbed them with his hands saying may god bless you richly baron for troubling yourself on our behalf may god bless you well and richly ran spent the day getting to know the people of cel craidd the hidden heart of the greenwood a few were folk of elfael but many were from other cantrefschiefly morgannwg and gwent which had also fallen under norman sway all for one reason or another had been forced to abandon their homes and seek the refuge of the wood he talked to them and listened to their stories of loss and woe and his heart went out to them that night he sat beside the hearth in iwans hut and they talked of the ffreinc and what could be done to reclaim their homeland we must raise a warband iwan declared brash in his enthusiasm that is the first thing drive the devils out drive them so far and so hard they dare not come back again the three men faced one another across the small fire burning in the centre of the huts single room we could get swords and armour siarles suggested and horses to be sure good onestrained to battle the young man had been chief huntsman to the king of gwent but when the ffreinc deposed his lord and took all hunting rights to themselves siarles had fled to the forest rather than serve a ffreinc lord he had assumed the position of iwans second de braose has hundreds of horses well raise a thousand he said exuberance getting the better of him he considered this for a moment and then amended it saying not every warrior will need a horse mind to be sure we must have footmen as well the mere thought of trying to find so many men and horses was laughable to bran even if men in such numbers could somehow be found arming and equipping a warband of that size could well take a year or moreand they must be housed and fed in the meantime it was absurd and bran pitied his friends for their hopeless pathetic dream it might make the british heart beat faster but it was doomed to failure the ffreinc were bred for battle they were better armed better trained better horsed engaging them in open battle was certain disaster every british death strengthened their hold on the land that much more and increased misery and oppression for everyone to think otherwise was folly listening to iwan and siarles bran grew more certain than ever that his future lay in the north amongst his mothers kinsmen elfael was lostit had been so from the moment his father was cut down in the roadand there was nothing he could do to change that better to accept the grim reality and live than to die chasing a glorious delusion he looked sadly at the two men across from him their faces eager in the firelight they burned with zeal to drive the enemy from the valley and redeem their homeland why stop there bran thought they might as well hope to reclaim cymru england and scotland too for all the good it would do them unable to endure the futile hope of those keen expressions bran rose suddenly and left the hut he stepped out into the moonlight and stood for a moment feeling the cool night air wash over him gradually he became aware that he was not alone angharad was sitting on a stump beside the door they have no one else she said and nowhere else to go what they want bran began then halted did anyone have even the slightest notion of the effort in time and money that it would take to raise a sufficiently large army to do what iwan suggested it is impossible he declared after a moment they are deluded then you must tell them tell them now explain why they are wrong to want what they want then you can leave knowing that as their king you did all you could her words rankled what do you expect of me angharad he spoke softly so those inside would not overhear what they propose is madnessas you and i know perhaps she conceded but they have nothing else they have no kinsmen in the north waiting to take them in elfael is all they have it is all they know if their hope is mistaken you must tell them i will said bran drawing himself up and let that be the end he went back into the hut taking his place at the fire once more we could go to lord rhys in the south iwan was saying he has returned from ireland with a large warband if we convinced him to help us he might loan us the troops we need no bran said quietly there is no plunder to be had and we have nothing to offer them king rhys ap tewdwr will not get dragged into a war for nothing and he has enough worries of his own what do you suggest asked iwan is there someone else bran looked at his friend the light still burning in his eyes he could not bring himself to snuff out that fragile flame angharad was right the people had no one to lead them and nowhere else to go for iwan and for them all it was elfael or nothing bran hesitated wrestling with the decision god have mercy he thought i cannot abandon them in that instant a new path opened before him and bran saw the way ahead we dont have to fight the ffreinc he declared abruptly no wondered iwan i think they wont surrender for askinga pleasant thought even so have you forgotten iwan we went to lundein and spoke to the kings justiciar bran said do you remember what he said aye conceded the big man i remember what help is that to us now it is our very salvation iwan and siarles exchanged puzzled glances across the fire clearly they did not see so bran explained the cardinal said he would annul baron de braoses grant for six hundred marks so we will simply buy elfael from the king six hundred marks muttered siarles in dull amazement have you ever seen that much never allowed bran in truth i dont know if there is that much silver to be had beyond the march but the terms were laid down by williams own man the cardinal said we could have elfael for six hundred marks aye mused iwan rubbing his chin doubtfully that is what he saidand it is just as impossible now as it was then a high price yes but not impossible anyway it is far less than what would be needed to raise and feed an army of a thousand mennot to mention weapons and armour for that wed need ten times more than the cardinal is asking the two others fell silent gazing at him calculating the enormity of the sums involved bran let his words work for a moment and then added that aside i agree about the horses you do wondered siarles much impressed yes but not a thousand three or four will suffice what can we do with three horses scoffed the young forester we can begin raising the six hundred marks to redeem our homeland part four the haunting chapter ten wagons laden with sacks of barley and rye bags of dried beans and peas and whole sides of beef and smoked pork trundled along the rising trackway through the forest the supply van of baron neufmarche had spent all morning toiling up the winding incline of the ridge and the crest was now in sight along with the wagons the baron had sent an armed escort five menatarms under the command of a knight all of them in mail hauberks and armed with swords and lances their shields and steel helmets slung behind their saddles their presence dared count falkes or anyone else to divert the consignment of supplies intended for the starving folk of elfael the day had turned hazy and hot in the open places the skies clear for the most part with but a smudgy suggestion of cloud to the west the road though deeply rutted and lumpy was as dry as parchment a drowsy hush lay over the rising woodland as if the trees themselves dozed in the heat the drivers did not press their teams too hard the day was hot the wagons were heavy and they were loath to hurry the food would arrive when it arrived and that would be soon enough the six advance guards paused on the spine of the ridge and waited for the ox train to reach the top from their high vantage point the soldiers could see the vale of elfael spreading green and inviting to the north this is tedious work muttered the knight leading the escort turning to one of his men he said richard go down and tell them that we will ride on there is a ford aheadjust there he pointed down the descending slope to a place where a stream cut through the road as it pursued its switchback descent into the valley we will water the horses and wait for them there the manatarms gave a nod put spurs to his horse and trotted back down the slope this way said the knight and they rode down to the fording place where they dismounted and stretched after the animals had drunk their fill the men drank too removing their round leather caps to lave cool water over their sweating heads kneeling in a sunny patch on the bank of the stream the knight saw a shadow pass over him he watched the shade slowly engulf him and thinking nothing more than that an errant cloud had passed over the sun he ducked his head and continued cupping water to his mouth behind him and a little way above he heard the rustling of feathers and still on his knees craned his neck around to see a huge dark winglike shape disappear into the undergrowthnothing more than a dull glimmering of black feathers and then it was gone the sunlight returned and the kneeling soldier was left with the strong sensation that something strange and unnatural had been watching him and for all he knew watched him still the skin of his belly tightened beneath his chain mail tunic fear stretched both ways along his spine the knight rose to his feet replaced his leather cap drew his sword and prepared to fight to arms men he cried to arms instantly the soldiers unsheathed swords and levelled lances they drew together to form a protective line and waited for the anticipated onslaught the moment stretched and passed the attack did not come the knight advanced cautiously to the place in the brush where the dark shape had disappeared gesturing for his men to maintain silence he summoned them to him indicating that the enemy was hiding in the underbrush they paused at the ready and then hearing nothing seeing nothing they started into the brushwood where they discovered a narrow trail used by animals when passing to and from the stream stopping every few steps to listen the five soldiers advanced cautiously along the trackway a hundred paces farther along the trail divided one way led into a deepshaded game run arched over by intertwining limbs it was straight and narrow and dark as any underground tunnel the other was more open and meandered amongst the trees below which stunted saplings formed a scrubby underbrush where an enemy might hide it could have been his overwrought imagination but the knight felt dank and chill air seeping along the darker path it came spilling out from the entrance of the game run like a vapour invisible to the eye nevertheless he could feel it curling and coiling around his feet and ankles climbing his legs he stopped in his tracks and motioned the others behind him to halt as well loath to take the darker path the knight was considering their position when he heard a faroff whinny it seemed to come from behind them in the direction of the stream the horses turning as one the warriors ran back the way they had come stumbling in their haste as they emerged once again on the low banks of the stream to find that their horses had vanished god in heaven cried the knight we have been tricked get up there he shouted pushing two men along the upstream bank find them he sent his other two menatarms to search downstream and then ran to the road and hurried back to the ridgetop to see the oxdrawn wagons still some way off creeping slowly up the last rise he returned to the fording place and sat down on a rock with his sword across his knees eventually the two who had gone upstream returned to say they had found not so much as a hoofprint on the muddy bank one of the guards who had been searching downstream returned with the same reportneither hide nor hair of any horse did he see where is laurent asked the knight he was with you what happened to him i thought he came back here replied the soldier glancing around quickly did he not he did not retorted the knight angrily as you can well see he did not but he was just behind me insisted the manatarms looking back along the bank he said he must have turned aside to relieve himself assuming this to be the case they waited for a time to see if their missing comrade would reappear when he failed to show up the knight and his men walked back along the downstream bank they shouted and called his name and listened for sounds of the absent soldier thrashing through the brush the surrounding wood remained deathly still and quiet the five guardsmen were still shouting when the rider sent with the message for the wagons appeared the knight turned on him have you seen him who my lord laurenthes disappeared did you see anything amiss on the road catching the wild cast of the knights eyes and frantic tone he replied with studied caution nothing amiss my lord all is well the wagons will be here soon all is not well by heaven roared the knight our horses have vanished too vanished spirited away the riders bald brow furrowed and tiny creases formed at the corners of his eyes but iare you certain sire we watered the horses and knelt down to get a mouthful ourselves explained one of the menatarms pushing forward when we looked uphe glanced around to gather the assent of his com panionsthe horses had disappeared one moment there and the next gone wondered the rider and you saw nothing if we had would we waste breath talking to you the knight charged angrily still gripping the hilt of his sword he scanned the forest round about a great green allembracing wall mark me there is some witchery hereabouts i can feel it they waited at the ford armed and ready for whatever might happen next however uncanny but nothing more sinister than clouds of flies gathering about their heads had befallen them by the time the first of the oxdrawn wagons reached them the driver stopped to allow his team to rest before continuing the descent into the vale of elfael while they waited the knight questioned the lead wagoner closely and then all the rest in turn as they drew up to water their animals but none of the drivers had seen or heard anything strange or disturbing on the road when the oxen had rested the wagon van of supplies resumed its journey to the monastery at llanelli while they were still some little way off the wagons were seen by the guards at the counts fortress hoping for a way to ingratiate himself with the baronand to distance himself from any whiff of thievery or misuse of this second shipmentcount falkes sent his own contingent of soldiers down to help convey the muchneeded food supplies the short remaining distance to the monastery the barons guards grudgingly tolerated the counts menatarms and the party continued on to llanelli to supervise the unloading of the wagons at what remained of the monastery while they watched the cargo being carried into the chapel the soldiers began to talk and were soon relating the unchancy events that had just befallen them in the forest thus word of the visiting soldiers strange experience quickly reached count de braose who summoned the barons knight to his fortress what do you mean the horses vanished inquired the count when he had heard what the knight had to say count de braose conceded the knight reluctantly we also lost a man men and horses do not simply dissolve into the air as you say sire replied the knight growing petulant even so i know what i saw but you said you saw nothing insisted count falkes and i stand by it the knight maintained stolidly i am no liar nor do i so accuse you replied the count his voice rising i am merely attempting to learn what it was that you sawif anything i saw began the knight cautiously a shadow as i knelt to drink a shadow fell over me and when i looked up i saw he hesitated yes yes urged the count impatience making him sharp drawing a bracing breath the knight replied i saw a great dark shapevery like that of a bird a dark shape you say like a bird repeated falkes but largerfar larger than any bird ever seen before black as the devil himself and a wingspread wide as your arms are you suggesting to me that this bird carried off your man and all the horses scoffed the count by heaven it must have been a very colossus amongst birds the knight shut his mouth and stared at the count his face growing hot with humiliation well go on i would hear the rest of this fantastic yarn we gave chase sire the knight said in a low disgruntled voice we pursued the thing into the brushwood and found a deer track which we followed but we neither saw nor heard anything again when we returned to the stream our horses were gone he nodded for emphasis vanished you looked for them i presume inquired the count we searched both ways along the stream and that is when laurent disappeared and again i suppose no one saw or heard anything nothing at all the forest was uncannily quiet if there had been so much as a mayfly to see or hear that we would have one moment laurent was there and the next he was gone growing tired of the murky vagueness of the report the count cut the interview short if there is nothing else you may go but do not for a single moment think to lay any of this at my feet by the holy name i swear i had nothing to do with it i accuse no one muttered the knight then you are dismissed take some refreshment for yourself and your men and then you may return to the baron god knows what he will make of the tale when the knight made no move to leave count falkes added i said your service is completed the supplies have been delivered i believe you may go we have no horses sire and what do you imagine i should do about that i am certain baron neufmarche would deem it a boon of honour if you lent us some worthy mounts the knight suggested the count glared at the man before him you want me to lend you horses he made it sound as if it was the most outlandish thing he had heard so far and what watch you make my animals disappear along with the others ill have none of it you can ride back in the empty wagons it would serve you right the knight stiffened under the counts sarcasm but held his ground the baron would be indebted to you i daresay yes i daresay he would agreed the count he regarded the knight there was something in what he suggested to have the baron beholden to him might prove a useful thing in future dealings oh very well take some refreshment and i will arrange it you can leave tomorrow morning thank you sire said the knight we are most grateful when the knight had gone count falkes put the matter out of his mind soldiers were a superstitious lot all told forever seeing signs and wonders where there were none even the most solidseeming needed little promptinga shadow in the woods was that itto embark on a flight of delirious fancy and set tongues wagging everywhere probably the slackwitted guards having ranged far ahead of the wagons had emptied a skinful of wine between them and in their drunken stupor allowed their untethered horses to wander off later that evening however as twilight deepened across the valley the count was given opportunity to reappraise his hasty opinion when the missing soldier laurent stumbled out of the forest and appeared at the gate of his stronghold half out of his head with fear the fellow was gibbering about demons and ghosts and a weird phantom bird and insisting that the ancient wood was haunted before the count could interview the man in person word had flashed throughout the caer that some sort of unworldly creaturea giant bird with a beak as long as a mans arm wings a double span wide and glowing red eyeshad arisen in the forest called forth by means both mysterious and infernal to instil terror in the hearts of the ffreinc intruders this last appeared only too likely the count considered watching his men fall over themselves in their haste to hear the lunatic this time tomorrow the tale would spread from one end of the valley to the other whatever it was that had frightened the stricken soldier it would take more than some cockeyed tale involving an oversized bird and the dubious misplacement of a few horses to make count falkes tremble in his boots nothing short of a midnight shower of fire and brimstone and the appearance of lucifer himself could drive a de braose from his throne once he had got his rump on it and that was that chapter for merian the invitation to attend the barons festivities came as a command to undertake an onerous obligation must we go she demanded when her mother informed her must i she had heard how the ffreinc lived how the men worshipped their ladies and showered them with expensive baubles how the noble houses were steeped in lavish displays of wealthfine clothes sumptuous food imported wine furniture made by artisans across the sea how the ffreinc prized beauty and held a high respect for ritual indulging many extraordinary and extravagant courtesies all this and more she had heard from one gossip or another over the years and it had never swayed her from her opinion that the ffreinc were little more than belligerent swine scrubbed up and dressed in satin and lace perhaps but born to the stockyard nonetheless the mere thought of attending one of their festive celebrations produced in her a dread akin to the sweating queasiness some people feel aboard ship in uneasy seas it is an honour to be asked queen anora told her then that is honour enough for me she replied crisply your father has already accepted the invitation he accepted without my permission merian pointed out let him go without me this was not the last word on the subject far from it in the end however she knew she must accept her fathers decision she would pretend the dutiful daughter and go like a martyr to her fate galled as she was to think of attending the event she worried that she would not be properly dressed that she would not know how to comport herself correctly that her speech would betray her for a brutish briton that her family would embarrass her with their backward ways and on and on just as there were a thousand objections to consorting with the ffreinc there was she discovered no end of hazards to fear as the barons castle at hereford loomed into sight rising in the deepening blue of a twilight summer sky above the thatched rooftops of the busy town merian was overcome by an apprehension so powerful she almost swooned her brother garran saw her sway and grasped her elbow to keep her from toppling from her saddle steady there sister he said grinning at her discomfort you dont want to greet all those highborn ffreinc ladies covered with muck from the road theyll think you a stable hand let them think what they will she replied trying to sound imperious and aloof i care not you do he asserted twitching like a sparrow with salt on its tail at the mention of the barons name do you think i havent seen oh and would it do you any harm to stand a little closer to the washbasin brother mine i doubt highborn ffreinc ladies look kindly on men who smell of the sty listen to that garran hooted your concern is as touching as it is sincere he chortled but your counsel is misdirected dear sister it is yourself you should worry about and worry she did merian had enough anxiety for the whole travelling party and it twisted her stomach like a wet rag by the time they reached the foot of the drawbridge spanning the outer ditch of the neufmarche stronghold she could scarcely breathe and then they were riding through the enormous timber gates and reining up in the spacious yard where they were greeted by none other than the baron himself accompanied by two servants in crimson tunics each bearing a large silver tray the baronhis smoothshaven face gleaming with goodwillstrode to meet them greetings hies arms bellowed the baron with bluff bonhomie i am glad you are here i trust your journey was uneventful pax vobiscum replied king cadwgan climbing down from his saddle and passing the reins to one of the grooms who came running to meet them yes we have travelled well praise god good the baron summoned his servants with a wave of his hand they stepped forward with their trays which contained cups filled to the brim with wine here some refreshment he said handing the cups around drink and may it well become you he said raising his cup he sipped his wine and announced the celebration begins tomorrow merian having dismounted with the others and accepted the welcome cup raised the wine to her lips it was watered and cool and went down with undignified haste when all had finished their cups the new arrivals were conducted into the castle merian marching with the wooden stoicism of the condemned followed her mother to a set of chambers specially prepared for them there were two rooms behind a single wooden door inside each was a single large bed with a mattress of goose down two chairs and a table with a silver candleholder graced the otherwise bare apartment food was brought to them the candles lit and a fire set in the hearth for though it was a warm summer night the castle walls were thick and constructed entirely of stone making the interior rooms autumnal having seen to the needs of the barons guests the servants departed leaving the women to themselves merian went to the window and pushed open the shutter to look out and down upon the massive outer wall by leaning out from the casement she could glimpse part of the town beyond the castle come to the table and eat something her mother bade her im not hungry the feast is not until tomorrow her mother told her wearily eat something for heavens sake before you faint but it was no use merian refused to taste a morsel of the barons food she endured a mostly sleepless night and rose early before her mother or anyone else and drawn by morbid curiosity she crept out to see what she could discover of the castle and the way its inhabitants lived she moved silently along one darkened corridor after another passing chamber after chamber until she lost count and came unexpectedly to a large anteroom that contained nothing more than a large stone fireplace and a hanging tapestry depicting a great hunt fierce dogs and men on horseback chasing stags hares wild boars bears and even lions all of which ran leaping through a woodland race drawn to the tapestry she was marvelling at the prodigious size and the tremendous amount of needlework required for such a grand piece when she felt eyes on her back turning quickly she found that she herself was the object of scrutiny your pardon lady merian said her observer emerging from the shadowed doorway across the room dressed entirely in blacktunic breeches boots and beltsave for a short crimson cloak neatly folded across his shoulders and fixed with a large brooch of fine yellow gold almost the same colour as his long flowing hair he wore a short sword at his side sheathed in a black leather scabbard baron neufmarche she said suddenly abashed forgive me i did not mean to trespass nonsense he said smiling i fear it is i who am trespassingon your enjoyment i do beg your pardon he moved to join her at the tapestry she gazed at the wall hanging and he gazed at her it is fine is it not it is very beautiful she said politely ive never seen the like a mere trifle compared to you my lady blushing at this unexpected compliment merian lowered her head demurely here now said the baron placing a finger beneath her chin he raised her face so that he could look into her eyes i see i have made you uncomfortable again i must beg your pardon he smiled and released her that is twice already today and i have not yet broken fast indeed he said as if just thinking of it for the first time i was just on my way to the table will you join me pray excuse me my lord said merian quickly but my mother will have risen and is no doubt looking for me then i must content myself to wait until the feast said the baron however before i let you go you must promise me a dance my lord i know nothing of ffreinc dancing she blurted i only know the normal kind neufmarche put back his head and laughed then for you i will instruct the musicians to play only the musique norniale unwilling to embarrass herself further merian gave a small curtsy my lord she said backing away i give you good day and good day to you my lady said the baron smiling as he watched her go merian ducked her head turned and fled back down the corridor the way she had come pausing at her chamber door to draw a breath and compose herself she touched the back of her hand to her cheek to see if she could still feel the heat there but it had gone so she silently opened the door and entered the room her mother was awake and dressed in her gown peace and joy to you this day mother she said hurrying to give her mother a kiss on the cheek and to you my lovely replied her mother but you are awake early where have you been oh she said absently just for a walk to see what i might learn of the castle was your father or brother about no but i saw the baron he was going to break his fast did you see his wife the baroness she was not with him merian walked to the table and sat down are they really so different from us her mother paused and considered the question i do not know she said at last perhaps not but you must be on your best behaviour merian her mother warned and on your guard mother the queen made no reply but simply raised an eyebrow suggestively whatever do you mean persisted merian i mean said her mother with exaggerated patience these ffreinc noblemen merian they are rapacious and grasping ever seeking to advance themselves at the expense of the britons by any means possibleand that includes marriage mother it is true daughter and do not pretend the thought of such a thing has never crossed your mind lady anora gave her daughter a glance of shrewd appraisal and added more than one young woman has had her heart turned by a handsome noblemanffreinc english irish or whatever i would kill myself first merian stated firmly of that you can be certain nevertheless her mother said nevertheless indeed and yet here they were attending a feastday celebration in the castle of a wealthy and powerful ffreinc lord her mother was right she knew but she still resented such an untoward intrusion into what she considered the affairs of her own secret heart she might not have the remotest intention of encouraging a dalliance with a loathsome ffreincman but she did not like having anyone much less her mother insinuating that she lacked the wits to govern her private affairs and anyway baron neufmarche was married and almost twice her age at least what on earth was her mother thinking just you keep yourself to yourself merian her mother was saying mother please she complained in a pained voice some of these noblemen need little enough encouragementthat is all i will say and here was i fumed merian thinking you had said too much already on the same day that baron neufmarches supply wagons departed the second dispatch of baron william de braoses wagons arrived as the heavyladen vehicles trundled out across the valley floor the sun dimmed in the west leaving behind a copper glow that faded to the colour of an angry bruise nine wagons piled high with sacks of lime rope rolls of lead and other supplies brought from normandie were met by orval the counts seneschal who instructed them to make camp below the caer food will be brought to you here he told them stay with your teams tonight and tomorrow you will be escorted to the building works the drivers passed a peaceful night at the foot of the hill beneath the fortress moving on the next day to the three castle mounds now emerging on elfaels borders the farthest a place newly dubbed vallon verte took all of a long day to reach and it was already growing dark by the time the wagoners began unhitching the oxen and leading them to the ox pen only when their animals were fed watered and put to rest for the night did the drivers join the masons and labourers gathered around their evening fire the workers camped a little distance away from the ditch beyond which rose the bailey mound where they had been working that day cups of ale and loaves of bread were passed from hand to hand as whole chickens splayed on green elm branches were turned slowly in the flames men talked easily and watched the stars gather in the sky overhead as they waited for their supper when they had eaten they spread their bedrolls in the emptied wagon beds and lay down to pass a peaceful night amongst the heaps of stone and stockpiled timbers of the building site it was not until one of the drivers went to yoke his team the next morning in preparation for the return journey that he noticed half of the oxen had disappeared of the twelve beasts to have entered the pen the night before only six remained three of his own animals were missing half of a second team and one of a third he quickly called the other drivers to him but other than standing and staring at the halfempty pen no one had any explanation for the disappearance they called the master but he could offer nothing better than the welsh are a thieving kind as god knows its their nature i say find the nearest farmer and youll find your oxen like as not when asked however the master refused to spare any of his men from the building work to search for the missing beasts they were still arguing over who should go to the fortress to request a party to track down the purloined animals when the count himself appeared he had come with a small force to make a circuit of the construction works now that the longawaited supplies had arrived he wanted to make certain that nothing prevented the workmen from making good and speedy progress thieves you say wondered falkes when the drivers had explained the predicament how many difficult to say my lord replied the driver no one saw them no one saw anything no my lord we only discovered the theft a short while ago it must have happened during the night and the ox pens are not guarded i suppose no my lord why not no one steals oxen my lord i think retorted the count you will find that they do the welsh will steal anything they can lay hands to so it would appear indeed replied the count sharply you will find them or go back without them we dare not go back without them the driver said why not the wagons are empty falkes pointed out you can get more oxen in lundein my lord replied the driver gravely matched teams are scarce as bird hair just now you wont find any for sale between here and paris be that as it may rejoined the count what do you expect me to do about it we thought begging your pardon sirethat his lordship might lend us some soldiers to find the thieves my lord unwillingness tugged the edges of the counts lips into a frown first the missing horses and now this was it really so difficult to keep animals from wandering off you want my men to search for oxen five or six menatarms should be enough seeing the counts hesitation the wagoner added the sooner we find the missing team the sooner we can be on our way to fetch more supplies for the masons when the count still failed to reply he continued now that the season is full on the baron will not take kindly to any delays as a last resort he added also the workers will be wanting their pay count falkes regarded the empty wagons and the drivers standing idle yes yes you have made your point he said at last ready your wagons and prepare to leave we will find the stolen beasts oxen are slow they cannot have gone far right you are my lord said the driver hurrying away before the count changed his mind turning to the soldiers who had accompanied him to the site de braose called the foremost knight to him guiscard come here a problem has arisen the knight attended his lord and listened to his instructions carefully consider it done he replied and the thieves sire what shall we do with them this land is now governed by the custom of the march you know what we do with thieves do you not a slow smile spread across the knights smooth face yes i believe i recall then do it ordered the count show no mercy the knight bent his head in acknowledgement of his orders then turned and started away he had taken only a few paces when the count called after him on second thought guiscard keep one or two alive and bring them to me we will draw and quarter them in the new town square and let their welldeserved deaths serve as a warning to anyone else who makes bold to steal from baron de braose it will be done sire the knight mounted the saddle and called three menatarms to attend him see you make some haste the count shouted as they rode off the wagons must be on their way without further delay chapter the day could not pass quickly enough for merian in her impatience she forgot her displeasure at her mothers meddling and her abhorrence of all things ffreinc and instead fell to fretting about clothes she stood gazing with mounting chagrin at the gown spread out on her bed why oh why had she chosen that one what had possessed her as much as she loathed the idea of consorting with norman nobility she did not want to give any of them the satisfaction of dismissing her as an ignorant british churl when the time came to dress for the feast she had worked herself into such a nervous state that she felt as if someone had opened a cage of sparrows inside her and the poor birds were all aflutter to get out trying her best to maintain her fragile composure she forced herself to wash slowly and carefully in the small basin of cool water she put on a fresh chemise of costly bleached linen and allowed her mother to brush her hair until it shone her long dark tresses were gathered and braided into a thick and intricate plait the end of which was adorned with a clasp of gold merian then drew on her best gown of pale blue and over it a short silkembroidered mantle of fine creamcoloured linen the gown and mantle were gathered at the waist by a wide kirtle of yellow satin the beaded tassels of which almost brushed her toes when she was ready queen anora approved her daughters choices and said but there is something missing suddenly stricken merian gasped what what have i forgotten calm yourself child cooed her mother bending to a small wooden casket that had travelled with them from eiwas raising the lid she produced a gossamerthin veil of white samite hemmed with gold thread she arranged the long rectangle of rare cloth with the point of one corner between merians dark brows and the rest trailing down her back to cover yet reveal the young womans braided hair mother your best veil breathed merian you shall wear it tonight my lovely replied her mother bending to the casket once more she brought out a thin silver circlet which she placed on her daughters head to secure the veil then stepped back to observe her handiwork exquisite her mother pronounced a jewel to brighten any celebration let the norman ladies gnaw their hearts with envy merian thanked her mother with a kiss i will be happy if i can survive the evening without falling over off with you now said anora sending her away with a pat on the cheek put on your shoes the chamberlain will be here any moment stepping into new soft leather slippers never worn merian tied the slender laces above her ankles and as the knock sounded on the chamber door she straightened drew a deep calming breath and prepared to take her place amongst the highborn guests assembling in the barons hall though it was daylight still the banqueting room was lit by rows of torches aflame in sconces on the walls the immense oak doors were opened wide to allow the barons guests to come and go as they pleased iron candletrees in each corner and a bright fire in the hearth at the far end of the room banished the shadows and gloom like uninvited guests boards had been set on trestles to form rows of tables down the length of the hall at one end of which another table had been established on a riser so that it overlooked all the others the room was aswarm with peopleboth guests in their courtly finery and servants in crimson tunics and mantles bearing trays of sweetmeats and dainties to sharpen the appetite up in a small balcony in one corner of the hall five musicians played music that sounded to merian like birds twittering in the trailing branches of a willow while water splashed in a crystal pool it was so beautiful she could not understand how it was that no one seemed to be listening to them at all she had time enough to spare them only a fleeting glance before being drawn to observe the arrival of the baron and his lady wife all hail the lord of the feast cried remey the barons seneschal as the couple appeared in the doorway presenting my lord and lady the baron and baroness neufmarche all hail hail replied the guests with fervour hail the lord of the feast baron neufmarche tall and regal in his black tunic and short red cloak with his long fair hair brushed back the gold at his throat and on his tunic gleaming stood on the threshold and passed a beneficent gaze over the glittering assembly he carried a small jewelled knife on his wide black belt and wore a cross of gold on a gold chain around his neck beside him slender as a willow wand stood the baroness lady agnes she wore a pale gown of silvery samite that glistened like water in the torchlight on her head was a small squarecornered caplet beaded with tiny pearls a double circlet of tiny pearls adorned each slender wrist oh but she was thin the outlines of her hip bones could be seen through the fine material of her dress and the bones at the base of her throat stood out like twin arrow points her cheeks were hollow only when she smiled stretching her tight lips across her teeth did a scrap of vitality steal into her features neufmarche and his wife were attended by a darkhaired young womantheir daughter lady sybilwhom merian judged to be a few years younger than herself the girl wore a bored and aloof expression that declared to the world a lively disdain for the gathering and no doubt her forced attendance behind the imperious young lady marched a bevy of courtiers and servants carrying trays heaped with tiny loaves of bread made with pure white flour other servants in crimson livery followed pulling a tun of wine on a small wagon still others brought casks of ale two kitchen servants followed bearing an enormous wooden trencher on poles in the centre of the trencher was a great wheel of soft white cheese surrounded by brined onions and olives from the south of france the servants proceeded to make a slow circuit of the room so that the guests might help themselves to the cheese and olives and merian turned her attention to the other guests there were several young ladies near her own age all ffreinc as far as she could tell there were no other britons the young women were gathered in tight little gaggles and cast snide glances over their shoulders none deigned to notice her merian had resigned herself to having her mothers company for the evening when two young women approached peace and joy to you this day one of the young women offered slightly the elder of the two she had an oval face and a slender swan like neck her hair was long so pale as to be almost white and straight and fine as silken thread she wore a simple gown of glistening green material merian had never seen before blessings on you both replied merian nicely pray allow me to make your acquaintance said the young woman in heavily accented latin i am cecile andhalfturning she indicated the darkhaired girl beside herthis is my sister therese i am merian she responded in turn i give you good greeting have you been long in england non answered the young woman we have just arrived from beauvais with our family my father has been brought to lead the barons warhost how do you find it here asked merian it is pleasant said the elder girl very pleasant indeed and not as wet as we feared added therese she was as dark as her sister was fair with large hazel eyes and a small pink mouth she was shorter than her sister and had a pleasant applecheeked face they told us it never stopped raining in england but that is not true it has rained only once since we arrived her gown was of the same shiny cloth but a watery aquamarine colour and like her sisters her veil was yellow lace do you live in hereford asked cecile no my father is lord cadwgan of eiwas the two young strangers looked at each other neither knew where that might be it is just beyond the marches merian explained a small cantref north and west of herenear the place the english call ercing and the ffreinc call archenfield you are welsh exclaimed the elder girl the two sisters exchanged an excited glance we have never met a welsh merian bristled at the word but ignored the slight british she corrected lightly les marches said therese she had a lilting almost wispy voice that merian found inexplicably appealing these marches are beyond the great forest oui that is so affirmed merian caer rhodlmy fathers strongholdis five days journey from here and a part of the way passes through the forest but then you have heard of the she broke off searching for the proper word lhanter inquired the elder of the two oui lhanter the haunting confirmed cecile everyone is talking about it it is all anyone speaks of affirmed therese with a solemn nod what do they say asked merian you do not know wondered cecile almost quivering with delight at having someone new to tell you have not heard i assure you i know nothing of it merian replied what is this haunting before the young woman could reply the barons seneschal called the celebrants to find places at the board let us sit together suggested cecile nicely oh do please sit with us cooed her sister we will tell you all about the haunting merian was about to accept the invitation when her mother turned to her and said come along daughter we have been invited to join the baron at the high table must i asked merian certainementgushed cecile you must it is a very great honneur precisely her mother replied but these ladies have kindly asked me to sit with them merian countered how thoughtful lady anora regarded the young women with a prim smile perhaps in the circumstance they will understand you may join them later if you wish merian muttered a hasty apology to her new friends and followed her mother to the high table where her father and brother were already taking their places at the board there were other noblemenall of them ffreinc with their resplendently jewelled ladiesbut her father was given the place at the barons right hand her mother sat beside her father and merian was given the place beside the baroness at her husbands left hand to merians relief lady sybil was far down at the end of the table with young ffreinc nobles on either side both of whom appeared more than eager to engage the aloof young lady as soon as all the remaining guests had found places at the lower tables the baron raised his silver goblet and in a loud voice declared lords and ladies all peace and joy to you this day of celebration in honour of my lady wifes safe return from her sojourn in normandie welcome everyone let the feast begin the feast commenced in earnest with the appearance of the first of scores of platters piled high with roast meat and others with bread and bowls of stewed vegetables servants appeared with jars and began filling goblets and chalices with wine i do not believe we have met said the baroness raising a goblet to be filled in her gown of glistening silver samite she seemed a creature carved of ice her smile was just as cold i am baroness agnes peace and joy to you my lady i am called merian the womans gaze sharpened to unnerving severity king cadwgans daughter yes of course i am glad you and your family could join us today are you enjoying your stay oh yes baroness very much this cannot be your first visit to england i think but it is answered merian i have never been to hereford before i have never been south of the march i hope you find it agreeable the baroness awaited her answer regarding her with keen almost malicious intensity wonderfully so replied merian growing increasingly uncomfortable under the womans unrelenting scrutiny bon answered the baroness she seemed suddenly to lose interest in the young woman that is splendid two kitchen servants arrived with a trencher of roast meat just then and placed it on the table before the baron another servant appeared with shallow wooden bowls which he set before each guest the men at the table drew the knives from their belts and began stabbing into the meat the women waited patiently until a servant brought knives to those who did not already have them more trenchers were brought to the table and still more as well as platters of bread and tureens of steaming buttered greens and dishes that merian had never seen before what is this she wondered aloud regarding what appeared to be a compote of dried apples honey almonds eggs and milk baked and served bubbling in a pottery crock it is called a muse lady agnes informed her without turning her head equally good with apricots peaches or pears whatever apricots or peaches might be merian did not know but guessed they were more or less like apples also arriving on the board were plates of steamed fish and something called frose which turned out to be pounded pork and beef cooked with eggs and several more dishes the contents of which merian could only guess delighted at the extraordinary variety before her she determined to try them all before the night was over as for the baroness sitting straight as a lance shaft beside her she took a bite of meat chewed it thoughtfully and swallowed she tore a bit of bread from a loaf and sopped it in the meat sauce ate it and then dabbing her mouth politely with the back of her hand rose from her place i hope we can speak together again before you leave she said to merian now i must beg your pardon for i am still very tired from my travels i will wish you bonsoir the baroness offered her husband a brisk smile and whispered something into his ear as she stepped from the table her sudden absence left a void at merians right hand and the baron was deep in conversation with her father so she turned to the guest on her left a young man a year or two older than her brother you are a stranger i think he said watching her from the corner of his eye verily she replied so are we both he said and merian noticed his eyes were the colour of the sea in deep winter his features were finealmost feminine except for his jaw which was wide and angular his lips curled up at the corners when he spoke i have come from rainault do you know where that is i confess i do not answered merian remembering her mothers caution and trying to discourage him with an indifferent tone it is across the narrows in normandie he said but my family is not norman no he shook his head we are angevin a flicker of pride touched this simple affirmation an ancient and noble family still ffreinc though merian observed unimpressed where is your home he asked my father is king cadwgan ap gruffyddof an ancient and noble family our lands are in eiwas in wallia scoffed the young man you are a welsh british said merian stiffly he shrugged whats the difference welsh she said with elaborate disdain is what ignorant saxons call anyone who lives beyond the march everyone else knows better i have heard of this march he said unperturbed i have heard about your haunted forest merian stared at the young man agitation knitting her brows as curiosity battled her reluctance to encourage any ffreinc affinity curiosity won this is the second time this evening someone has mentioned the haunting searching the lower tables she found the two girls she had spoken to earlier those twothere she indicated the sisters sitting together they spoke of it also they would muttered the young man obviously irritated that his important news had been spoiled do you know them my sisters he said as if the word pained his mouth what did they say nothing at all the baron was seated and we had to come to table so i learned nothing more about it well then i will tell you said the young man recovering something of his former good humour as he went on to explain how the forest was haunted by a rare phantom in the form of an enormous preying bird how strange said merian wondering why she had heard nothing of this this bird is bigger than a mantwo men it can appear and disappear at will and swoop out of the sky to snatch horses and cattle from the field truly he nodded with dread assurance apparently the thing was black from head to tail and twice the height of the tallest man possessing glowing red eyes and a beak as sharp as a sword he smiled grimly enjoying the effect his words were having on the young woman beside him it can devour a human being whole with one snatch of its beak and also outrun the fastest horse i thought you said it swooped from the sky merian pointed out dashing cold water on his fevered assertions is it a bird or a beast a bird the young man insisted that is it has the wings and head of a bird but the body of a man only bigger much bigger and it does not only fly but hides in the forest and waits to attack its prey how do you know this asked merian how does anyone know bending near he put his head next to hers and said it was seen by soldiersnot so many days ago where in the forest of the march he replied confidently some of the barons own knights and menatarms were attacked they fought the creature off of course but they lost their horses anyway the tale was so strange that merian could not decide what to make of it they lost their horses she repeated a sceptical note edging into her tone all of them the young man nodded solemnly and one of the knights what it was a cry of disbelief it is true he insisted hurriedly the knight was missing for three days but was at last able to fight free of the thing and escaped unharmedexcept that he cannot remember what happened to him or where he was some are saying that the phantom is from the otherworld and everyone knows that any mortal who goes there cannot remember the way backunless of course he eats of the food of the dead and then he is doomed to stay there and can never return speechless merian could but shake her head in wonder all the barons court have been talking about nothing else said the young man i have seen the man that was taken but he will speak of it no more why not for fear that the creature has left its mark on him and will return to claim his soul can such a thing happen bien surthe young man nodded again it has been known the priests at the cathedral have forbidden anyone to make sacrifice to the phantom they say the creature is from the pit and has been sent by the devil to sift us an exquisite thrill rippled through merians framehalf fear half morbid fascination you live beyond les marches her companion said and yet you have no knowledge of the phantom bird none replied merian i once heard of a great serpent that haunted one of the lakes up in the hillsllyntalin it was the creature possessed the head of a snake and the slimy skin of an eel but legs like those of a lizard with long claws on its toes it came out at night to steal cattle and drag them down into the bottom of the lake to drown a wyrm the young man informed her knowingly i too have heard of such things but that was a long time agobefore my father was born my grandfather told me they killed it when he was a boy he said it stank so bad that three men fell sick and one man died when they tried to bury it in the end they burnt it where it lay i would like to have seen that the young man said appreciatively smiling suddenly he said my name is roubert what is yours i am merian she replied peace and joy to you lady merian he said this night and all nights and to you roubert she smiled liking this young man more and more have you ever seen a wyrm no he conceded but in a village not far from our castle in normandie there was a child born with the head of a dog by this the father knew his wife was a witch for she had had unnatural relations with a black hound that had been seen outside the village what happened the villagers hunted down the dog and killed it when they returned home they found the woman and the baby were also dead with the same wounds as those inflicted on the dog here now interrupted a voice next to merian she turned to see baron neufmarche leaning across the empty place toward her glancing down the table she saw that her father was deep in conversation with the ffreinc nobleman next to him what is this nonsense you are telling our guest nothing of importance sire answered the young man retreating rapidly we were speaking of the phantom in the marches forest volunteered merian have you heard of this sire hmph puffed the baron phantom or no it cost me five horses the creature ate your horses wondered merian in amazement i did not say that replied the baron smiling he slid closer to her on the bench i lost the horses it is true but i am more inclined to the view that one way or another the soldiers were careless what about the missing footman asked the young man as to that replied the baron i expect drink or too much sun will account for his tale he paused to reconsider still i grant that he was a solid enough fellow whatever the explanation the incident has much altered his mind merian shivered at the thought of something wild and freakish arising in the forest the very forest she and her family had passed through on the way to hereford but come my lady said the baron with a smile i see i have upset you we will not speak of such abhorrent things anymore here he reached for a bowl containing a pale purple substance have you ever tasted fruinenty no never then you must i insist said the baron handing her his own silver spoon he pushed the bowl toward her i think you will like it merian dipped the tip of the spoon into the mushy substance and touched it to her tongue the taste was cool and sweet and creamy it is very good she said handing back the spoon keep it said the baron closing his hand over hers a little gift he said for gracing this celebration with your ah presence lumineuse your radiant presence merian feeling the heat of his touch on her skin thanked him and tried to withdraw her hand but he held it more tightly leaning closer he put his mouth to her ear and whispered there is so much more i would give you my lady chapter the knight called guiscard in command of eight doughty menatarms ordered his troops to follow the tracks made by the missing oxen most of the hoofprints as expected led back toward the valley in the direction the wagons had come a few however led out from the pen and down the hill to the nearby stream here men to me shouted guiscard as soon as he was alerted to this discovery we have them when the searchers had assembled once more they mounted their horses and set off together on the trail of the missing oxen pursuing the track as it followed the stream passing down around the foot of the castle work and behind the shoulder of the next hill once out of sight of the builders camp the trail turned inland heading straight up over the hill and toward the forest a short distance to the northeast the searchers mounted the brow of the hill and started out across the wide grassy hilltop toward the leafdark woodland blue in the distance and shimmering in the heat haze of summer the tracks were easy to follow and the soldiers loped easily through the long grass slowing only as they approached the beeches elms and fingerthin fir trees that formed a protective bulwark at the edge of the forest passing between the trunks of two large elms the trail of the missing oxen entered the wood as through a timber gate the light was somewhat poorer inside but the beasts left good wellshaped prints in the soft earthand occasionally soft splats of droppingswhich allowed the knight and his men to proceed without difficulty a few hundred paces inside the wood the ox trail joined a deer run and the hoofprints of the four heavyfooted beasts mingled with those of their swiftrunning cousins the path traced the undulating hillside rising and falling with the rock escarpment beneath it until it descended into a deepriven glen with a brook at the bottom here the trail turned to follow the trickle of water as it flowed out from the forest interior eventually joining the stream that passed by the foot of the castle they pushed on and after a time the banks became steeper and rock lined as the brook sank lower into the folded earth dwindling to little more than a blueblack rivulet at the bottom of a ravine of shattered grey shale the searchers moved deeper into the forest where the trees were older and bigger and the undergrowth denser sunlight came in dappled fits and starts striking green glints from every leafy surface when the search party came to the top of a ridge guiscard halted his men and paused a moment to survey the path ahead the air was still and humid the trail dark and close grown the knight ordered his companions to dismount and proceed on foot the thieves cannot have gone much farther guiscard told his men the only grazing is behind us now they will not want to stray too far from it who says the thieves intend to graze them wondered one of the menatarms valuable beasts like those scoffed the knight what else would they do with them the man shrugged then spat eat them guiscard glowered at the soldier and said move on the trail pursued its way down the slope of the ridge beneath trees of everincreasing size and age the upper branches grew higher from the ground lifting the roof of foliage and dimming the sunlight with a heavy canopy of glowing green leaves on and on they went and when the knight stopped again the wood had become dark and silent as an empty church the only sound to be heard was the rustling and chirping of small birds unseen in the upper branches high above thorny shrubsblackberry and bilberrygrew man high on each hand a few hundred paces farther along the trail pinched down to a constricted corridor before disappearing into a tangled and impenetrable bank of brambles as they neared the wall of thorns they saw that the narrow trail turned sharply to the left the oxen had passed between two overlapping hedges the animals had been led single file in order to squeeze through and there were tufts of tawny hair caught on some of the lower thorns the silence of the forest had given way to the noisy chafe and chatter of crows emanating from the other side of the bramble bank easing cautiously through the thorny hedge the searchers entered a clearing the racket of the birds had risen to a piercing cacophony gripping their lances the soldiers crept out from the thorn hedge and into a small sunlit meadow ringed about with birch and rowan trees in the centre of the clearing was a roiling boiling black mound of birds hundreds of them crows ravens choughs jays and others were fighting over something on the ground and still more were circling and diving in the air above this squirming living heap of feathers wings and beaks the air was loud with their shrieks and heavy with a sweet turgid stink drive them off guiscard ordered and four of the menatarms rushed the mound of birds swinging their lances before them and yelling as they ran the birds took flight at the sudden appearance of the men and fled squawking and screeching into the sky most settled again in the branches of the surrounding trees where they continued to shriek their outrage at being driven from their repast the birds gone for the moment the knight and the rest of the men approached the mound where their four comrades were now standing still as stones enthralled by the heap before them out of the way ordered guiscard striding up the footman stepped aside and the knight took one look at the mound before him and almost vomited before him were what appeared to be the entrails and viscera of the missing oxenartfully heaped into a single glistening purple mound of rotting slime rising from the centre of this putrefying mass was a long wooden stake and on the stake was the severed head of an ox the skin and most of the flesh had been ripped from the skull to reveal the bloody bone beneath two of the hapless animals hooves were stuffed in its hanging mouth and its tail protruded absurdly from one of its ears and jutting from the naked eyeballs of the freshly flensed skull were four long black raven feathers the weird sight caused these battlehardened men to blanch and brought the gorge rising to their throats one of the soldiers cursed and two others crossed themselves glancing around the clearing nervously sacre bleu grunted a soldier prodding a loppedoff hoof with the blade of his lance this is the work of witches what said the knight recovering some of his nerve have you never seen a slaughtered beast slaughtered muttered one of the men scornfully if they were slaughtered where are the carcasses another said aye and wheres the blood and hide and bones carried away by them that slaughtered the beasts replied another of the soldiers growing angry its just a pile of guts with that he shoved his spear into the curdling bulk striking an unseen bladder which erupted with a long low hiss and released a noxious stench into the already fetid air stop that shouted the man beside him shoving the offender who pushed back enough shouted the knight quickly scanning the surrounding trees for any sign that they were being watched he said the thieves may still be close by make a circuit of the clearing and give a shout when you find their trail only too glad to turn away from the grisly mound in the centre of the glade the soldiers walked to different parts of the perimeter and bending low began to look for the footprints of the thieves one complete circuit failed to turn up anything resembling a human footprint so the knight ordered them to do it again more slowly this time and with better care and attention they were all working their way around the circle when a strange sound halted them in midstep it started as an agonised cryas if someone or something was in mortal anguishand then rose steadily in pitch and volume to a wild ululation that raised the short hairs on the napes of the warriors necks the crows in the treetops stopped their chatter and a dread hush descended over the clearing the unnatural calm seemed to spread into the surrounding forest like tendrils of a stealthy vine like a fog when it searches along the ground coiling moving flowing amongst the hidden pathways until all is shrouded with its vapours the searchers waited hardly daring to breathe after a moment the eerie sound rose again closer this time growing in force rising and risingand then suddenly trailing away as if stifled by its own strength the carrion birds in the high branches took flight all at once the soldiers holding tight to their weapons gazed fearfully at the sky and at the wood around them the trees seemed to have moved closer squeezing the ring tighter forming a sinister circle around them christ have mercy cried a footman he flung out a hand and pointed across the clearing the soldiers turned as one to see an indistinct shape moving in the shadows beneath the trees at the edge of the glade straining into the darkness they saw a form emerge from the forest gloomas if the shadow itself was thickening gathering darkness and congealing into the shape of a monstrous creature big as a man but with the head and wings of a bird and a round skulllike face that ended in an extravagantly long pointed black beak like a fallen angel risen from the pit this baleful presence stood watching them from across the clearing steady men said the knight holding his sword before him close ranks no one moved close ranks shouted guiscard now the soldiers shaken to action moved to obey they drew together shoulder to shoulder weapons ready even as they formed the battle line the phantom melted away disappearing before their eyes as the shadows reclaimed it the soldiers waited bloodless hands gripping their weapons staring fearfully at the place where they had last seen the creature when a cloud passed over the sun leeching warmth from the air the terrified men bolted and ran stand cried the knight to no avail he watched his men deserting him thrashing through the brush in their blind haste to escape the horror encircling them with a last glance around the tainted meadow brave guiscard joined his men in flight back at the builders camp the breathless searchers told what they had found in the forest and how they had been attacked by the forest phantoma creature so hideous as to defy descriptionand only narrowly escaped with their lives as for the missing oxen they had been completely devoured by the creature except for the vitals one of the menatarms explained to his astonished audience the devil thing devoured everything but the guts he said the soldier next to him took up the tale the bowels it vomited in the meadow we must have startled it at its feeding he surmised another soldier nodded adding cest vrai no doubt that was why it attacked us but the soldiers were wrong it was not the phantom that fed on the stolen oxen that very evening in british huts and holdings all along the valley a score of hungry families dined on unexpected gifts of good fresh meat that had been discovered lying on the stone threshold of the house each gift had been delivered the same way wrapped in green oak leaves one of which was pinned to the parcel by a long black wing feather of a raven chapter brother aethelfrith paused on the road to drag a damp sleeve across his sweating face the norman merchants with whom he had been travelling had long since outpaced him his short legs were no match for their mules and highwheeled carts and none of the four traders or their retainers had consented to allow him to ride in back of one of the wagons to a man all had made obscene gestures and pinched their nostrils at him stink stink do i muttered the mendicant under his breath he was a most fragrant friar to be sure but the day was sweltering and sweat was honest reward for labours spent normans he grumbled mopping his face god rot them all what a peculiar people they were big lumpy lunks with faces like horses and feet like boats vain and arrogant untroubled by any notions so basic as tolerance fairness equality always wanting everything their own way never giving in they reckoned any disagreement as disloyal dishonest or deceitful while judging their own actions however outrageously unfair as lawful godgiven rights did the ruler of heaven really intend for such a greedy grasping gluttonous race of knaves and rascals to supplant good king harold blessed jesus he muttered watching the last of the wagons recede into the distance give the whole filthy lot flaming carbuncles to remind them how fortunate they are then chuckling to himself over the image of the entire occupying population hopping around clutching painfully swollen backsides he moved on upon cresting the next hill he saw a stream and a fording place where the road met the valley several of the carts had paused to allow the animals to drink god be praised he cried and hurried to join them perhaps they would take pity on him yet arriving at the ford he called a polite greeting but the merchants roundly ignored him so he walked a little way upstream until he came to a shady place where drawing his long brown robe between his legs he tucked the ends into his belt and waded out into the stream ahh he sighed luxuriating in the cool water a very blessing on a hot summer day thank you jesus much obliged when the merchants moved off a short while later he remained behind content to dabble in the stream a little longer by all accounts llanelli was a mere quarter days walk from the ford no one was expecting him so he could take all the time he needed and if he reached the monastery by nightfall he would count himself fortunate the fat friar padded in the stream watching the small darting fish he hummed to himself enjoying the day as if it were a meal of meat and ale spread before him with lavish abundance upon reflection he had no right to be so happy his errand god knew was sin itself how he had come to the idea he still could not say an overheard conversationa marketplace rumour an errant word perhaps spoken by a stranger in passinghad worked away in him sending its black roots deep growing unseen until it burst forth like a noxious flower in full bloom one moment he had been standing before the butchers stall haggling over the price of a rind of bacon and the next his bandy legs were scuttling him back to his oratory to pray forgiveness for the thoroughly immoral idea that had so forcefully awakened in his everscheming brain oh my soul he sighed shaking his head at the mystery of it the heart of man is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked who can know it although he had spent the night on his knees begging both forgiveness and direction as dawn came up bright in the east that heavenly guidance was no more in evidence than the popes pardon if you have qualms lord he sighed stop me now otherwise i go since nothing materialised to prevent him he rose washed his face and hands strapped on his sandals and hastened to consummate his scheme it was notand he was fiercely adamant about this partfor his own enrichment nor did he desire any gain but justice this was the heart of the matter justice for as his old abbot had often said when iniquity sits in the judgement seat good men must take their appeals to a higher court aethelfrith did not know how that appeal to justice might come about but trusted that his information would give bran all the inspiration he required to at least set the wheels in motion the shadows lengthened over the valley and the road was not shrinking with grudging reluctance aethelfrith stepped from the water dried his feet on the hem of his robe and continued on his way the merchants van was well ahead of him now but he dismissed the rude company from his thoughts his destination was almost within sight the vale of elfael stretched before him its green fields spotted with slowshifting loud shadows he doubted a more peaceful and serene dale could be found anywhere buoyed by the beauty of the place brother aethelfrith opened his mouth wide and began to sing aloud letting his voice resound and echo out across the valley as he made his way down the long slope that would eventually bring him to llanelli he was sweating again long before reaching the valley floor in the near distance he saw the old fortress caer cadarn rising on its hump of rock overlooking the road may your walls keep you safe as jericho aethelfrith muttered then crossed himself and hurried by the sun was touching the far western hills when he reached llanelli or what was left of it the low wall of the enclosure had been taken down and most of the interior buildings either destroyed or converted to other uses the yard had been enlarged to make a market square and new structuresunfinished their bare timbers rising from the builders rubblestood at each corner all that remained of the original monastery was a single row of monks cells and the chapel which was only slightly larger than his own oratory there seemed to be no one around so he strode to the door of the chapel and walked in two priests knelt before the altar on which burned a single thick tallow candle that sent a black oily thread of smoke into the close air he stood in the doorway for a moment then cleared his throat to announce his presence and said forgive me friends i see i am inter rupting your prayers the nearer of the two priests looked around and then nudged the other who quickly finished his prayer crossed himself and rose to greet the newcomer god be good to you brother said the priest taking in his visitors robe and tonsure i am bishop asaph how can i be of service greetings in christ and all his glorious saints declared the mendicant brother aethelfrith i am come on an errand of some ahhe hesitated not wishing to say too much about his illicit choredelicacy and importance peace and welcome brother the bishop said as you can see we have little left to call our own but we will help you in any way we can it is easily done and will cost you nothing the friar assured him i am looking for bran ap brychani have a message for him i was hoping someone here could tell me where to find him at this a shadow passed over the bishops face his smile of welcome wilted and his eyes grew sad ah he sighed i would that you had asked anything but that alas you will not find the man you seek amongst the living he shook his head with weary regret our young prince bran is dead dead oh dear god how aethelfrith gasped when did this happen last autumn it was replied the bishop as to how it happenedthere was a fight and he was cruelly cut down when trying to escape count de braoses knights the english monk staggered backwards and collapsed on a bench against the wall here rest a moment said asaph brother clyro fetch our guest some water clyro hobbled away and the bishop sat down beside his guest i am sorry my friend he said your question caught me off guard or i might have softened the blow for you where is he buried i will go and offer a prayer for his soul you knew our bran met him once he stayed the night with mehe and that tall tree of a fellowwhat was his name john they had a priest with them good man i think one of yours iwan yes and ffreol perhaps the very fellows aethelfrith nodded they were on their way to lundein to see the king i went with them in the end sorely disappointed they were but i could have told them the ffreinc are bastards from what we have been able to learn asaph said our bran was captured on his way home he was killed a few days later trying to escape he regarded his visitor with softeyed sadness it pains me the more he continued but iwan and brother ffreol also fell afoul of count de braose dead too all of them asked aethelfrith bishop asaph bent his head in sorrowful assent filthy norman scum growled the friar kill first and repent later that is all they know worse than danes there was nothing to be done asaph said we said a mass for him of course buthe lifted his hands helplesslythere it is so now you have no king observed aethelfrith bran was the last of his line affirmed the bishop we must be content now to simply survive and endure this unjust reign as best we can and nowhis voice quivered slightlyanother blow has been dealt us the monastery has been taken over for a market town scabby thieves the lot of em muttered aethelfrith nay worse than that even the lowest thief wouldnt rob god of his home baron de braose has determined to install his own churchmen in this place they are to arrive any dayindeed when you came to the door we thought it might be the new abbot come to drive us from our chapel where will you go we are not without friends the monastery of saint dyfrig in the north is sister to llanelli or once was we will go to them and from there the bishop offered a forlorn smile it is in gods hands then i am doubly sorry said aethelfrith this world is full of trouble god knows and he spares not his own servants brother clyro returned with a bowl of water which he offered to their guest aethelfrith accepted the bowl and drank deeply why did you want to see our bran asked the bishop when he had finished i had a notion to help him replied the friar but now that i see how events have fallen out i warrant it a poor idea in any event it is of no consequence now i see replied the bishop he did not press the matter have you travelled far from hereford i keep an oratory theresaint ennions have you heard of it of course yes replied the bishop one of our own dear saints from long ago to be sure conceded aethelfrith but it is home to me now then it is too far to come and return all at once you must stay with us a few daysthe bishop lifted a hand in a gesture of helpless nessor until the ffreinc come to drive us all away friar aethelfrith spent the next day helping asaph and clyro pack their belongings they wrapped the bound parchment copies of the psalms and the book of saint matthew as well as the small golden bowl used for the eucharist on high holy days these things had to be disguised and secreted amongst the other bundles of clerical implements and utensils for fear that the ffreinc would confiscate them if their value was known they finished their work and enjoyed a simple supper of stewed beans with a little sliced leek and burdock the next morning brother aethelfrith bade his friends farewell and started back to his oratory the merchants he had followed to elfael had also concluded their business and as he passed castle truanwhat the normans were now calling caer cadarnhe saw five muledrawn carts turn out onto the road and thought now that the wagons were empty of goods he might beg bold and ask for a ride so he quickened his pace and by midmorning had caught up with the wagon van when it paused to water the animals at the valley stream before starting up the long slope of the forested ridge he came within hailing distance and gave a shout which was not returned i see they still have some manners to learn he muttered but no matter they will have to be hardhearted indeed to refuse my request as he neared the fording place he saw that the traders were standing together in a clump motionless with their backs to him they seemed to be staring at something on the far side of the stream he hurried to join them calling pax vobiscum one of the traders turned on him keep your voice down he whispered savagely mystified the friar shut his mouth with a click of his teeth taking his place beside the men he stared across the fording place and into the wood the mules impassive creatures ordinarily seemed restless and uneasy they jigged in their traces and tossed their heads and yet the wood beyond the stream seemed quiet enough brother aethelfrith could see no one on the road all seemed calm and tranquil forgive my curiosity friend he whispered to the man next to him but what is everyone looking at gerald thought he saw the thingthe creature the merchant whispered back his voice tense in the unnatural silence the only sound to be heard was the lazy liquid gurgle of the water as it slipped around and over the stones what creature wondered the priest nothing moved amongst the lush green foliage of the trees and lower brushwood the phantom the man explained he turned his face to the bowlegged friar do you not know i know nothing of any phantom replied aethelfrith what sort of phantom is it presumed to be why replied the merchant it takes the form of a great giant of a bird men hereabouts call it king raven do they indeed wondered the friar much intrigued what does it look likethis giant bird the merchant stared at him in disbelief by the rood man are you dim it looks like a thumping great raven shut up hissed one of the others just then you will have the demon down on us before anyone could reply to this one of the other traders threw out his hand and shouted there it is friar aethelfrith glimpsed a flash of blueblack feathers glinting in the sun and the suggestion of a massive black wing as the creature emerged from the brushwood on the opposite bank a few score paces downstream two of the merchants gave out shouts of terrified surprise and two others fell to their knees clasping their hands and crying aloud to god and saint michael to save them the rest fled back down the road to the safety of castle truan leaving their carts behind christ have mercy gasped one of the remaining merchants as the creatures head came into view its face was an oval of smooth black bone devoid of feathers with two round pits where its eyes should have been save for the wickedly long pointed beak its head most resembled a charred human skull lifting its swordlike beak the thing uttered a piercing shriek that resounded in the deathly silence of the wood even as the cry hung in the air the phantom turned and simply melted back into the shadow of the wood the terrorstricken merchants leapt to their feet and ran for their wagons lashed their mules to motion and fled back into the valley of all those at the stream only aethelfrith was left to give chasewhich he promptly did chapter gathering up his robe aethelfrith strode boldly across the stream and started after the phantom upon reaching the far side of the stream he paused and finding nothing proceeded into the brushwood where the thing had vanished there was no sign of the creature and after a few paces he stopped to reconsider he could hear the traders clattering away into the distance as their wagons bumped over the rutted road then even as he was wondering whether to continue the chase or resume his journey he saw the faint glimmer of glistening black feathersjust a quick flash before it disappeared into a hedge bank a few hundred paces down the trail he hurried on the ground rose toward the ridge and he eventually reached the top sweating and out of breath he stumbled upon a game trail that led along the ridgetop it was old and well established overarched by the huge limbs of plane trees elms and oaks that formed a vault overhead and allowed only intermittent shafts of sunlight to strike down through the leaf canopy and illuminate the path it was dark as a cellar but since it was easier than pushing his way through the heavy underbrush he decided to follow the run and soon realised just how quickly it allowed a man on foot to move about the forest the heat had been mounting steadily as the sun arced toward midday and aethelfrith was glad for the shade beneath the hanging boughs he walked along listening to the thrushes singing in the upper branches and lower down the click and chirrup of insects working the dead leaf matter that rotted along the trail at any moment he told himself he would turn backbut the path was soft underfoot so he continued after a time the trail branched off the lefthand side continued along the ridgetop and the righthand side descended the slope to a rocky hollow here the priest stopped to consider which path if either to take the day was speeding from him and he decided to resume his homeward journey he turned around and started back but he had not gone far when he heard voices murmured only light as thistledown on the deadstill air there and gone again and so faint as to be easily dismissed as the invention of his own imagining but years of living alone in his oratory with no company save his own inner musings had made his hearing keen he held his breath and listened for the sound to come again his vigilance was rewarded with another feathersoft murmur followed by the unmistakable sound of laughter frail as a wisp of cobweb adrift on the breeze it nonetheless gave him a direction to follow he took the righthand trail leading down the back of the ridge the path fell away steeply as it entered the hollow below and aethelfrith his short legs unable to keep up with his bulk plunged down the hill he entered the hollow in a rush tripped over a root and fell landing with a mighty grunt at the feet of the great black phantom raven he slowly raised his fearful gaze to see the ominous black head regarding him with malevolent curiosity the fantastic wings spread wide and the thing swooped the priest rolled on his belly and tried to avoid the assault but he was too slow and he felt his arm seized in a steely grip as he squirmed on the ground god save me he cried shout louder hissed the creature god may hear you yet let be he cried in english wriggling like an eel to get free let me go do you want to kill him or should i aethelfrith twisted his head around and saw a tall brawny man step forward he wore a long hooded cloak into which were woven a multitude of small tatters of green cloth twigs and branches and leaves of all kinds had also been attached to the curious garment regarding the priest with a frown he drew a knife from his belt ill do it wait a little spoke the raven with a human voice well not kill him yet time enough for that later to the friar he said you were at the ford did anyone else follow struggling in the creatures unforgiving dutch it took the priest a moment to realise that the thing had spoken to him turning his eyes to his captor once more he saw not the bonethin shanks of a bird but the wellbooted feet and legs of a man a man wearing a long cloak covered entirely with black feathers the face staring down at him was an expressionless deaths head but deep in the empty eye sockets aethelfrith caught the glimmer of a living eye i ask for the last time the blackcloaked man said did anyone follow you no sire replied the priest i came alone god have mercy can we not talk this out i am a priest am i not that you are aethelfrith said the creature releasing him at once pax vobiscum cried the priest scrambling to his feet i mean no harm i only thought to tuck exclaimed the man in the leafy cloak reaching up a blackgloved hand the creature took hold of the sharp raven beak and lifted it to reveal a mans face beneath blessed jesus gasped the astonished friar is it bran greetings tuck laughed bran what brings you to our wood you are dead not as dead as some might wish he said removing the highcrested hood from his head tell us quickly nowhow did you come to be here a hood cried the friar relief bubbling over into exultation it is just a hood a hood nothing more admitted bran why are you here i came to find you did i not the friar stared at the strangely costumed man in amazement and here you are sweet peters beard but you do not half frighten a body friar tuck called iwan stepping dose he gave the priest a thump on the back you held your life in your hands just then what of the othersthe men at the forddid they see you nay john they all ran away clutching their bowels he smiled at the memory you put the fear of the devil in them no mistake bran smiled good to iwan he said bring the horses we will meet siarles as planned tuck too wondered iwan of course bran turned and started away wait called the cleric i came to elfael to find you i have something important to say later bran told him we must be miles from here before midday our days work has only begun come along he said beckoning the priest to follow watch and learn the game run was narrow and the horses were fast pounding along the ridgetop track as the outreaching hazel branches whipped past bran following iwans lead slashed his mount across the withers with his reins careering through the forest the trail continued to climb as the ridge rose bending around to the north upon reaching the summit they abandoned the run and struck off along another trail moving west toward the edge of the forest the riders might have travelled more quickly but for the extra weight behind bran clinging on for dear life the trail dropped sharply into a rocky defile the pathway became rough under hoof and the riders slowed stones the size of houses rose abruptly on each hand forming a winding and shadowed corridor through which they had to pick their way carefully when the path grew too narrow they abandoned their mounts tying them to a small pine tree growing in a crevice and then proceeded on foot silently they stalked along a stone gallery so close they could have touched both sides with arms outstretched this trail ended and they stepped out into a small clearing where they were met by another manalso dressed in a long hooded cloak of green tatters where have you been he whispered sharply he saw the bandylegged priest toiling along in brans wake and asked where did you find that ignoring the question bran asked are they here aye answered the man but they will soon be moving onif they are not already gone he darted away hurry bran turned to his visitor and said you must swear a sacred oath to hold your tongue and keep silent why what is going to happen asked aethelfrith swear it insisted bran whatever happens you must swear on my naked soul i swear silence the friar replied may all the saints bear witness now stay out of sight to iwan looking on he said take up your position you know what to do all three moved off at a fast trot brother aethelfrith stood for a moment catching his breath and then hurried after them soon the surrounding wood began to thin somewhat and they came to a dell with huge boulders strewn amongst the standing trees like miniature mountains at the far end of the dell the forest ended and the vale of elfael opened before them beneath a great spreading beech tree at the forests edge three swineherds were taking their midday mealtwo men and a boy eating from a tuck bag they passed between them all around them their scattered herdthirty or more large greyandblackspotted swinegrubbed and rooted for last years acorns and beech mast beneath the trees without a word bran and his two companions left the trail quickly melting into the shadowed greenwood aethelfrith knelt down on the path to catch his breath and wait to see what would happen nothing happened his attention had begun to drift when he heard a shout from the swineherds turning his eyes back to the trio of herdsmen the friar saw that all three were on their feet and staring into the wood he could not see what had drawn their attention but he could guess the three remained stockstill unable or unwilling to move rigid with fear then aethelfrith saw what they had seen the elusive black shape moving slowly in and out of the shadows amongst the trees at the same time two figures in green emerged from the wood behind the watching herdsmen keeping the lowhanging beech between the swineherds and the black shape that held their attention the two greencloaked men using nothing more than short staves quickly culled eight pigs from the herd and led them away into the wood wonder of wonders the swine followed the strange herdsmen willingly and without a sound in less time than it would have taken aethelfrith to tell the livestock had been removed from the dell just as the animals disappeared into the forest there arose a ghastly unnatural shriek from the surrounding wood it was the same screech the priest had heard at the ford only now he knew what it signified the swineherds terrified by the inhuman cry threw themselves to the ground and covered their heads with their mantles they were still cowering there not daring to move when iwan appeared and with a gesture only summoned tuck to follow him they returned to the horses then and waited for bran who soon joined them you can have siarless horse bran told the priest he is bringing the pigs the three retreated back down the narrow defile retracing their steps until they reached a wider way and then rode north into the heart of the forest unaccustomed to riding it was all aethelfrith could do to remain in the saddle let alone guide his mount he soon lost all sense of distance and direction and contented himself with merely keeping up as he pressed deeper and ever deeper into the dark heart of the ancient wood eventually they slowed their horses and after splashing across a brook and gaining a long low rise arrived at the great black trunk of a lightningblasted oak here bran stopped and dismounted aethelfrith grateful for the chance to quit the saddle climbed down and stood looking around the trees were giants of the forest their limbs huge and majestic their crowns lofty their great girth meant that their trunks were far apart from one another and little grew in the shadows beneath them younger trees struggled up straight and thin as arrows to reach the sun most failed unable to sustain their own weight they fell back to earthbut slowly slanting down at unnatural angles this way said bran motioning his guest to follow he stepped through the split in the trunk of the blighted oak as through an open door the friar followed emerging on the other side into a wide sunlit hollow large enough to contain a most curious settlement a veritable village of hovels and huts made from branches and bark andcould it bethe horns bones and skins of deer oxen and other beasts on the far side of the glade were small fields where a number of settlement dwellers were at work amongst the furrowed rows of beans peas and leeks passing strange murmured aethelfrith oddly delighted with the place this is cel craidd bran told him my stronghold you are welcome here tuck my friend the freedom of my home is yours the cleric made a polite bow i accept your hospitality come along then said bran leading the way into the peculiar settlement there is someone else i would have you meet before we sit down to hear your news bran his cloak of black feathers gleaming blue and silver in the bright daylight led the way to one of the hovels in the centre of the settlement as they approached an old woman emerged pushing aside the deer hide that served as her door she regarded the newcomer with a keen dark eye and then touched the back of her hand to her forehead this is angharad said bran she is our banfaith seeing that the priest did not understand the word he added it is like a bard angharad is chief bard of elfael to the old woman he said and this is brother aethelfrithhe helped us in lundein clapping a hand to the friars shoulder bran continued he has come with news he deems so important that he has travelled all the way from hereford then let us hear it said angharad stepping back she pulled aside the deerskin and indicated that her guests should enter the single large room had a bare earth floor packed hard and swept clean it was covered by an array of animal skins and handwoven coverings more skins encircled a round firepit in the centre of the room where a small fire flickered amongst the embers there was a sleeping pallet on one side and a row of woven grass baskets bran untied the leather laces at the neck of his feathered cloak and hung it on the tine of a protruding antler above one of the baskets above the cloak he hung the highcrested hood with its weird mask then removed the black leather gauntlets and put them in the basket he knelt over a basin on the floor to splash water on his face and drew his hands through his black hair shaking off the excess moisture he arched his back and then suddenly slumped and sighed and his body quivered as if with cold the tremor passed and bran straightened when he turned he had changed slightly he was more the bran whom aethelfrith remembered angharad invited her guests to sit and stepped out to a barrel beside the door she dipped out a bowl which she brought to the priest peace friend and welcome she said offering him the cup may god be good to thee all thy days and strengthen thee to every virtue the priest bowed his head may his peace and joy forever increase he replied and may you reap the rich harvest of his blessing it is water only bran explained we dont have enough grain to make ale just now water is the elixir of life declared the priest raising the bowl to his lips i never tire of drinking it he sucked down a healthy draught and passed the bowl to bran who also drank and passed it to iwan when the big man finished he returned the bowl to angharad who set it aside and took her place at the fire ring with the men i trust all is well in hereford said bran easing into the reason for the friars journey to elfael better than here replied aethelfrith but that could change leaning forward in anticipation of the effect his words would have he said what if i told you a flood of silver was coming your way if you told me that replied bran i would say we will all need very big buckets aye agreed the priest and tubs and vats and casks and tuns and barrels and cisterns large and small and i say you had best find them quickly because the flood is on the rise bran eyed the stout priest whose plump cheeks were bunched in a selfsatisfied grin tell us he said i would hear more of this silver flood chapter the rider appeared unannounced in the yard at caer rhodl the horse was exhausted hide wet with lather spume pink with blood hooves cracked lord cadwgan took one look at the suffering animal and its deadeyed rider and commanded his grooms to take the poor beast to the stables and tend it to the rider he said friend your news must be grievous indeed to drive a good horse this way speak it out and quicklythere will be ale and warm meat waiting for you lord cadwgan said the rider swaying on his feet the words i have are bitter ashes in my mouth then spit them out and be done man they will grow no sweeter for sucking on them drawing himself up the messenger nodded once and announced king rhys ap tewdwr is deadkilled in battle this time yesterday lord cadwgan felt the ground shift beneath his feet only months ago rhys king of deheubarthand the man most britons considered the last best hope of the cymry to turn back the tide of the ffreinc invadershad returned from exile in ireland where he had spent the last few years ingratiating himself with irish kings slowly eliciting support for the british cause against the ffreinc word had gone out that rhys had returned with a massive warhost and was preparing to make a bid for the english throne while william the red was preoccupied in normandie such was the strength of king rhys ap tewdwrs name that even men like cadwganwho had long ago bent the knee to the ffreinc kingallowed themselves to hope that the yoke of the hated overlords might yet be thrown off how can this be cadwgan wondered aloud by whose hand was it an accident before the messenger could answer the lord collected himself and said wait say nothing he raised his hand to prevent the reply we will not stand in the yard like market gossips come to my chambers and tell me how this tragedy has come about on his way through the hall king cadwgan ordered drink to be brought to his room at once then summoned his steward with queen anora and prince garran in attendance he sat the messenger down in a chair and commanded him to tell all he knew of the affair word came to our king that ffreinc marchogi had crossed our borders and set fire to some of our settlements the messenger began after taking a long pull on the ale cup thinking it was only a few raiders lord rhys sent a warband to put a stop to it when none of the warriors returned the alarm was raised and the warhost assembled we found the ffreinc encamped in a valley inside our lands where they were building one of those stone caers they glory in so greatly and this inside the marches you say asked cadwgan the messenger nodded inside the very borders of deheubarth itself what did lord rhys say to that our king sent word to the commander of the foreigners demanding their departure and payment for the burned settlements on pain of death good said cadwgan nodding his approval the ffreinc refused continued the messenger they cut off the noses of the messengers and sent the bloodied men back to tell the king that the ffreinc would leave only with the head of rhys ap tewdwr as their prize the messenger lifted his cup and drank again by this we knew that they had come to do battle with our lord and kill him if they could they left him no choice observed garran quick to refill the cup they wanted a fight they did agreed the rider sadly raising the cup to his lips once more though the ffreinc force was smaller than our ownfewer than fifty knights and maybe two hundred footmenwe were wary of some treachery god knows we were right to be so the moment we assembled the battle line more marchogi appeared from the south and westsix hundred at least two hundred mounted and twice that on foot they had taken ship and come in behind us the messenger paused they had marched through morgannwg and ceredigion and no one lifted a hand to stop them nor to warn us what of brycheiniog demanded cadwgan did they not send the battle host they did not my lord replied the man curtly neither blade nor shield of brycheiniog was seen on the field speechless with shock king cadwgan stared at the man before him prince garran muttered an oath beneath his breath and was silenced by his mother who said pray continue sir what of the battle we fought for our lives said the messenger and sold them dear at the end of the first day rhys raised the battle call and sent to the cantrefs close about but none answered we were alone he passed a hand before his eyes as if to wipe the memory from his sight even so he continued the fighting continued until the evening of the second day when lord rhys saw that we could not win he gathered the remnant of the warhost to him and we drew lotssix men to ride with word to our kinsmen and the rest to remain and seek glory with their comrades the messenger paused gazing emptily down i was one of the six he said in a low voice and here i am to tell youdeheubarth is no more king cadwgan let out a long breath this is bad he said solemnly there is no getting around it first brychan at elfael he thought and now rhys at deheubarth the ffreinc it seemed would not be content with england they meant to have all of wales too if deheubarth is fallen said prince garran looking to his father then brycheiniog cannot be far behind who has done this asked queen anora the ffreincwhose warriors were they baron neufmarche answered the messenger you know this demanded cadwgan quickly you know this for a truth the messenger gave a sharp jerk of his chin sideways not for a truth no the leaders amongst them wore a strange liveryone we have not seen before but some of the wounded we captured spoke that name before they died did you see the end asked anora clasping her hands beneath her chin in anticipation of the answer aye my lady myself and the other riderswe watched it from the top of the hill when the standard fell we scattered with the news where will you go now she enquired i ride to gwynedd to inform the northern kingdoms replied the messenger god willing and my horse survives that horse has run as far as it will go today and for many days i fear replied the king i will give you another and you will rest and refresh yourself here while it is readied you should stay here tonight anora told the messenger continue on your way tomorrow my thanks to you my lady but i cannot the northern kings were raising warriors to join us they must hear that they can no longer look to the south for help the king commanded his steward to bring food and make ready provisions the messenger could take with him i will see to the horse said garran my lord king i am much obliged having discharged his duty the messenger slumped grey faced into the chair we will leave you to your rest now said the queen leading her husband out once out of hearing of the chamber the king turned to his wife there it is he concluded gloomily the end has begun so long as the south remained free it was possible to think that one day the cymry might yet shake off the ffreinc there will be nothing to stop the greedy dogs now queen anora said you are client to neufmarche he will not move against us client i may be spat the king bitterly but i am cymry first last and always if i pay tribute and rents to the baron it is only to keep him far away from here now it seems he will not be satisfied with anything less than taking all of cymru and driving us into the sea he shook his head as the implications of the catastrophe rolled over him neufmarche will keep us only so long as it pleases him to do so just now he needs someone to hold the land and work it but when the time comes to repay a favour or provide some relative with an estate or reward some service renderedthen intoned cadwgan ominously then all we have will be taken from us and we will be driven out what can we do asked anora bunching her mantle in her fists who is left that can stand against them god knows replied cadwgan only god knows baron neufmarche received the news of his resounding victory with a restrained almost solemn demeanour after accepting a report on the casualties suffered by his forces he thanked his commanders for carrying out his orders so well and so completely awarding two of them lands in the newly conquered territory and another an advancement in rank to a lordship and the command of the unfinished castle that had so readily lured king rhys ap tewdwr to his doom we will speak more of this tonight at table go now rest yourselves you have done me good service and i am pleased when the knights had gone he went to his chapel to pray the simple room built within the stone walls of the castle was cool in the warmth of the day the baron liked the air of calm quiet of the place approaching the simple wooden altar with its gilt cross and candle he went down on one knee and bowed his head great god he began after a moment i thank you for delivering the victory into my hand may your glory increase i beg you almighty lord have mercy on those whose lives were given in this campaign forgive their sins account their valour to their merit and welcome them to your eternal rest heal the wounded lord christ and send them a swift recovery in all ways comfort those who have suffered the pains of battle he remained in the chapel and was still enjoying the serenity when father gervais appeared aging now though still vigorous the cleric had been a member of the barons court since coming to beauvais as a newly shorn priest to serve bernards father ah it is you my lord said the priest when the baron turned i thought i might find you here the greyrobed priest came to stand beside his lord and master you are not celebrating the victory with your men god grant you peace father said bernard celebrating no not yet later this evening perhaps the priest regarded him for a moment is anything the matter my son crossing himself neufmarche rose and taking the priest by the arm turned him and led him from the chapel saying walk with me father there is something i would ask you they climbed to the rampart and began making a slow circuit of the castle wall earl harold swore a sacred oath to duke william did he not said the baron after walking awhile the sun was lowering touching everything with gold the summer air was warm and heavy and alive with the click and buzz of insects amongst the reeds and bulrushes of the nearby marshland below the east wall an oath sworn on holy relics in the presence of the bishop of caen replied father gervais it was written and signed there is no doubt about it whatsoever glancing at the baron he said but you know this why do you ask the oath said bernard confirmed the promise made to william that he was to follow edward as rightful king of england dune certitude and the matter received the blessing of the pope said bernard who is gods vicar on earth again that is so agreed the priest he glanced at the baron who continued walking his eyes on the stone paving at his feet my lord are you fretting over the divine right again the barons head turned quickly fretting no father he turned away again perhaps a little he sighed it just seems too easy unable to find the words he sighed again all this and what do you expect god is on our side it is so ordained william has been chosen of god to be king and thus any enterprise that supports and increases his kingdom will rightly be blessed of god bernard nodded his eyes still downcast the priest was silent for a moment then declared ah i have it you worry that your support of duke robert will be held against you that you will be called to reckoning and the price will be too heavy to bear that is what is troubling you nest ce pas it has occurred to me the baron confessed i sided with robert against rufus the king has not forgotten and neither will god i think there is an accounting to be rendered payment is due i can feel it but you were upholding the law protested the priest you will remember that at the time robert was the rightful heir he had to be supported even against the claims of his own brother you were right to do so and yet replied the baron robert did not become king in his heavenly wisdom god saw fit to bestow the kingship on his brother william said father gervais how were you to know how was i to know repeated bernard wondering aloud precisement declared the priest you could not know for god had not yet revealed his choice and i believe that is why rufus did not punish those who went against him he understood that you were only acting in good faith according to holy law and so he forgave you he returned you to his grace and favour as was only just and fair the priest spread his hands as if presenting an object so obvious that it needed no further description our king forgave you vila god has forgiven you in the clear light of the elderly priests unfaltering certainty bernard felt his melancholy dissipating there is yet one more matter he said let me hear it said the priest unburden your soul and obtain absolution i promised to send food to elfael the baron confessed but i did not but you did countered the priest i saw the men readying the supplies i saw the wagons leave where did they go if not to the relief of the welsh before i mean i let the welsh priest think that count de braose had stolen the first delivery because it suited my purposes i see father gervais tapped his chin with an inkstained finger but you made good your original vow oh yesdoubled it in fact well then replied the priest you have overturned the wrong and provided your own penance you are absolved and you are certain that my attainment of lands in wallia is ordained by heaven deus vult the priest confirmed god wills it he raised his hand to the barons arm and gave it a fatherly squeeze you can believe that your endeavours prosper because god has so decreed you are his instrument rejoice and be grateful bernard de neufmarche smiled doubts routed and faith restored thank you father he said his countenance lightening as always your counsel has done me good service the priest returned his smile i am glad but if you wish to continue in favour with the almighty then build him a church in your new territories one church only said the baron his spirits rising once more i will build ten chapter you cannot save elfael one pig at a time brother aethelfrith was saying have you seen our pigs bran quipped they are mighty pigs iwan chuckled and siarles smirked laugh if you must said the friar growing peevish but you will wish soon enough you had listened to me the people are hungry siarles put in they welcome whatever we can give them then give them back their land cried aethelfrith god love you man do you not see it yet and is this not the very thing we are doing bran said calm yourself tuck we are already making plans to do exactly what you suggest the friar shook his tonsured head are you deaf as well as blind why do you think we watch the road asked iwan watch it all you like snipped the priest it will avail you nothing if you are not prepared for the flood im talking about the others frowned as one tell us then said bran what is it that we lack sufficient greed replied the cleric by the rood and jehoshaphats nose you think too small enlighten us head of wisdom remarked iwan dryly see here tuck licked his lips and leaned forward baron de braose is building three castles on the northern and western borders of elfael is he not he has a hundredmaybe two hundredmasons not to mention all those workers toiling away workmen must be paid sooner or later they will be paidevery last manhundreds of them aethelfrith smiled as he watched the light come up in his listeners eyes ah you see it now do you not hundreds of workers paid in silver said bran hardly daring to voice the thought a river of silver a flood of silver corrected aethelfrith is this not what i am saying even now the baron is preparing to send his wagons with strongboxes full of good english pennies to pay all those workers all the money you need will soon be flooding into the valley and it is ripe for the taking well done tuck cried bran and he jumped to his feet and began pacing around the fire ring did you hear banfaith he asked turning suddenly to angharad sitting hunched on her threelegged stool beside the door here is the very chance we need to drive the foreigners from our land aye could be she nodded in cautious agreement mind the ffreinc will not send their silver through the land unprotected there will be marchogi and in plenty bran thanked her for her word of warning then turned to his champion iwan he frowned sucking his teeth thoughtfully before answering we havewhatmaybe six men amongst us who have ever held more than a spade we cannot go against a body of battletrained knights on horseback yet the silver will not leap into our hands of its own accord i think offered siarles angharad frowning on her stool spoke again if thou wouldst obtain justice thou must thyself be just the others turned questioning glances toward bran who explained i think she means we cannot attack them without provocation the group fell silent in the face of such a challenge truly bran said at last raising his head he gazed across the fire ring dark eyes glinting with merry mischief we cannot take on knights on horseback but king raven can brother tuck remained unmoved it will take more than a big black bird to frighten battlehardened knights will it not well then bran concluded his smile was slow dark and fiendish we will give them something more to fear zx bbot hugo de rainault was used to better things he had served in the courts of angevin kings princes had pranced to his whim dukes and barons had run to his beck and bidding hugo had been to rome twiceand had met the pope both times gregory and urban had each granted him audience in their turn and both had sent him away with gifts of jewelencased relics and precious manuscripts he had been extolled for an archbishopric and in due time perhaps even a papal legacy he had governed his own abbey controlled immense estates held dominion over the lives of countless men and women and enjoyed a splendour even the kings of england and france could sincerely envy alas all that was before the rot set in he had done what he could to prevent the debacle once the tide of fortune began to turn against himbenefactions and indulgences costly gifts of horses falcons and hunting hounds to courtiers in high places favourable endorsements for those in a position to speak a good word on his behalf the reach of kings is long however and their memories for insults even longer when william the red cut up rough over the throne of england hugo had done what any rightthinking churchman would have donethe only thing he could have done what choice did he have robert curthose the conquerors eldest was the legitimate heir to his fathers throne everyone knew it most of the barons agreed and supported roberts claim who could have known the deceitful william would move so swiftly and with such devastating accuracy he cut the legs out from under his poor deluded brother with such uncanny ease one had to wonder whether the hand of god was not in it after all be that as it may the whole sorry affair was the beginning of a long decline for hugo who had seen his own fortunes steadily wane since the day william the red snatched away the crown now at long last the abbot was reduced to this exile in a dreary backwater province full of hostile natives to be bootlicker to a halfbaked nobody of a count hugo supposed he should be grateful even for this little but gratitude was not a quality he had cultivated instead he cursed the rapacious rufus he cursed the blighted wilderness of a country he had come to and he cursed the monstrous fate that had brought him so very low low he may be shattered perhaps even devastated but not destroyed and never ever finished he would like lazarus rise again from this dismal hinterland tomb he would use this opportunity weak and slender though it was to haul himself up out of the muck of his disgrace and reclaim his former stature the de braoses new church might be an unlikely place to start but stranger things had happened that baron william de braose was a favourite of red william was the single bright light in the whole cavalcade of misery he now endured the road to the successful restoration of the abbots wealth and power ran through the baron and if hugo had to wetnurse his lordships snottynosed nephew to ingratiate himself so be it time was against him he knew he was no longer a young man the years had not mellowed him however if anything they had made him leaner harder and subtler outwardly serene and benevolent with a charitable smilewhen it suited his interestshis scheming devious soul never slept though his hair had gone white he had lost none of it nor any teeth his body was still resilient and sturdy with a peasants enduring strength what is more he retained all the ruthless cunning and insatiable ambition of his younger years allied to that was the sagacity of age and the sly wisdom that had kept him alive through travails that would have consumed lesser men he paused in the saddle and gazed out over the vale of elfael his new and he fervently hoped temporary home it was not much to look at although it was not without he grudgingly admitted a certain bucolic charm the air was good and the ground fertile obviously there was water enough for any purpose there were worse places he considered to begin the reconquest attending the abbot were two of baron de braoses knights they rode with him for protection the rest of his entourage and belongings would come in a week or sothree wagons filled with the few books and treasures left to him and a smattering of more practical ecclesiastical accoutrements such as robes stoles his mitre crook staff standard and other oddments there would be five attendants two priests one to say mass and another to carry out the details of administration and three lay brotherscook chamberer and porter with these chosen for their loyalty and unfaltering obedience abbot hugo would begin afresh once officially installed in his new church hugo would commence building his new empire ike braose wanted a church hugo would give him an abbey entire first would come a stonebuilt minster worthy of the name and with it a hospitalboth inn for passing dignitaries and healing centre for those wealthy enough to pay for their care there would be a great tithe barn and stable and a kennel to raise hunting hounds to sell to the nobility then when these were firmly established a monastery schoolthe better to draw in the sons of the regions noblemen and worthies and reap fat grants of land and favours from appreciative parents with these thoughts he lifted the reins and urged his brown palfrey on once more following his escort to the counts fortress where he would spend the night continuing on to the church the next morning within sight of their destination now the riders picked up the pace at the foot of the hill they turned off the track and rode up to the fortress passing over the narrow bridge and through the newly erected gate tower where they were met by the snivelling nephew himself greetings abbot hugo called count falkes hurrying to meet him i hope you have had a pleasant journey pax vobiscum replied the cleric god be praised yes the journey was blissfully tranquil he extended his hand for the young count to kiss his ring count falkes unused to this courtesy was taken aback after a brief but awkward hesitation he remembered his manners and pressed his lips to the abbots ruby ring hugo having made his point now raised the hand over the young count in blessing benedictus oinni patri he intoned then smiled i imagine it must be easy to forget when one is unaccustomed to such decorum your grace replied the count dutifully i assure you i meant no disrespect it is already forgotten the abbot replied i suppose there is little place for such ceremony here in the marches he turned to take in the hall stables and yard with a sweep of his keen eyes you have done well in a short time most of what you see was here already the count conceded aside from a few necessary improvements i have not had time to construct anything better now that you say it intoned the abbot i thought it possessed a certain quaint charm not altogether fitting the tastes of your uncle the baron we have plans to enlarge this fortress in due course the count assured him the town and church are of more immediate concern however i have ordered those to be finished first a wise course to be sure make no mistake i am most eager to see it allespecially the church that is the solid cornerstone of any earthly dominion there can be no true prosperity or governance without it abbot hugo raised his hands and waved off any reply the count might make but no here i am preaching to my host when the welcome cup awaits forgive me please your grace come this way said falkes leading the way to his hall i have prepared a special meal in your honourand tonight we have wine from anjou selected especially for this occasion by the baron himself do you indeed good replied hugo with genuine appreciation it has been a long time since i held a cup of that quality it is a delicacy i will enjoy count falkes relieved to have pleased his demanding guest turned to greet the churchmans escort he charged orval the seneschal with the care of the knights and then led the abbot into the hall where they could speak in private before supper the hall had been renovated a fresh layer of clay and gypsum had been applied to the rough timber walls and after being painstakingly smoothed and dried the whole was whitewashed the small window in the upper east wall was now closed with a square of oiled sheepskin a new table sat a short distance from the hearth with a tall iron candletree at each end a fire cracked smartly on the big hearth more for light than heat and two chairs were drawn up on each side with a jar and two silver goblets on the table between them the count filled the cups and passed one to his guest and they settled themselves in their chairs to enjoy the wine and gain the measure of each other health to you lord abbot said falkes may you prosper in your new home hugo thanked him courteously and said truth told a churchman has but one home and it is not of this world we sojourn here or there awhile until it pleases god to move us along in any event replied the count i pray your sojourn amongst us is long and prosperous there is great need hereabouts for a strong hand at the church ploughif you know what i mean the former abbot incompetent eh raising his cup to his nose he sniffed the wine then sipped not altogether no said falkes bishop asaph is capable enough in his waybut welsh and you know how contrary they can be little better than pagans offered hugo with a sniff by all accounts oh it is true confirmed the count they are an illmannered racecoarse unlettered easily inflamed and contentious as the day is long and are they really as backward as they appear difficult to say answered falkes hardheaded and stiffnecked yes they resist all refinement and delight in ostentation of every kind like children then remarked the abbot i also have heard this you would not believe the fuss they make over a good tale which they will stretch and twist until any truth is bent out of all recognition to the plain facts of the matter for example said the count pouring more wine the locals will have it that a phantom has arisen in the forest round about a phantom truly insisted the count leaning forward in his eagerness to have something of interest with which to regale his eminent guest apparently this unnatural thing takes the form of a great birda giant raven or eagle or some suchand they have it that this queer creature feeds on cattle and livestock even human flesh come to that and the tale is frightening the more timorous do you believe this story i do not replied the count firmly but such is their insistence that it has begun disturbing my workmen wagoners swear they lost oxen to it and lately some pigs have gone missing simple theft would account for it surely observed the abbot or carelessness i agree insisted the count and would agree more heartily if not for the fact that the swineherds contend that they actually saw the creature swoop down and snatch the hogs from under their noses they saw this marvelled the abbot in full light of day confirmed the count even so i would not put much store by it save they are not the only ones to make such a claim some of my own knights have seen itor seen something at leastand these are sturdy trustworthy men indeed one of my menatarms was taken by the creature and narrowly escaped with his life mon dieu non oh yes it is true affirmed the count taking another sip from his cup the men i sent to track down the missing oxen found the animalsor the little left of them the thing had eaten the wretched beasts leaving nothing behind but a pile of entrails some hooves and a single skull what do you think it can be wondered the abbot savouring the extraordinary peculiarity of the tale these hills are known to be home to many odd happenings suggested falkes who is to say who indeed echoed abbot hugo he drank from his cup for a moment then mused pigs snatched away in midair whole oxen gorged men captured it passes belief to be sure conceded the count he drained his cup in a long swallow then admitted yetand i do not say this lightlythe affair has reached such a state that i almost hazard to think something supernatural does indeed haunt the forest chapter ll through the night bran sat hunched beside the hearth arms around his knees staring into the shimmering flames iwan aethelfrith and siarles had long ago crawled off to sleep but angharad sat with him still every now and then she would pose a question to sharpen his thinking otherwise the hudolions hut remained steeped in a seething silencethe hush of intense and turbulent thoughtas bran forged the perfect weapon in the glowing fires of his mind he was not tired and could not have slept anyway with his thoughts burning bright as dawn began to invade the darkness in the east the fires began to cool and the shape of his cunning craftwork was revealed that is everything i think he said raising his head to regard the old woman across the smouldering fire ring have i forgotten anything he was rewarded with one of her wrinkled smiles you have done well master bran raising her hand palm outward above her head she said this night you have become a shield to your people but now in the timebetweentimes you are also a sword bran took that as high approval he stood easing out the kinks in his cramped muscles well then he said let us wake the others and get started there is much to do and no time to lose angharad lifted her hand to the men slumped across the room patience let them sleep there will be little enough time for that in the days to come indicating his own empty sleeping place she said it would be no bad thing if you closed your eyes while you have the chance i could not sleep now for all of the barons riches he told her nor could i she said rising slowly since that is the way of it let us greet the dawn and ask the king of hosts to bless our battle plan and the hands that must work to make it succeed she stepped to the door and pushed aside the ox hide beckoning him to follow they stood for a moment in the early light and listened to the forest awaken around them as the dawn chorus of birds filled the treetops bran looked out at the pitiful clutch of humble dwellings but felt himself a king of a vast domain the day begins he said after a moment i want to get started in a little while she suggested let us enjoy the peace of the moment no now he countered bring me my hood and cloak then wake everyone and assemble them they should remember this day why this day above any other because explained bran from this day on they are no longer fugitives and outcasts today they become king ravens faithful flock the grellon suggested angharadan old word it meant both flock and following grellon repeated bran as the banfaith moved off to strike the iron and rouse ce craidd he turned his face to the warm red glow of the rising sun this day he declared speaking softly to himself the deliverance of elfael begins i is a very great honour said queen anora i would have thought you would be pleased how should i be pleased relations are strained just now it is true her mother granted but your father thought that perhaps my father the king has made his views quite clear merian insisted dont tell me he has changed his opinion just because an invitation has come this may be the barons way of making amends her mother countered it was a weak argument and merian regarded her mother with a frown of haughty disdain the baron knows he has done wrong and wishes to restore the peace oh so now the baron repents and the king dances dizzy with gratitude said merian merian reprimanded her mother sharply that will do girl you will respect your father and abide by his decision what demanded merian and is there nothing to be said you have said quite enough her mother stiff backed turned in her chair to face her you will obey but i do not understand insisted the young woman it makes no sense your father has his reasons replied the queen simply and we must respect them even if he is wrong countered merian that is most unfair mother queen anora observed her daughters distraught expressionbrows knit mouth pressed hard eyes narrowedand remembered her as an infant demanding to be let down to walk in the grass on the riverbank and being told that she could not because it was too dangerous so close to the water it is only an invitation to join the court for a summer her mother said trying to lighten the mood the time will pass quickly pass as it may merian declared loftily it will pass without me she rose and fled her mothers chamber stalking down the narrow corridor to her own room where she went to the window and shoved open the shutters with a crash the early evening air was soft and warm the fading light like honey on the yard outside her window but she was not in a mood to take in such things much less enjoy them her fathers decision seemed to her arbitrary and unfair she should she felt have a say in it since it was she who must comply the barons courier had arrived earlier in the day with a message asking if merian might come to hereford to spend the remainder of the summer with his lordships daughter sybil he was hoping merian would help teach the young lady something of british customs and speech sybil would of course gladly reciprocate baron neufmarche was certain the two ladies would become fast friends lord cadwgan had listened to the message thanked the courier and dismissed him in the same breath saying i am much obliged to the baron please tell my lord that merian would be delighted to accept his invitation so that apparently was that a decision that trod heavily on some of her most deeply held convictions and merian was to have nothing to say about it since the downfall of deheubarth her father had been writhing like a frog in cinders desperate to distance himself from the reach of neufmarche and now all of a sudden he seemed just as eager to court the barons good favour why it made no sense the very thought of spending the summer in a castle full of foreigners sent waves of disgust coursing through her slender frame her aversion natural and genuine was also an evasion for what merian refused to admit even to herself was that she had enjoyed the barons feast immensely truth be told she had glimpsed an attractive alternative to life in a crumbling caer on the marches border she did not allow herself to so much as imagine that she might acquire this life for herselfgod forbid but somewhere in her deepest heart lurked the hunger for the charm and grandeur she had experienced that glittering night and heaven help her it all danced around the person of baron neufmarche himself for his part he had made it abundantly clear that he found her beautiful and even desirable the mere notion awakened feelings merian considered so unholy that she tried to suffocate the fledgling thought by depriving it of all rational consideration on her return to caer rhodl after the feast in hereford she had considered herself safely out of harms way and beyond the reach of the temptation the barons court represented and now without so much as an if you please merian she was to be sent away to the barons castle like so much baggage she pushed away from the window and flopped back on her bed the thought that her father was simply using her to appease neufmarche and further himself with the baron was too depressing to contemplate all the same that was the only explanation that made sense of the situation if anyone else had suggested such a thing she would have been the first to shout him downall the while knowing it was her lot precisely in any event the matter was closed to all appeal lord cadwgan had made his decision and regardless of anything merian or anyone else might say would not reverse it for the next few days merian sulked and let everyone know exactly how she felt delivering herself of long soulful sighs and dark moody glances until even garran her oblivious brother complained about the damp chill in the air every time she passed by but the evil day would not be held off her father commanded her to pack her belongings for her stay and had begun to make arrangements to take her to hereford when merian received what she considered a reprieve it came in the form of a summons for all the barons nobles to attend him in council the gathering was to be held at talgarth in the barons newly conquered territory and all client kings and landed lords along with their families and principal retainers must attend it was not an invitation that could be refused under feudal law the unfortunate who failed to attend a formal council faced heavy fines and loss of lands title or in extreme cases even limbs baron neufmarche did not hold councils often the last had been five years ago when he had moved his chief residence to hereford castle then he had served notice that he meant to remain in england and expected his nobles to be ready and forthcoming with their supportchiefly in rents and services but also in advice lord cadwgan took a cloudy view of the summons to deheubarththe scene of the late king rhys ap tewdwrs recent downfall and demiseconsidering it an insult to the cymry and a nonetoosubtle reminder of ffreinc supremacy and ascendancy the rest of the family felt likewise perversely only merian welcomed the council looking upon it as a pardon from the onerous duty that had been forced upon her now instead of merian going alone into the enemy camp the whole family would have to go with her you need not look so pleased her mother told her a little less gloating would better become you i do not gloat merian replied smugly but milk for the kit is milk for the catis that not what you always say mother three days of preparation followed and the ordinarily sedate fortress shook life into itself in order to make ready the lords departure on the fourth day after receiving the summons the entourage set out all rode save the steward cook and groom who travelled in a horsedrawn wagon piled high with food supplies and equipment the servants had dusted off and repaired the old leather tents lord cadwgan used for campaigns and extended hunting tripsof which there had been few in the last seven or eight yearsin anticipation of making camp along the way and at the appointed meeting place how long will the council last asked merian as she and her father rode along it was early on the second day of travel the sun was high and bright and merian was in good spiritsall the more since her fathers mood also showed signs of improving how long repeated cadwgan why as long as neufmarche fancies he thought about it for a moment and said there is no way to tell it depends on the business to be decided once i remember old williamthe conqueror mind not the redbearded bratheld a council that lasted four months think of that merian four whole months merian considered that if the barons council lasted four months then summer would be over and she would not have to go to hereford she asked why so long i was not there her father explained we were not yet under the thumb of the foreigners and had our own affairs to keep us occupied as i recall it was said the king wanted everyone to agree on the levy of taxes for land and chattels agree with him you mean yes said her father but there was more to it than that the conqueror wanted as much as he could get to be sure but he also knew that most people refuse to pay an unjust tax he wanted all his earls barons and princes to agreeand to see one another agreeso that there could be no complaint later clever aye he was a fox that one her father continued and merian after their stormy relations of late was happy to hear him speak and to listen the real reason the council lasted so long came down to the forest law merian had heard of this and knew all rightthinking britons as well as saxons and danes resented it bitterly the reason was simple the decree transformed all forested lands in england into one vast royal hunting preserve owned by the king even to enter a forest without permission of the warrant holder became a punishable offence this edict hated as it was from the beginning made outlaws of all those who for generations had made their living out of the woodlands in one way or anotherwhich was nearly everyone so that was when it began mused merian that it was cadwgan confirmed and the council twisted and turned like cats on a roasting spit they refused three times to honour the kings wishes and each time he sent them back to think about the cost of their refusal what happened when it became clear that no one would be allowed to return home until the matter was settled and that the king was unbending the council had no choice but to assent to the conquerors wishes what a spineless bunch of lickspits observed merian do not judge them too harshly her father said it was either agree or risk being hung as traitors if they openly rebelled meanwhile they watched their estates and holdings slowly descending into ruin through neglect so with harvest hard upon them they granted the king the right to his precious hunting runs and went home to explain the new law to their people cadwgan paused thank god the conqueror did not include the lands beyond the marches when i think what the cyniry would have done had that been forced on us he shook his head well it does not bear thinking about part five the grellon chapter despite count falkess repeated offer to accompany him abbot hugo insisted on visiting his new church alone but the work is barely begun the count pointed out allow me to bring the architects drawings so you can see what it will look like when it is finished you are too kind hugo had told him however i know your duties weigh heavily enough and i would not add to them i am perfectly capable of looking around for myself and happy to do so i would not presume to burden you with my whims he rode out from the caer on his brown palfrey and arrived at llanelli just as the labourers were starting their work for the day the old church with its stone cross beside the door still stood on one side of the new town square it was a rude woodandwattle structure little more than a cow byre in hugos opinion the sooner demolished the better the abbot turned from the sight and cast his critical gaze across the square at a jumbled heap of timber atop a foundation of rammed earth what by the rod of moseswas that the new church he strode closer for a better look a carpenter appeared with a coiled plumb line and a chunk of chalk you there the abbot shouted come here the man glanced around saw the priestly robes and hurried over offering a bow of deference you wish to speak to me your grace what is this he flipped a hand at the partially built structure it is to be a church father replied the carpenter no the abbot told him no i do not think that likely yes replied the workman i do believe it is i am the abbot here hugo informed him and i say thathe flapped a dismissive hand at the roughly framed buildingthat is a tithe barn the carpenter cocked his head to one side and regarded the priest with a quizzical expression a tithe barn your grace my church will be made of stone abbot hugo told the carpenter and it will be of my design and raised on a site of my choosing i will not have my church fronting the town square like a butchers stall but father see here do you doubt me not at all but the count this is to be my church not the counts i am in authority here comlrris indeed your grace answered the confused carpenter what am i to tell the master tell him i will have the plans ready for him in three days declared the abbot starting away tell him to come to me for his new instructions with that the abbot marched to the old chapel paused outside and then pushed open the door he was greeted by two priests from the look of it they had slept in the sanctuary amidst their bundled belongings who is in authority here demanded the abbot greetings in christ brother abbot said the bishop stepping forward i am asaph bishop of llanelli we would have made a better welcome but as you can see this is all that is left of the monastery and the monks have all been pressed to labour for the count be that as it may sniffed hugo glancing around the darkened chapel it smelled old and musty and made him sneeze i see you are ready to depart i shall not keep you we were waiting to pass the reins to you as it were replied asaph that will not be necessary no we thought you might like to know something about your new flock your presumption has led you astray bishop it is the flock that must get to know and heed the shepherd hugo sneezed again and turned to leave god speed you on your way abbot see here said the bishop starting after him there is much we would tell you about elfael and its people you presume to teach me abbot hugo turned on him all i need to know i learned from the saddle of my horse on the way here he glanced balefully at the rude structure and the two lorn priests your tenure here is over bishop god in his wisdom has decreed a new day for this valley the old must make way for the new again i wish you gods speed i do not expect we will meet again the abbot returned to his horse across the square passing the carpenter who was now sitting on a stack of lumber with a saw across his lap what about this called the carpenter indicating the unfinished jumble of timber behind him what am i to do with this it is a tithe barn replied the abbot it will need a wider door you tuck have the most important duty bran had told him as he boosted the priest into the saddle the success of our plan rests on you aye he had replied you can count on me borne on waves of hope and optimism he had departed cel craidd with cheers and glad farewells still ringing in his ears oh but the fiery blush of enthusiasm for his part in brans grand scheme had faded to dull muddy pessimism by the time aethelfrith reached his little oratory on the hereford road how by the beards of the apostles am i to discover the movements of the de braose treasure train as if that were not difficult enough he must acquire the knowledge far enough in advance to give bran and his grellon enough time to prepare to that end he had been given the best of the horses so that he might return with the news at utmost speed impossible aethelfrith muttered to himself with or without a horse impossible never should have agreed to such a lackbrain scheme then again the idea had originated with himself after all tuck old son he murmured youve gone and put both feet in the brown pie this time as he approached the oratory he was relieved to see that no one was waiting for him people had visited in his absence small gifts of eggs lumps of cheese and beeswax candles had been placed neatly beside his door after tethering his mount in the long grass around back he filled a bucket from the well and left it for the animal he gathered up the offerings from his doorstep and went in to light the fire eat a bite of supper and contemplate his precarious future he fell asleep praying for divine inspiration to attend his dreams as the morning sun rose to dispel the mist along the wye so it brought a partial solution to tucks problem rising in his undershirt he went out to the well to wash drawing his arms through the sleeves he pushed the shirt down around his waist and splashed water over himself the cold stung his senses and made him splutter he dried himself on a scrap of linen cloth and stood for a moment savouring the sweet air and calm of the little glade surrounding his cell he watched the mist curling along the river and it came to him that whatever else they did the wagons would have to use the bridge at hereford it only remained to find out when he could simply wait until the wagons passed his oratory on their way to elfael then he could saddle the horse and race to bran with the warning and hope it gave him time enough bran had said they would need three days at least four would be better bran had told him give us but four days tuck and we have a fighting chance he hurried back inside to pull on his robe and lace up his shoes taking his staff he walked down to the bridge and into town it was market day in hereford but there seemed to be fewer people around than usualespecially for a clear fine day in summer he wondered about this as he watched the farmers and merchants setting out their goods and opening their stalls as he loitered amongst the vendors idly wandering here and there he heard a cloth merchant complaining to another about the lack of custom poor dealings today michael mlad he was saying might have stayed home and saved shoe leather twill be no better next market week replied the merchant named michael a dealer in knives pruning hooks and other bladed utensils aye agreed the other with a sigh too right you are too right wont get better till the baron returns good fellows said aethelfrith speaking up forgive mei heard you speaking just now and would ask a question brother aethelfrith mornin to you said the one named michael god be good to you and to you my son replied the friar can you tell me why there are so few people at market today where has everyone gone well replied the cloth dealer sure as sunday its the council ent it the council wondered aethelfrith i have been away on a little business and only just returned the king has called a great council nay brother replied the clothier not a kings councilonly a local one neufmarche has convoked an assembly of all his nobles and their families said michael the cutler off beyond the marches somewhere wed ha done better to follow the lot of them there indeed mused the priest i have heard nothing about this the two merchants with no customers and time on their hands were only too glad to oblige aethelfrith of the news he had missed the fierce battle and resounding defeat of the welsh king rhys ap tewdwr and the swift conquest of deheubarth by the barons troops the cutler finished saying neufmarche called council to square things away ysee the squat friar nodded thanked them and asked when did they leave do you know when did the council begin the clothier shrugged i couldnt say brother why if i be not mistaken said michael it ent rightly begun as yet no dont see how it could michael picked up a small kitchen knife and tried its blade with his thumb the baron and his people rode out but yesterdaymorning it was very early i reckon twill take them two days at least to reach the mootthem and the other lords the council would seem to begin a day or two after that so make that three daysfour to be safe five maybe six at most too right agreed the clothier and all that means we lose custom next weekand maybe the week after as well blessings upon you friends called aethelfrith already darting away he fled back across the bridge his soft shoes slapping the worn timbers and steamed up the hill to his oratory he wasted not a moment but threw a few provisions into a bag saddled the horse and rode out again he knew exactly when baron de braoses money train would roll chapter ls baron bernard de neufmarche gazed out upon the upturned faces of his subject lords gathered at talgarth in the south of wales the treasure train of his rival baron de braose was approaching the bridge below his castle back in hereford three wagons with an escort of seven knights and fifteen menatarms under the command of a marshal and a sergeant all the soldiers were mounted and their weapons gleamed hard in the bright summer sun hidden beneath food supplies and furnishings for abbot hugos new church were three sealed strongboxes ironbanded and bolted to the wagon beds with ranks of soldiers leading the way and more riders guarding the rear the train passed unhindered through hereford if any of neufinarches soldiers saw the train passing beneath the castle walls they made no move to prevent it thus in accordance with baron de braoses plan the wagon train rumbled across the bridge through the town and out into the bright sunlit meadows of the wide wye valley it would take the slow ox train four days to pass through neufmarche lands and the great forest of the march but once past hereford there would be no stopping the wagons and the knights could breathe a little easier knowing that nothing stood between them and the completion of their duty the leader of this party was a marshal named guy one of baron de braoses youngest commanders a man whose father stood on the battlefield with the conqueror and had been rewarded with the lands of a deposed earl in the north ridings a sizeable estate that included the old saxon market town of ghigesburghor gysburne as the normans preferred it young guy had grown up in the bleak moorlands of the north and there he might have stayed but thinking that life held more for him than overseeing the collection of rents on his fathers estate he had come south to take service in the court of an ambitious baron who could provide him with the opportunities a young knight needed to secure wealth and fame inflamed with dreams of grandeur he yearned for glory far beyond any that might be acquired grappling with dour english farmwives over rents paid in geese and sheep guys energy and skill at arms had won him a place amongst the teeming swarm of knights employed by william de braose his solid dependable levelheaded northern practicality raised him above the ranks of the brash and impulsive fortune seekers who thronged the southern courts two years in the barons service guy had waited for a chance to prove himself and it had finally come certainly marshalling the guard for some money chests was not the same as leading a flying wing of cavalry into pitched battle but it was a start this was the first significant task the baron had entrusted to him and though it fell far short of taxing his considerable skills as a warrior he was determined to acquit himself well mounted on a fine grey destrier he remained vigilant and pursued a steady unhurried pace to better safe guard the silver no advance warning had been given not even count de braose knew when the money would arrive days end found them camped beside the road on a bend in the river high wooded bluffs sheltered them to the east and the bow of the river formed an effective perimeter barrier on the other three sides any wouldbe thieves thinking to liberate the treasure would have to come at them on the road and guy positioned sentries in each direction changed through the night to prevent intruders from disturbing their peace they passed an uneventful night and the next morning moved on around midday they stopped to eat and to feed and rest the animals before beginning the long winding ascent up out of the vale of wye the first wagon gained the heights a little before sunset and guy ordered camp to be made in a grove of beech trees near an english farming settlement other than a herdsman leading a few muddy brown cows home to be milked no one else was seen on the road and the second night passed beneath a fair starseeded sky with serenity undisturbed the third day passed much the same as the previous day before climbing into their saddles on the fourth day guy assembled the men and addressed them saying today we enter the forest of the march we will be wary if thieves try to attack us they will do so here conipris everyone is to remain alert for any sign of an ambush he gazed at the ring of faces gathered around him as solemn earnest and determined as he was himself if there are no questions then what of the phantom ah replied guy yes he had anticipated such a question and was ready with an answer many of you will have heard some gossip of this phantom non he paused trying to appear severe and dauntless for his men it is but a tale to frighten infants nothing more we are men not children so we will give this rumour the contempt it deserves he offered a grimace of ridicule to show his scorn adding it would take a whole forest full of phantoms to daunt baron de braoses soldiers nest cepas he commanded the treasure train to move out the soldiers took their mounts and fell into line a rank of knights three abreast to lead the train followed by menatarms alongside and between each of the wagons with four knights serving as outriders patrolling the road ahead and behind on each side at the head of this impressive procession rode guy himself on his fine grey stallion directly behind him rode his sergeant to relay any commands to those behind by mornings end the money train had reached the forest edge the road was wide though rutted and the wagon drivers were forced to slow their pace to keep from jolting the wheels to pieces the soldiers clopped along passing through patches of sunlight and shadow alert to the smallest movement around them it was cool in the shade of the trees and the air was thick with birdsong and the sounds of insects all remained peaceful and serene and they met no one else on the road a little past midday however they came to a place where the road dipped low into a dell at the bottom of which trickled a sluggish rill despite the fine dry weather the shallow fording place was a churned mass of mud and muck apparently herders using the road had allowed their animals to use it for a watering hole and the beasts had transformed the road into a wallow stuck in the middle of the ford was a wagon full of manure sunk up to its axles a ragged farmer was snapping the reins of his twoox team and the creatures were bawling as they strained against the yoke but to no avail the farmers wife stood off to one side hands on hips shouting at the man who appeared to be taking no heed of her both the man and his wife were filthy to their knees the road narrowed at the ford and the surrounding ground was so soft and chewed up that guy could see there would be no going around wary senses prickling to danger guy halted the train he rode ahead alone to see what had happened pax vobiscum he said reining up behind the wagon what goes here the farmer ceased swatting his team and turned to address the knight good day sire the man said in rough latin removing his shapeless straw hat you see how it is he gestured vaguely at the wagon i am stuck i told him to put down planks the farmwife called in shrill defiance but he wouldnt listen shut up woman shouted the farmer to his wife turning back to the knight he said well soon have it out never fear eyeing the waiting train behind them he said maybe if some of your fellows could help no guy told him just you get on with it at once mlord he turned back to the task of coaxing threatening and bullying the struggling team once more guy rode back to the waiting train we will rest here and move on when they have cleared the ford water the horses the horses were watered and rested and the sun was beginning its long slow descent when the farmer finally ceased shouting and slapping his team guy thinking the wagon was finally free hurried back down into the dell only to find the farmer lying on the grassy slope above the ford his wagon as firmly stuck as ever you what in gods name are you doing demanded guy sire replied the farmer sitting up quickly the wagon remains stuck aye sire it is that agreed the farmer ruefully i have tried everything but it wont budge for gold nor goose fat glancing around quickly the knight said wheres the woman i sent her ahead to see if there might be anyone coming the other way that could maybe lend a hand sire replied the farmer seeing as how you and your men are busylike he left the rest of the thought unspoken get up shouted guy get back to your team you have delayed us long enough as you say sire replied the farmer he rose and shambled back to the wagon guy returned to the waiting train and ordered five menatarms to dismount and help pull the wagon free these first five were soon as muddy as the farmer and with just as little to show for it so with increasing impatience guy ordered five more menatarms and three knights on horseback to help too soon the muddy wallow was heaving with men and horses the knights attached ropes to the wagon and with three or four men at each wheel and horses pulling they succeeded in hauling the overloaded vehicle up out of the hole into which it had sunk with a creak and a groan the cart started up the greasy bank the soldiers cheered and then just as the wheels came free there came a loud crack as the rear axle snapped the hind wheels buckled and the cart subsided once more men and horses still attached to the ropes were dragged down with it the oxen could not keep their feet and fell sprawling over each other caught in their yoke they thrashed in the mud kicking and bellowing guy saw his hopes of a swift resolution to his problem sinking into the mire and loosed a spate of ffreinc abuse on the head of the luckless farmer loose those animals he ordered his men then drag that cart out of the way seven menatarms leapt to obey working quickly they unyoked the oxen and led them from the wallow once free the farmer led them aside and stood with them while the soldiers emptied his wagon pitching the manure over the sides and then slowly and with great effort dragging the broken vehicle up the slippery bank and off the road thank you sire called the farmer regarding the wreck of his wagon with the dubious air of a man who knows he should be grateful but realises he is ruined idiot muttered guy satisfied that his wagon train could now pass through guy rode back up the slope and signalled the drivers to come ahead when the first of the three teams had descended into the dellwhich now resembled a wellstirred bogguy taking no chances ordered branches to be cut and laid down and ropes to be attached so riders could help pull the fully laden vehicle through the morass like a boat dragged across a tideabandoned bay the first wagon slid recklessly across the laborious process was repeated for each of the two remaining wagons in turn guy waited impatiently while the soldiers paused to clean the mud and ordure off themselves as best they could his sergeant a veteran named jeremias approached and said the sun is soon down sire do you want to make camp now and journey on at daybreak tomorrow no guy growled glancing at the miserable swamp now reeking with manure weve wasted enough time here today i want to put this place behind us we push on raising himself in the stirrups he shouted be mounted a few moments later all had regained the saddle guy waited until they had fallen into line and reformed the ranks then called marcher sur and the money train resumed its journey once over the rim of the dell the forest closed around them once more the setting sun thickened the shadows beneath the overarching limbs giving the riders the sensation of entering a dim green tunnel darkness crept in closing silently around them guy was soon wishing he had not been so hasty in rebutting the sergeants suggestion and decided that they would make camp at the next glade or meadow but the underbrush crowded close on each side of the road the tree trunks so close that the wagon wheels bumped over exposed roots forcing the drivers to slow the pace even more all the while the last of the daylight steadily faded to a murky twilight and the evening hush descended on the forest it was only then in the quiet of the wood that marshal guy de gysburne began to wonder why it was that two bedraggled english farmers should speak such ready latin the thought had little time to take root in his awareness when the soldiers saw the first of the hanging corpses chapter arshal guy heard the low tightmouthed cursing of the soldiers behind him and knew that something was amiss without stopping he turned in the saddle and looked back along the trading ranks he saw his sergeant and motioned him forward jeremias he said as the sergeant reined in beside him the men are muttering they are sire confirmed the sergeant why is this methinks it is the mice sire the mice sergeant repeated guy casting a sideways glance at the man beside him he appeared to be earnest pray explain with a tilt of his head the sergeant indicated a branch at the side of the road a few paces away guy squinted at the overhanging branch which looked no different from a thousand others seen that dayentirely unremarkable except except hanging from the branch was a dead mouse the tiny corpse was suspended by a long hair from the tail of a horse its sunshrivelled body turning slowly in the light evening breeze the marshal leaned from the saddle for a closer look and poked it with his finger as he passed the little dead thing swung on its slender thread guy turned his face away and made a show of ignoring what he took to be a harmless if somewhat sinister prank the attitude was admirable but became increasingly hard to maintain try as he might to keep his eyes on the road before him he could not prevent himself from glimpsing more of the things and once he began to see them he saw them everywhere swinging on their horsehair nooses from bushes and twigs dangling from overhanging limbs and branches high and low on each side of the road dead mice hung like grotesque fruit in an orchard of death the wagon train continued on into the gloaming and the farther they went the more of the weird little corpses they sawand not mice only now here and there amongst the hanging dead were the bodies of larger creatures he saw a vole first and then another then moles shrews and rats like the mice the moles and rats were strung up with horsetail hair and left to twist gently in the breeze soon the soldiers were seeing dead rats everywheresome shrivelled and desiccated as if dried in their skins others that appeared freshly killed but all whether mummified or fresh were hung by their necks legs flat to their sides tails stiff and straight guy glancing right and left took them in with a shiver of disgust and refusing to be cowed by the unnatural spectacle rode on then came the birds small ones firstsparrows for the most part but also wrens and nuthatchesscattered in amongst the rodents the birds were dry husks of the creatures that had beenas if the avian essence had been sucked from them along with all their vital juicesall of them suspended by their necks wings folded tight against their bodies beaks pointing skyward a few hundred paces down this weird gallery of death the soldiers began seeing faces leering from the leafbordered shadows they were not human faces but effigies of twigs and bark and straw tied together with bits of leather and bone heads large and small their eyes of stone and shell gazing sightlessly from the wood at the passing riders the muttering of the men became a low rumble everywhere a knight or soldier looked another disembodied face met his increasingly unsteady gazeas if the wood were populated with greene men come to menace the intruders some of the larger ones had straw mouths lined with animal teeth bared as if in the frozen rictus of death these effigies mocked the riders they seemed to laugh at the living their mute voices shrill with the unspoken words as we are soon you shall be the soldiers proceeded along this eerie corridor in silence eyes wide shoulders hunched with apprehension the farther they went the more uncanny it became the feeling of dread deepened moment by moment as if each step brought them closer to a doom unknown and deeply to be feared guy resolute but anxious was no less affected than his men the weird sights around them seemed both purposeful and malevolent yet the meaning of the macabre displayif meaning there wasescaped him then all at once yeux de dieu swore guy jerking back the reins involuntarily the big grey halted in the road affixed to a tree beside the road was what appeared to be the figure of a man with huge hands and an enormous misshapen head drenched in blood his arms stretched as if to welcome passersby with a grisly embrace a second glance revealed that it was not a man at all but a statue of cloth and straw affixed to a scaffold of tree limbs and topped with the head of a boar the hideous thing had been drenched in blood and was covered with flies merde guy spat urging his mount forward once more pagans the heavy wagons rolled slowly past this grisly herald knights and men loosed curses even as they signed themselves with the cross the road descended gently into a shallow trough between the crests of two low hills the forest pressed dose ominously silent guy riding ahead reached the bottom of the dell and in the last light of day fading to the shadowy gloom of twilight saw something lying across the road closer inspection revealed that a tree had fallen its trunk spanning the road from side to side there was no going around it guy now fully alert to danger wheeled his mount halt he shouted his voice cracking loud in the deep forest hush jeremias he said indicating the tree behind him remove it form a troop get it cleared away at once sire replied the sergeant turning in the saddle he called to the knights and men behind him first four ranks dismount he shouted the rest remain on guard before the knights and menatarms could climb down from their saddles there came a crashing from the surrounding woodsomething huge and clumsy crashing through the tangled undergrowth toward the road the soldiers drew their weapons as the unknown entity lumbered closer the bushes beside the road began quaking and thrashing from side to side guys hand found his sword hilt and drew it the sword was halfway out of the scabbard when with the mewling inarticulate squeal of a host of lost and tortured souls the branches parted and out from the vinecovered thicket to his left burst a herd of wild pigs halfmad with fear the animals tumbled through the opening and into the road whatever was driving the pigs terrified them more than the men on horseback for the squealing squalling animals seeing their only path of escape blocked by the fallen tree swirled around once then lowered their heads and charged into the halted ranks of soldiers the hapless creaturesfour sows with perhaps twenty or more pigletsdarted in amongst the legs of the horses instantly throwing the ordered ranks into rearing kicking chaos some of the soldiers tried to ward off the pigs by stabbing at them with their swords which only increased the confusion hold cried guy trying to make himself heard above the frantic neighing of the horses hold the ranks let them pass catching a movement out of the corner of his eye he turned and saw something alight on the trunk of the fallen tree it seemed to simply materialise out of the darknessa shadow taking substance darkness contracting to itself and coalescing into the shape of a gigantic birdlike creature with the wings and highdomed head of a raven and the torso and legs of a man the face of the phantom was a smooth black skull with an absurdly long pointed beak guy gaped at the unearthly creature his shouted orders clotted on his tongue he swallowed and found his mouth had gone dry the phantom perched on the massive trunk of the fallen tree spread its great wings wide and in a voice that seemed torn from the very forest round about shrieked out a cry of raw animal rage that resounded through the forest echoing amongst the treetops soldiers threw their hands over their ears to keep out the sound at once the scent of smoke filled the air and before guy could draw breath to shout a warning to his men twin curtains of flame leapt up on each side of the road along the length of the wagon train which was now a confused mass of frightened men pigs and thrashing horses the phantom shrieked again lord guys grey destrier reared its eyes rolling in terror when guy turned to look the enormous raven had vanished fall back cried the knight marshal retreat his command was lost in the cacophony of pigs squealing men shouting and oxen bawling turn around go back as if in reply the forest answered with a low groan and the shuddering creak of tree trunks cracking the soldiers shoutedsome pointing left some rightas two huge oaks gave way on each side of the road crashing to earth in a juddering mass of limbs and leaves knights on horseback scattered as the heavy pillars toppled one atop the other directly behind the last wagon in the train the startled ox team surged forward smashing into the stationary ranks directly ahead overturning two horses and unseating their riders trapped now in a corridor of flame and oily pungent smoke the wagons could neither turn around nor move off the road the soldiers still contending with the remaining pigs strove to regain control of their mounts in the tumult and confusion no one saw two furtive figures in deerskin cloaks rise from the bracken with pots of flaming pitch suspended from leather cords standing just beyond the shimmering sheet of fire the skinclad figures swung the pots in tight looping arcs and let fly the clay pots smashed into flaming shards splattering hot burning pitch over the sideboards of the nearest wagon the frightened oxen bolted driving into the men and horses who could not get out of the way swiftly enough hold cried guy drivers hold your teams but there was no holding the terrified animals they surged forward heads down driving into anything in their path knights and menatarms scattered desperate to get out of the way of the wildly scything horns some of the soldiers braved the wall of flames turning their mounts they jumped the burning logs and struggled into the bramblebound undergrowth those in the rearward ranks seeing the flames and chaos ahead abandoned their uncontrollable mounts and scrambled through the branches and over the fallen tree trunks blocking their retreat in the chaos of the moment no one gave a thought to their trapped comrades thoughts ran only to survival and each man looked after himself once free the menatarms took to their feet running back down the road the way they had come the wagons were burning fiercely now driving the horses and oxen wild with terror there was no holding them everywhere men were abandoning their saddles to flee the panicstricken horses and flaming wagons marshal guy his voice raw from shouting tried to order his scattered retinue with sword held high he repeatedly called his men to rally to him but the preternatural attack had overwhelmed them to a man and guy could not make himself heard above the clamour of beasts and men lost in the frenzy of escape in the end he had no choice but to desert his own mount and follow his retreating men as they fled into the night working his way back along the riotous commotion of his flailing devastated soldiers guy reached the rear of the treasure train and climbed onto the bole of one of the toppled oaks there he took up the call to retreat fall back to me fall back those nearest swarmed over the fallen trunks tumbling into the road and pulling the stragglers after them when finally the last man had cleared the fiery corridor guy allowed himself to be pulled away from the wreckage by his sergeant come sire said jeremias tugging him by the arm let it go still guy hesitated he cast a last look over his shoulder at the inferno the road had become terrified horses still reared and plunged hurling themselves headlong into the flames the oxen lay deadmost had been killed by the knights in order to keep from being gored or trampled discarded weapons and armour were strewn the length of the corridor the rout was complete it is over said jeremias you must rally the men and regain command come away marshal guy de gysburne nodded once and turned away a moment later he was running into the flameshattered darkness of a strange and hostile night chapter the sound of frightened mailclad soldiers in headlong retreat dwindled away and soon all that could be heard was the hiss and crackle of the burning brush and wagons for a moment the forest seemed to watch and wait with breath abated and then the scouring of the kings road began seven men carrying spears leapt over the burning logs and into the fiery corridor clad in green cloaks the hooded men made quick work dispatching any wounded animals they then signalled the rest of their band and within the space of six heartbeats twenty more men and women crept out from hiding in the surrounding wood likewise dressed in long green cloaks with leaves and twigs and bits of rag sewn onto them they were the grellon king ravens faithful flock quickly removing their cloaks and hoods the grellon set about quenching the flames of the burning wagons and surrounding vegetationusing hides that had been soaked in the stream as soon as the fires were out torches were lit and sentries posted and the flock fell to their appointed tasks with silent and urgent efficiency while some of the band butchered the horses and oxen where they lay others led the living animals away into the forest once the animals had been cared for the workers unloaded the stillsmouldering wagons carefully examining the cargo much had been damaged by the flames of course but much remained unharmed everything was carried off to be hidden in the wood for later use once the vehicles had been unburdened of their baggage the ironbound strongboxes were prised from the planks before the wagons themselves were broken apart and hauled into the forest the useable partswheels harness yokes and iron fittingswould find their way back into service and the rest would be scattered hidden and left to rot while the wagons were being dismantled the discarded bits of armour and weapons saddles and tackas well as anything else of valuewere heaped together in a single pile that was then sorted into bundles and carried off meanwhile the leavings of the butchered animals were placed in a readydug pit near the road which was then filled in and covered with bracken and moss freshly dug elsewhere and transplanted when everything of value had been salvaged the tree trunks blocking the road were removedan arduous task made more difficult by the necessity of having to work in darknessand the pitchbearing logs were rolled back into the underbrush any scorched branches were carefully trimmed back to green growth their work finished the forest dwellers gathered up the meat of the slaughtered beasts and crept away melting back into the darkness from which they had sprung when the sun rose upon the forest the next day there was little to mark the odd onesided battle that had been fought in that placesaving only some singed tree limbs that could not be reached broken earth and a few damp dark patches where the blood of an ox or a horse stained the road loss of all goods and chattels under your care loss of horses and livestock loss of church property and sacred relicsnot to mention loss of the treasure you were sworn to protect abbot hugo de rainault intoned solemnly as he stared out the window of the former chapter house he had commandeered for his own use your failure is as ignominious as it is complete i lost no men marshal gysburne pointed out mon dieu growled hugo do you think baron de braose will care about that he levelled a virulent stare at the knight do you think at all guy de gysburne held his tongue and waited for the storm to pass of the two men before him the abbot was the more outraged and possessed far greater ability to make his anger felt next to the fiery hugos scathing excoriations the irate count falkes seemed placid and reasonable if perturbed at the very least gysburne you will be imprisoned said count falkes breaking in at worst you face execution for malfeasance and gross neglect of duty said the abbot concluding the thought in his own way we were ambushed i did my duty did you did you demanded hugo no doubt that will be of great comfort when your head is on the block execute a knight in service scoffed guy the bravado was thin and unconvincing do not imagine such a fate unlikely the baron may think it worthwhile to make an example of you guy standing at attention with his hands clasped behind him as he bore the brunt of their anger now turned in appeal to the count lord falkes he said you saw the place of ambush you saw how i saw very little indeed falkes replied with cool disdain a few bloodstains and some withered foliage what is that it is my point exactly insisted guy his voice rising with frustration someone removed the wagons and oxenremoved everything yes yes no doubt it was this creaturethis phantom i did not say that muttered guy phantom asked abbot hugo raising one eyebrow with interest falkes gave the priest a superior smile and explained about the birdlike creature haunting the forest of the march the folk of elfael call it the hud he said waving his hand dismissively he added i am sick of hearing about it hood questioned the abbot is that what you said hud corrected falkes it means sorcerer enchanter or some such it is a tale to frighten children something attacked us in the forest the marshal said it commanded wild pigs killed oxen and burned our wagons yes yes replied falkes impatiently and then carried everything away leaving nothing behind what do you want of me demanded guy tiring of the interrogation i want the barons money back roared falkes guy lowered his head and falkes let out a sigh of exasperation mon dieu this is hopeless looking to the abbot he said do what you will with him i am finished here with a last condemning glance at the miserable guy de gysburne he paid the abbot a chilly farewell and strode from the room in a moment they heard the clump of hooves in the yard as the count rode away a man in your precarious position gysburne said the abbot quietly might rather ask what i can do for you clasping his hands before him he regarded the dishevelled knight with a pitying expression i do not know what happened out there hugo continued in a more sympathetic tone but i see that it has shaken you and your men gysburne clenched his jaw and looked away there will be hell to pay of course resumed the abbot yet i can ensure that the brunt of this catastrophe does not fall solely on your shoulders why should you help me asked the knight without looking up is not clemency an attribute of the holy church abbot hugo smiled guys gaze remained firmly fixed on the floor at his feet if further explanation is needed let us just say that i have particular reasons of my own the abbot crossed to the table on which cups and a jar were waiting he placed his hands flat on the table you will of course return to face the wrath of baron de braose he said however i propose to send you with a letter informing the baron of certain mitigating facts which should be taken into consideration facts which will ultimately exculpate you furthermore i am prepared to argue not for imprisonment or dismissal but for your reassignment in short i might be persuaded to ask the baron to assign you to me here i would then be willing to take full responsibility for you and your actions at this the knight raised his eyes the abbot pacing slowly around the small room of the former chapter house continued after the debacle in the forest last night de braose will not refuse me far from it he will think it a most salubrious suggestionall the more when i offer to make up the pay for the workers out of my own treasury you would do this wondered guy this and more the cleric assured him i will request troops to be placed under my command you my friend shall lead them abbot hugo paused again to regard the unlucky knight he might have chosen someone older and more experienced for what he had in mind but gysburne had dropped into his lap so to speak and another opportunity might be a long time coming all things considered sir guy was not such a bad choice i trust this meets with your approval what about the count count falkes will have nothing to say about it one way or the other the abbot assured him well your grace i hardly know what to say swear fealty to me as gods agent by authority of the holy church and it is done i swear it on my life i do so swear splendid hugo returned to the table and poured a cup of wine for his guest please he said offering the goblet to the knight guy accepted the cup almost expecting it to burn his hand even if it had been offered by the devil himself he would still be bound to receive it the calamity in the forest had left him with no better choice the abbot smiled again distressing as the loss of his property was the strange turn of events had nevertheless provided him a welcome means of increasing his authority with his own private army he would be the most powerful prelate in all wallia as you will appreciate i lost a very great deal last night the church lost treasure of significant value that cannot be allowed to happen again he poured wine into the second cup that will not happen again no your grace agreed guy he raised his cup and wet his lips although greatly relieved not to have to return to baron de braose emptyhanded the knight had yet to obtain the measure of the abbot less a saint he thought than a merchant prince in priestly robes jobs bones he had met more holyminded pickpockets guy took another sip of wine and his thoughts returned to the events of that morning as soon as he had regrouped his menwho were still exhausted and shaken by the unnatural events in the haunted woodhe had started out by dawns first light to bring the count and abbot the bad news it was most uncanny beginning to end he had reported on my life it seems the very stuff of nightmares he then went on to explain to an increasingly outraged and disbelieving audience all that had transpired in the forest fool the abbot had roared when he finished am i to believe that you think there is more to this affair than the rapacious larceny of the reprobate and faithless rabble that inhabit this godforsaken country at those words the unearthly spell surrounding the entire incident had relinquished some of its power over him guy de gysburne stood blinking in the sunlight of the abbots reception room it was the first time he had stopped to consider that the attack had been perpetrated by mere mortals only cunning mortals perhaps but fleshandblood humans nonetheless no my lord he had answered feeling instantly very embarrassed and overwhelmingly absurd obviously it had all been an elaborate trapfrom the dead creatures strung up along the roadside to the flames and falling trees that had cut off any chance of escape but no now that he thought about it the ambush had begun well before thatprobably with the broken wagon axle earlier in the day the hapless farmer and his shrewish wife loud and overbearing impossible to ignore as they stood arguing over the spilled load standing in mud where no mud should have been yes he was certain of it the deception had begun far in advance of the actual attack moreover the individual elements of the weird assault had taken a considerable amount of time to prepareperhaps many dayswhich meant that someone had known when the treasure train would pass through the forest of the march someone had known was there a spy in the barons ranks was it one of the soldiers or someone else who had passed along the information as guy sat clutching his cup his heart burned for revenge the offer of a new position with the abbot notwithstanding he vowed to find whoever had ruined his position with the baron and make them pay dearly mark me lord marshal these pagan filth will learn respect for the holy offices they will learn reverence for the mother church their heinous and highhanded deeds will not go unpunished though the abbot spoke softly there was no mistaking the steelhard edge to his words you marshal gysburne will be the instrument of gods judgement you will be the weapon in my hand sir guy could not agree more the abbot poured another cup and lifted it in salute let us drink to the prompt recovery of the stolen treasure and to your own swift advancement the marshal raised his cup to the abbots and both men drank they then put their heads together to compose the letter to be delivered to the baron before the wax was dry on the parchment guy was already scheming how to find the stolen treasure expose the traitor in their midst and exact revenge on those who had disgraced him and robbed the abbot chapter qnder the keen watch of sentries hidden in the brush along the road the grellon walked hidden pathways moving with the stealth of forest creatures men women and children ferried the plunder back to their greenwood glen on litters made of woven leather straps stretched between pine poles it took most of the day to retrieve the spoils of their wild nights work and store it safely away thus the sun was low in the sky when bran iwan tuck siarles and angharad finally gathered to open the ironbanded caskets iwan and siarles set to work hacking at the charred wood and metal bands of the first two strongboxes the others looked on speculating on what they would find under the onslaught of an axe and pick iwans box gave way first three quick blows splintered the sides and three more released a gleaming cascade of silver onto the hearthside floor tuck scooped up the coins with a bowl and poured them into his robe as siarles meanwhile chopped at the top of the chest before him and presently succeeded in breaking open the ruined lock he threw open the lid the interior was filled with cloth bags each one tied by a cord that was sealed in wax with the barons crest at a nod from bran he lifted one out and untied the string breaking the seal and poured the contents into brother tucks bowl fortyeight english pennies newly minted bright as tiny moons there must be over two hundred pounds here siarles estimated more even iwan turned his attention to the third box smaller than the other two it had suffered less damage and proved more difficult to break open with battering blows iwan smashed at the lock and wooden sides of the chest the ironbanded box resisted his efforts until siarles fetched a hammer and chisel and began working at the rivets loosening a few of the bands to allow iwans pick to gain purchase eventually the two succeeded in worrying the lid from its hinges tossing it aside they upended the box and out rolled plump leather bagssmaller than the barons black bags but heavier when hefted they gave a dull chink open them bran commanded he sat on his haunches watching the proceedings with dazzled amazement plucking a bag from the chest iwan untied the string and shook the contents into brans open hand the gleam of gold flashed in the firelight as a score of thick coins plopped into his palm upon my vow gasped aethelfrith in awe theyre filled with flaming byzants raising one of the coins bran turned it between his fingers watching the lustrous shimmer dance in the light he felt the exquisite weight and warmth of the fine metal he had never seen genuine byzantine gold solidi before what are they worth well now the priest answered snatching up a coin from the floor let me see there are twelve pennies in a shilling and twenty shillings in a poundso a pound is worth two hundred and forty pennies tapping his finger on his palm as if counting invisible coins the mendicant priest continued amazing his onlookers with his thorough understanding of worldly wealth now then a mark as we all know is worth thirteen shillings and four pence or one hundred sixty pennieswhich means that there are one and a half marks in one pound sterling so how much for a byzant asked siarles give me time said tuck im getting to that this will take all night complained siarles it will if you keep interrupting boyo replied the priest testily these are delicate calculations he gave siarles a sour look and resumed where was i rightso thats he paused to reckon the total thats over five pounds he frowned no make that sixmore a bag asked bran each replied the priest handing the byzant back to him you mean to say this said bran holding the gold coin to the light is worth ten marks they are as valuable as they are scarce sire said iwan dazzled by the extent of their haul this is far better than we hoped reaching into another of the leather bags he drew out more of the fat gold coins this is a a miracle the good lord helps them who help themselves friar tuck said pouring coins from the fold of his gathered robe into the bowl on the floor before him blessed be the name of the lord how much is there altogether wondered bran gazing at the treasure hoard several hundred marks at least suggested siarles it is more than enough to pay the workers observed angharad from her stool much more she rose and gathered a deerskin from her sleeping place spreading it on the floor beside the kneeling priest she instructed count it onto this and count it out loud so we can all hear added siarles help me said the priest put them into piles of twelve the two fell to arranging the silver coins into little heaps to represent a shilling and then brother tuck began telling out the number shilling by shilling siarles using a bit of charred wood kept a running tally on a hearthstone announcing the reckoning every fourth or fifth stack and calling out the total at each mark one hundred one hundred seventyfive two hundred the women of cel craidd brought fooda haunch of roast meat from one of the slaughtered oxen and some fresh barley cakes made from the supplies intended for abbot hugo bran and the others ate while the counting continued after a while they heard voices outside the hut your flock grows curious angharad said they have been patient long enough you should speak to them bran rising bran stepped to the door and pushed aside the oxhide covering stepping out into the soft night air he saw the entire population of the settlementfortythree souls in all ranged on the ground around the door of the hut wrapped in their cloaks they were talking quietly amongst themselves a fire had been lit and some of the children were running barefoot around it we are still counting the money he told them simply i will bring word when we have finished it is taking a fair sweet time suggested one of the men there is a lot to count god be praised said another how much more than we hoped replied bran your patience will be rewarded never fear he returned to angharads hearth and the counting three hundred fifty droned siarles making another mark on the stone four hundred four hundred marks gasped iwan why were they carrying so much money something is happening that we have neither heard nor foreseen angharad replied and this is the proof tuck still counting gave a cough to silence them and the total continued to grow when the last silver penny had been accounted the total stood at four hundred and fifty marks then turning his attention to the leather bags in the last casket the friar began to count out the gold coins to the value of ten marks each the others looked on breathlessly as the friar arranged the golden byzants in neat little towers of ten when he finished tuck raised his head and in a voice filled with quiet wonder announced seven hundred and fifty marks that makes five hundred pounds sterling do i believe what i am hearing breathed iwan overwhelmed by the enormity of the plunder five hundred pounds he turned his eyes to bran and then to angharad what have we done we have ransomed elfael from the stinking ffreinc declared bran using their own money too rough justice that turning on his heel he moved to the door and stepped out to deliver the news to those waiting outside angharad went with him and raising her hands said silence rhi bran would speak when the murmuring died down bran said through our efforts we have won five hundred poundsmore than enough to pay the redemption price red william has set we have redeemed our land the sudden outcry of acclamation took bran by surprise hearing the cheers and seeing the glad faces in the moonlight took him back to another place and time for a moment bran was a child in the yard at caer cadarn listening to the revelry of the warriors returning from a hunt his mother was still alive and as queen of the hunt she led the women of the valley singing and dancing in celebration of the hunters success her long dark hair streaming loose as she spun and turned in the rising glow of a full moon nothing could ever bring her back or replace the warmth he had known in the presence of that loving soul but this he could do he could reclaim the caer and under his rule return the court of elfael to something approaching its former glory angharad had once asked him what it was he desired he had suspected even then that there was more to the question than he knew now suddenly he beheld the shape of his deepest desire more than anything in the world he wanted the joy he had known as a child to reign in elfael once more angharad standing at his side felt the surge of emotion through him as a torrent through a dry streambed and knew he had made up his mind at last yes she whispered this night whatever you desire will bend to your will choose well my king raising his eyes he saw the radiant disc of the moon as it cleared the sheltering trees filling the forest hollow with a soft spectral light my people my grellon bran said his voice breaking with emotion tonight we celebrate our victory over the ffreinc tomorrow we reclaim our homeland xerian had determined to endure the barons council with grace and forbearance spared the greater evil of having to spend the summer in the barons castle in hereford she could afford to be charitable toward her enemies therefore she vowed to utter no complaint and to maintain a respectful courtesy to one and all in what she had imagined would be a condition little better than captivity as the days went by however her energetic dislike for the ffreinc began to flag it was simply too difficult to maintain against the onslaught of courtesy and charm with which she was treated thus to her own great amazementand no little annoyanceshe found herself actually enjoying the proceedings despite the fact that the one hope she had entertained for the councilthat she might renew her acquaintance with cecile and theresewas denied her they were not in attendance their brother roubert cheerfully informed her that his sisters had been sent back to normandie for the summer and would not return until autumn or perhaps not even until next spring it is good for them to acquire some of the finer graces he confided adopting a superior tone what these graces might be he did not say and merian did not ask lest she prove herself a backward hillcountry churl in need of those same finer graces she welcomed rouberts company but felt awkward in his presence although he always appeared eager to see her she sensed a natural haughtiness in him and a veiled disdain for all things foreignwhich was nearly everything in fair britains island realm including herself aside from roubert the only other person near her own age was the barons dour daughter sybil merian and the young lady had been introduced on the first day by neufmarche himself with the implied directive that they should become friends for her part merian was willing enoughthere was little to do anyway with the council in session most of the daybut so far had received scant encouragement from the young noblewoman lady sybil appeared worn down by the heat of the summer sun and the innate discomforts of camp her fine dark hair hung in limp hanks and dark shadows gathered beneath her large brown eyes she appeared so listless and unhappy that merian at first annoyed by the young womans affected swanning eventually came to pity her the young ffreinc noblewoman languished in the shade of a canopy erected outside the barons massive tent cooling herself with a fan made of kidskin stretched over a willow frame mere de dieu sighed the young woman wistfully when merian came to visit her one day i am not umshe paused searching for a word she could not findaccoutume so much this heated air merian smiled at her broken english yes she agreed sympathetically it is very hot it is always so non oh no merian quickly assured her it is not usually the weather is fine but this summer is different a cloud of bafflement passed over lady sybils face hotter merian finished lamely the two gazed at each other across the ditch of language gaping between them there you are they turned to see baron neufmarche striding toward them flanked by two severelooking knights dressed in the long drab tunics and trousers of saxon nobility my lords declared the baron in english have you ever seen two more beautiful ladies in all of england never sire replied the two noblemen in unison it is pleasant to see you again lady merian said the baron smiling into her eyes he grasped her hand and lifted it to his lips turning quickly he kissed his daughter on the forehead and rested his hand on her shoulder i see you are finding pleasure in one anothers company at last we are trying merian said she offered sybil a hopeful smile clearly the young woman had no idea what her father was saying i hope that when the council is over you still plan to attend us in hereford the baron said well i merian faltered unable to untangle her mixed emotions so quickly after all when originally mooted the proposition had been greeted with such hostility on her part that now she hardly knew what she felt about the idea neufmarche smiled and waved aside any excuse she might make we would make you most welcome to be sure he stroked his daughters hair in fact now that you know each other better perhaps you might accompany sybil to our estates in normandie when she returns this autumn it could be easily arranged uncertain what to say merian bit her lip come my lady coaxed the baron he saw her hesitancy and offered her a subtle reminder of her place we have already made arrangements and your father has consented i would be honoured sire she said seeing my father has consented good he smiled again and offered merian a little bow of courtesy you have made my daughter very happy a third soldier came rushing up just then and the baron excused himself and turned to greet the newcomer ah de lacy you have word oui anon baron de seigneur blurted the man redfaced from rushing in the heat the baron raised his hand and commanded him to speak english for the benefit of the two knights with him the messenger gulped air and dragged a sleeve across his sweating face beginning again he said it is true my lord baron de braose did dispatch wagons and men through your lands they passed through hereford on the day the council convened and returned but yesterday the man faltered licking his lips yes speak it out man calling toward the tent the baron shouted remey bring water at once in a moment the seneschal appeared with a jar and cup he poured and offered the cup to the baron who passed it to the soldier drink bernard ordered and let us hear this from the beginningand slowly if you please the messenger downed the water in three greedy draughts taking back the cup the baron held it out to be refilled then drank a little himself see here he said passing the vessel to the nobles with him de braoses men passed through my lands without permissiondid you mark the nobles nodded grimly this is not the first time they have trespassed with impunity how many this time seven knights and fifteen menatarms not counting ox herds and attendants for three wagons as i say they returned but yesterday onlymost were afoot and there were no wagons indeed there is rumour of an attack in the forest given that some of the men were seen to be wounded it seems likely do they say who perpetrated the attack sire there is talk rumours only the soldier glanced at the two noblemen standing nearby and hesitated well demanded the baron if you know say it they say the train was attacked by the phantom of the forest mon dieu exclaimed remey unable to stifle his surprise the baron glanced hastily over his shoulder to see the two young women following the conversation pray excuse us ladies this was not for your ears to the men he said come we will discuss the matter in private he led his party into the tent leaving merian and lady sybil to themselves once more le fantonie whispered sybil eyes wide at what she heard i have heard of this it is a creature gigantesque oui yes a very great enormous creature said merian drawing sybil closer to share this delicious secret the people call him king raven and he haunts the forest of the march incroyable gasped sybil the priests say this is very impossibility nest ce pas oh no it is true merian gave her a nod of solemn assurance the cymry believe king raven has arisen to defend the land beyond the marches he protects cymru and nothing can defeat himnot soldiers not armies not even king william the red himself chapter dressed as humble wool merchants bran iwan aethelfrith and siarles swiftly crossed the marches and entered england strange merchants these avoiding towns entirely travelling only by night they progressed through the countrysidefour men mounted on sturdy welsh horses each leading a packhorse laden with provisions and their wares which consisted of three overstuffed wool sacks laying up in sheltered groves and glades and hidden glens along the way they slept through the day with one of their number on watch at all times they arrived in lundein well before the city gates were open and waited impatiently until sleepyeyed guards yawning and muttering drew the crossbeams and gave them leave to enter they went first to the abbey of saint mary the virgin where after a coldwater bath the travellers changed into clean clothes and broke fast with the monks then groomed and refreshed they led their packhorses through the narrow streets of the city to the tower fortress at the outer wall of the tower they inquired of the porter and begged audience with cardinal ranulf of bayeux chief justiciar of england he is not here the porter informed them he is away on kings business if you please friend said aethelfrith could you tell us where we might find him it is of utmost importance winchester replied the porter seek him there bran and iwan exchanged a puzzled glance where caer wintanthe kings hunting lodge the friar explained for the benefit of the welsh speakers it is not farmaybe two days ride the four resumed their journey pausing long enough to provision themselves from the farmers stalls along the river before crossing the kings bridge once out of the city they turned onto the west road and headed for the royal residence at winchester riding until long after dark rising early and resting little along the way the travellers reached the ancient roman garrison town two days later upon asking at the city gate they were directed to king williams hunting lodge a sprawling halftimbered edifice built by a longforgotten local worthy and carelessly enlarged over generations to serve the needs of various royal inhabitants the great house was the one place in all england the red king called home unlike the white tower of lundein the royal lodge boasted no keep or protective stone walls two wings of the lodge enclosed a bare yard in front of the central hall a low wooden palisade formed the fourth side of the open square in the centre of which was a gate and a small wooden hut for the porter as before the travellers presented themselves to the porter and were promptly relieved of their weapons before being allowed into the beatenearth yard where knights bare to the waist practised with wooden swords and padded lances they tied their horses to the ringed post at the far end of the yard and proceeded to the hall they were made to wait in an antechamber where they watched norman courtiers and clerks enter and leave the hall some clutching bundles of parchment others bearing small wooden chests or bags of coins bran unable to sit still for long rose often and returned to the yard to see that all was well with iwan and siarles who waited with the horses keeping an eye on their precious cargo brother aethelfrith meanwhile occupied himself with prayers and psalms that he mumbled in a low continuous murmur as he passed the knots of his rope cincture through his pudgy hands the morning stretched and dwindled away midday came and went and the sun began its long slow descent bran had gone to see if iwan had watered the horses when aethelfrith called him back inside bran hurry the cardinal has summoned us bran rejoined tuck who was waiting for him at the door mind your manners now the friar warned taking him by the arm we need not make this more difficult than it is already agreed bran nodded and the two were conducted into ranulf of bayeuxs chamber a whole year and more had passed and yet the same two brownrobed clerics sat at much the same table piled high with rolled and folded parchments still scratching away with their quill pens between them in a highbacked chair sat the cardinal wearing a red satin skullcap and heavy gold chain his red hair was cut short it had been curled with hot irons and dressed with oil so that it glimmered in the light from the high window three rings adorned the fingers of his pale hands which were folded on the table before him eyes closed cardinal ranulf rested his head against the back of his chair apparently asleep my lord cardinal announced the porter i bring before you the welsh lord and his priest and his english priest added aethelfrith with a smile dont you be forgetting cardinal said bran not waiting to be addressed we have come about the de braose grant the chief justiciar slowly opened his eyes have i seen you before he asked passing a lazy glance over the two men standing before him at the table yes sire replied the friar respectfully last year it was allow me to present lord bran of elfael we discussed the kings grant of elfael to baron william de braose recognition seemed to come drifting back to the cardinal then presently he nodded regarding the slim young man before him just so the welsh lord appeared different somehowleaner harder with an air of conviction about him do you speak french inquired the cardinal no my lord answered aethelfrith he does not pity sniffed bayeux changing to latin he asked what is your business i have come to reclaim my lands replied bran you will recall that you said the grant made to baron de braose could be rescinded for a fee yes yes replied the cardinal as if the memory somehow pained him i remember i have brought the money my lord cardinal answered bran he raised a hand to tuck who hurried to the door and gave a whistle to the two waiting outside a moment later iwan appeared lugging a large leather provision bag approaching the cardinal the champion hoisted the bundle onto the table opened it and allowed some of the smaller bags of silver to spill out six hundred marks said bran as agreed he put his hand to the sack here is two hundred the rest is ready to hand ranulf reached for one of the bags and weighed it in his palm as he raised his eyes to study bran once more that is as it may be he allowed slowly i regret to inform you however six hundred marks was last years price my lord if you had redeemed the grant when offered continued the cardinal you could have had it for six hundred marks you waited too long the price has gone up gone up bran felt the heat of anger rising to his face events move on apace time and tide as they say intoned the cardinal with lofty sufferance it is the same with the affairs of court pray spare me the lesson my lord muttered bran through clenched teeth how much is required now two thousand marks you stinking bandit bran spat we agreed on six hundred and i have brought it the cardinals eyes narrowed dangerously careful my hotheaded prince if it were not for the kings need to raise money for his troops in normandie your petition would not be considered at all he reached a hand toward one of the money sacks as it is we will accept this six hundred in partial payment of the two thousand you want money cried bran he saw the cardinal officious and smug in his sumptuous robes as he reached for the coins his vision dimmed as the blood rage came upon him here is your money reaching across the table he seized the cardinal by the front of the robe pulled him up out of his chair and thrust him down on the table crushing his face against the coins spilled there ranulf let out a strangled cry and his two scribes jumped up as the nearest one bent to his masters aid bran took up an ink pot and dashed the contents into his face instantly blinded the clerk fell back bawling shaking black ink everywhere the other started for the door stay shouted bran his knife in his hand iwan uncertain what was happening glanced nervously at his lord tightening his grip on the money sack he backed toward the door cardinal ranulf squirming under his grasp pulled free falling back in his chair bran leapt onto the table and kicked the pile of parchments scattering letters deeds and royal writs across the room he kicked another pile and then jumped down seizing the cardinal once more does the king know what you do in his name asked bran the cardinal spat at him and bran slammed his head down on the table answer me pig bran iwan put a hand to his lords shoulder to pull him away bran enough shaking off iwans hand bran pulled the cardinal up wielding the knife in his face and shouting does the king know what you do in his name what do you think sneered the cardinal i act with williams authority and blessing release me at once or i will see you dance on the gibbet before the day is out pray forgive him your eminence said tuck pushing in beside bran he is overwrought and emotional taking brans hand in both of his own it took all his considerable strength to wrest the knife from his grasp and pull him away if you please sire accept this six hundred marks in part payment for the whole we will bring you the rest when we have it he looked to bran indicating that an answer was required not so bran took a step back from the table they get nothing from menot a penny bran think of your people pleaded aethelfrith but bran was already walking away he signalled iwan and siarles still holding the leather bags bring the money he told them the two scooped the loose coins and money bags back into the sacks and then hurried to follow their lord i will have you in chains shouted the cardinal you cannot treat the royal justiciar this way again i beg your indulgence your eminence said friar tuck but my lord has decided to take his appeal to a higher court fool this is the kings court the cardinal roared there is none higher i think replied tuck hurrying away you will find that there is one tuck rejoined the others in the yard bran was already mounted and ready to ride iwan and siarles were securing the money sacks when from the hall entrance burst cardinal ranulf shouting saivez les aux armes some of the knights still lingering in the yard heard the summons and turned to see the cardinal redfaced and angry his robes splotched with black ink hands outthrust he was pointing wildly at the departing britons aux armes gardes bawled the cardinal to arms seize them iwan siarles shouted bran slapping the reins across his mounts withers he started for the gate to me the porter hearing this commotion stepped from his hut just in time to see bran bearing down on him he flung himself out of the way as bran slid from his stillgalloping horse and dove into the hut appearing three heartbeats later with the weapons that had been given over on his arrival raising his longbow and nocking an arrow to the string he loosed one shaft at a barechested knight who was readying a lance for iwans unprotected back the arrow sang across the yard with blazing speed striking the knight high in the chest he dropped to the ground clutching his shoulder writhing and screaming iwan finished tying the money sack and swung into the saddle siarles followed an instant behind and both rode for the open gate tucks horse skittish with the sudden commotion reared and shied unwilling to be mounted the friar held tight to the reins and tried to calm the frightened animal meanwhile the porter having regained his feet and his wits threw himself at bran and received a jab in the stomach with the end of the bow he crumpled to his knees and bran returning to the business at hand raised the bow drew and buried a second shaft in the doorpost a bare handsbreadth from the cardinals head ranulf yelped and stumbled back into the hall the porter struggled to his knees againjust in time to receive a sidelong kick to the jaw which took him from the fight if you want to live said bran stay down iwan reached the porters hut and bran darting inside again retrieved the champions bow and sword ride on ahead shouted bran handing the champion his weapons he galloped away leading the packhorse wait for me at the bridge siarles followed holding tight to the reins of the second packhorse he paused at the porters hut long enough to snatch his bow and a sheaf of arrows from brans grasp go with iwan my lord i wont leave you behind keep the money safe bran shouted ill bring tuck wait for us at the bridge but my lord objected siarles just go bran waved him away as he darted back into the yard the friar had his hands full now he was surrounded on three sides by ffreinc knightstwo holding the padded lances they had been using when the fight began and one wielding a wooden practise sword one of the knights made a lunge with his lance striking the priest on the back of the neck tuck fell still clinging to the reins of his rearing mount and was dragged backwards bran running to the middle of the yard loosed a shaft as the knight drove in to crush tucks skull with the butt of the lance the arrow struck just above the hip throwing the knight sideways his lance spun from his hand pick it up shouted bran out of the corner of his eye he saw the dull glint of metal as two helmeted heads appeared in the doorway of the hall he sent another arrow into the doorway to keep them back and shouted for tuck to release the horse the spear tuck he cried pointing to the weapon on the ground use it understanding came to him at last the friar let go of the reins and snatched up the practise weapon just as the knight with the wooden sword closed on him spinning the shaft like a quarterstaff tuck dealt the man a solid blow on the forearm as the wooden blade swung down the sword slipped from his grasp as the soldier grabbed his broken arm tuck swung hard at the mans knee the soldiers leg buckled and he went down meanwhile tuck spinning on his toes whirled around to face his last assailant he neatly parried one swipe of the padded lance and dodged another before landing a doublehanded blow on top of the knights unprotected head the lance pole bounced and split with a resounding crack as the knight dropped senseless to the ground away tuck cried bran seizing the reins of the friars skittish horse he held the animal until the priest gained the saddle and with a slap on the beasts rump sent him off fly bran turned around to face the next assault only to find himself alone in the yard there were other soldiers in hiding close by he guessed but none brave enough to face his bow until they could better protect themselves he walked to the soldier squirming in the dirt with an arrow in his hip if youre finished with this ill be having it back bran told him placing a foot on the wounded mans side he gave a hefty yank and pulled the arrow free the knight screamed in agony and promptly passed out bran set the bloody arrow on the string and watching for anyone bold enough to challenge him backed toward the gate and his own waiting mount upon reaching his horse he cast a last look at the hall where a knights redpainted shield was just then edging cautiously into view from the open doorway he drew and loosed the arrow blazed across the distance and struck the shield just above the centre boss the oak shaft of the arrow shattered and the shield split bran heard a yowl of pain as the splintered shield disappeared smiling to himself he climbed into the saddle wheeled his horse and rode to join his swiftly fleeing band chapter the fields and groves of winchester fell away behind the steady hoofbeats of the horses bran pushed a relentless pace and the others followed keeping up as best they could when bran finally paused to rest his mount the sun was a golden glow behind the western hills the first stars could be seen in patches of clear sky to the east and the kings town was but a dull smokecoloured smudge on the southern horizon do you know what this means demanded tuck out of breath and sweating from the exertion he reined in beside bran and gave vent to his anger i suppose it means we wont be asked to join the kings christmas hunt replied bran it means cried tuck that a worse fate has befallen elfael than any since good king harold quit the battle with an arrow in his eye christ and all his saints attacking the cardinal like that you could have got us all killedor worse what were you thinking me you blame me shouted bran you cannot trust these people tuck the ffreinc are twofaced liars and cheats every last onebeginning with that redhaired maggot king of theirs well boyo you showed them the friar growled this time tomorrow there will be a price on your headon all our heads thanks to you good let red william count the cost of cheating bran ap brychan for the love of god bran tuck pleaded all you had to do was swallow a fairsized chunk of that blasted welsh pride and you could have had elfael for two thousand marks yesterday it was six hundred marks and today two thousand bran spat itll be ten thousand tomorrow and twenty the day after it is always more tuck and still more there is not enough silver in all england to satisfy them theyll never let us have elfael not now tuck snapped you made fair certain of that did you not bran glaring at the fat priest turned his face away iwan and siarles leading the packhorses reined up then sire said iwan what about the money what are we going to do now why ask me bran replied not taking his eyes from the far horizon i had one idea and risked everything to make it workwe all didbut it failed i failed i have nothing else but you will think of something said siarles you can always come up with something aye and it had better be quick friar tuck pointed out after what happened back there the ffreinc will be fast on our trail we cannot stand here in the middle of the road what are we going to do cant you see thought bran we tried and failed it is over finished the ffreinc rule now and they are too powerful the best we can do is take the money and divide it out amongst the people they can use it to start new lives somewhere else for myself i will go to gwynedd and forget all about efael bran said iwan quietly you know we will follow you anywhere just tell us what you want to do bran turned to his friends he saw the need in their eyes it was as angharad had said they had no one else and nowhere else to go for better or worse beleaguered elfael was their home and he was all the king they had well he was a sorry excuse for a kingand no better than his father king brychan had cared little enough for his people pursuing his own way all his life you are not your father angharad had told him you could be twice the king he wasand ten times the manif you so desired yet here he was set to follow in his fathers footsteps and go his own way was this his fate or was there another way competing thoughts roiled in his mind until one finally won out he was not his father it was not too late he could still choose a better way god in heaven thought bran i cannot leave them what am i to do what are you thinking bran asked aethelfrith i was just thinking that the enemy of my enemy is my friend said bran as the words came to him indeed tuck wondered regarding him askance and who is this dubious friend of yours neufmarche said bran you said the baron had called a council of his vassals and liege men yes but the place where they are meeting could you find it it would not be difficult but then lead me to him see here bran tuck remonstrated let us talk this over you said the ffreinc will be searching for us he countered they will not think to look for us in the barons camp but bran what have we to do with the baron there is no justice to be had of englands king bran answered his voice cutting therefore we must make our appeal wherever we find a ready ear turning in the saddle the priest appealed to iwan talk to him john ive grown fond of this splendid neck of mine and before i risk it riding into the enemys camp i would know the reason he has a fair point bran said the champion what have we to do with neufmarche bran turned his horse around to address them the king weighs heavily on de braoses side he said his face aglow in the golden light of the setting sun with the two of them joined against us we need a powerful ally to even the balance regarding tuck he said you have said yourself that neufmarche and de braose are rivals rivals yes agreed tuck who would carve up cymru between themand then squabble over which one had the most he shook his head solemnly neufmarche may hate de braose every mite and morsel as much as we do but he is no friend to us if we make alliance with him said bran he will be obliged to help us he has the power and means to rid us of de braose tuck is right said iwan besides how can we persuade him to ally with us we have nothing to offer him that he wants even so said siarles would neufmarche make such a bargain aye and if he did added tuck would he keep it bran paused in silent reflection could neufmarche be trusted there was no way to tell lord cadwgan in eiwas holds him trustworthy and just he and his people have been treated fairly but whether the baron honours his word or not bran said the words like stones in his mouth we will be no worse off than we are now this is a remedy of last resort tuck argued let us exhaust all other possibilities first we have done that my friend we have all that is left us now is to watch the ffreinc grow from strength to strength at our expense baron de braose and the red king mean us nothing but harm as for neufmarche we have nothing to lose bran offered a bitter smile if we must sleep with the devil let us do it and be done this is nothing more than what my father should have done long ago if brychan had sworn allegiance to the ffreinc when he had the chance we would not be in this predicament now the others unable to gainsay this argument reluctantly agreed bran brightening at last said lead the way tuck and pray with every breath that we find the friend we seek baron bernard de neufmarche had dismissed the last of the days petitioners and returned to his tent where after summoning remey to bring him refreshment he removed his short cloak and eased himself into his chair it had been a long day but in balance a good one and a fitting conclusion to a council that had in the end satisfied his every demand convening at talgarththe scene of vaunted lord rhys ap tewdwrs recent demisehad been the masterstroke providing a strong and present reminder to all under his rule that he was not afraid to deal harshly with those who failed to serve him faithfully the point had been made and accepted tomorrow the council would formally end and he would send his vassals homesome to better fates than they had hoped others to worseand he would return to hereford to oversee the harvest and begin readying the castle for the influx of fresh troops in the spring your wine sire remey placed a pewter goblet on the table beside the barons chair i have ordered sausages to be prepared and there is fresh bread soon would you like anything else while you wait the wine will suffice for now the baron replied easing off his boots and stretching his legs bring the rest when it is readyand some of those fraises if there are any left of course sire replied the seneschal the sessions went well today i assume they went very well indeed remey i am content baron neufmarche raised his cup and allowed himself a long satisfying sip savouring the fine tart edge of the wine councils always brought demands and this one more than mostowing to the prolonged absence of the king royal dispatch fresh from normandie indicated that the conflict between red william and his brother duke robert had bogged down with summer dwindling away there would be no further advances at least until after harvest if then meanwhile the king would repair to rouen to lick his wounds and restock his castles thus the kings throne in england appeared likely to remain vacant into the foreseeable future an absent king forced the lesser lords to look for other sources of protection and redress this neufmarche reflected created problems and opportunities for the greater lords like himself whose influence and interests rivalled the kings a baron who remained wary and alert could make the most of the opportunities that came his way he was just congratulating himself on the several exceptional opportunities that he had already seized this day when one of the squires who served as sentry for the camp appeared outside the tent bernard saw him hovering at the door flap and called yes what is it someone requests audience sire affairs are concluded for the day neufmarche replied tell them they are too late there was a short silence and then a small cough at the door flap what did you not hear what i said the council is over i have told them sire the squire replied but they insist do they shouted the baron rising from his chair he stumped to the doorway in his stocking feet and threw back the hanging flap i am at rest idiot the squire jumped back almost colliding with the two strangers behind himwelshmen from the look of them a young one dark and slender with a puckered scar along his cheek and an older one broad and bandylegged who despite his outgrown tonsure appeared to be a priest of some kind both men were dusty from the road and stank of the saddle well demanded the baron glaring at the strangers who had disturbed his peace what is it be quick pax vobiscum said the fat priest we have come on a matter we think will be of special interest to you the only thing that interests me right now snarled the baron is a cup of wine and the comfort of my chairwhich i possessed until your unseemly interruption william de braose said the young man quietly neufmarche turned a withering gaze upon the lithe stranger what about him his star ascends in the kings court while yours declines the young man smiled the scar twisting his expression into a fierce grimace i would have thought the humiliation of that would be a constant embarrassment to a man like you am i wrong impudent knave spat neufmarche thrusting forward who are you to speak to me like this the stranger did not flinch but replied with quiet assurance i am the man who offers you a way to reverse your sorry fate baron neufmarche succumbed to his own curiosity come inside he decided i will listen to what you have to say holding the flap aside he invited the strangers to enter and dismissed the squire i would ask you to sit the baron said returning to his camp chair but i doubt you will be here that long for i warn you the moment i lose interest in your speech i will have you thrashed and thrown out of this camp as you say replied the young man taking up his cup once more the baron said you have until this cup is drained he drank deeply and said less now i would speak quickly if i were you de braose is a tyrant the young man said with little understanding of the land he has taken and none at all of the people under his rule most of them have fled and those that remain are made to perform slave labour at the cost of their own fields and holdings if they were allowed to return to their homes to work the land and tend their herds elfael would enjoy prosperity unequalled by any other cantre all that is required is someone who can guide the will of the peoplesomeone the cymry will follow who can deliver them to you the baron sipped again more slowly this time and considered what he had heard you can do this i can there was no hint of hesitation or doubt in the young man your offer is tempting to be sure allowed the baron cautiously putting the cup aside he said but who are you to make such an offer at this the bowlegged friar spoke up before you stands bran ap brychan the rightful heir to elfael and i am aethelfrith at your service neufmarche gazed at the young man before him it never ceased to amaze him how very often events beyond his reckoning conspired to bring his plans to bountiful fruition here he had not lifted a hand and the prize plum had simply dropped into his lap the rightful heir is dead he said feigning indifference at least that is what i heard to my great relief replied bran it remains a rumour only still it serves a useful purpose when the time is right put aethelfrith we will make his presence known and his people will rally to him and overthrow the de braose usurpers in exchange for your promise to restore me to the throne bran said i would pledge fealty to you elfael would then abide in peace now the baron smiled what you have said has roused my interestand more than you know he rose and walked to the rear of the tent will you take some wine it would be an honour replied tuck there is much to discuss a moment please said the baron i will order cups to be brought with that he disappeared through the rear flap into the room used by his servants for preparing food for the baron and his guests remey neufmarche called aloud wine for my visitors the servant just returning from the kitchen tent with a trencher of sausages appeared at his summons stepping quickly to meet him the baron raised a finger to his lips for silence leaned close and whispered fetch me four knightsarmed and ready to fight bring them here at once remeys brow wrinkled in confusion sire is something amiss no time to explainbut the two welshmen are to be taken cap tive indeed they will not leave this place alive understand the aging seneschal inclined his head in a compliant nod go said neufmarche taking the trencher from his hands i will keep them occupied until you return remey turned on his heel and padded away the baron returned to his audience room with the sausages which he placed on the table inviting his guests to help themselves sit you down please enjoy he said with expansive warmth the wine will come in a moment in the meantime i would hear more about how you plan to bring about de braoses defeat chapter the last day of the barons council found merian in a pensive mood having resigned herself to the fact that she would leave the council and return not to caer rhodl but to castle neufmarche in hereford she was nevertheless apprehensive a sojourn amongst the ffreinc in the barons household secretly she was fascinated by the thoughteven regarding the prospect of a winter spent in normandie in a kindly light even so she could not deny the feeling that she was behaving as something of a traitor a traitor to what her family her country her own ideas about who and what the ffreinc were she could not decide her father had as much as commanded her to go her own mother had told her it is important that you do well in the barons court merian he likes you and we need his friendship just now although she did not say it outright her mother had given her to know that by currying favour with the baron she was helping her family survive in short she was little more than a hostage to the barons good pleasure she told herself that cymru would be the same whether she was attached to the barons court or not she told herself that in all likelihood her poor opinion of the ffreinc was based on hearsay and ignorance and that this was a chance to discover the truth of course she still considered the ffreinc enemies but was not a christian required to love her enemy from the time she was old enough to stand beside her mother in church she had been instructed to love her enemies and do good to those who persecuted her so if not the ffreinc then who she told herself that any young woman in her position would welcome the chance to advance herself in this way and that she should be grateful she told herself all these things and more yet the feeling of betrayal would not go away it was with these thoughts turning over in her mind that she made her way amongst the untidy sprawl of tents to the baronesss pavilion in the centre of the camp merian had been sent to find sybil and inform her friend that she had said her goodbyes to her parents and that her things were packed and awaiting collection by the barons servants as she passed the barons tent however a shout brought her up short she stopped it sounded like an argument had broken out there was a crash as if a table had been overturned and suddenly out of the tent burst four marchogi dragging two men between them at the sight of the young noblewoman standing directly in their path the soldiers halted the foremost prisoner raised his head even with the blood streaming from a cut above his eye even though she never thought to see him again amongst the living she knew him bran she blurted the name in startled amazement is it you merian gasped bran no less astonished to see her step aside lady said one of the knights jerking bran to his feet without thinking merian held up her hand stop she said and the soldiers paused she stepped nearer i thought you diedeveryone said so wishful thinking you know this man the voice was neufmarches he stepped from the tent and came to stand beside merian i did once merian replied turning to the baron iuntil this moment i thought him dead why are you treating him so what has he done he claims to be the heir of elfael the baron replied is this true it is merian granted that is all i need to know the baron sword in hand waved the soldiers on take them away i am sorry you had to see that my dear the baron began he did not finish the thought for as the knights still distracted by merian stepped past her bran twisted in their grasp and shook himself free snatching a dagger from the belt of his nearest captor he spun on his heel grabbed merian and pulled her roughly to him neufinarche made a clumsy attempt to snatch her from brans grasp and almost lost his hand stay back bran shouted raising the naked blade to merians slender neck bran no merian gasped one of the knights made a sudden lunge toward him bran evaded the move pressing the knife to merians throat and drawing a frightened scream from the young woman if you have any care for her at all he snarled you will stand aside stand easy men the baron told his soldiers to bran he said do you imagine this will aid you in any way that we will soon discover he said turning to the soldiers holding tuck he commanded release the priest the knights looked to the baron he saw the sharp blade pressed against the soft white fleshflesh he covetedand could not bear to see it harmed neufmarche surrendered with a nod do it he said dully let him go tuck called bran bring the horses the english friar shook free of his captors giving one a pointed kick saying that is for laying unclean hands on one of gods humble servants he hurried to where the horses had been left on the nearby picket line bran let me go pleaded merian her fear quickly melting into anger this is not meet i asked you to come with me once he said his mouth close to her ear you refused now it seems you are to join me whether you will or no tuck hurried back leading the horses he passed one pair of reins to bran and scrambled into the saddle bran stepping gingerly backwards to the horse pulled merian with him climb up and be quick he told her maintaining his grip on the knife gathering her skirts she put her foot to the stirrup and bran with a sudden movement boosted her onto the horse and quick as a cat vaulted up behind her farewell baron said bran shaking out the reins had you been true you would have enjoyed the spectacle of your rivals downfall now you will have to content yourself with the knowledge that this day you sealed your own i will track you down like an animal said neufmarche when i find you i will gut you and hang your carcass for the birds you must catch me first neufmarche said bran and if we are followed from this place merians lovely corpse will be all you find on the trail dont waste your breath on them said tuck let us hie from this vipers den away tuck with that bran slapped the reins across the shoulders of his mount and the horse leapt ahead the fat priest followed and the two riders disappeared with their hostage passing between the doseset tents and out of sight the soldiers watched in flatfooted amazement after them shouted the baron merian is not to be harmed what about the other two asked one of the knights once the lady is safeand only then the baron cautioned kill them if anything happens to her your lives are forfeit the four knights ran for their horses and clattered off in pursuit of the fugitives baron neufmarche watched until they were out of camp and then returned to his tent his spirits soaring with jubilation by the time his knights returned with merian the last heir to the throne of elfael really would be dead his unwanted presence a fastfading memory the troops promised by his father the duke would arrive with the first ships in the spring and in the council just concluded he hadthrough bargaining wheedling threatening and cajoling over many daysfinally obtained the support of his vassal lords for his threefold plan the unexpected appearance of elfaels prince might have swiftly undone all his hard work over the last many days but fortunately that problem would be swiftly resolved when the knights returned with his head in a sack thus no sooner than it had arisen the unforeseen impediment had been cleared the conquest of wales could begin friar tuck was first to reach the little dell where the four had made campnot far from the fields where the council was meeting but hidden in a fold between two hills iwan siarles he shouted thundering down the hillside to the stand of beech trees where they had camped to arms the ffreinc are coming the two men appeared drawing their swords as they ran iwan took in the situation at a glance thrust his sword into the turf and raced back for his longbow tuck reached the shelter of the trees and threw himself from the saddle as iwan appeared clutching two bow staves in one hand and a sheaf of arrows in the other there are four of them cried tuck bran has a woman with him and cannot outpace them much longer we had but a few yards start on them four only said iwan tossing a bow to siarles the way you were shouting i thought all the normans in england were on your tailand their hounds as well what woman wondered siarles bracing the bow against his leg to string it our escape required a hostage tuck explained for gods sake hurry a cry arose from the rim of the dell they turned to see bran pounding down the gentle slope encumbered by a squirming screaming female his mount was tired and clearly labouring even as they watched he was overtaken by the two ffreinc knights sweeping up behind him with swords raised for the love of god cried tuck hurry all in good time brother said iwan passing a handful of arrows to siarles it does not do to hurry an archer it makes him miss with quick downward jabs the two stuck the arrows point first in the turf and plucking one each nocked it to the string left said iwan right answered siarles and with almost languid motion the two pressed the longbows forward as if trying to step through them there was a single dull thrum and fizzing hiss as the arrows flew the knight on the left standing in his stirrups his arm raised high ready to begin the fatal downward slash with his blade was struck in the centre of the chest already unbalanced the impact slammed him backwards over the rump of his horse dead when he hit the ground the rider on the right had time but to glance once at the suddenly empty saddle of his companion before siarless arrow buried itself in his chest the sword spun from his hand and he clutched the arrow fighting to turn his galloping mounta fight he lost when siarless second arrow struck just below the first and knocked him from the saddle bran galloped on the two remaining knights appeared on the rim of the dell and started down left said iwan again and loosed the arrow a blurred streak in the air seemed to lift the soldier up ever so slightly as the horse ran out from under him the sole remaining knight must have seen the two riderless horses breaking off to the side for he tried to halt his headlong pursuit with a cry of dismay he jerked the reins back hard the horses churning hooves slipped in the long grass and the animal slid the knight occupied with his stumbling mount did not see the arrow that flung him from the saddle he landed heavily on his side rolled over and did not move again get their horses shouted bran to siarles as he reined his lathered mount to a halt tuck iwan break camp it will not be long before neufmarche realises his knights are not coming backand then he will come in force the two hurried off to gather the water and provisions and saddle the horses let me go shouted merian scratching at brans hands he released his hold and let her fall she landed in an awkward sprawl her mantle sliding up over bare legs her shoes had come loose and been lost in the mad dash from the barons camp you did that on purpose she raged pulling down her mantle and scrambling to her feet bran slid down from the saddle livid with rage dark eyes ablaze merian flew at him with her fists how dare you i am not a sack of grain to be picked up and thrown over your shoulder i demand enough bran snapped grabbing both of her wrists in one strong hand take me back at once so your friend the baron can carve my head from my shoulders he said no i think i would rather live a little longer my father will do the same unless you let me go whatever trouble youre in will not be helped by taking me i am certain that it can be cleared up if we all just merian brans hand flicked out and connected with her cheek in a resounding slap do you understand what just happened here he pointed to the dead knights on the hillside look out there merian this is no misunderstanding the baron means to kill me and i do not intend to give him another chance you hit me she said darkly never do that again then do not give me cause siarles returned leading three horses one got away he said go help iwan and tuck bran told him taking the reins three is enough what are you going to do asked merian her voice shaking with anger get as far away from here as possible he replied examining the horses there was blood on one of the saddles and the horse that had stumbled had a ragged gash in a foreleg bran released the animal and selecting one for merian pulled her around to the side and held out the stirrup for her mount up no you are acting like a child and you are acting like a brigand she said raising both hands she pushed him over backward turned and started runninggaining only a few paces before she felt his arms around her waist lifting her from her feet i am a brigand he said lugging her back to the horse he heaved her clumsily into the saddle and proceeded to tie her feet to the stirrups with the straps used to secure a lance do not try me again merian or i might forget i ever loved you you flatter yourself she snarled but you were ever a flatterer and a liar iwan tuck and siarles emerged from the beech grove just then leading two horses ready called iwan ride out bran said holding tight to the reins of merians mount he swung up into the saddle come my lady he said his voice cold and cutting let us hope that along with your loyalty and good sense you have not also forgotten how to ride where are you taking me to cel craidd he replied our fortress may not be as fine and rich as castle neufmarche but it is blessedly free of ffreinc and you will receive a better welcome there than i received at the barons hands they will find me you know she said trying to sound brave and unconcerned and you will pay dearly for what youve done they will find you when i choose to let them find you and they are the ones who will count the cost turning his eyes to the line of advancing twilight away to the east bran gazed at the gathering darkness and embraced it like a friend he lifted his head squared his shoulders and drew the evening air deep into his lungs when he glanced again to merian his eyes were veiled with the night and she realised bran was no longer the boy she had once known but now he said his words falling like a shadow between them it is time for this raven to fly epilogue dine days after the searchers returned to castle neufmarche in hereford with the sorry news that they had failed to turn up any sign of the welsh outlaws trail a solitary rider appeared at the door of the abbey of saint dyfrigthe principal monastery of elfael in the north of the cantref near glascwm i am looking for a certain priest the rider announced to the brother who met him at the gate wearing a dark green hooded cloak and a widebrimmed leather hat pulled low over his face he spoke the cymry of a trueborn briton i was told i might find him here who is it you seek asked the monk i will help you if i can one called asaph a bishop of the church then god has rewarded your journey friend the monk told him he is here fetch him please my time is short this way sir if you please the brother led the visitor to the guest lodge where he was given a cup of wine a bowl of soup and some bread to refresh himself while he waited lifting the bowl to his lips he drank down the broth and used the bread to sop up the last drops he then turned his attention to the wine sipping from his cup he leaned on the doorpost and gazed out into the yard at the monks hurrying to and fro on their business presently the doorkeeper appeared leading a whiterobed priest across the yard bishop asaph said the monk delivering his charge this man has come asking for you the priest smiled his pale eyes crinkling at the corners i am asaph he said how may i serve you i have a message for you said the stranger reaching into a pouch at his belt he brought out a piece of folded parchment which he passed to the bishop how very formal remarked the bishop he received the parcel untied the leather binding and unfolded it excuse me my eyes are not what they were he said stepping back into the light of the yard so that he could see what was written there he scanned the letter quickly and then looked up sharply do you know what this letter contains the rider nodded his assent and the bishop read the message again saying and a sum of money to be used for the building of a new monastery on lands which have been purchased for this purpose the better to serve the people of elfael should you accept this condition raising his face to the stranger he asked do you have the money with you i do replied the rider and the conditionwhat is it it is this the messenger informed him that you are to preside over a daily mass and pray for the souls of the people of elfael in their struggle and for their rightful king and his court each day without fail and twice on high holy days the rider regarded the bishop impassively do you accept the condition gladly and with all my heart answered the bishop god knows nothing would please me more than to undertake this mission so be it reaching into his pouch the messenger brought out a leather bag and passed it to the senior churchman this is for you with trembling hands the bishop opened the curiously heavy bag and peered in the yellow gleam of gold byzants met his wondering gaze two hundred marks the rider informed him two hundred did you say gasped the bishop stunned by the amount begin with that there is more if you need it but how asked asaph shaking his head in amazement who has sent this it has not been given for me to say answered the rider he stepped to the bench and retrieved his hat it may please my lord to reveal himself to you in due time he moved past the bishop into the yard for now it is his pleasure that you use the money in the service of gods kingdom for the relief of the folk of elfael the bishop holding the bag of money in one hand and the sealed parchment in the other watched the mysterious messenger depart what is your name asked asaph as the rider took up the reins and climbed into the saddle call me silidons for such i am replied the rider i give you good day bishop god with you my son he called after him and god with your master whoever he may be later as the monks of saint dyfrigs gathered at vespers for evening prayers bishop asaph recalled the condition the messenger had made that he perform a mass each day for the people of elfael and the king lord brychan of elfael was dead sadly enough if any soul ever needed prayer his surely didbut who amongst the living cared enough to build an entire monastery where prayers could be offered for the relief of that suffering soul but no no the messenger did not name brychan he had said the people in their struggle and for their rightful king and his court sadly the king and heir were deadso who was the rightful ruler of elfael bishop asaph could not say later that night the faithful priest led the remnant of elfaels monks the handful of loyal brothers who had entered exile with him in the first of many prayers for the cantref its people and his mysterious benefactor and if it please you heavenly father he whispered privately as the prayers of the monks swirled around him on clouds of incense may i live to see the day a true king takes the throne in elfael once more robin hood in wales it will seem strange to many readers and perhaps even perverse to take robin hood out of sherwood forest and relocate him in wales worse still to remove all trace of englishness set his story in the eleventh century and recast the honourable outlaw as an early british freedom fighter my contention is that although in nottingham the robin hood legends found good soil in which to grow they must surely have originated elsewhere the first written references to the character we now know as robin hood can be traced as far back as the early s by the robin hood legends were wellknown if somewhat various consisting of a loose aggregation of poems and songs plied by the troubadours and minstrels of the day these poems and songs bore little relation to one another and carried titles such as robin hood and the potter robin hoods chase robin hood and the bishop of hereford the jolly pinder of wakefield the noble fisherman robin whood turned hermit robin hood rescuing three squires and little john abegging as the minstrels wandered around britain with their lutes and lyres crooning to high and low alike they spread the fame of the beloved rogue far and wide often supplying local placenames to foster a closer identification with their subject and give their stories more immediacy thus the songs do not agree on a single setting nor do they agree on the protagonists name some will have it robert hood or whoode and others robin hod robyn hode robinet or even roger other contenders include robynhod rabunhod robehod and interestingly hobbehod and although these popular tales were committed to paper or parchment by about still no attempt was made to stitch the stories together to form a whole cloth in the earliest stories robin was no honourable errol flynnesque hero he was a coarse and vulgar oaf much given to crudeness and violence he was a thief from the beginning to be sure but the nowfamous creed of robbing from the rich to give to the poor was a few hundred years removed from his rough highwayman origins the early robin robbed from the rich to be sureand kept every silver english penny for himself as time went on the threadbare tales acquired new and better clothesuntil they possessed a whole wardrobe full of rich colourful sumptuous medieval regalia in the form of characters places incidents and adventures characters such as little john friar tuck will scarlet and sir guy of gisbourne joined the ranks one by one in various times and places as different composers and writers spun out the old tales and made up new ones the sheriff of nottingham was an early addition and contrary to popular opinion was not always the villain of the piece the beautiful plucky maid marian was actually one of the last characters to arrive on the scene making her debut sometime around the beginning of the sixteenth century others are notable by their absence in the early tales there is no evil king john and no good king richardno king at all and the only monarch who receives so much as a mention is edward our comely king though which of the many edwards this might be is never made clear so we have an amorphous body of popular songs and poems about a lovable rascal whose name was uncertain and who lived someplace on the island of britain at some unknown time in the past of all the possibilities to choose from in locating the legend in place and time why choose wales several small but telling clues serve to locate the original source of the legend in the area of britain now called wales in the generation following the norman invasion and conquest of first and foremost is the general character of the people themselves the welsh from the saxon wealas or foreigners or as they would have thought of themselves the britons in ad gerald of wales a highborn nobleman whose mother was a welsh princess wrote of his people the welsh are extreme in all they do so that if you never meet anyone worse than a bad welshman you will never meet anyone better than a good one he went on to describe them as extremely hardy extremely generous and extremely witty they were also he cautioned extremely treacherous extremely vengeful and extremely greedy for land above all he writes they are passionately devoted to liberty and almost excessively warlike gerald painted a picture of the cymry as a whole nation of warriors in arms unlike the normans who were sharply divided between the military aristocracy and a mass of peasants every single welshman was ready for battle at a moments notice women too bore arms and knew how to use them within two months of the battle of hastings william the conqueror and his barons the new norman overlords had subdued percent of england within two years they had it all under their rule howeverand i think this is significantit took them over two hundred years of almost continual conflict to make any lasting impression on wales and by that late date it becomes a question of whether wales was really ever conquered at all in fact william the conqueror recognising an implacable foe and unwilling to spend the rest of his life bogged down in a war he could never win wisely left the welsh alone he established a baronial buffer zone between england and the warlike britons this was the territory known as the march later this sensible nogo area and its policy of tolerance would be violated by the conquerors brutish son william ii who sought to fill his tax coffers to pay for his spendthrift ways and expensive wars in france wales and its great swathes of undeveloped territory seemed a plum ripe for the plucking and it is in this historical context in the year ad that i have chosen to set hood a welsh location is also suggested by the nature and landscape of the region wales of the march borderland was primeval forest while the forests of england had long since become wellmanaged business property where each woodland was a veritable factory wales still had enormous stretches of virgin wood untouched except for hunting and hiding the forest of the march was a fearsome wilderness when the woods of england resembled wellkept garden preserves it would have been exceedingly difficult for robin and his outlaw band to actually hide in englands everdwindling sherwood but he could have lived for years in the forests of the march and never been seen or heard this entry from the welsh chronicle of the times known as brenhinedd y saesson or the kings of the saxons makes the situation very clear anno domini mlxxxxv in that year king william rufus mustered a host past number against the cymry but the cymry trusted in god with their prayers and fastings and alms and penances and placed their hope in god and they harassed their foes so that the ffreinc dared not go into the woods or the wild places but they traversed the open lands sorely fatigued and thence returned home emptyhanded and thus the cymry boldly defended their land with joy emphasis mine that i think is the robin hood legend in seed form the plucky britons disadvantaged in the open field took to the forest and from there conducted a guerrilla war striking the normans at will from the relative safety of the woodsan ongoing tactic that would endure with considerable success for whole generations that is the kernel from which the great durable oak of legend eventually grew finally we have the briton expertise with the warbow or longbow as it is most often called while one can read reams of accounts about the english talent for archery it is seldom recognizedbut well documentedthat the angles and saxons actually learned the weapon and its use from the welsh no doubt the invaders learned fear and respect for the longbow the hard way before acquiring its remarkable potential for themselves as military historian robert hardy has observed the welsh were the first people on the british isles to have and use longbows the welsh became experts in the use of the longbow and used the longbow very effectively in battles against the invading english the welsh repelled ralph earl of hereford in using the longbow there is a story about welsh longbowmen penetrating a fourinchthick solid oak door with their arrows at the siege of abergavenny castle hardy goes on to say like the welsh the english learned an important lesson by fighting against the longbow that lesson being that the longbow is a formidable weapon when used correctly with the eventual defeat of the welsh and alliance of the english and welsh the english employed welsh longbowmen in its own army during this time the english began a campaign to train their own longbowmen as well in his book famous welsh battles british historian philip warner writes there were no easy victories over the welsh they were greatly esteemed and widely feared whether fighting as mercenaries in the middle ages or engaging in guerrilla combat from south wales came a new weapon the longbow as terrifying as modern weapons of mass murder some feet long and discharging an arrow feet in length averaging arrows a minute they blanketed a target like a dark vengeful cloud in the next moment all would be groans screams and confusion taken altogether then these clues of time place and weaponry indicate the germinal soil out of which robin hood sprang as for the english robin hood with whom we are all so familiar just as arthur a briton was later anglicisedmade into the quintessential english king and hero by the same enemy saxons he fought against a similar makeover must have happened to robin the british resistance leader outlawed to the primeval forests of the march eventually emerged in the popular imagination as an aristocratic englishman fighting to right the wrongs of england and curb the powers of an overbearing monarchy it is a tale that has worn well throughout the years however the real story i think must be far more interesting and so in an attempt to centre the tales of this british hero in the time and place where i think they originatednot where they eventually ended upi have put a british rhi bran and all his merry band of friends and enemies in wales stephen lawhead acknowledgments the author gratefully acknowledges the assistance of

many of the old celtic words and names are strange to modern eyes but they are not as difficult to pronounce as they might seem at first glance a little effortand the following rough guidewill help you enjoy the sound of these ancient words consonants as in english but with the following exceptions c hard as in cat never soft as in cent ch hard as in bach never soft as in church dd a hard th sound as in then f a hard v sound as in of ff a soft f sound as in off g hard as in girl never soft as in george ll a gaelic distinctive sounded as tl or hl on the sides of the tongue r rolled or slightly trilled especially at the beginning of a word rh breathed out as if hr and heavy on the h sound s soft as in sin never hard as in his when followed by a vowel it takes on the sh sound the
