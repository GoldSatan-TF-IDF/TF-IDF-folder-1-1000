don winslow a cool breeze on the underground prologue dads call neal knew he shouldnt have answered the phone sometimes they just ring with that certain rotten jangle that can mean only bad news he listened to it ring for a full thirty seconds before it stopped and then he looked at his watch exactly thirty seconds later it rang again and he knew he had to answer it so he set his book down on the bed and picked up the receiver hello he said sourly hello son a cheerfully mocking voice answered dad its been a long time meet me it was an order neal hung up the phone whats up diane asked neal pulled on his sneakers i have to go out a friend of the family you have an exam in the morning she protested i wont be long its eleven oclock at night gotta go she was puzzled one of the few things neal had ever told her about himself was that hed never known his father neal pulled on a black nylon windbreaker for the cool may night and hit the streets broadway was still busy this time of night it was one reason he loved living on the upper west side he was a new yorker born and bred and for all of his twentythree years had never lived anywhere but on the upper west side he bought a times at the newsstand on seventyninth in case graham was late as he often was he hadnt seen or heard from graham in eight months and he wondered what was so goddamn urgent that he had to meet him right away whatever it is he thought please let it be in town a quick trip down to the village to pick up some kid and bring him back to mama or maybe a couple of quick sneaky snapshots of somebodys old lady dining out with a saxophone player he and graham always met at the burger joint this had been neals idea for a hamburger lover it was mecca a narrow little place jammed in on the first floor of the hotel belleclaire it catered to everyone from junkies who had scraped together a few bucks to movie stars who had scraped together a lot of bucks nick made the best burgers in town if not the civilized world and it was a terrific place to pick up a fast meal and a tip about a ball game the yankees would be in it this summer for surethe pennant and series too just for the bicentennial neal went in and waved at stavros behind the counter then took an empty booth in the corner sure enough graham wasnt there yet but neal was early he ordered a cheeseburger with swiss cheese fries and an iced coffee he settled into the times and waited comfortably for things to happen in his line of work waiting well was an acquired talent and a necessity neal was a newspaper addict he read the three major dailies religiously and absorbed the variety of weeklies that new york served up like a heavy dessert tonight it was the sports news that interested him convinced as he was of the yankees destiny he started right in when the food came although meet me always meant in one half hour at the last designated spot neal knew that he could double the time and still be waiting on graham he figured that graham did it on purpose to annoy him so he did his best to cover his embarrassment when he looked up from his paper to see the smiling face of joe graham looking across the table at him neal was glad to see him but he didnt want to show that either you look like a bum graham said so graham wasnt being followed or in any immediate trouble been working hard neal answered how are you ah he shrugged so whats up you in a hurry you mind if i eat i see you waited for me graham signaled the waiter ill have what hes having on a clean plate tell me this isnt an allnighter neal said i have a test at eightthirty in the morning graham chuckled you dont know the half why do we always have to meet in this toilet i want you to feel at home the waiter came with grahams food graham examined it carefully before pouring half a bottle of catsup all over it he sipped at his coffee when are you guys going to break down and make a fresh pot of coffee when you change your shorts the waiter answered happily and walked away hed put in his time on broadway graham sat silently for a minute neal recognized the technique graham wanted him to ask the questions screw him he thought he hasnt called me in eight months youre going out of town tomorrow graham said finally wiping a smear of catsup from his mouth the hell i am to providence rhode island i know where it is im not going though graham smirked what you got hurt feelings we havent called your rent gets paid college kid hows your hamburger maybe theyd cook it next time the man wants to see you levine levine lives in providence for all i see of levine he could be living in afghanistan let me tell you something levine would rather never see you again levine would like to see you pumping gas in butte wyoming im talking about the man at the bank in providence rhode island montana and i have a test tomorrow not anymore i cant screw around this semester graham your professor understands turns out hes a friend of the family graham was grinning at him graham was an evil leprechaun neal decided a short roundfaced middleaged little harp with thinning hair beady blue eyes and the nastiest smile in the whole history of smiles whatever you say dad youre a good son son part one the sound of one hand clapping neal carey was eleven years old and broke that wasnt a big deal for most elevenyearolds but neal was basically selfsupporting as his father had never put in an appearance and his mother had an expensive habit that more than ate up whatever money she brought home when she was capable of leaving the apartment so when neal snuck into megs one slow summer afternoon he was looking for a contribution he was a skinny dirty kid like a lot of others on the west side there was nothing unusual about neal and he liked it that way the ability to blend into a crowd is an important trait for a pickpocket there was nothing unusual about megs either it was just another bar that served beer whiskey and the occasional gin and tonic to the remnants of the neighborhoods irish population mckeegan the bartender felt hed landed in a pretty soft bog when hed married meg there is nothing more fortuitous than wedding an irish broad with her own bar he was telling graham that afternoon shell keep you in food whiskey and you know what and all you have to do is stand behind the bar and make conversation with other drunks no offense to yourself youll be understanding graham also felt lucky he had an afternoon to kill he was making a living and he was parked on a bar stool in front of a cold glass of beer a child of delancey street knew things didnt get much better young neal slid up and crouched under the bar next to graham listening to the sounds of the baseball game with which the man seemed involved he waited until he heard the crack of a bat and the cheer of the crowd experience had taught him that men sitting in saloons lean forward when home runs are hit sure enough this sucker did and neal placed his index and forefingers in a gentle pinch on the nowexposed top of the mans wallet when the man sat back again the wallet popped into the kids hand as if it was saying take me home neal who didnt have a set at home nevertheless thought that television was a wonderful thing stealing something is relatively easy getting out with it is something else again a thief is basically confronted with two choices bluff or run he needs to know himself and his gifts his strengths and his weaknesses a successful thief must possess an unusual amount of selfknowledge neal had some information readily available from the swift observation that is part and parcel to a poor city kid he knew that he was in an irish bar with two more or less sober micks that he was eleven years old and that there was no way in hell that he was going to bluff these two guys he also knew that there was no way on gods good earth that either of these middleaged guzzlers could ever catch him in a flatout race baseball might be a spectator sport theft is strictly participatory he analyzed this data in the space of about a second and a half and headed full speed for the door graham hadnt felt his wallet being lifted but he sure felt it was gone joe graham never had much money so he tended to know where it was and where it wasnt and even a roger maris shot over the leftfield fence couldnt mask the fact that his money wasnt in its right and proper place in his pocket he turned around to see the back of a little kid running out the door graham didnt pause to comment those who take the time to say something like that little bastard just took my wallet are acknowledging a fait accompli he shot out the door after the kid intent on the recovery of his property and the punishment of the perpetrator neal took a hard right out of the door and headed up amsterdam then jagged a left on eightyfirst street halfway down the block he decked right spun left and plunged into the alley where a chainlink fence and an unlocked basement door promised haven he hit the fence at full stride digging in with the toe of his sneaker and pulling up with his arms neal knew from his childhood days of ringalevio that he could take a fence faster than any kid in the neighborhood he knew he was being chased but he also knew that by the time this jerk got over that fence he would be separating fives from tens in the cool of the basement he was in the middle of this pleasant thought when something hard and heavy hit him about kidney height in the back and dropped him off the fence he was sucking for air for just a moment before he blacked out graham had seen as soon as he turned into the alley that this kid was a sprinter and that he wasnt going to catch him his clean shirt was soaked with sweat now and four beers were bouncing around in his belly and threatening worse he knew that if this kid got over that fence his wallet was history so he grabbed his artificial right arm a heavy hardrubber affair and jerked it out then with his overdeveloped left arm threw it at the thief when neal came to he saw a mean little leprechaun leering down at hima onearmed leprechaun life stinks doesnt it observed the man you think youve picked yourself up a couple of bucks you just about got it made and some guy takes his arm off for chrissakes and flattens you with it he grabbed neal by the shirt and hauled him to his feet cmon lets go see mckeegan my beers getting warm he frogmarched neal back to megs nobody on the street took any notice graham slammed neal down on a bar stool neal watched with fascinated horror as graham put his arm back on and roiled his sleeve down over it neal you little fuck said mckeegan you know him graham asked he lives in the neighborhood his mothers on the needle lucky for you you didnt have time to spend any of this graham said to neal then he slapped him hard across the face you want the cops asked mckeegan reaching for the phone what for neal knew enough to keep his mouth shut there wasnt any use trying to deny the obvious besides he was a little demoralized having just been cornered and beaten up by a guy with one arm life sure does stink he thought you do this a lot pick pockets graham asked only since last friday what happened last friday i took a bath in the market you got a smart mouth for a pick who gets caught so easy i were you id work on my technique let jackie gleason do the jokes graham looked real hard at this child he was just pissed off enough to call the cops and make the kid take the trip to juvenile hall but a younger joe graham had found more than one meal in someone elses pocket and you never knew when a smart kid could be useful whats your name neal you a rockandroll star or you got a last name neal carey mckeegan how about making a cheeseburger for neal carey mckeegan gestured behind him do you know what this is a grill a clean grill and its going to stay a clean grill until five oclock ill not be dirtying it up for a sneaky thief whos after robbing my customers i rob my customers how about a turkey sandwich that ill make mckeegan turned to the counter to make the sandwich graham turned to neal your mother takes dope yeah do you take dope i take wallets neal was confused generally speaking people whose pockets have been rifled dont buy lunch for the rifler this was the first time in a twoyear career that hed ever been caught he knew from neighborhood wise guys what to expect from the cops but this was another thing altogether he contemplated another run for it but his back still hurt from the last attempt and from the corner of his eye he could see a thick turkey sandwich on rye with mayonnaise knowing that a full stomach beat an empty one he decided to play along for a while your mother get money from you when she can you eat regular i get by right mckeegan delivered the food and neal wolfed it down you eat like an animal said graham youll get sick neal barely heard him the sandwich was wonderful when mckeegan unbidden served up a coke neal thought he might like to get caught more often when he was finished graham said now get out of here thanks thanks a lot and if theres ever anything i can do for you you can get out of my sight neal headed for the door he wasnt one to push his luck and neal carey neal turned around if i ever catch you in my pocket again ill cut your balls off this time neal ran a week later neal was hiding in an alley it was pretty late at night but his mother was entertaining a customer and neal didnt feel like going home people in the neighborhood lived on the streets on summer nights like this one a sticky new york city night the air as hot and black as tar the multicolored carnival of a west side night went on around him but he was only dimly aware of the decadent beauty that made up this world he was savoring a hershey bar filched from a local bodega on eightyfifth street he was in a quiet mood wanting to be alone and that was why he was sitting in an alley resting in a position to see a very large man in his underwear come pounding down a fire escape in pursuit of a fleeing joe graham ill kill you you bastid the fat man huffed his sweaty gut bouncing over his jockey shorts neal heard a womans voice and looked up to see a naked blond lady screaming out the window the film get the film joe graham didnt pause a second when he glimpsed neal carey with a quick backhand toss he flipped the camera down to the boy and kept running neal didnt have to be told what to do when you are holding an item urgently desired by a furious threehundredpound man in his underwear there is only one thing to do neal took off down the alley and into the street where he soon lost himself in the crowd the camera was one of those new small jobs designed to fitor more exactly to be concealedin the palm of the hand it was clearly not a device uncle dave carried to get a shot of aunt edna on top of the empire state building neal hung around the streets for a while keeping a wary eye out for angrylooking gargantuans then he made his way over to megs joe graham was at the bar nursing a whiskey and holding a piece of hamburger over his left eye im thinking you have to use a steak mckeegan was saying you have one no then ill take another whiskey the bar was crowded neal squeezed his way over to graham did you lose something neal asked him did you find something neal handed him the camera graham opened it up wheres the film id like a hamburger rare not the one you have on your face either some french fries and a beer i could just take it from you child unless i stashed it somewhere get the little bastard what he wants graham said to mckeegan neal reached into his pocket and handed him the film dirty pictures valuable dirty pictures thats what i figured wheres the gorilla soaking his balls in ice and they should fall off looks like he caught you a good one comes with the job couldnt you get your arm off quick enough i was scared hed eat it i didnt think youd get out of that alley i notice you didnt stick around long enough to find out i thought the film was more important you were right i know it you want a job yeah when can you start now okay hustle down to the carnegie deli find a guy named ed levine big tall guy curly black hair tell him youre from me give him the film he asks why i didnt come tell him im wounded and getting drunk you got that easy yeah also easy to find the fat guy and sell the film back to him but dont do it because ill find you and i know meet me back here two oclock tomorrow afternoon what for for your education my son so neal carey went to work for friends of the family not fulltime of course and not even very often but an agency like friends often had a need to get quietly into small places and quickly out of them anyone who grew up in or near providence rhode island knew the old bank building its gray stones had held in safety the treasure of piggy banks the birthday presents from fond uncles the weekly paychecks and stock dividends of the thrifty workingclass new englanders since rum slaves and guns had made the town more than just a farm market later the bank housed the profits from the textile mills of southern new england from the slate quarries of pawtucket and from the fishing fleets of galilee and jerusalem at the mouth of narragansett bay everyone knew that the bank was solid it offered no toasters electric blankets or water tumblers to lure prospective savers it had a reputation trustworthy solid and steady which brought people to its mahogany counters where the tellers windows resembled the gun ports of the old frigates that had brought the city wealth to deposit their nickels dimes and dollars no deposit was too small or too large something different brought the wealthy customers privacy the bank was the kitteredge family and the kitteredge family was the bank the kitteredges had been counting saving investing and hiding the money of the rich from the days when british tax collectors sought the crowns share of the lucrative molasses trade to the present era of the slick and merciless irs computers the kitteredges were private people private in the way that can be found only in new england and the deep south for the kitteredges a new customer was merely a thirdgeneration saver at the bank their steady clientele were those who had hoarded their money during the revolution until they were sure just how things would turn out money from the bank fought the revolution in the form of uniforms muskets and powder although one kitteredge samuel joshua displeased his grandfather by donning one of those uniforms and dying at the head of his platoon on the ramparts of yorktown far more sensible in the old mans eyes were the kitteredgefinanced privateers who raided british shipping on the high atlantic thereby serving their country by crippling british sea power while at the same time bringing home nice profits to the bank the kitteredges were fortunatesome say providentin producing the right numbers of male and female offspring kitteredge followed kitteredge in direct line as presidents of the bank with few enough descendants to avoid destructive squabbling and just enough to keep the business in the family the nineteenth century was a golden era for the family and its bank an age when patrician attitudes went hand in hand with the growth of the republic the civil war brought a financial boom and another son joshua samuel marched off to help destroy the evil institution of slavery that his forefathers had done so much to establish young joshua did not march back a grave was chipped out on the frozen slopes of fredericksburg where a rhode island general had ordered him to his death a foolish charge joshuas father had grumbled at the memorial service like someone from massachusetts might dothat state having a reputation for fanaticism akin to rhode islands legacy of unprovoked orneriness in the halcyon years between appomattox and the sinking of the lusitania the bank thrived the gaslight gave way to the electric light furnaces took the place of potbellied stoves but the old stone building itself never changed and never would a bank isnt plastic glass and steel one kitteredge had thundered during an infamous board meeting when a foolish member had proposed a new look a bank is stone brass and hardwood people bring their money here the kitteredge lifestyle was as conservative as the building itself keep the business in the office and out of the newspapers was the honored family motto no newport mansions or debutante balls for the kitteredges their large houses were tucked away in narragansett or in the woods of lincoln and of course the old family home on college hill remained occupied and freshly painted the kitteredge youths attended brown yale too progressive harvard too flashy princeton in new jersey berthed their sailboats in a small cove in wickford married girls from new hampshire and vermont and drank their whiskey in their dens at night july stands out as a significant date in terms of the lives of neal carey and joe graham on that day one william kitteredge in roughly the middle of the standard twentytothirtyyear apprenticeship as vice president of something beat the scion of another family rather too easily in their weekly tennis match at the club this gentleman whose family maintained reserves of at least two sets of books at the bank confessed to bill that the light of his life his young daughter had run away with an italian this disturbing revelation provoked sympathy in bill who thought something should be donequietly that evening bill had a word with jack quinn a janitor at the bank whose son jack junior was a promising young prizefighter and youth about town could young jack perhaps lend a hand jack was delighted and located the couple had a few friendly words of counsel with the nowlessthanardent husband and delivered the girl to bill at his house in town bill in turn had a drink with his friend the judge and the marriage never happened bill returned the daughter received copious thanks and thought no more about it until he was summoned into the office promptly at seven oclock monday morning hear youve been rescuing damsels in distress from the clutches of recent mediterranean arrivals his father said thats right plan to continue this sort of thing might then you had better get organized actually the old man said it made sense the world had changed and could be a more troublesome sort of place than it should the bank despised a scandal he said and more and more of its old customers seemed to be getting in the newspapers these days were old friends of these families and moreover its in our interest to keep them safe and happy cheaper in the long run to take care of some of these little problems ourselves so bill got a raise and a budget and orders to put together an agency within the bank to be at the service of old friends whose private problems might not be best ameliorated by the public arm of the law and the grimy hands of the press the agency never existed on paper and the door of room never proclaimed friends of the family but thats what the agency came to be called and the word passed quickly around the locker rooms and boardrooms of southern new england the word was that if you needed something done quietly go visit bill or drop a word at the bank that old stone building housed friends of course the needs of friends clients changed with the century prohibition brought in its wake waves of arrests which in turn brought showers of envelopes cheerfully dropped on enteprising police and judiciary and a wave of a different sortthe immigrant wavechanged new england forever but the bank held its ground and friends with both fists and favors carved out a modus vivendi with other tightknit ethnic organizations the depression winnowed the banks customers and forced the bank to burrow deeply into its reserves to survive until hitler and tojo filled the shipyard with contracts and workers again and people remarked over dinner how provident the kitteredges had been to invest in the arms industry way back in the thirties new england was already on its way to becoming a backwater however the textile mills packed up and went south to the cheap labor and the business talent caught the train to new york city whose glass and steel monoliths began to buy up more and more new england businesses friends clients were increasingly finding the worms in the big apple so in a quiet branch office was opened in manhattan not long after that friends hired a foulmouthed onearmed toocleverbyhalf private dick named joe graham not long after that on one of his early cases graham was sitting in a quiet west side bar when some kid tried to pick his pocket the am train from new york to providence said amtrak on it but actually it was something dante had designed for collection agents to spend eternity inwhich is about how long the train took to get to providence the seats were as comfortable as a tax audit featured torn upholstery and could have served as the focus for a rousing game of name that stain old newspapers paper coffee cups and beer cans festooned the aisles and the seats the smell of stale everything perfumed what passed for air neal returned from the snack car with a cup of coffee that was already semisolid and a danish older than hamlet graham had brought his own food sealed in little tupperware containers graham had ridden the train before why couldnt we fly neal asked because i didnt want to youre afraid i dont like to fly graham said munching on a carrot stick why dont you like to fly because im afraid graham twisted open a thermos and poured hot coffee into his cup he smiled at neal and said failing to prepare is preparing to fail neal huddled up in his sport coat and tried to look out the gungedup window they were somewhere in connecticut stopped dead in their tracks as it were for no discernible reason nor did this seem to cause undue concern to the conductor who was sleeping the sleep of the innocent in the backseat of the car neal thought the guy must have the metabolism of a polar bear to sleep in this cold there was no heat on the train and it was cold for a may morning you want to get drunk he asked graham graham opened the thermos again and held it up to neals nose yes neal smelled it and gave graham his best lostpuppy look graham sighed and shook his head and pulled an extra plastic cup out of his bag he removed it from its plastic wrapping and poured neal a heavy tot love you dad how could you help it son the nice thing about irish coffee neal thought was that it kept your body awake but put your mind to sleep he sat back and let the warmth spread through him eight or ten more of these might make the trip almost bearable the train lurched forward wakey wakey we there already not quite you have to get cleaned up graham was leaning over him cleanshaven straight tie eyes clear and breath fresh neal hated graham i brought you an extra razor sure enough graham had brought two cordless electric shavers with him also a lint brush visine and cepacol neal hauled himself and his kit into the rest room and got himself into shape he felt like shit and was surprised to feel butterflies in his stomach in almost twelve years of working for friends this would be the first time he would meet the man and the man had more or less run his life so far why he asked graham when he returned to his seat is this the first time i meet the man no need and theres a need now you look good son straighten your tie levine waited for them at the platform levine was sixthree and at thirtyone beginning to thicken around the middle he had curly black hair blue eyes and a face that was just a couple of sixpacks this side of fat his heavily muscled body didnt begin to hint at his speed levine was catquick and that with his size made a very ugly package for anybody on the wrong side of his fists he was a black belt who thought that breaking boards was a waste of time and good wood he had come into friends strictly as muscle someone to help out a short onearmed guy when things got out of hand but levine had a brain and was very very hip brainy enough and hip enough to know he didnt want to stay on the street all his life so hed put himself through night classes at city and came out with a management degree and now he headed up the new york office of friends passing by his old friend and partner joe graham levine hates you graham told neal i know this wasnt exactly news to neal he knew levine hated him and he was tired of it really tired of it he figures you got a free ride fancy private school ivy league now graduass school all paid for doesnt think youre worth it hes probably right probably i dont want his job dad that was the problem neal thought levine knew that neal was being groomed neal knew it graham knew it the man was paying for his masters degree for the upscale clothing for the speech teacher who had taken away neals street dialect but groomed for what neal didnt want to run friends he wanted to be an english professor honest to god i know you want to teach poetry to fags well not exactly eighteenthcentury english novels fielding richardson smollett how many times do i have to say it neal asked he had told ed he had told everybody he had written the man dont put me through any more college because im not going to stay with you forever it was all right they said work for us when you can parttime case by case no strings attached then they jerk you out of classes two weeks before finals you dont get to be an english professor by flunking your graduate english seminars even getting a b could be death maybe if you hadnt pronged his wife graham said the train was pulling into the grimy providence suburbs she wasnt his wife then neal said hed been over this ground so many times christ i introduced them maybe ed just figures you got everything he should have had first neal shrugged maybe that was true but he hadnt asked for any of it providence is the kind of city where all the men still wear hats the soul of the city was stuck back in the good old forties when you kept a lid on things and rooted against the japs the germans and the yankees not necessarily in that order a hat was a symbol of respectability a nod to the order of things to a city run by irish politicians sicilian gangs and french priests all of whom came together for knights of columbus breakfasts and providence college basketball games and otherwise stayed in their respective realms union station was a perfect representative of the city sad drab dirty and hopeless it was the right place to enter providence you didnt get your hopes up levine greeted them as they got off the train laurel and hardy he said hello ed said graham levine ignored neal he said to graham anybody follow you graham and neal exchanged an amused glance i think were clean ed you better be well there was that guy with dark glasses a fake mustache and a trench coat you dont suppose ed didnt laugh cmon he led them downstairs into the old terminal where a few old winos held some ragged newspapers down on the old wooden benches a couple of them were watching the dust filtered through the dirty yellow windows as they walked past a stand of metal lockers ed grabbed neal by the neck and pushed him none too gently against a locker he lifted neal until only his toes touched the floor graham started to move in but was stopped by a straightarm and an icecold look neal tried to slide out of the hold but eds big arms held him tight he managed to get his own arms inside eds and grab him by the collar it was merely a symbolic hold now listen to me you little bastard ed whispered this job is important got it important youre going to do just what youre told just the way youre told to do it none of your smart mouth or your smart ideas you are the last person in the world id pick for this job but the man wants you so its you so you dont fuck around and you dont fuck up because if you do im going to bust you up im going to hurt you real bad got it jesus ed said graham got it youre going to do this to me sometime ed and im ed tightened his grip and laughed youre going to do what neal huh what are you going to do neal could barely breathe he needed aireven providence air levine could break him into little bits without breaking a sweat the book said to hit ed in the nose with the heel of his palm the book wasnt going to get killed so neal did the best thing he could under the circumstances he kept his mouth shut after a few long seconds ed let him go and walked away graham rolled his eyes at neal and hurried after ed neal slouched against the lockers and caught his breath then he shouted after levine so ed hows the little woman he watched as graham nudged levine through the door neal was getting tired of this shitvery tired at forty ethan kitteredge looked younger than neal thought he would a lock of ash blond hair fell over his forehead and the pale blue eyes that peered from behind his wirerim glasses he was about five ten neal guessed and weighed maybe one seventy one seventyfive the body under the gray bankers suit was trim tennis or handball then neal quit playing sherlock holmes because the man was reaching out his hand and smiling you must be mr carey he said his handshake was firm and quick nothing to prove and youre mr kitteredge witty neal he thought great first impression ive heard a lot about you kitteredge said how is your graduate work coming im missing an exam as we speak otherwise its going great thanks graham found something fascinating on the floor to stare at levine stared at neal and shook his head yes i chatted with professor boskin about it kitteredge said if he was bugged he didnt show it he mumbled something about giving you an incomplete that was nice of you to do mr kitteredge but i like to finish what i start just so gentlemen please sit down coffee tea three wooden chairs had been placed in an arc facing kitteredges desk levine sat down on the right graham on the left neal plunked himself down in the remaining chair the center of attention kitteredge stepped to a silver coffee service neal noticed he moved in the awkward manner produced by generations of new england breedingstops and starts which imply that any choice of motion is merely a necessary evil that the real virtue is to remain still nevertheless he managed to pour four cups of coffee and serve them around this took a while and neal used the quiet moments to study the office which was pure bank pure kitteredge the twentieth century had yet to intrude its vulgarities sunlight shone a soft filtered amber on a room ruled by mahogany and oak glassenclosed bookshelves lining the walls housed leatherbound sets of dickens emerson thoreau and of course melville bowditchs navigation held a prominent spot flanked by various obscure whaling memoirs and sailing treatises wooden models of old china clippers completed the decor these were the vessels that had carried kitteredge tea kitteredge guns kitteredge opium and kitteredge slaves across the oceans and neal imagined that the profits from these voyages still rested beneath his feet in kitteredge vaults one modern memento held the pride of place an exquisite scale model of the sloop haridan sat on the glossy polished oak of ethans desk some skilled craftsman had faithfully rendered the boats sleek structure and clean lines ethan spent every free moment on haridan sailing narragansett bay long island sound and the open atlantic he often docked on block island where he kept a summer home for ethan kitteredge responsible banker responsible husband responsible father haridan meant rare and precious moments of heady freedom the coffee successfully served kitteredge took his seat behind his desk and pulled a file from the top center drawer he looked at the file for a moment shook his head and handed it across the desk to neal then he sat back in his chair and pressed his fingers together in this is the church this is the steeple fashion kitteredge talked like he walked some uh old family friends have a bit of a problem and we have offered our services to assist them in finding a resolution he smiled as if to suggest that disorderly people were amusing werent they and a bit of a bother but they are our friends and we must do our best he paused for a moment to allow neal to open the file senator john chase comes from a prominent rhode island family said kitteredge the family name has undoubtedly been an asset in his political progress but i hasten to add that the senator is a talented intelligent and ah energetic man okay kitteredge continued the senator sits on several important committees where his performance has attracted national attention from the press as well as party professionals despite the somewhat distasteful fact that john is a democrat we support him in his ambitions money in the bank the probable democratic nominee will need to look northward for a running mate ah emissaries have already been sent kitteredge paused to allow the import of this last statement to sink in it didnt so what neal thought despite the somewhat distasteful fact that im going to vote for whatever democrat is running whats all this have to do with me there is however a problem which is where i come in the problem is allie neal turned a few pages of the file and saw a picture of a teenaged girl she had shiny blond hair and blue eyes and looked as if she belonged on a magazine cover kitteredge stared at the model of haridan as he said actually alison always has been the problem he seemed lost in his thoughts or in some more happy memory on board his boat neal said but specifically now allie has run away yeah okay so well go get her but there was something else going on here neal sensed things were a little too tense he looked at graham and didnt see a clue he looked at ed but ed wouldnt look back any idea where neal finally asked she was last seen in london ed said a former schoolmate saw her there over a springbreak trip he tried to speak to her but she ran away from him its all there in your file neal looked it over this schoolmate a scott mackensen had seen her about three weeks ago what do the british cops say kitteredge stared harder at the boat no police mr carey this time ed did look at nealhard neal buried his face in the file then asked alison is seventeen years old nobody answered neal looked through the file some more a seventeenyearold girl has been gone for over three months and nobody has called the police another few seconds of silence and kitteredge would actually will himself onto the model boat a tiny model captain on a toy boat levine said the senator was reluctant to risk publicity less reluctant to risk his daughter does the senator like his daughter neal asked not particularly this came from kitteredge who continued nevertheless he wants her back by august he wants her back not right away not tomorrow morning but by august let me see what happens in august it gets hot and muggy the yankee pitching falls apart oh yeah the democrats have a convention i trust you will not be offended mr carey when i say that sometimes a situation arises that requires a blend of the common and the sophisticated when someone is needed whose education has occurred as much in the street as well as in the classroom this is just such a case you are just such a person except i dont want to do it god how much i dont want to do it not after the halperin kid please no more teenage runaways never again after the halperin kid levine frowned as he said youre going to go to london find alison chase and bring her back in time for the democratic convention no im not what happens if chase doesnt get nominated ed you want me to throw the kid back your fine sense of moral indignation will not be required mr carey im not the man for this job mr kitteredge the halperin tragedy was an aberration mr carey it could have happened to anyone but it happened to me it wasnt your fault son then why have i been on the shelf since it happened kitteredges hand traced the sleek bow of haridan the hiatus was for your benefit not friends well then it worked after the drinking and the insomnia and the nightmares had gone on for a while i found diane and school again and now i dont want to come back for once i agree with carey mr kitteredge said ed hes wrong for this one im sorry to pull you out of your classes but your adviser understands kitteredge said hes a friend of the family so thats it neal thought you bought me you own me im sorry neal but this assignment is important vital neal closed the file and put it in his lap he knew a dismissal line when he heard one ill need to talk to the senator and mrs chase as soon as possible because the first place to start looking for a runaway he knew is at home this is a case for the new york rangers neal said to graham out on the sidewalk it stinks on ice all right but there it is son you gotta pay rent they were following levine they knew not where and he was pacing out in front of them just because she was in london three goddamn weeks ago doesnt mean shes there now a kid with her money could be anywhere in the world and even if she is in london there are what twelve thirteen million people there with her the odds on finding her are shitty i know levine led them into a parking garage neal kept at it so whats the point the point is its your job you do your best you take the money you forget about it cold hey they were walking up the ramps what does ed have against elevators graham asked himself and why do they all of a sudden want their kid back why now why not three months ago when she first took off talk to them they were on the third level the orange one when ed turned around white porsche guys name is rich lombardi he said to neal hes chases aide hell brief you take you to the chases graham tried to look serious neal didnt bother whats all this mission impossible crap ed professionalism right everything you need to know is in the file got allies london address in it fuck you ill need some prep time in the states for what for trying to find out a little about this kid for talking to the boy who saw her little shit like that read the file i already talked to him so go get her then you dont have a lot of time on this thing no kidding so get going graham put his heavy rubber arm around neals neck and pulled him a few feet away you know billy connor the alderman you know how much he takes in under the table think about how much a vice president hauls in dont fuck around with this one son see you back in the city take it easy dad neal had taken about five steps away from them when he heard eds cheerful voice hey neal try to bring this one back alive okay the guy in the drivers seat of the white porsche was reading the providence journal when neal tapped on the window he looked about thirty thick wavy black hair tamed by cutting it short brown eyes pressed jeans red sweater and running shoes white socks he seemed confident and comfortable and was probably the kind of a guy who looked in the mirror and said confident and comfortable the guy smiled broadly as he rolled the window down youre neal carey right and if you know im neal carey that makes you rich lombardi hey were both right neal stepped away from the door so lombardi could get out lombardi shook neals hand as if he could pump money out of it i have to tell you were really glad youre on board neal have to tell me he took neals shoulder bag and slung it into the backseat hop in neal hopped in in fact he sunk into the deep upholstery of the bucket seat if chases gofer drives a porsche we hear youre the best hey rich yeah neal want to do me a favor hey youre doing us one right quit stroking me you got it he started the car took a perfunctory glance in the rearview mirror and backed out of the slot i mean the way we hear it if youd been at the watergate nixon would still be president good thing i wasnt there then hey you got that right hey where are we going rich newport you ever been no lombardi wheeled the car into the light traffic he made a few semilegal maneuvers through the narrow downtown streets and then hit the entrance ramp onto i if he was worried about cops his foot sure wasnt well take the scenic route he said the scenic route took them across two bridges that spanned narragansett bay sailboats danced on the blue water welcome to newport lombardi said he turned down farewell street which ran alongside a cemetery and drove on past the quaint houses that had stood since before the revolution the island town of newport had seen many lives having been a pirate haven a fishing port and a home for whalers and sea traders widows walks and carved wooden pineapples attested to the maritime tradition the captains wives would stroll the widows walks scanning the horizon for the sight of a sail that might be bearing their husbands home these stalwarts once home and not having been with their mates in maybe two years would place a pineapple on the front steps when they were ready to leave the bedroom and receive visitors eventually the carved pineapple became a symbol of hospitality or fertility or sexual satiation there was actually zoning in certain parts of old newport that would demand the houses be painted only in colors available in colonial times the bmws could be any color though around the turn of the twentieth century newport became a playground for the old and new rich whose mansions lined bellevue avenue and the cliff walk and were just summer homes these cottages each about the size of versailles were inhabited by their owners for about seven weeks in the short rhode island summer they survived the bitter windswept winters the corrosive salt air and the autumn hurricanes only to succumb to the mundane but lethal assault of the graduated income tax most of the larger places had become museums or junior colleges few survived intact one of the few was the chase home lombardi entertained neal on the drive with a description of allie allie chase he had begun is one messedup kid i sort of figured that out alcohol drugs whatever allie has done it last time i searched her room in dc i found enough stuff to stock a grateful dead concert allie doesnt care if she goes up or down just as long as she goes when did this start when did this start christ i sound like the family physician neal welby md allies what seventeen around thirteen i guess call her an early bloomer if they noticed it at thirteen it means she really started at eleven or twelve neal thought make a list of the best boarding schools in the country lombardi continued and title it places allie chase has been thrown out of shes had at least one abortion we know about when a year ago last march and affairs with at least two of her teachers and one of her shrinks title their book men who will never work again by the way are you telling me all this so mom and dad wont have to lombardi laughed a big part of my job is to spare the senator any embarrassments and allies a big one the biggest cops and reporters i have bullied or bribed by rich lombardi drugs minor in possession shoplifting all gone without a trace congratulations a lot of work my friend still and all i like the kid yeah lombardi looked startled for a second then laughed oh no babe not me i like my job you have a suspicious mind neal yeah well comes with the territory im into it so heres the problem neal we think we have a real shot at the vp thing and after that who knows the senator is of that stature neal trust me on that okay okay right call our movie remember the eagleton conceptually speaking you remember the eagleton thing neal mcgoverns people tab this senator from the showme state turns out his brain runs on batteries the party is a little touchy on the subject now they check these things out a little more closely like a proctoscope so a druggedout boozing teenage thief stands out there we go id think then youd want her to stay disappeared lombardi stopped the car at a gate he pulled one of those garagedoor gadgets out of his pocket and hit a combination of numbers the gate swung open ali baba he said its this postwatergate ethics thing neal everybodys talking values family you have a frontrunner whos been born again although youd think once was enough right everybody looking for mr smith goes to washington shit wed probably run jimmy stewart except hes a buddy of ronald reagans lombardi pulled the car slowly down a long crushedstone driveway flanked by willows the frontrunner lombardi went on dresses like robert whatshisname in father knows best and drags his daughter around all over the place we have more kids in this campaign than in the our gang comedies maybe chase should just buy a dog with a cute little ring around the eye ill make a note but seriously neal we have to have allie back by convention time looking like elinor donahue yeah and quietly neal the press and the party people are going to be all over us he parked the car on the side of the circular driveway in front of the house or in front of part of the house the house was endless like the ancient mariner a broad expanse of manicured lawn led down to the ocean and a private dock and boat house neal saw a fence he assumed screened a pool and a double tennis court grass wheres the helicopter pad neal asked other side lombardi handed neals bag to your basic livened servant who disappeared with it hey rich i have an idea maybe you could make like allie never existedairbrush her from photos steal her birth records kill anyone who remembers her pretty good neal but dont joke like that in the house okay okay senator john chase was one of those rare people who resemble their photographs he was tall craggy and muscled with an adams apple and a set of shoulders that competed for attention he looked like an ichabod crane who had bumped into charles atlas on the road someplace he stalked into the room and headed straight for the bar im john chase and im having a scotch what are you having scotch is fine thank you scotch is fine and youre welcome soda or water neither ice mr campbell in fifthgrade science told me ice melts and becomes water mr campbell wasnt drinking fast enough here you are just because the room was exactly what youd expect doesnt mean it didnt impress neal thought three walls were glassed in and all the furniture was casual and expensive each seat offered an ocean view neal took the proffered drink perched himself on the edge of the sofa and took a sip the whiskey was older than he was a point that chase picked up on right away are you as young as you look neal younger chase turned a chair around and sat down leaning over the back it was a campaign photo of the nononsense legislator getting down to some serious turkey talking i thought the bank would send somebody a little more mature you can probably still trade me in for the toaster or the luggage how old are you neal senator chase how old do i have to be to find her how old did you have to be to lose her chase smiled with all the joy of a dog eating grass rich get mr kitteredge on the phone this isnt going to work out neal finished off his scotch and stood up yeah rich get mr kitteredge on the phone tell him the senator wants strom thurmond or somebody lets just everybody sit down shall we neal looked at the woman who had just spoken and couldnt believe he hadnt noticed her standing in the doorway she was a lovely woman and she stood framed in the doorway just a second longer than necessary to let neal realize that she was a lovely woman shes made such entrances into this room before neal thought she used the door frame like bacall used a movie screen but she was small her long blond hair was pulled tightly back almost prim brown eyes flecked with green smiled at him she wore a black jersey and jeans she was barefoot she walked over to her husband took a sip of his drink made a face and moved behind the bar where she poured grapefruit juice over crushed ice then she sat down on the opposite end of the sofa from neal and pulled her legs up under her nobody said a word during all this nobody was expected to neal carey is twentythree she said to the room at large in a voice that whistled dixie how do you know chase asked i inquired and you dont think hes too young of course i do john i think theyre all too young but what you and i think hasnt worked out all that well has it she fixed her husband with those brown eyes the issue was settled then she turned them on neal ill bet you have some questions for us it was all pretty much as rich lombardi had described alison chase was a brat of the first order a spoiled baby turned spoiled kid turned spoiled teenager and on the fast track toward turning ruined adult bored by age ten jaded by thirteen hopeless by the time she celebrated sweet sixteen alison was the classic case of too much too soon and too little too late child allie had garnered all kinds of attention from the doting parents who hauled her out to perform for dinner guests and hauled her back in when the evenings supply of cute had been played out she made the usual adolescent progression from ballet to horses to tennis and had littered new england and washington with the tattered detritus of dance teachers horse masters and court coaches the proud parents made all the recitals most of the field trials and quite a few of the tennis matches until allie started losing and the fun went out of it as allie grew up john chases political career thrived and the demands of the young congressmans time increased especially when he made the giant step to senator likewise the politicians wife made her obeisance to the junior league and the torturous committees of washington wives who devoted their afternoons and evenings to worthy causes such as saving other peoples children nothing was too good for allie however so off she went to the very best schools first to day schools in dc and later to those new england boarding schools whose role it is to prepare young women for the next generation of committees and as allie had learned young that she had to perform to get attention perform she didbadly because while nothing was too good for allie allie was never good enough for mom and dad not the tentative jete the imperfect seat the lazy backhand that sliced out certainly not the grades that started with bs and made a steady slide to fs as desperate but futile stabs at perfection gave way to sullen indifference and then determined screwups if she could not be the perfect success she would be the perfect failure if she could not be the ideal princess she would be the ideal dragon she would turn her beauty around to be the beast and nobody had intended that to happen not mom or dad not the coaches or the teachersnot even allie what in most girls was adolescent rebellion settled into a protracted war allie against her folks allie against her teachers allie against the world allie against allie she had no real friends just a series of temporary allies and coconspirators she did most of her talking to shrinks then stopped talking to them altogether unless to exercise her blossoming talent for sarcasm and disdain allie discovered early on that the pretty bottles in the household bars and liquor cabinets gave her a powerful weapon in her war against life as she knew it surreptitious sips from guests glasses soon became nighttime raids to snatch halffull bottles bottles that gave her a breezy high to chase boredom away smoothed the anxieties and placed her parents at the far end of a telescope when looked in at the wrong end she met the challenge when mom and dad took to locking the liquor cabinets as willing cohorts at school taught her that credit cards opened doors in more than the symbolic sense and that your basic manicure tools when handled with panache in a manner never described in seventeen will open most of the locks installed to prevent the servants from pilfering later on she discovered the potential hidden in moms medicine cabinet how when you drop a valium in a glass of scotch your afternoon is pretty much taken care of she drifted through entire days and nights without a hassle in sight or a care in the world except how to restock the chemical larder an unusually cooperative shrink bought her story about anxiety attacks and prescribed the stuff for her in nifty five and ten mils and allie became known in the hallways of academia as a girl who could actually give pharmaceutical change then allie went to another doctor and claimed to be really really depressed whereupon the good doctor referred to his pdr and discovered that the treatment for depression was an antidepressant and wrote scrip for it so allie had an unlimited and legally sanctioned supply of speed allie had her dawns and dusks and could swap and trade with her friends teenage boys their hormones bouncing around like pingpong balls in a vacuum sniffed her out as an easy mark allie discovered sex which wasnt so bad except she didnt discover birth control with it and she got pregnant scared enough to confide in her mother allie then made the discreet visit to the discreet office dad is going to have you killed she told the doctor and nurse to keep you from talking after that teenage boys became too immature for allie who made the important transition from prey to predator and found any number of older men willing to be stalked and brought down and it was pathetically easy boring really allie had inherited her mothers hair and from somewhere a pair of blue eyes that shone with life even in the photographs the genetic sculptor had fashioned a classically chiseled face and a form that embodied the current american ideal how could a girl as pretty as you was a refrain that allie heard over and over again after spectacular screwups or misbehavior she was expected to be the prom queen and the sweetheart and she responded to these expectations with an almost savage perversity sex was a weapon sex was revenge so by age seventeen she had done it all all the drinks all the drugs all the boys and all the men and she was so tired of it all so one fine day she looked out her window at the big ocean and decided that the other side might offer something new and she whipped out the old credit card one more time to open the airplane door and flew to paris that was three months ago and nobody had heard from her or seen her until three weeks ago when some kid had spotted her in london the description of allies youth had taken some time and a working lunch had been served by a staff quite used to serving working lunches chicken sandwiches fruit salad wheat crackers and cheeses had been laid out quietly and consumed with no great enthusiasm allies story had a way of sapping an appetiteexcept neals he ate it and enjoyed surveillance work had taught him that whenever food appeared you ate and appreciated it why did you wait three weeks to tell anyone that allie had been spotted the more interesting question neal thought was why they had waited three months to do anything at all but he knew better than to ask that was a question for later if at all we didnt scott did chase said eagerly finding something for which he couldnt possibly be blamed teenage loyalty whatever he came to us just five days ago we went to kitteredge who did scott call you or mrs chase me said liz chase was he a boyfriend just a friend neal picked a stem of grapes from the plate and popped one in his mouth something was screwy here and he just happened to run into allie in london why was he there a trip with his school nice school thought neal whose own class trip had been to ossining anything unusual happen just before allie took off neal asked feeling stupid it was a stupid pat question and usually the kind of information parents volunteered nobody answered neal chewed on another grape to kill time two grapes later he said shall i take that to mean that nothing unusual happened or that something unusual did happen and we dont want to talk about it allie was home for the weekend liz said she just hung around really no mrs chase she didnt just hang around really she flew to paris you see in most runaways there is what we like to call a precipitating factor a fight with the parents a fight between the parents maybe the kid had been grounded forbidden to see a boyfriend had her allowance cut nothing like that said chase he sounded really sure about it too bad it helps if there was if you know what a kid is running from you have a jump on what shes running to but just business as usual more grapes when did you last see allie another stupid pat question saturday night i went to a party a fundraiser liz chase said john was in washington he got home when darling ten i suppose i didnt get in till late i imagine it was after one i looked in on allie in her room she was asleep asleep or passed out chase said i dont particularly care for your attitude neither do i neal answered but were both stuck with it liz jumped in when we got up sunday late allie was gone shed told mariechristine who one of the staff allie told her that she was going for a walk which she did which she did for a second neal felt that he should stand up and pace around the room one of those nobody leaves until numbers instead he sank back into the sofa and said all right so after you have your coffee and omelets and read the sunday times you notice that allie hasnt come home yet then what i drove around looking for her liz said the senator didnt say anything and you didnt find her but i did find the car parked downtown by the bus station so right away i thought she let her thought drop off as if she was trying to think up a new ending from the looks on everyones faces in the ensuing silence neal thought this one could be a four or fivegraper he couldnt take it you thought that allie had taken off again liz nodded she hit him with those brown eyes flecked with green and filled with sadness what are you trying to tell me mrs chase how many times has allie run away neal asked he flipped through the report no mention of previous times swell four maybe five times said lombardi doing his job overseas no no lombardi said quickly twice to new york fort lauderdale once la one time to her grandparents in raleigh liz said that was when we were in washington is allie close to her grandparents allie is not close to anybody mr carey said mrs chase the sun was calling it a day neal watched the ocean turning a slate gray so then you called the cops and the fbi and the state patrol and the national guard i called her school lombardi said as chase turned a deep red and asked to speak to her slick and they said she hadnt come back from her weekend home so then you called the cops and the fbi and the state patrol and the national guard this was called baiting the client and was the kind of thing that got you canned or it could get the client jazzed up enough to drop his guard and tell you something juicy or it could do both or did you call the gallup poll set the hook and yank the line chase came out of his chair like a trout out of a stream listen you little bastard why is everyone calling me a little bastard today darling its all our fault right all the parents fault we gave that kid everything now im supposed to destroy my future for her she doesnt want to be here fine yeah its okay with me too senator but now you want her back in the picture you dont work for me anymore neal stood up i dont work for you period i work for the bank they tell me to go after your kid i go after your kid they tell me to forget it i forget it lombardi got up then liz got up find my daughter it wasnt a plea it was a command it was the kind of command that comes from a beautiful woman the kind of command that comes from a mother it was the kind of command that comes from a wife who doesnt need hubbys okay neal heard it all three ways good old mariechristine brought in coffee and they started again no allie had not used the amex card since buying the air ticket yes she had trust funds from both sets of grandparents but no way of touching the funds without her parents signatures she had her own bank account as well but she hadnt drawn anything from that either so she was on her own financially which was very bad news it meant that she could either beg steal or sell herself begging wasnt very lucrative and you usually had to buy your begging spot from the local thug stealing takes considerable skill selling yourself doesnt and little allie would need a lot of money because drugs arent cheap and the people who sell them are if it was strictly up to me neal said id advise you to clean out allies closets make yourself a nice album and get on with the business of mourning because the girl you knew probably doesnt exist anymore because sometimes its just too late folks the streets take the child you know and turn that child into someone you dont even recognize neal flashed on the halperin kid on that goofy look he had on his face all the time even after may i see allies room now please he asked liz and lombardi took him there it looked like a hotel room elegant sleek comfortable but nobody lived there no pictures souvenirs no posters of rock stars on the wall walkin closet private bath of course bay window view of the ocean this is going to take a while neal said if were not in the way liz answered neal gestured to the bed liz and lombardi sat down and put their hands in their laps neal searched the room it was a relief to be doing something practical something quiet something he was good at he went through the drawers and the closets carefully slowly are you in the habit of searching allies room mrs chase wouldnt you be mr carey but you havent removed anything no neal opened the top drawer of allies dresser and ran his hand along the inside top he felt the edge of the tape and gently pulled it off he smelled the two joints emergency stash he said expensive stuff too money is not allies particular problem in life liz said didnt used to be mrs c searching the contents of the drawer neal asked did you used to take away drugs you found here liz nodded we fought about it what about the prescription stuff same thing once we caught on neal finished with the drawers and moved to the closet allie had a few clothes neal flipped through the dozen or so jackets before he found another strip of medical tape stuck to the inside lapel of a nice little denim job he removed the three joints from the tape and flipped them to lombardi hawaii fourth he didnt find anything else until he got to the portable sony tv he twisted the finetune dial off and found the valium that had been glued to the inside rim not to worry he said they use the same kind of paste you used to make in kindergarten you can eat a quart of it and you wont get sick i never dreamed liz chase was shaking her head youre not a pro mrs chase neal moved into allies bathroom the medicine cabinet alone took almost half an hour and yielded nothing very interesting likewise the underside of the bathtub rim neal emptied the sink cabinet and crawled underneath he found allies major stash in a small plastic trash bag taped to the bottom of the sink jackpot he called out liz chase stood in the doorway what neal sat on the floor rooting through the bag well we have your uppers and your downers and some grass and hash and a little coke my god its not all bad news no needles neal handed her the bag and smiled may i take a look at allies car please its in the garage it had a lot of company there were seven cars in the garage allies was a modest datsun z the others were all sleek little sports jobs that neal didnt recognize that wasnt too hard though neal didnt know too many cars that werent on the irt john was very interested in cars for a while liz explained as a matter of fact so was allie it gave then something they could share i think everybody needs a hobby neal started with the glove compartment just in case there was a note in there nobody had noticed maybe a note that read im in such and such a place and heres my address and phone number he didnt find it he found the usual glove compartment crap a couple of road maps a service manual an open package of cherry life savers lipstick an emergency pack of cigarettes a comb a brush a pint bottle of johnnie walker black he felt around between the seats for she went thataway clues and didnt find any of those either he also didnt find any dope of any kind which sort of surprised him it was dark by the time he finished neal sank back into the bathtub that came along with the guest room he had filled it with steaming hot water to try to ease the ache in his body and his soul the first sip of scotch spread a soothing warmth through his insides and after a few minutes he was able to pick up his paperback copy of the adventures of peregrine pickle and lose himself in the eighteenth century which was his lifes goal anyway he relished the quiet chase and jimmy cricket had headed back to washington for one of those crucial votes the missus was preparing herself for yet another fundraiser for an undoubtedly good cause what had dickens called it telescopic philanthropy although neal had to admit that given a choice between mrs jellyby and liz chase there was no contest anyway shed hoped that he wouldnt mind dining alone he didnt the cook laid on with hopefully unintentional irony a london broil rice and asparagus and followed it up with a raspberry tart neal washed it all down with the appropriate wine and was about halfbagged when he hit the tub after a chapter of pickle he laid the book down and thought things over allie hadnt planned to take off no good doper leaves a stash like that behind if shes thought about it no allie was upset when she left shed made the decision in a hurry impulsively sometime saturday night or sunday morning shed given it a little more thought in the car and taken whatever stuff she had with her but she hadnt gone back to the house to collect anything else which meant she was a pisspoor druggie or she really didnt want to go home also she wanted to stay gone most casual runaways who are fed up with the discipline or bored at home or want attention want to be found consciously or unconsciously they leave clues all over the place they also find that life out there is a lot worse than life at home and they come back unless life out there is better than life at home or life at school which was something hed better look into except he didnt think hed be allowed to the chases had simply withdrawn allie in absentia as it were to avoid a scandal so forget that but it impressed him that spoiled little allie hadnt reached for the plastic or wired for money she was gutting it out and this was a girl who wasnt used to gutting it out so why he fiddled the hotwater tap with his foot he didnt feel like sitting up to reach it and it left his hand free to fiddle with the scotch he wished hed taped the afternoons interview because there was something back there that was bugging him really bugging him and it was rattling around in the dimmer corners of his mind just out of reach neal checked his watch when he heard the knock on the bedroom door it was a few minutes past two in the goddamn morning he said come in anyway liz chase shut the door behind her neal wondered why she was wearing black silk to sleep alone in but that was her business the black turned her blond hair gold she sat on the edge of the bed pulled her legs up underneath just as she had that afternoon and tugged the hem of the nightgown down around her knees then she just sat there looking at him neal had read about this kind of thing in detective novels but it never had happened to him he didnt think it was happening to him now either but his throat tightened up and he swallowed hard nevertheless yeah this is not easy for me she bit her lip and nodded her head several times as if she was trying to make up her mind allie has been with a number of men she said there are worse things mrs chase apparently the senator is one of them whoa allie had left a notein the car where she knew her mother would find it because she knew dear old dad wouldnt come looking it had been going on for years since she was old enough like ten and it had started with fondling and extraspecial hugs and bonus kisses it hadnt been all the time just every once in a while and she had been scared to tell she had tried to tell grandpa and grandma that one time but she couldnt she was so ashamed please mom dont be angry dont hate me she wrote and they had never done you know gone all the way until last night and daddy just wouldnt stop just wouldnt stop just wouldnt and she didnt know what to do she just couldnt face them just couldnt face her mother and so she was taking off for good so lets take another look at little allie who was never good enough but good enough for dad allie who drowned the memories and numbed the feelings and who went out looking for sex instead of love because she didnt know the difference and who maybe had it buried real deep in the past until daddy took her again except this time she was old enough that shed never forget and old enough to know what it meant and you thought you knew this kid neal you thought you had her pegged you never learn do you wheres the note neal asked when liz was finished is it important it will be when i take it to the cops and if you destroyed it mrs chase it makes you guilty of a half dozen crimes i can think of youre going to the police soon as i get dressed you want to come with me my husband fuck him she held up for another second or so and then she lost it suddenly as if shed been stabbed in the heart and the pain had just hit her it seemed like the beautiful face aged ten years in the seconds that she held back the tears and then they came out in wracking sobs my baby my poor little baby she needs so much help she needs me and i dont know where she is i have to tell her i have to tell her tell her what neal asked and if she said something like that i love her he was about ready to smack her in the mouth on top of everything else what she must be thinking i have to tell her at least that tell her what mrs chase she settled herself down he had to give her credit for that she drew herself back from the edge of hysteria and settled down to help her daughter she caught her breath and spoke quietlyslowly hes not her father whoa and double whoa she had turned around while neal put his clothes on and she sat patiently while he poured himself a drink and tossed down half of it if he smoked he would have lit one up does the senator know that allie isnt his she nodded since when i suppose allie was eight or nine we had a terrible fight i threw it at him but you never told allie id been meaning to wheres the note mrs chase in a safedeposit boxmy own smart lady does anyone else know about it no so the senator doesnt know that you know that she shook her head i havent said anything to him about it if i did id have to leave him and if i left him i wouldnt get the help i need to find allie would i no lady you probably wouldnt are you going to the police she asked no because youre right mrs chase if i take this to the cops its all over im off the case the senator is out of office friends loses interest and allie gets to read about it in the foreign edition of newsweek and will bury herself even deeper than she already has no winners so the basic rules apply john chase is a wealthy member of the us senate and he might be president someday and he has money in the bank so he gets to rape his stepdaughter and get away with it and also get someone like me to clean it all up neal carey janitor to the rich and powerful and that son of a bitch is counting on allies shame to shut her up while shes posing for the waltons go to washington pictures and then hell stick her away in some really faraway school someplace maybe one of those swiss jobs and im going to help him do it because its better than having that kid out there thinking shes had sex with her own father and quite possibly dying over it and because i want to finish college one of these days theres something else to think about mrs chase if allie needs drugs and food and shelter and all that and she doesnt have money shell do anything to get it what do you mean you know what i mean allie would never do that yes she would youre doing it im doing it and we aint even haggling over the price neal lay awake for most of what was left of the night he hadnt had dreams about the halperin kid for months and he didnt want to start again but when he closed his eyes he saw the kid again and thought about the ifs if they had only let the kid be what he wasan amiable not overly bright gay teenager if they had treated the case as more than a ground ball and sent two guys instead of just neal if only room service hadnt been closed that night he gave up trying to sleep around five took a wakeup shower said a quick goodbye to elizabeth chase and asked for a ride downtown the driver let him off at an avis counter neal got lost about fifteen times before he found scott mackensens school in connecticut scott mackensen was running to lacrosse practice coach will kill me if im late again he said to neal carey who thought the boy was a little too eager to get going neal looked behind him to the beautifully tended green fields where several boys tossed the ball among them in studied insouciance itll only take a minute neal lied thats worth five minutes of stadium steps scott answered he was tall muscular cleareyed jack armstrong and all that shit but neal saw that those clear eyes looked scared he knew then that there was no hurry later maybe he asked scott waged a brief skirmish with his conscience neal had seen it a few hundred times duty versus selfinterest scott was just young enough that duty had a shot at winning and neal didnt want to push a quick decision he waited theres a coffee shop in the villagethe copper donkey give me two hours scott backed away as he talked you got it neal said as scott turned and ran toward the practice field maybe i should have let the man send me to boarding school neal thought as he walked back to his rented car the barker school looked pretty nice nestled in the rolling hills of northwest connecticut the brochure had doubtless proclaimed and indeed the berkshire foothills framed the sprawling campus neal slipped into the rented nova put it in drive thinking it was reverse and smacked the front bumper into a white post placed there precisely for such ineptitude he hated to drive and had done so only because he couldnt screw graham into making the trip connecticut graham had said in dismissal they got bees in connecticut neal found the copper donkey without major mishap but he took ten minutes to parallel park on the narrow village street twenty bucks had gotten him past that part on the drivers test the village old farmstead was bona fide new england quaint colonial and victorian houses all beautifully kept competed for the oohs and aahs of tourists neal didnt ooh or aah he had his fill of quaint from the plumbing in his building the copper donkey catered to the privateschool crowd the boys came over from barker and the girls from nearby miss cliftons which neal thought sounded like an instant muffin mix but which had been one of allies pit stops on her race through the academic elite he figured that even the patient folk at the donkey wouldnt appreciate him nursing a cup of coffee for an hour and a half so be wandered off in search of a bookstore he found bookes which surprised him by having the good sense to stock john macdonalds latest he found a quaint sidewalk bench and settled down to commiserate with travis mcgee he and travis got through a quick hour with no trouble well none for neal lots for travis neal went into the donkey and got a booth at the back scott arrived almost on time he had showered and changed and looked fresh and even younger in a white sweater stonewashed jeans and brown loafers he looked around for a moment spotted neal then looked around again to see who else was there nobody was sitting down he started right in i dont know maybe i should never have said anything first mr chase then the other guy now you i dont want to get involved with the police i just got accepted to brown im not a cop then i dont have to talk to you no which other guy a big guy kind of young older than you though tall heavyset curly black hair pushy scott nodded real pushy ill kill levine neal thought do you want something neal asked gesturing at the menu ill have some coffee i have an exam tomorrow neal signaled the waitress pointing at his own cup and scott she brought the coffee over quickly i just want to check a few details neal said like what like your whole story is bullshit scott set his cup down what do you mean ive been looking at your yearbook scott track football lacrosse basketball you say you saw allie in hyde park and gave chase no pun intended gave chase nobody talks like that thats the sort of thing cops say when they lie on the witness stand she didnt beat me exactly she ran into the subway the kid was lying person looks up and to the right when theyre telling you something theyre making it up as they go along the subway in hyde park hyde park corner theres a station there a hint of that wonderful teenage defensive whine had snuck into his voice neal didnt answer him i didnt have a token scott continued you mean a ticket yeah okay a ticket neal played with the salt and pepper shakers on the table moving them in lazy figureeight patterns im not a cop he said if you tell me thats the story we finish our coffee and its over but well both know youre holding back scott took a deep breath and let it out in a long sigh you wont tell anyone the dean of admissions will never hear it from me if this ever got out it wont a friend and ihe doesnt go to this schoolstayed over a few days after the school trip we got kidding around one night go ahead we called one of those services you know they have phone numbers in the paper we called one of them neals heart bounced and they sent a couple of ladies over he said yeah and did you yeah and was one of them allie chase scott looked shocked no no way really okay okay i believe you after we we got talking a little and we asked these girls if they knew where we could get some hash this last tidbit came out in a rush and neal could see the kid relax hey scott ill bet they knew huh yeah he sort of chuckled they called this guy who said to come meet him and you went i know it sounds dumb but it was right out in public right by this movie theater in leicester square we even knew the place because wed seen the new bond movie there where does allie come in she was with him with who the dealer him and two others a guy and a girl did you talk to allie no when she walked up with this guy she was laughing and all but then she saw me and she turned away real quick behind the other girl and they backed off into the alley scott are you sure it was her scott nodded real sure how come allie and i you know wed partied then what happened we bought the hash and took off did you try to approach allie scott blushed her friends were pretty punklooking i didnt want to push it you were right you did the right thing anyway when i got back i thought i should tell mrs chase but i didnt want to tell everything sure so i made up the story about seeing allie in the park how did allie look okay yeah i guess so a little ratty maybe sweatshirt and jeans was she stoned yeah maybe she was laughing a lot what about the dealer what did he look like cool very cool scott smiled some detectives can deal with civilians others cant they get impatient and scream things like cool very cool what the hell does that mean such detectives love to get clothingstore robberies because the witnesses are perfect this fortytwo long in a cheap maroon blazer gray polyester slacks and buster browns comes in and what was cool about him he had real short hair and was wearing a doublebreasted suit with a tshirt he was real slick with the money and the dope like it was all a big joke like he was selling hot dogs or something big guy little about your size biggerboned if he plays football what position is he halfback maybe a small tight end did he have a name not that i heard anything else yeah he had three safety pins stuck through his ear im glad you brought that up scott that might just help identify him three safety pins yeah answered scott with unmixed admiration what about the girls you remember their names ginger and yvonne swell the name of the service you called sorry cmon you do this a lot no we were drunk you know how about the hotel the piccadilly hotel never ask a witness more than two questions in a row he cant answer make sure you pitch him a watermelon every once in a while builds his confidence the gospel according to st joseph graham did the two hookers seem to know allie they say hi or anything i dont think so did the dealer say anything to her no not a word anything else you remember or you want to tell me it was kind of a blur you know neal nodded he knew thanks scott he said going through the ritual youve been a big help can i go hey you have an exam tomorrow scott started to slide out of the booth one more thing neal said realizing he was doing a columbo imitation the hash how was it jack armstrong ailamerican boy grinned primo neals motel room was nothing special but it had the essentialsa bed with a rationally placed reading light a phone within easy reach and a color tv that brought in the yankees game it also had clean glasses neal was feeling semicivilized so he used one of them to belt down three slugs of scotch before dialing the phone ed levine answered after seven rings he said hello with the voice of a man who doesnt like being called at home ed yeah keep your fat fingers off my fucking case neal hung up the phone and sat back in bed as guidry smoked another angel maybe he thought maybe he could find the aptly named alison chase if she was still with this dealer the dealer was a pro no question he had good technique and some connections he screened his firsttime customers coming in and did smalltime courtesy deals for business connections and if he had turned allie on he hadnt turned her overyet definitely a yet because a businessman doesnt waste a commodity as valuable as a beautiful young girl unless he really loves her then it will take a little longer so there was a place to start find the dealer and you have a shot at finding allie a long shot indeed but youve seen them hit before just to encourage him guidry threw a curve that didnt which the batter pulled right and put over the fence as the base runner trotted contemptuously home neal consoled himself with chapter seven of the making of the english working class and another scotch neal spent a very boring day and a half waiting for the fedex package from graham to arrive he killed time with chapters eight through fifteen travis mcgee and mr ed reruns the desk rang him when the package came in it were three xeroxed pages from a rag called the london daily leveller the classified ads for may the night that scott mackensen and his friend had let their fingers do the walking most of the ads were of the for a good time call variety but there were a number of specialty acts motherdaughter teams b ampd mistresses imelda knows youve been a bad boy a wide world of ethnic specialties neal wondered what a full treatment bulgarian hour could possibly entail there were bad little girls who wanted to be spanked first some who wanted to be spanked afterward many had cute names there were three bambis but to neals intense relief no thumpers a goodly number had french names and not a few had threatening ones neal thought that any man dumb enough to call up a woman named stiletto and invite her into his room deserved whatever he got there were also a lot of agency listings most used sophisticated names like erotica and exotica and neal yearned for an agency of frigid hookers called antarctica his personal favorite though was around the world in eighty minutes of course there was no listing for ginger and yvonne sex drugs and rock and roll because nobody ever got that lucky you said last time was it scott mackensen protested over the phone i know im sorry will this really help allie could there ensued one of those long irritating silences neal was getting used to on this gig and not a grape in sight he settled for a bite of his hershey barthe healthy kind the one with almonds i have a test tomorrow scott said i know the feeling kid on what macbeth he sounded mournful ill help you with it ive taken a few exams on macbeth myself really yeah the witches did it scott stared at the ads laid out on the counter in neals motel room he moved his index finger slowly down the page then shook his head sorry he said try again i cant remember jesus christ how many call girls have you been with i was drunk attaboy neal he told himself browbeat a witness whos really trying thatll help im sorry he said were both tired try it this way in your hotel room in london where was the phone scott pointed to a spot on the counter neal moved the phone there and put a chair in front of it okay he said sit down where was the paper okay which hand do you dial with good now look at the paper dont think just point somewhere around here scott said pointing toward the lower third of the first page good now was it the name of an agency or just a couple of girls just girls good good not great but it was progress something to work from scott sank back in his chair and let out a long sigh he was an exhausted kid he looked at neal and smiled we have to stop meeting like this he said neal went for the brass ring hey scott did you take any pictures of these girls neal watched the kids spine stiffen you mean dirty pictures no i mean you tell your friends what you did and they say bullshit and you whip out a couple of polaroids of the girls scott looked him right in the eye and told him the gods honest truth no way just a thought whens your test first period neal whipped through a few of the big themes in the old scottish play discoursed on how many times the word man was used and for extra credit threw in a few notes on the uses of color in the imagery then he sent scott on his way and phoned joe graham neal was at scotts school bright and early first period the kids dormroom door was a breeze one of those springbolt locks that yodel come on in pardner the room was your typical boys school hovel with a sort of dirty laundry cristo effect neal found scotts desk and went straight to the top right drawer the locked one it was a little less friendly than the door lock but opened up after a little persuasion the usual collection of bullshit was in there a bunch of letters from a girl named marsha another bunch from a debbie lots of pictures marsha or debbie with scott on a beach marsha or debbie with scott at a dance just marsha or debbie on a boat just scott on the boat taken by marsha or debbie marsha or debbie posed romantically under a willow tree neal didnt see any of marsha and debbie pounding the crap out of scott he leafed through a couple of penthouse magazines a passport and a brochure on brown university before he came to a thin packet of pictures secured by a rubber band bingo scott and a friend with arms around two girls who were neither marsha nor debbiein a hotel room hello ginger greetings yvonne neal took the best picture and slipped it into his jacket pocket he locked the desk drawer and walked out of the room whistling a happy tune wondering how scott was doing in class joe graham listening from the stairway heard the whistling and left by a side door they met in the parking lot of the post office neal slid into the passenger seat of grahams car so what do you have so important i have to come to connecticut to hold your hand for i have allie hooked up to a dealer name unknown naturally who has friends in the love for rent business i have two working girls names unknown naturally but narrowed down to about twelve phone numbers who know the aforementioned dealer i have skit youre doing okay yeah right do you want to lay the odds on our finding allie chase in london about the same as jackie o peeling my banana at lincoln center neal laid the photo on the dashboard visual aids very nice graham said ive been thinking about something hard to believe allie chase ran before so twice to new york graham pretended to study the picture if id have picked her up i would have told you about it he said so you didnt and i didnt and theres nothing about it in the file at least not in the file weve seen graham perused the picture some more nicelooking girls whats going on dad son i dont know i hope you dont dad goddamn i hope you dont a few weeks and a few jobs after neal had started working for graham he answered a knock on the door to find the gremlin standing there his arms full of packages and a brandnew mop and broom clutched in one hand whats this neal asked im fine thank you how are you your mother home not lately graham brushed him aside and stepped in you live in a toilet a toilet its the maids year off graham swept off some garbage from the kitchen counter and set the packages down were going to fix that you buy me this stuff no you bought you this stuff i took it out of your pay for the last job you better be kidding me man this said graham with an appropriate flourish is a mop you use it to clean floors just give me the money this is a broom you also use it to clean floors graham said looking around although maybe i should have brought some dynamite that morning neal discovered that graham was a firstclass neatnik a psychopathic cleaner of the highest order out of the bags came sponges dishrags dish towels brillo pads bug spray disinfectant lemon oil windex paper towels detergent comet cleanser the best dont let anybody kid you toiletbowl cleaner and a package of bright yellow rubber gloves i like things to be neat and clean graham explained at work and at home they cleaned they crammed months of accumulated trash into plastic garbage bags and carried it downstairs then they sweptlike your mother never did the brooms not going to get everything you see so you have to get down on your hands and knees with this brush and use the dustpan then they mopped with graham showing neal not only the correct ratio of cleanser to water but also the proper way to swing the mop so youre not just shoving the dirt around this was followed by scrubbing waxing polishing disinfecting and scraping until neal carey was tired irritable aching sore and living in an immaculate apartment and how long you think its gonna stay this way once my mother gets home neal demanded you keep it this way another thing you eat like shit i eat okay candy bars sugar pops i like candy bars and sugar pops theres another bag in the hall get it yes sir neal returned with the bag and asked what is all this stuff graham removed the contents a frying pan a pot a pot holder two plates two forks two spoons two knives one can opener i got a can opener a spatula eggs bread butter dinty moore beef stew a jar of peanut butter a jar of grape jelly some spaghetti these things are called vegetables you will learn to like them no way or i will break your face i will bring more next week every thursday we are going to have a cooking lesson youre talking we you better bring a friend or youre fired you think youre the only underage undersized sneak thief in new york not the only just the best then you had better get yourself some pride kid because you live like an animal your mother doesnt take care of you so youd better learn to take care of yourself or you cant work for me he worked and learned easy stuff at first like tailing someone from a distance how to keep an eye on the guy without looking as if he was looking first thing you look at are the shoes neal the shoes graham told him during one of the many sidewalk lectures two reasons one you can always spot him in a crowd two the guy turns around and spots you youre looking down not right into his baby blues they practiced that for a week neal following graham down broadway on the subway on the bus down crowded streets down nearly empty ones one day tailing graham east on fiftyseventh neal was concentrating so hard on grahams shoes he bumped right into his back now why did that happen graham asked him i dunno good answer exactly you dont know the pace neal you have to watch the pace everybody has a different stridelong short slow fast i shortened my steps i kept walking just as fast but i shortened my stride i took smaller steps i made you bump into me the first block or so youre tailing measure the guys step against the cracks in the sidewalk what is it step step and a half to each crack count it off is it slow or fast its like music so sing to yourself if you have to keep time another good reason to match his step is he cant hear you so easy a guy who knows how to shake a tail is going to listen as well as look hell hear the difference in walking sounds and if he hears one sound too long hell know hes pulling a caboose so its like you imagine hes got paint on his shoes and you walk in his footprints so they spent a week with neal following graham and matching his pace and his stride graham would take the kid along crowded streets and then suddenly down empty ones where the boys every footfall would echo in his own ears youre tailing an amateur it doesnt matter neal save your energy and just stay out of sight but a pro its like its a habit with him to mix up his walk slow and fast and slow again hes going to play simon says take one giant step one baby step they went at it again a solid month of tailing after the first week graham knew that neal was the most talented prospect he had ever seenfast canny and the lucky owner of a set of looks that was quite literally unremarkable graham worked him hard leading him on chases down the shoppers paradise of fifth avenue where every store window offered a reflection onto subway trains into coffee shops movie theaters and mens rooms through the parks and the alleys at first the kid was always easy to detect or to shake but after a short time graham found himself working hard to lose the little bastard and then hard even to see him find the blind spot graham told the kid and stay in it for as long as you can whats the blind spot the blind spot the alley the slipstream a spot behind the guy where he just doesnt see you usually its behind him slightly to his left side about fifteen feet back but it depends you know on his height and build thats why its good youre a little shit because it gives you a bigger blind spot to stay in yeah i know what you mean like when youre following somebody and you get into the rhythm and then you feel like youre invisible like the guy cant see you so they practiced finding that spot picking a stranger at random out of a crowd and following him neal got good at it real good and graham marveled at the kids ability to fade back into a crowd to disappear momentarily and then reappear instantly back on the track and a shadow made more noise than neal carey use the crowd graham lectured horizontal too not just vertical because you can get beside your guy if you use the crowd right like try to find a woman with real big ones and get beside her then when your guy turns around hes not even going to see you hes too busy checking out her daisy maes soon neal graduated to trickier stuff today graham announced one time youre going to follow me from the front that doesnt make any sense thats why its so beautiful no one is going to be looking for a tail in front of him graham showed him crossing the street and then crossing back in front of a guy they picked at random graham used store windows and the mirrors of parked cars to follow his man not missing a beat when the man turned into a bookstore off fiftyseventh neal tried and failed miserably losing his mark after five minutes because you didnt listen neal remember what i told you every step is different do the soles of his shoes slap the sidewalk do they click if its a woman wearing high heels thats a different sound maybe the marks wearing sneakers back at it until front following became automatic then they moved on to the east sidewest side where the tail stays on the opposite side of the street why does the chicken cross the road graham asked so the chicken hes following doesnt make him then they went to the twoman stuff relays passoffs front and back doors peekaboos peekaboo i see you you see me but you dont see him and the evertricky fake burn in which you let the mark give you his best move and lose you while your unseen partner stays on the marks relaxed ass neal loved the fake burn loved it with an intensity that inspired him to create his own variation the solo fake burn known in the carey household as neals very own special fake burn you cant have a oneman fake burn graham replied with disgust when neal announced his invention the whole point is that you have two men not necessarily replied neal with a degree of preadolescent selfsatisfaction that might have aggravated a man more sensitive than graham okay graham said im going to walk out this door and be back in two hours and i want you to tell me where ive been and what ive been doing graham polished off his beer and headed out into the street he made neal about twelve seconds later because the dumb little bastard was wearing red socks that could have given ray charles a headache graham made a mental note to correct the kid on that and settled into the not unpleasant task of teaching him a lesson he crossed broadway against the light but stopped in the island noticing with pride that neal hadnt jumped after him then he crossed the rest of the street and ducked down the irt entrance on the uptown side of seventyninth bought a token and walked back up the downtown side sure enough ol red socks was still with him so he stopped at a newsstand looked at a paper reached into his pocket for a coin changed his mind and headed straight back at neal forcing him to front follow for a good fifteen minutes now ive got him worn down graham thought ill finish him off and he checked to see the red socks back in a crowd at the crosstown bus stop he got into the line to board the bus and used the buss side mirror to see the red socks get into line about five old ladies back when it came his turn to get on board he stepped past the door and leaned against the front of the bus until he saw the red socks go up the steps byebye neal thought graham as he stepped out across the street see you later graham ambled along the sidewalk looking back to see whether maybe just maybe the kid had hung tough but no red socks no neal lesson administered the solo fake burn indeed an hour and a half later neal entered mckeegans to find graham occupying his usual spot at the bar you got your hair cut and had a blt at the american the bread was soggy next time tell em take it easy on the mayo graham reached down and pulled up the boys pant leg plain old white socks reversible said neal the key to the solo fake burn is to make one man into two men the first man had red socks the second man didnt the rear doors of buses also help neal carey could follow you into the can and hand you the toilet paper a proud graham told ed levine and you wouldnt know he was there other subjects emerged such as photography it is very hard graham lectured to get the guys face and pecker in the same shot but try because if you just get the pecker the guy will deny its his unless its humongous or dirty fighting the basics of handtohand combat neal are simple forget this karate shit like levine goes in for just pick up something hard and heavy thats not your pecker and hit the guy with it and dont always try to break his jaw like on rawhide theres time for that when hes unconscious hit him in the knee or across the shins the elbow is always nice and thus the education of neal carey continued neals mother was home she looked like shit her eyes resembled blue marbles after a hard days play on the sidewalk greasy brown hair hung uncombed over her face and her skin had the life and luster of chalk she looked just like herself she was happy to see neal baby she said baby you look good mamas missed you so where you been asked neal crossing over to the couch where she sat slumped to give her a peck on the cheek around and about around and around neal heard soft sounds behind the closed bathroom door your pimp here hes not my pimp baby she said hes my manager mommas a little sick baby but shes gonna be better soon why dont you stay this time get off that shit ill help you now isnt that a touching scene neal turned toward the voice to see marco come through the door the pimp wore a white linen suit and a sky blue shirt open at the collar a single gold chain hung from his neck his full black hair was greased and combed straight back he was solid without seeming heavy he held a syringe in his right hand youre neal right johnny say hello to neal hello neal johnny was huge he had both fat and muscle you could land planes on his flattop make pancakes on his open palms neal didnt answer he watched as his mother stretched out her arm johnny took off his belt and wrapped it around the womans arm until a vein stood out clearly marco squeezed the syringe until the tiniest drop glistened on the edge of the needle dont do that neal said quiet neal the doctor is working i said dont do that yeah and we all heard you now shut up neal slipped his hand into his right back pocket and pulled out a metal shoehorn he slid the curl over his index finger and felt the cool metal settle firmly into his palm the wide edge sticking out he waited for marco to bend over to his mothers arms and then he burst across the room lifting his arm over his head he slammed the hard metal edge down right between the pimps eyes marco dropped to his knees as the blood pumped from his shattered nose onto the formerly white suit jesus i cant see i cant see marco screamed as johnny grabbed neal and neals mother grabbed the syringe marco pulled himself up on the arm of the couch felt for the silk handkerchief in his breast pocket and wiped the blood from his eyes his legs trembled as he made his way over to neal and backhanded him once and then twice across the mouth you think youre a man little shit neals mother watched from inside a fluffy cloud as the men stripped her son and held him down on the couch marco had gone at him with the belt for what seemed like a long time when she heard the boys first cry and thought she should go to him but he was so far away ed levine got quiet when he got angry graham was straining to hear him is this dink connected by a thread an uncle in numbers nobody heavy graham had forced the story out of neal who had finally showed up for work two days late and barely able to walk he had gently cleaned the boy off medicating the cuts that threatened to become infected he had seen some beatings as a kid but he had never seen anything like this neals back and legs were a red and purple contour of welts and bruises where the pimp had lashed him with the buckle end of the belt nobody beats on one of my people levine said phone call to mulberry street takes care of him they owe us a couple no this is personal i want him for myself set it up cmon ed levines glare ended the discussion joe graham didnt like it levine had told him to set the guy up and he had set the guy up but he wasnt happy about it standing in a dark alley with a vicious dopepushing pimp and his gigantic thug graham just hoped that ed levine knew what he was doing ed levine was a big guy but this ox with marco was a whole lot bigger wheres your friend marco asked him the pimp still decked out in his trademark white suit was nervous hes coming he better be i dont like standin around when im holdin i dont like standing around period i hear that come on ed thought graham i hope youre not slopping down that chinese food somewhere and forgot about our little appointment marco said you dont mind my friend pats you down not that i dont trust you hey its business right answered graham graham lifted his arms as johnny carefully and gently checked him for weapons the guy is a pro thought graham feeling a little more scared and wishing more than ever that levine had just let the old italian guys on mulberry take care of this hes okay johnny reported smiling pleasantly at graham what happened to your arm marco asked i stuck it someplace it didnt belong hope she was worth it marco laughed graham chuckled politely and made a note to add this to marcos tab good evening gentlemen graham turned with relief at the sound of eds voice and then regretted it levine was dressed in a threepiece gray pinstriped suit what ed are you going to rumble or sell them term life how ya doin asked marco sizing him up this did not look like a guy who would want to buy dope im doing fine levine answered its you im worried about you got no worries about me my friend im legit your health i mean im worried about your health there it was in the air where everyone could feel it somebody was going to get hurt who are you asked marco he wanted to get right to it im the guy whos going to bust you up bad ed answered in a conversational tone before graham could move or shout a warning johnny came at levine from the blind left side with a swooping right hook designed to cave in eds jaw graham watched amazed as levine leaned away from the fist and grabbed the wrist with his own left hand switched his weight to his right foot and kicked low and hard with his left the sole of his foot caught johnny hard on the side of his planted left knee and the sickening sound of bone and cartilage giving way as the giant crumpled to the ground with a scream made graham want to lose his dinner marco began to sweat but forced a smile youre in big trouble sport my uncle sal thinks youre a sniveling little scumbucket at least thats what he said to me at the social club he doesnt like guys who beat up little boys either graham should have known the punk had a gun didnt they all he cursed himself for not having checked him in the endless second it took for the pimp to reach inside his jacket to his shoulder holster levine waited until he saw the muscles in marcos wrist tense as he grabbed the handle of the revolver he waited for the exact moment when the forearm lay flat and tight against the chest then he stepped back on his left foot brought his right foot up level with his own chest and then straightened his leg with a lightning kick that hit marcos wrist like a hammer on an anvil marcos wrist snapped like a dead branch marco stood shocked and stupid his right arm graciously numb and his hand caught inside his lapel at least he understood now what was going on although he couldnt believe this guy was so pissed off about some stupid hookers little kid credibility came quickly with a sharp kick that cracked two ribs and doubled him over in pain he was trying to hit the deck when three fists banged into his face with jackhammer speed breaking his nose and left cheekbone he felt only relief when his knees crashed onto the concrete the alley in front of him spun in fiery red and sickly yellow as he heard the little onearmed guy ask where did you learn that stuff levine was just reaching his stride his breathing even and the slightest sheen of sweat beginning on his forehead chiding himself for getting out of shape he did a reverse spinning dropkick that hit marco flush in the side of the head and sent him flying into an unconscious heap is he dead graham asked i dont think so levine answered he squatted down beside marco and grabbed him by the broken wrist squeezing hard the sharp pain woke the pimp up are you listening to me asshole your career in new york is over you got that marco listened numbly an end to physical pain was the height of his worldly ambitions graham had walked out into the street to fetch a cop who had been guarding the alley for them he was a young patrolman two years on the force and eager for a good arrest hes yours and hes holding graham told him easy felony do us a favor though and just drop the big guy off in an e room and lose him okay you take care of that other thing the kids mother yeah we sent her out on a bus couple hours agooneway ticket the kid wasnt around okay good job go pick up your prize they went into the alley where the cop surveyed the scene one mobtype gorilla lay whimpering against the wall and a very dudedup wise guy with a face that now looked like pie from the automat was kneeling and clutching a hand that was pointed uptown jesus christ the cop said all kinds of alarms going off in his head are you sure this guy isnt connected he got disconnected levine said the patrolman none too gently hauled marco out of the alley graham stopped them on the way out hey he said to the pimp what happened to your arm then he went over to johnny leaned down and whispered in his ear were turning you out for one reason you spread the word nobody but nobody lays a hand on neal carey ever not while im around mister good because hes a friend of the family one afternoon when neal was thirteen graham arrived at his place with two packs of football cards a roll of medical tape and a pair of small scissors he set all this on the kitchen counter and then stood on his toes and inspected the top of the refrigerator you have to clean up here he said youre the only one who ever looks i brought you presents neal checked out the items on the counter and said id rather have playboy graham unwrapped the football cards and set aside the two rectangles of flat powdered bubble gum he dealt five of the cards out facedown like a poker hand and then handed the five to neal look at them he said im too old for football cards graham you too old to get paid neal examined the cards now hand them back neal shrugged and gave him the cards graham merged them back into the rest of the pack played with them for a minute dealt out five cards and handed them to neal neal looked at them and asked so graham opened the refrigerator you got no milk in here no eggs no orange juice so one of the cards was in the first and the second bunch which dont look im gonna go shopping this afternoon i think maybe roosevelt grier you think maybe roosevelt grier it was roosevelt grier roosevelt grier is correct lets play again why graham didnt answer but he shuffled the cards selected five and handed them to neal neal had looked at them for maybe five seconds before graham snatched them out of his hand regrouped the cards and handed them back john brodie graham shook his head matt snell three more guesses you might get it i dont know right answer but not good enough it was doug atkins neal grabbed a small spiral pad and pretended to carefully write out a shopping list okay he said it was doug atkins what difference does it make whats the point the point is in our business you see somebody more than once you better know it point is in our business you better develop an eye for detail quick and accurate the point is in our business you need a memory graham resumed his inspection of the kitchen ill do the shopping you stay here and memorize these cards what do you mean memorize gimme your shopping money neal went into the bedroom and came out with five dollars wheres the rest of it graham asked what rest the cost of living here soda candy bars magazines what happened to that budget we made up its my money give neal came back with another seven dollars and slapped them into grahams hand ill be back graham said yippee graham set the two large grocery bags down on the counter put the perishable items in the refrigerator took the cards from neal and sat down he opened the roll of medical tape cut ten small strips and taped them across the names of the players on the front of the cards then he held up a card in front of neal john brodie graham held up the next one alex sandusky another one jon arnett he got all ten first try no mistakes not bad graham said not bad take another look at them graham said and he gave neal a couple of minutes before taking them back then he taped over everything but the eyes he held up a card to neal george blanda george blanda graham mimicked alex sandusky its george blanda tricky your first guess is usually right they went on this way most of the day graham would place the cards in various groups flash them and have neal recite them in order or show him five different groupings and then ask in which group a particular card had been on and on backward forward and sidewaysuntil neal could answer correctly every time next saturday neals place jimmy orr said graham neal closed his eyes five eleven one eightyfive eighth year georgia gino cappelletti six flat one ninety sixth year minnesota in the picture on the card was he wearing home or away home you sure home home is right yeah i know look graham i dont want to hurt your feelings but football cards are getting boring yeah yeah right

saturdays later neals place i have a new one neal said to graham as he came through the door a new what memory game neal held up the saturday new york times the crossword puzzle graham looked at it there was nothing written in the squares so what youre going to do the puzzle i already did cute neal now lets get to work it was tough graham plunked himself down in the decrepit easy chair you asked for it kid okay twelve down apse where are the answers mondays paper thirtyone across kipling and so on and so forth graham wrote the answers in and checked the papers on monday they were all right graham told ed levine about it and he told ethan kitteredge ethan kitteredge phoned a friend at princeton who came up to new york with a bunch of tests neal didnt want to take them until graham held up three hundred baseball cards and offered the alternative neal took the tests and did pretty well neal and graham had finished a particularly easy job one night an overandout surveillance on a visiting toy salesman who had found his own barbie doll in the roosevelt and who should never have ordered room service when his old lady hears these tapes neal said as they strolled up broadway graham shook his head no well just file the report and use the tapes as backup youre no fun graham slowed his pace tipping neal off that he had something on his mind he wasnt long getting it off neal remember those tests you took that you made me take yeah you did good swell graham made a point not to look at him as he said so youre going to start trinity school in the fall neal froze bullshit i am graham shrugged neal turned to face him who says who says i start trinity in the fall the man says levine says i say yeah well i say no way nobodys asking you neal was angry its a prep school kids wear jackets and ties rich kids go there forget it he started to turn away but graham grabbed him by the wrist and held him still this is a great opportunity for you to be a fag and leggo of me graham released his wrist youre thirteen years old neal you have to start thinking about your future neal stared at the sidewalk i think about it yeah you want to be me graham saw the tears begin to form he pushed on anyway you want to be me son but you cant be you do okay i do fine but you can do better i dont want to be better than you listen neal listen youre smart you have brains you dont want to spend your whole life sniffing peoples sheets peeking through windows we do other things the time we found that old lady who inherited the money the lawyer we caught ripping off that guy that kid that ran away we found im not saying you cant work with me anymore ill always want you to work with me but you have to go to school i go to school graham laughed when you feel like it okay ill go to school i will but not that school the man wanted to send you to one of those boarding schools in new england i talked him out of it talk him out of this i dont want to neal spun around and walked awayfast let mr wizard follow me if he can he thought aint going to any rich little snobby fag school graham let him go let him hide out for a while and think it over he pointed his own nose to mckeegans for a cold one and a shot neal showed up there two days later he found graham sitting on his customary stool neal sat down at the other end of the bar those schools cost a lot of money he said a lot graham agreed time you add in books fucking uniforms all that shit very expensive mckeegan brought graham his pastrami on rye fries and a fresh beer the kid want anything he asked graham the kid doesnt work for me anymore the kid has money of his own neal said give me a coke he would have ordered a beer but knew that failure would be a disaster diamond jim will have a coke mckeegan responded so these books and stuff neal continued where would i get the money you wont let me steal the man will pick up your tab plus your usual pay for jobs also something he called a modest allowance you steal i break your wrists heres your coke mckeegan said shall i keep the change gimme youve been associating with graham too much tell me about it graham took a break from his pastrami he knew he should have had the corned beef the man said something about grooming you for better things whatever that means at first i thought he was talking about a horse maybe he was maybe neal sipped his coke and set it downan expansive gesture he was pleased tell you what ill come back same pay no school mckeegan isnt this kid underage youll never get anyone as good as i am probably not son so so it comes to this graham turned on his stool to face the boy you go to this school or you go your own way neal threw the coke back as hed seen the men do with the real stuff see you around he said and headed for the door you know what i think graham asked as he inspected the pastrami for fat i think you want to go to this school but youre afraid because you think the other kids are better than you are problem was the other kids thought so too neal felt stupid enough anyhow wearing the blue blazer khaki slacks and cordovans with the white buttondown shirt and brandnew old school tie white fucking socks then there was that assignment in mr danforths english class about your life at home neal had scribbled something straight out of leave it to beaver and the class had laughed its collective head off at him and danforth got pissed at him what am i supposed to write neal thought that my hophead hooker of a mother has split and the nearest thing i got to a father is a onearmed dwarf whose idea of a fatherson outing is breaking into somebodys office and lifting files so dont ask me for real life mr danforth because i dont think you can handle reading it any better than i can take writing it settle for june cleaver and be happy or how about the usual jokes your mothers like a doorknob everybody gets a turn your mother is like the union pacific she got laid across the country when these made the rounds neal was the only kid in school who knew for a fact they were true and when the talk turned to family vacations christmas presents brothers and sisters and crazy aunts neal had nothing flatass nothing to say and was too proud and too smart to make things up nor could he invite other kids over to his place because it literally was his placeno momandpop combo cookies on the tableand his place was a oneroom slum neal was a lonely miserable kid then that son of a bitch danforth made him read dickens oliver twist neal devoured it in two allnight sessions then he read it again and when it came time to write about it boy mr danforth can i write about it your other students may think they know what oliver feels but i know what he feels this is excellent danforth said handing him back his paper why dont you talk in class neal shrugged you liked dickens said danforth neal nodded danforth went to his bookcase and handed neal a copy of great expectations thank you neal said neal went straight back to the neighborhood bought himself a jar of nescafe and a halfgallon of chocolate ice cream and dug in to spend the weekend with pip the reading was great the reading was wonderful he was never lonely when he was readingnever cold never afraid never alone in the apartment he returned great expectations with a small essay hed written and received david copperfield in exchange did you like it danforth asked yeah i liked it a lot why i dont know it made me feel he couldnt find the word i know what you mean danforth smiled at him youre okay carey you know that parents night was hell neal dreaded it with a neartangible fear exposure he could hear the taunts that would follow him around the hallways the next day and ever after bastard that night he sat in the back of homeroom as the parents drifted in smiled their dull smiles shook their wooden handshakes feigning interest in their daughters dumb pastels and sons stupid poems he looked impatiently at his watch every few seconds and frowned a where the hell are they frown for the benefit of anybody who might be watching awash in the adolescent conviction that everyone was watching he was slumped so low in his chair that he didnt see her come in but he sure as hell heard her her rich voice dripped class hello im mrs carey neals mother how nice to meet you she was beautiful she made mrs cleaver look like a carhop her auburn hair was perfectly coiffed her gray dress was letterperfect for the occasion brown eyes sparkled at the teacher and as she held her hand out the poor man almost kissed rather than shook it she strode to the back of the room displaying a warm maternal smile as she kissed neal on both cheeks and subtly hauled him from his seat show me everything she said they walked the school together pretending fascination with the various displays she oohed proudly over his prize essay on dickenss london she charmed teachers and parents sipped punch and nibbled cookies she apologized for having to leave so early and swept yea verily swept out the door neal found graham at mckeegans later on where did you get her he asked she was perfect graham nodded for two hundred bucks he thought shed better be perfect youre faginesque you know that neal asked graham they were in a dark staircase in neals building what do you mean i like women dont tiptoe you dont make noise stepping on the stair you make it stepping off thats what i mean fagin was a character in oliver twist who taught boys how to steal and stuff i dont teach you how to steal graham didnt have much patience at the moment for this fagin shit he was trying to teach the kid something important you plant your footnot heavy but firmly you step off lightly like you dont weigh anything yeah okay not steal but stuff like this neal planted his foot on the edge of the step the result was an awful screech you want to wake the whole building graham asked always always step to the butt end of the stair thats where its the most solid least likely to squeak also you can feel your way you can feel where the next step is faginesque ill give you faginesque get to work work this evening was learning how to climb stairs without making any noise work was doing it with your eyes closed work was realizing that you make more noise going downstairs than going up so generally speaking you sneak up but run down christmastime graham said as neal practiced his step technique i run out and buy presents for those people who put carpet on their stairs nice people neal agreed going downstairs was a genuine bitch mostly because you cant find the butt end of the step with your toe and youre afraid of pitching forward and breaking your neck so observed neal to his tutor about the fortieth time hed fucked up the maneuver worse comes to worst graham said and it will you get down on your belly and swim downstairs swim try it dont be afraid lie down headfirst and do the dog paddle i cant swim and i dont have a dog neal felt stupid as shit lying down dangling over the stairs youve seen lassie havent you asked graham do like lassie does when she has to save that little bastard from drowning timmy right whatever quit stalling graham put his foot on neals ass and pushed it wasnt so bad when you got used to it neal thought doing like lassie does etcetera he made his way to the bottom of the stairs he asked graham how do you do this with one arm you dont you hire some stupid kid to do it for you he walked over neals back and out the door a couple of months later neal tried to climb through a window and talk at the same time he had something on his mind if i gave you the money would you buy me something graham stood on the fire escape what beer cigarettes rubbers a book neal was backing through the window his feet already in the kitchen sink a book you really want to go through a window like that so you cant see whats in the room awaiting your arrival with a louisville slugger what book neal swedish sex slaves ruby and the firemen like that neal climbed out tom jones he started back through the window headfirst this time tom jones is it dirty dirty enough they wont let me buy it are you really this stupid neal or are we just having an off day going into an apartment window head in the air like a hanging curveball you go in like that you come out on a stretcher anyones home neal eased his way out so will you whats so important about this book david copperfield read it when he was a kid you know david copperfield yes i know david copperfield i saw it twice freddie bartholomew and w c fields really w c fields whod he play i dont know guy who was always broke owed money mr micawber yeah okay now will mr carey please show me the correct way to enter a domicile via a window if this literary discussion is over or shall i pour tea i dont know what dont you know the correct way to enter a domicile via a window why didnt you ask feetfirst facing the window and swing through like youre on the monkey bars then walk purposefully through the kitchen and down the hallway and into the bedroom which will be on your right dont tiptoe tiptoes are for ballerinas and guys who go to jail for b amp e which you are neither first thing grab something that looks pawnable and put it in your pocket if someone is there and you cant get out dont fight let him grab you and call the cops levine will be right there to arrest you so youre in the bedroom and the guy is asleep you put his watch in your pocket and place this nice little mike under the side table put the watch back i said put the watch back now go out the way you came in easier than maloneys sister your old dad taught you well home now for a swansons tv dinner and a book thus neal carey grew up and learned a useful trade today said joe graham with his brightest nasty smile we are going to play a game swell said sixteenyearold neal who possessed that finely tuned sixteenyearold sense of sarcasm they were sitting in grahams apartment on twentysixth street between second and third the place looked like an operating room only smaller the countertop of the efficiency kitchen glistened and the sink and tap handles shone as brightly as the soul of a sevenyearold catholic girl leaving confession neal could not figure out how a onearmed man could make a bed with hospital corners you could cut yourself on the bathroom contained a toilet that begged sunglasses a similarly shimmering sink and a showerno bath i dont like lying around in dirty water graham had moved in ten years ago because it was an upwardly mobile irish neighborhood he had failed to discern that all the upwardly mobile irish were moving to queens they came back to the neighborhood only on saturday nights to sit in a local tavern and listen to songs about killing englishmen sanguinary concerts punctuated by maudlin renditions of the dreaded danny boy on this particular saturday an unseasonably warm autumn afternoon the neighborhood was noisy with the sounds of playing children old couples returning from their weekly grocery shopping and neighbors hanging out on the sidewalk enjoying the sun neal would rather have been enjoying the sun especially in the company of one carol metzger with whom he had planned a stroll in riverside park and maybe a movie instead he was cooped up in grahams stuffy shrine to brillo about to play a game the game is called hideandgofuckyourself graham announced and the rules are simple i hide something and you go fuck yourself you win can i go now no now let us say i have lost my earring your earring just play the game i have lost my earring it is somewhere in this apartment find it what are you going to do im going to have a beer can i have a beer no you can look for the earring graham went to the fridge and got a cold one then he sat down on a stool by the kitchen counter and turned to the sports section of the daily news neal began to search the apartment if he could nail this stupid thing early maybe graham would let him out of here and he could still catch up with carol metzger the way her brown hair fell on her shoulders made his stomach hurt if i were an earring where would i be he thought this seemed like the most logical way to go about this he looked under the cushions of the small sofa in grahams sitting area good idea graham said there was no earring in the sofa there was no earring under the sofa there wasnt even any dust under the sofa no pennies rubber bands paper clips or toothpicks either neal looked in the seam between the seat cushion and back of grahams naugahyde easy chair no earring the giants are eightpoint dogs tomorrow graham noted at home against the colts you want in neal didnt bother to answer he knew this bit graham was just trying to distract him disrupt his concentration graham continued eight points tempting you can give a touch and still make of course the stupid bastards would find a way to give up a safety in the last twelve seconds and bust your balls wheres the goddamn earring go fuck yourself graham said pleasantly there were far worse ways to kill a saturday afternoon than torturing neal watching college football for example au ugly suspicion hit neal is this earring on as they say your person that would be as they say devious because if its in your underwear im not looking for it graham was tempted to say something about this carol girl but thought better of it sixteenyearold love being a sensitive sort of thing so if i tell you to search my drawers you wouldnt take it the wrong way neal rifled through grahams chest of drawers this wasnt too hard the socks were neatly balled and organized by color the underwear was folded there were little plastic containers for formerly loose change neal got a quick surge of hope when he found the little tray containing cuff links and tie tacks but there was no earring nor was it under the laundered shirts stiff in cardboard and tissue paper nor under the sweaters you told me to search the drawers so so its not there gee neal tried the closet next coat pockets shelves the works in a moment of inspiration he searched the vacuumcleaner bag nothing while he was zipping it back up graham slid off his stool and came over youre going about this all wrong son figures the key to finding an object is not to look for it i can do that graham ignored the remark dont search for the object search the space dont run around looking where you think the object might be look at what is got it neal shook his head okay graham said you got the room right thats what is in the room there is supposed to be an earring right thats what might be what are you going to look at what is or what might be what is graham was getting excited right so you search the room thats what i was doing no you were searching around the room neal sat down in the easy chair im sorry i dont get it graham went to the fridge and got out a beer and a coke he handed neal the coke okay you like to read right graham was thinking real hard so when you read do you skip all over the page read a word here a word there no why not wouldnt make any sense so what do you do well you read paragraphs and sentences okay so break the room up into paragraphs read the room now neal was getting excited he didnt quite have it but the connection was almost there yeah but how do you break a room up into paragraphs divide it up into cubes cubes sure it would be squares except squares are only two dimensions and rooms are three dimensions then you search a square at a time search the whole square dont look for the object search the cube if the object is there youll find it if not move on to the next cube that makes sense how about that now find the earring while i finish my beer and look for investment opportunities graham said he returned to his stool and perused the point spreads neal found it in the fifth cube beneath the radiator he held the earring up in triumph graham nodded the cube system is good of course when you are looking for some specific object but its even better when you are just searching for something what do you mean graham sighed in mock exasperation sometimes neal youre sent into an apartment or an office or a house just to see if theres anything peculiar out of the ordinary with the cube system youre unlikely to miss anything like maybe a twelveinch mahogany dildo carved like mount rushmore or something because youre just looking not looking for something and therefore youre not narrowing your vision with preconceptions if you say so son well pick this up next week now get out so i can watch ohio state massacre wisconsin in peace were done neal asked visions of carol metzger dancing in his head for today neal scrambled for the door neal neal stopped in the doorway he knew it was too good to be true graham was probably going to send him out to look for something like a gum wrapper he had initialed and left in times square yeah you got money for the movie how did he know yeah graham extended a tendollar bill youll want to take her somewhere decent afterward get a bite to eat neal shook his head thanks graham but i dont want take it youre a working man you deserve a little walkingaround money take her someplace they have napkins neal took the money thanks graham get out i wanna see the pregame show neal split graham went back to his paper but his mind was more on eileen omalley who had been sixteen when he was sixteen and who had blue eyes that could stop your heart you give good search neal joe graham said one saturday morning during one of their weekly training sessions thanks you read a room really very well this was true neal had just finished searching grahams apartment for an m ampm a brown one the regular kind not the peanut he had found it in less than ten minutes taped in the water tank of the toilet but graham said as neal winced helen keller could come in here know the place was tossed isnt she dead doesnt matter she could still tell this week neal actually had a saturdaynight date a real date with carol metzger so he was in a particular hurry nevertheless he was annoyed that graham was never happy what did he want go search my top drawer thats what he wanted neal went to the drawer and visually divided it into cubes he lifted up the plastic tray full of change saw nothing very interesting and was about to set it down when graham told him to freeze look at the way you picked it up graham said he waited for an answer neal didnt have one he had just picked the damn thing up thats all he shrugged graham continued you picked it up diagonally at an angle i should be shot what the hell difference did it make you have to lift this straight up straight why oh yeah so you can set it down in exactly the same place youre not as stupid as you look of course that would be impossible now practice practice its not as easy as it seems lifting things straight up setting them down im going to practice on a cold bottle of knickerbocker so neal spent an hour and a half lifting things up and setting them down and it wasnt as easy as it seemed he found the best technique was to stand at a little less than arms reach with his elbow slightly bent and wrist cocked downward what about fingerprints he asked graham have you ever thought of that wise guy yeah well if youre tossing an fbi agent you might want to bring gloves along but if you do it right your average homeowner isnt gonna know youve been there never mind think about fingerprints the next thing they worked on were window treatments thats what interior decorators call curtains and venetian blinds and that stuff graham said what do you know about interior decorators theres one lives in this building whose interior id like to decorate god so look behind the curtain there i looked already yeah you looked bad now i want you to look good neal reached for the curtain stop i havent even touched it you were about to pull it back dont pull it back pull it out and no smart remarks neal pulled the curtain out now let go of it neal did and graham asked and it fell back in the same place doesnt matter so much if its a guys place but women notice these things woman comes home and theres a corpse lying on the floor she calls the cops and says theres a body lying in a pool of blood over by the curtain which is out of place now raise the blinds youre going to stop me before i touch the cord arent you yes first lick your finger then do i spin around three times and say theres no place like home graham made a lewd gesture spin on this he said but first lick your finger then which any finger just do it now using the spittle spittle mark the windowsill and match it up with the bottom edge of one of the thingies on the blinds neal did raised the blinds and then lowered them to the exact spot and you thought your uncle joey was crazy same thing with windows up and down right bright boy neal went to the fridge and grabbed a coke so probably the next thing youre going to show me is how to do closet doors medicine cabinets that sort of thing im looking at you with new respect neal now usually this is the stuff that only professionals women and advanced paranoids notice but theres no harm in being careful right i like careful so they went to work on the closet door in grahams bedroom first came a lecture from graham which neal didnt mind as it gave him a chance to sit down and finish his coke graham told him that if the closet was shut it was no issue but sometimes suspicious people will leave a closet door ajar deliberately and then you had to be careful to leave it exactly the same way there were two good ways to accomplish this you can mark the opening along the side of your shoe or you can do what the subject probably did which is to line the edge of the door up with something else in the room usually something on the wall and usually something very obvious hinged doors like this one are trickier than sliding doors why because you have to check both the inside and outside edges of the door against possible marks on the wall and also because its harder to match the exact perspective that the subject used to make the mark youre sharp today this is why i prefer to make measurement from the doorsill to the door because theres no perspective to worry about if its two inches its two inches as you know from bitter personal experience you have to be careful about closed doors too dont you dont people sometimes leave tape or hair or something stretched across the door they do in books and movies a lot yeah and sometimes in real life but yes son youre right it doesnt hurt to check you said that already ill say it about fifty thousand times they practiced being careful for a couple of hours leaving marks on doorsills medicine cabinets windows bedspreads pillows even flower arrangements it was exacting work that demanded precision neal was bushed when they finished so graham asked whos your date with tonight nice try you should tell your old dad these things youll never know why not because youd never shut up about it youd want to know everything is she one of those rich trinity babes i dunno you dunno have you met this girl i dont know if shes rich she was or her parents were anyway their apartment occupied half a floor on central park west neal was nervous this was the first time he had gone to carols home the first time he was to meet her parents shed been after him to do it for weeks you have to meet them shed said if were going to go on a real date you know at night or they wont let me going to her home meeting her parents saturdaynight date it was fraught with peril on several levels it elevated their relationship from the safe status of friends just hanging out on weekend afternoons to boyfriend and girlfriend and the news would be out all over school before classes started monday morning neal wasnt sure how he felt about that scary stuff on the one hand but on the other it was great then there was the parent thing neal didnt have a lot of experience with parents his own or anybody elses he knew from leave it to beaver that parents tended to ask a bunch of questions the answers to which would probably propel them to throw him out and lock carol in her roomwith armed guards carols not quite ready yet her father would say lighting his pipe as he looked neal over from head to toe have a seat young man take that chair there the electric one her mother would hover about nervously smiling tightly while she contemplated changing the locks on all the doors what does your father do carols father would ask raising thick eyebrows hes in travel sir and does your mother work mrs metzger would ask uh yes maam what does she do public relations sales wed like to meet your parents sometime mr metzger would say so would i sir this was going to be a disaster what floor huh what floor do you want the doorman asked the metzgers thats the penthouse swell are they expecting you the doorman asked im afraid so the doorman gave him an ugly look and pointed to the elevator the operator settled for a smirk as he took him up neal took a deep breath in the foyer and rang the bell here we go carol opened the door right away hi she said she looked flushed nervous and glad to see him meet my parents her parents were on their hands and knees on the floor mrs metzger looked up at him neal saw where carol got her looks mrs m was wearing a sequined black evening gown and a lot of jewelry its a pleasure to meet you neal but dont come in any farther please mr metzger clad in a dinner jacket said likewise neal arent you all supposed to be facing east neal asked oh god why do i say these things mrs metzgers contact lens carols father said and were already late mrs metzger said carol looked at him and shrugged i can find it neal said hows that mr metzger asked his hand gently sweeping the thick gray carpet i can find it if youll all stay still carol looked at him strangely less than two minutes later neal held the lens gently on his index finger he had found it on mr metzgers pant cuff neal said mrs m thank you how did you do that practice carols mother looked at her and said i like this one hope to see you again neal we have to go joan my parents like you carol said much later as they were walking back from a chinese dinner after the movie they have good taste my parents the elevator ride lasted about eighty thousand years her parents werent home yet and carol and neal sat down on the sofa next to each other her kisses were delicious and kisses were enough more than enough for this night they were sitting at a proper distance when her parents discreetly rattled their keys at the door i really dont want to be doing this neal said to graham neal was seventeen and there were a whole lot of things he really didnt want to be doing lacing on boxing gloves in a stinking old gym off times square headed the list at the moment however i dont blame you graham answered but its either this or that kung fooey crap levine does the gym was on the second floor of a decrepit building off fortyfourth street and smelled like the inside of a jockstrap that had been left in the laundry bag about a month neal took another look around the room where a dozen or so honesttogod boxers banged on speed bags heavy bags and each other another guy was jumping rope an activity that looked a little more appealing why neal asked do i have to learn to fight at all company rule its stupid the guy lacing up his gloves looked as if he had stepped out of a casting call for darby ogill and the little people he kneeled in front of neals stool and blew cigarette smoke in the kids face its the manly art mick croaked pulling the laces a little tighter for emphasis i never been in a fight yet they stopped to put gloves on graham responded you hang around a scummy class of people okay kid on your feet neal stood up he banged his gloves together as hed seen them do on television the hollow thwump was reassuring take a poke mick offered you dont have gloves on this amused mick he snorted and it sounded like an old steam engine going to its last reward you aint gonna hit me hes probably right graham said neal launched a tentative right that looked like it had all the lethal menace of a kitten swatting at a christmastree bulb mick leaned away from the punch and shot a centerright jab that ended a quarter inch from neals nose keep your left up he said with a measure of disgust aint you never fought nobody i run away yeah i knew fighters like that but the old squared circle gets smaller in the late rounds squared circle cant stay on the bicycle all night thats why i take the subway neal said were gonna have to start from scratch mick sighed so they started from scratch three times a week after school neal reported to the gym to study boxing under the tutelage of mick pugilist he learned to keep his left up to pop his jab to counter hooks with straight rights and to keep his mouth shut and his chin tucked in he learned to do pushups situps and pullups he hated all of it after three months of this mick decided he was ready to spar with a live boxer the great event took place on a saturday morning and joe graham and ed levine came to watch levine wanted to check on neals progress graham averred that anytime there was a chance of neal getting punched he was going to be there to enjoy it the sparring partner was a young man named terry mccorkandale he was from oklahoma had a red crew cut and looked like his mother had conceived him with her first cousin he was a sparring partner of another pro who was a sparring partner of a ranked contender this record gave neal some comfort true the guy was a pro but just barely judging by his record besides which neal was feeling pretty good about his training he was no boxer he knew but he could hold his own he stepped into the ring shook hands with mccorkandale and flashed a quick smile at levine and graham then he assumed his defensive stance and shot out a crisp left jab he woke up hearing mccorkandale pleading defensively i just tapped him honest glass jaw mick asked graham glass brain graham answered what day is it mick asked neal january close enough levine said lets try it again neal was on his feet but not quite sure how he had gotten there he knew he had been humiliated but he didnt mind that as much as he did the physical pain mccorkandale was smiling at him apologetically mick whispered in his ear lucky punch kid go get him neal had an album of the overture at home and the next three minutes were like living inside the drum section the tulsa terror rattled on him like a snare drum beat a few timpani shots and thumped a couple of bass drumbeats before neal could move his hands he could not have been more helpless if he had been tied up in telephone wire he was only grateful this guy wasnt really trying interesting strategy levine observed to graham wearing the guy out like that that neals a terror neal the terror did what he could he started to laugh it was funny to him now that every time he attempted a punch or a parry he got hit with three shots so he covered up the best he could and got pounded on and giggled i gotta stop this mick said hes not hurting him ed said this kids gotta fight tonight he wont be able to lift his arms so levine asked mick while neal was in the shower hes hopeless mick wheezed the worst i ever seen yeah okay no more lessons aw thank god ed i aint got the heart what that kid does to the sweet science shouldnt be done you want a milk shake i can eat solid food i want a cheeseburger neal and graham were at the burger joint of course after the big match neals jaw was a little puffy and he had a black eye that was fun neal i enjoyed that thanks for the afternoon that makes it all worth it graham you did pretty good i think your ribs bruised his hand once i had him right where i wanted him another ten minutes he would have dropped neal checked his face in the mirror on the side wall carols not going to like this are you kidding women love that stuff if you had a broken nose shed propose to you i need an iced coffee for your face it does kind of hurt neal took small bites of his burger the iced coffee came and neal alternately sipped at it and held it against his jaw he felt really tired all of a sudden forget about it guy was a pro neal shook his head thats not it i dont know what to tell carol her parents she doesnt know what you do get real were not the whatdoyoucallit the cia son you can tell her if i tell what i do id have to tell her how i got doing what i do so so shell split and if she doesnt her parents will make her split you got quite a problem there son tell me about it with your head graham tossed a five on the table chucked neal under the chin and left neal sat there for a while and then went home to get ready for his date so a couple of dates later neal told carol all about himself about never knowing who his father was about his junkie mom and what she did for a living about how shed disappeared and he lived on his own and he told her he did some work on the side for sort of a detective agency but how that wasnt what he wanted to do with his life he wanted to be a professor and she hugged him and kissed him and he took her back to his place and they made love and it was all wonderful and they talked about going to college together and always being there for each other a week later carols dad took him aside when he went to pick her up mr metzger led him into the study carol had told them about neals life and both he and carols mother didnt think that she was ready for quite such an exposure to the real world just yet certainly neal could understand and they could still be friends in school neal and carol snuck around for a while she would tell her parents lies and get a friend to cover for her and sometimes she would even spend the night at neals at first it was exciting and romantic but then it got to be just tiring and sad and neal figured that he did enough sneaking around in his life he should be able to love in the open so after a while they became just friends and then not even that one night over a late dinner neal told graham the story and capped it off with his mature judgment you cant trust anyone dad thats not true son you can trust me neal came back from connecticut to an empty apartment it didnt surprise him even though diane had been sleeping there more nights than not lately theyd had one of those quick but wicked fights the morning hed left to meet graham at the train she couldnt understand that anything could be so urgent that he had to miss an exam or that anything could be so confidential that he couldnt tell her where he was going or what he was doing he wanted to tell her that he didnt understand it either but the rules told him to keep his mouth shut am i allowed to know how long youll be gone shed asked id tell you if i knew gee thanks hows the studying going great he didnt doubt it he knew diane was smarter than he was and worked harder to boot she was the star of every class and seminar and so insecure she was the only one who didnt see that theyd met in boskins eighteenthcentury comparative lit seminar just a few weeks after the halperin job hed been reading and drinking more drinking than reading when they managed to contrive a conversation in the hall he took her to coffee and she took him to bed explaining somewhere in there that she had time for a relationship but not for a courtship he found that the pageboy cut of her dark brown hair and the hats and vests and baggy clothes she wore disguised a quite feminine body she made love like she studied with a fierce concentration and attention to detail and she slept right through the nightmares he was having in those days so now he called her room at barnard she answered on the fourth ring yeah hi you missed a hell of an exam might as well get this over with i have to go away for a while he could feel her anger over the phone more secret guytype stuff yeah i sleep with you you know i know so when do i get to know you when do i see the other half whats so bad whats so special about your secrets she asked then added with a small chuckle hey neal you show me yours ill show you mine his chest felt tight it hurt if i show you that stuff youll leave me if you dont show me that stuff ill leave you it hurt a lot more he didnt have anything to say besides said diane im not leaving you youre leaving me can i come over all of you or part of you part of me and fuck you i guess ill see you when i get back he said maybe she hung up good going neal he thought well probably for the best anyway youve raised selfpity to an art form this will give you a chance to create another masterpiece he checked the clock it was he dialed levine at home hi i hope i woke you up not exactly and you answered the phone how is the little woman on top of things what do you want ill need a safe house whats wrong with a hotel it has other guests ill need a safe house neal could hear janets voice in the background a fine whine that had improved with age ill work on it ed said what else cash keep accounts when allie ran away before did you pick her up the pause was just a shade too long what the fuck are you talking about nice try you lying sack of shit nothing listen go back to what you were doing levine slammed the receiver down how come everyones hanging up on me tonight he dialed graham dad son find anything not a thing how about in eds desk zip if we ever dealt with allie chase theres nothing there to show it well thanks for the effort always a pleasure when do you take off tomorrow next day im waiting on some stuff from ed mind if i go back to bed sweet dreams he hung up quickly just to break the pattern neal rooted around the refrigerator until he found a beer hiding in the back he popped it open and drained about half of it in the first swallow maybe if he just showed up at dianes displayed his sweet sad face shed take him in probably not he finished his beer and went to bed the phone woke him early wake up fuckhead levine said what do you want nothing ed said then he hung up the doorbell rang about noon neal was making coffee strong black hangover coffee the kind of coffee meant to bring life back to your fingertips he wasnt thrilled to hear the doorbell maybe it was diane but probably it wasnt he thought about ignoring it until it went off again machinegunstyle as if somebody was leaning on the button joe graham was leaning on the button wakey wakey he said when neal opened the door he didnt wait to be asked in but walked past neal sniffed the coffee and grabbed a cup out of the cupboard he examined it carefully is this clean i washed it personally ill take a chance he poured himself a cup found milk and sugar and poured in a healthy measure of each then he poured another cupblack no sugarand set it down on the counter he lifted his own cup in a toast bon voyage you know something i dont neal took a sip of the coffee and believed once again in the possibility of a supreme merciful god i know a lot you dont know son about everything but i also know that youre leaving tonight at eight oclock graham said he took a ticket packet from his jacket pocket and tossed it to neal i know that some guy named simon keyesare you ready for this hes a safari guidewill meet you at the airport hes going to be gone most of the summer you can use his apartment to detox the kid a safari guide this is getting bizarre graham neal started on his second cup he safari guided the man once friend of the family so to speak guess what else i know decency doesnt allow youre supposed to have the kid back by august first any particular time seriously seriously graham ground his rubber hand into his natural one the way he always did when he was worried this coffee isnt too horrible im surprised they also dont want her back much before august first children should be seen and not heard something like that yeah something like that neal thought john chase is walking a narrow line and he thinks hes the only one who knows it he wants allie back just long enough to play her role in the waltons go to washington not long enough to sing daddys little girl he must want to be veep pretty badly to take that kind of risk today is what may twentyeighth twentyninth twentyninth that gives me something like nine weeks to find her get hold of her fix her up and persuade her to come back and these people want it brought in on the button gee what if i cant the rubber hand was really busy now rubbing away graham didnt like this thing either if you cant bring her in on the date forget it he said forget it graham shrugged it was an eloquent gesture the answer to a zen koan yeah okay neal said i get it allie is useful for a few days if its the right few days otherwise leave her where she is smells right graham said rubbing a sheen onto the rubber hand like a garbage strike in july right graham poured another cup neal saw he wasnt finished with the news what else do you know neal asked your graduassschool thing you can pick it up again graham stirred the sugar in with great care next fall could be worse neal thought they could have just tossed me out but the rubber hand was turning again there was more and he knew what it was if i bring allie back by august first graham frowned and nodded the sound of one hand clapping part two the main drag foggy london town was sunny and hot really hot summer had taken an early jump on spring neal stepped out of heathrows struggling air conditioning into an outdoor sauna a bit on the warm side im afraid said simon were on to having a drought actually everything is turning sort of monochromatic brown i thought it rained all the time here neal said im glad im off to africa where its cooler simon answered neal laughed politely at the joke until simons puzzled expression told him he wasnt joking it is actually cooler there have you ever been no im afraid not simon was an eccentric neal guessed his age at late fifties but knew he could be ten years off in either direction he was tall and angular with an adams apple that belonged to a different species and he walked with that particularly british purposefulness that people find so endearing or annoying with the temperature tilting toward eighty it tended toward the latter simon was wearing a pink striped shirt leaf green trousers paisley ascot blue argyle socks and shoes that looked like moccasins but laced up all this was topped off by a gray head with the odd lock of brown shiny blue eyes and a nose that should have been on mount rushmore except its a small mountain he was a friend of kitteredge had taken ethan and wife on safari and based himself out of london he found very little in the civilized world of much interest and therefore could be trusted never to reveal the story of allie chase he was to be neals london host im off in a week actually but that should give us time i gather im to be your local expert youre some sort of man hunter or some such thing girl hunter actually simon laughed oh yes well done he led them through the maze of parking lots as if they were late for lunch with the queen he stopped on locating a small silver sports car a convertible with the top down this he announced with a flourish is a gordonkeble its nice neal said selfconsciously inane the extent of his knowledge about cars was that they had a steering wheel and four tiresunless left overnight in his neighborhood there were only thirteen ever made simon continued with shy pride i own three of them thats great one of my vices simon confided in a tone more appropriate to a confession of sexual relations with twelveyearold chinese girls dressed up as nuns what are the others other cars other vices youll see simon answered seriously shall we take the keble to town simon tossed neals single bag into a small space behind the seats as neal settled into the car neal sank back in the bucket seat and felt at least two inches off the ground simon turned the key in the ignition and the little car came to life with demonic energy neal had the scary impression that the car had been waiting for this moment it throbbed with predatory vibrations that reached from the soles of neals feet to the top of his hair it hummed like a wolf at the edge of a flock of sheep like the worst boy on the block let out of his room quite a feeling isnt it simon asked proudly yes terror simon drove as if he knew something about physics that einstein hadnt thought of and god never intended if nature abhorred a vacuum simon positively loathed one and rushed to fill in the tiniest gap in the heavy flow of speeding traffic he passed on the right left center and all variations in between and the keble responded as if involved in some kind of blood compact with its human master neal sat as low in his seat as possible and kept his eyes closed as much as pride would allow why only thirteen he shouted over the rushing wind in an attempt to stave off vomiting by conversing after gordon was killed keble just lost the heart for it how was gordon killed neal asked hating himself knowing the answer would make him even more miserable swerved to avoid a grouse and jumped a stone wall landed in a church graveyard convenient that simon crossed three lanes of traffic oblivious to a chorus of blaring horns and curses to take advantage of a twofoot gap created by an exiting car he accelerated up a wicked outside curve dove down the ensuing hill braking just in time to avoid sodomizing a dairy truck slid into the passing lane and floored the accelerator the gearbox sounded like a chinese opera ive had three bad smashups myself simon shouted by way of reassurance one in madagascar laid up for months broke several major bones as the slightly thinning traffic allowed the driver to exercise his full gifts and the cars fiendish potential neal prayed that simons skull wasnt among those major bones pale and sickened neal was plastered to the seat by what he knew could be only g forces and he no longer hoped for survival only a quick and merciful immolation as anxiety perspiration joined the flow of heatinduced sweat and the silver demon sped farther and faster toward a fiery death neal silently composed a postcard to joe graham dear dad having a wonderful time wish you were here simons flat was a secondfloor walkup on regents park road a quiet street not far from the london zoo a good neighborhood for a safe house simon owned the entire house but rented the ground floor to a respectably married gay couple after all simon explained as they climbed the narrow staircase to his flat i spend most of my time in africa so it seemed a bit impractical to keep the whole thing the flat was small a sitting room faced the street and ran the whole width of the apartment a small kitchen ran off this room and the bed and bath ran off the kitchen two floortoceiling windows highlighted the sitting room and a daybed flanked one of the windows simon set neals bag down beside this bed here you are at least until i leave next week i hope youll be comfortable its great neal said then he noticed the walls his jaw dropped simon noticed my other vice he said i like books no kidding the entire room was lined with bookshelves all of which were jammed with first editions a card table in the center of the room struggled against the weight of heavy book catalogues stacks of books sat in every corner and unoccupied nook neal stepped to the nearest wall and stared at the book spines on the shelves a lot of them were nineteenthcentury explorers memoirs burton speke stanleyall first editions then neal saw the volumes of fielding and smollett simon this is fantastic simon visibly brightened you read neal nodded as he stared at the volumes what do you read simon asked this neal answered pointing at the shelves i read this in paperback you can touch them no thats all right they wont crumble in your hands neal was actually afraid that they wouldbooks that precious that old he thought he could spend his whole life quite happily in this room do you collect simon asked im a starving student i thought you were a private eye neal smiled that too and i dont make much money at that either he thought what do you study eighteenthcentury lit odd combination detective and academic a number of wry and ironic responses occurred to neal but he settled for well they both involve research indeed a crowbar couldnt have pried neals eyes from the bookshelf whos your favorite simon asked im doing my thesis on smollett aah thats what everybody says neal thought what they mean is aah how boring simon stepped to the bookcase and took out four volumes he handed one of them to neal and stood expectantly as neal perused it it was a rare first edition first volume of smolletts the adventures of peregrine pickle neal had never expected even to see one of these and now he was holding one simon this is a first edition simon grinned the unexpurgated version but its better than that he gestured with his chin for neal to examine the book handwritten marginal notes neal looked at the notes more closely he couldnt quite believe what he was seeing but it sure looked like old smolletts scrawl he looked up from the book to simon and raised his eyebrows simon nodded enthusiastically from smollett himself great stuff nasty remarks about the real people he was satirizing little asides that sort of thing neals hand started to shake simon is this the pickle there have only been rumors that this existed simon giggled i know this must be worth i paid ten for it thousand yes pounds yes neal swallowed hard the notes in these four volumes could make his thesis hell it could make his career he handed the book back to simon mind you i could sell it for twenty or more i should do really im not all that keen on smollett no offense none taken only a handful of people were keen on smollett professor leslie boskin at columbia university being one of them simon took the volumes and laid them on neals bed i know one collector arthur bloody kendrick sir arthur bloody kendrick who suspects that i have these hed pay a kings ransom mind you why not let him the swine doesnt love books he loves possessing them he sees books as commodities investments he doesnt deserve books simons face flushed with indignation actually you are one of the few people who know that i have these one of the few people who know these volumes even exist im honored you love books i can see that i do hope youll have an opportunity to browse through these volumes while youre here i do hope i will too neal thought actually said neal realizing that hed actually just said actually i have to be going im going to check into my hotel tonight simons face showed his disappointment oh i was hoping wed have a chance to talk about books im heading to my cottage in the country first thing tomorrow just for two or three days before i head to africa are you sure you wouldnt rather come up with me surely you cant be in that great a rush im afraid i am pity the cottage is in the yorkshire moors an old shepherds cot actually peaceful a place you can hear your heartbeat ill leave directions should you change your mind thanks at least stay to dinner we can talk about books dinner was a beefsteak tougher than a jockeys butt vegetables with the taste boiled out of them potatoes tinned fruit a red wine you could walk on and conversation devoted entirely to books neal thought that all in all it was delightful the only thing that might have made it better would have been the presence of professor leslie boskin scholars have been talking about the pickle for years but i dont think it even exists professor boskin said waving his cigarette around he smoked a lot when he was excited and he was always excited when he was talking about smollett neal carey sat there rapt he was a senior at the time an english major and boskin was an academic star neal had chosen columbia university for two reasons instructions from friends and professor leslie boskin the countrys foremost scholar of the eighteenthcentury english novel a famous authority at age thirtyseven he had come out of a nowhere pennsylvania steel town to win a scholarship to harvard which he parlayed into a rhodes his first book the novel and the new reading public redefined the field he was a true eighteenthcentury gentleman he paid his bills shouted his share of the rounds and believed first and foremost in the sanctity of friendship one of those friends was ethan kitteredge who on the deck of haridan had told boskin the truly picaresque life story of his promising young student neal carey not long after that boskin invited neal to partake of a chinese dinner every aspiring undergraduate in the english program knew what that meant an invitation to become a graduate student under boskins wing two years of harassment browbeating nitpicking and slow torture neal was thrilled it was all he had ever wanted he dug into his peking duck and listened boskin was on a roll his black eyes glowed you see smollett struggled for years just to get noticed he had an inferiority complex like a mule at a donkey convention he was scottish he was relatively uneducated in those days surgeons were pretty low on the social scale so when his first novel roderick random came out he thought hed finally be accepted by the london literati boskin paused to lay some strips of duck and some plum sauce onto the pancake and to take a sip of tsingtao but he wasnt johnson garrick all the boys still snubbed him so then he writes pickle and he lets them have it really vicious satire not to mention the lady vane memoirs he throws in for the hell of it imagine it here is the supposed diary of a highborn lady all about fucking around and people are wondering where did smollett get this shit and pickle is a smash the public loves it and hes picked up by london society johnson garrick all the boys neal watched boskin shove a huge hunk of the pancake into his mouth chew it quickly and wash it down with a slug of beer it was true neal thought boskin really would rather talk about smollett than eat boskin set the beer down and continued but now hes feeling badly about all the vicious shit he wrote in pickle so when hes asked to do a second edition he takes most of it out but he has one copy somewhereone copy in which he puts all the notes whos who what the joke is and the truth about lady vane was she his mistress is all the juicy stuff true boskin jabbed his chopsticks into his dragon and phoenix and came up with a piece of shrimp so smollett gets old as do we all so drink up he goes to europe for his health gets a tumor the size of a baseball on his hand his daughter and only child dies life sucks the big one miserable bankrupt he finally croaks in italy but we know for a fact that he had a copy of every one of his books with him when he went for the deep drop so what would the widow do no money no prospects no piece of the rock sell them right all she had to trade on was her late beloveds fame so she sold his whole collection one by one and every other book has surfaced except his pickle the pickle four volumes of literary treasures thats how the rumor started they say its never surfaced because it has all these marginal notes with all the goods on samuel johnson garrick akenside and of course the sporting lady vane any collector any eighteenthcentury scholar would give his left testicle to have a look at those volumes except they dont exist the rest of that duck is yours by the way except they did existin simon keyess apartment neal had held them in his hands books that could provide his future his fortune and his freedom and hed put them back on the shelf the piccadilly hotel was as simple as its name not plain or unattractive but simple in the sense that it knew what it was a good solid place from which to do business tour the city go the theater and take in the sights of london it offered large rooms big beds decent food and room service you could ring up for anything you wanted at the piccadilly hotel the piccadilly hotel knew that people went to hotels to do things they didnt do at home the lobby was large built in the days when people met socially in hotel lobbies it featured a lounge with old wingback chairs big enough to seat peter lorre and sydney greenstreet and a decently dark mahogany bar that was somehow always cool in hot weather and warm in cold weather it was the kind of bar where the men always kept their ties knotted but felt relaxed anyway the kind of a lounge where the barkeep would never disturb you to ask whether you wanted another but was always there with your drink at the slightest glance the lobby ended at the registration desk the piccadilly hotel had too much sense to make a new guest search for the bloody thing and it was always staffed by at least half a dozen redjacketed clerks who knew their business see that the room was paid for and get the guest to it if you made a reservation at the piccadilly hotel you always got a room they didnt believe in overbooking in fact they always kept a couple of rooms saved for emergencies you could stay for a night or a year at the piccadilly hotel the rules were the same you paid your bill and kept your jacket on neal shucked his off the moment he stepped into his room a nice large one on the sixth floor with a small window air conditioner that struggled bravely against the heat he kicked his shoes off on the ubiquitous red carpet and surveyed the room with a consumers eye the blue wallpaper was the color of the sea after a storm and was decorated with prints of heavily muscled barechested bareknuckled boxers toeing the line a manly room the bed had been built in an era when gentlemen kept their riding boots on for afternoon expressions of affection like the hotel it was large and sturdy and proclaimed itself the focal point of the room a small bathroom led off from the right it had a deep old tub an adequate sink and newly refurbished countertops and mirrors one small window broke up the wall and a doublejointed gymnast might have made out the view of piccadilly circus neal gave the bellhop a grotesquely large tip and dismissed him with a whats your name in case i need anything then he carefully hung up his jacketsthe allpurpose nowrinkle blue polyester blazer and the striped seersuckerand his summerweight trousers he laid his folded shirts out in a bureau drawer placed his cheap travel alarm clock on the bedside table and put some paperback books on the lower shelf he carefully laid out his toilet kit on the bathroom counter and took some manila folders out of his briefcase and laid them around the room then placed the british editions of that months playboy and penthouse on the floor in the bathroom after ringing room service for a bottle of scotch and a bucket of ice neal changed into a fresh blue shirt and red regimental tie he knotted the tie then undid the top button of his shirt and yanked the knot down next he lit a cigar puffed on it until it started to smoke and left it burning in an ashtray to stink up the room he overtipped the roomservice waiter poured three fingers of the scotch down the bathroom drain and made a weak one for himself then he sat down with his copy of the classified ads that had lured scott mackensen into the world of bigtime sin and started to dial numbers team number one showed up a half hour later they were each rather pretty the senior member sported flaming red hair freckles and wore a green dress and impossibly cliched black mesh stockings her colleague was a pleasantly plump blond lady neither of them were the ones who had dated scott and friend both of them tensed up when they saw only one man in the room relax said neal i just want to talk dont you like us love asked the green dress just about fed up with freaks neal gave them their standard fee in cash with his apologies and reassurance team number two was made up of two blackhaired blueeyed blackdressed severe types who accepted neals apology and cash with a dry sneer of contempt team number three consisted of two irish girls who were delighted with the money team number four was a pair of positively gorgeous black women and neal secretly felt abashed that his dismissal stuck in his throat for a long moment team number five claimed to be a mother and daughter team and might have been for all neal knew it made him wonder what kind of man would go for a threesome with the older woman and a woman who was at least twentyfive dressed up as alice in fucking wonderland team number six arrived about one and were smashinglooking with a smashing fee but still not the right ladies neal felt he was getting close though and showed them the polaroid hard up are you darling you could say that sorry never seen them if thats it then well just be tripping along are you a frustration freak is that it you dont know the half lady number six offered to perform for him if thats what he wanted number seven were transvestites number eight was a cop an enormous cop his wide shoulders sloped from years of stooping under small ceilings and through small doors his large head was matched by a large nose he had sad cop eyes eyes that had seen it all and wished they hadnt he was wearing a threepiece gabardine suit and refused to sweat neal put him in his late forties may i come in he asked entering sure good cops take possession of a space and this one was a good cop most rentacops shove their id at you but this guy didnt bother he sat down and invited neal to do the same my name is hatcher he said im from vine street station do you know where that is neal sat down on the edge of his bed no its across maninthemoon passage do you know where that is i dont know where anything is hatcher nodded its just outside the kitchen and the laundry do you know why im telling you this yeah i do neal thought you could tell me what you want to tell me straight out but youre establishing a pattern of question and answer not really this hotel does not require a house detective because i can be here on a moments notice i am not the house detective i am a london police inspector would you like a drink i have scotch scotch and water and scotch on the rocks scotch thank you neal poured three fingers into a glass and handed it to hatcher then he sat down again on the bed and waited the hotel staff cannot have helped but notice considerable traffic in and out of your room im looking for a girl apparently a particular girl rather particular indeed mr carey neal shrugged and tried to look stupid it wasnt tough he hadnt figured on a cop stepping into this and you have yet to find her hatcher asked not yet hatcher sipped at his drink but you intend to continue this search for the holy grail yup hatchers sad eyes grew a little sadder then he stared at the floor before staring back at neal it was an old cop move and it didnt surprise neal much it did surprise him that it shook him up a little not in this hotel lad neal stood up and freshened his own drink he held the bottle up in an invitation that hatcher accepted why not neal asked we dont mind a little of the old inandout man but you have them trooping up here at a pace that would do credit to an australian rabbit neal took a chance on getting his ribs bashed in so its not illegal its unseemly so you dont mind guests running whores up here you just dont want to get a reputation for it hatcher shook his head i dont mind guests running whores up here i just want to receive a piece of it neal smiled understand mr carey hatcher said this telephone business tends to cut the lads outthe bellboys the concierge the local constabulary who are coming up on retirement and who arent likely to get that promotion before the pension is set the referral fees are missed what are you suggesting neal could see the cop was annoyed at having to spell it out i am suggesting that you try to exercise a bit of control over your libido and that when the need does arise so to speak you ring the bellboy and if i was looking to get laid neal thought i wouldnt mind at all but my only shot at allie is over the phone he stepped to the door and opened it sorry hatcher ignored the door you dont mind if i have a looksee its your town what brings you to london hatcher asked from the bathroom business you have been busy neal knew what was coming oh dear hatcher said and here it comes hatcher came back from the bathroom holding a plastic film canister its not mine neal said hatcher reached into his jacket and took out a set of handcuffs nevertheless neal held his hands out in front of him to show his spirit of cooperation and said why dont i tell you what im really doing here hatcher was back in half an hour with the hotels telephone records your mackensen lad made only three calls from the room they checked the phone numbers against the classified sex ads number eleven matched neal reached for the phone no longer in service lad i checked already but the next number should be the dealers true but it isnt much help its a phone box in leicester square they were there in ten minutes hatcher pointed to the phone box it was unoccupied your dealer is a cute one he said the girls knew to reach him there maybe he keeps regular hours different phone booths at different times you havent asked me for my advice lad but im giving it to you nevertheless give it up go back to the states and tell your aunt and uncle to forget about their daughter its a fine thing youre trying to do but even if you were to find her youre more likely to get a knife in your innards than get your cousin back youve no business being on the main drag i have to try he gave it a nice touch of nobility suit yourself thanks for your help hatcher smiled forget about it literally neal straightened up the room he picked up the magazines and newspapers and tossed them in the trash bin he opened up a window to let the cigar stench out he rinsed the glasses out in the bathroom sink and then fixed himself a fresh drink while he drew a bath it isnt so bad he thought as he lay in the hot water he didnt have an address but he did have this phone booth or box in the vernacular and the location fits mackensens story and tomorrow ill check it out and find the dealer wholl lead me to allie right except he wasnt there like a roadshow shakespeare when hamlets missed the bus the dealer wasnt onstage when the lights came up and the supporting cast was in place so neal waited for him which wouldnt have been so bad except for the bloody heat neal had learned to say the bloody heat because everybody around him was calling it that in a country where air conditioning is considered decadent and they sell you an ice cube in your drink temps in the nineties were a pain indeed neal sweated through long afternoons in the square he had picked a bench that gave him a nice view of the phone box and its surroundings he also could check out most of the squares pubs movie houses and eateries now a bench in a public park is a jealously guarded commodity so neal was careful not to monopolize his spot and draw unwanted attention from any of the longtimer winos senile pigeon aficionados or schizoid bums for whom the square and its benches were something called home public parks and gardens built by proud city patrons and matrons as a pleasant gathering spot for the upper middle class had long since become one of the few surviving habitats of societys detritus a crucial place to sit or lie down so a regular in leicester square was more or less tolerated unless he caused trouble screaming above the citys natural decibel level pushing the panhandling act too hard with a tourist dealing dope too visibly or whipping out a weapon to lay claim to a spot on a bench were but a few of the offenses that might disturb the sensibilities of the local gendarmerie the serene london bobbies those fabled paragons of patience and civility might drag a repeat offender into a convenient alley or doorway and stomp the bejesus out of him the judicious application of nightstick to shin discouraged recidivism the occasional hard case might require a more thorough goingover and the rawest copper soon discovered that a trip to hospital could keep a nuisance off the beat for weeks at a time neal wasnt surprised to discover that the london cops had their own version of new yorks finests teacher may i technique in which one officer raises the students arm high above his head stretching out the thin sheaf of muscle that covers the rib cage then his partner administers the lesson in one of two modes if he just wants to get his point across he jams the butt end of his nightstick into the students ribs inspiring an instant shortage of breath coupled with a few moments of searing albeit temporary pain but if the teacher wants the pupil absent from class for a few days he swings the nightstick like a jimmy connors forehand at wimbledon cracking the students ribs class dismissed so neal took pains not to attract attention which was more or less his role in life anyway and therefore came naturally anyone who tries too hard not to attract attention almost invariably does this is particularly true on the street where the denizens have antennae finely tuned to the least twitch of the unnatural gesture the only way to be inconspicuous is to be so plainly obvious people dont see you this comes from our cavemen days joe graham had explained during one of the interminable anthropology lectures he had delivered to young neal when we operated under the theory that what isnt moving cant hurt you this was a fallacy of course but thats what they thought because they werent that smart to start with they had about as many brains as your average transit cop anyways they thought until it moves its a rock when it moves its a sabertoothed tiger or something else that can eat us this is why to this day people see motion sitting still they dont see you show me a sabertoothed tiger that can sit still ill show you a fat tiger also a bored tiger neal thought tedium is the detectives most steadfast companion it never goes away for long and it always comes back neal used to chuckle at the detective shows hed see on tv which were twelve minutes of commercials and fortyeight minutes of action he knew they should have had twelve minutes of commercials forty minutes of stupefying monotony seven minutes and fifty seconds of paperwork and ten seconds of what you might call action if you werent too particular about your definition of action not that boredom was necessarily bad on those rare occasions when things got excitingsomeone pulling a knife or much worse someone pulling a gunboredom looked pretty good you could do a lot worse than boredom but it was hard for neal to keep that perspective in june in leicester square in london during the hottest summer in recorded history waiting for somebody who didnt show up who might never show up someone who might have once spent an evening with allie chase and then booted her along her merry way somebody who was a missing link as it were in a very thin chain waiting while the clock ticked slowly but the calendar raced neal had managed to skip einstein but he already knew that time was relative minutes dragged hours stood positively still but days zipped past him like taxis in the rain may was gone june was already a week old and neal was no closer to finding allie and finding her was only the start grabbing her would take time cleaning her up more time and time was a funny thing every hour seemed to take a week and every week seemed to take about an hour he had time on his hands and he was running out of time back in the states the democrats were gearing up for their august party senator chase was polishing the acceptance speech ed levine was sending neal telexes demanding news and neal was sitting on a bench racing toward his drop dead line in slow motion eight weeks now and counting the heat didnt help neals shirt would be stuck to the back of the bench ten minutes after he sat down the crotch of his jeans would cling tenaciously to his balls and his armpits would smell like a mississippi chain gang by noon there wasnt a breeze not the slightest whisper of a cool breeze to break the still and sullen air neal would force himself to get up and move he would sit on his bench for two hours and then walk for one around and about covent garden piccadilly circus soho chinatown some days hed walk down to the national gallery and watch the crowds in trafalgar square hundreds of teenagers no allie mostly he sat however the tiger at work hed arrive on his bench around noon one nice thing about drug dealers are their hours you want to talk to a dealer before noon youd better know where he lives hed plop down on the bench spread his arms out and have a glance at the international herald tribune to check out the baseball standings it took maybe five minutes for the little prickles of heat to start on his arms and back followed shortly by the sweat that would become a trickle and then a stream he had found a cafe by the tube station and it sold a reasonable facsimile of a bagel it became his habit to start his day with a styrofoam cup of black coffee and a plain toasted bagel with butter satisfying himself that the yankees still held first hed scan the headlines then ball the bagel wrapper up inside the empty cup and toss it into the trash basket behind the bench then hed settle in to watch the show he began to know how movie ushers felt when the film had been running for three months the sidewalk vendors already would be setting up their wares along the wroughtiron spiked fence that bordered the square they sold the usual assortment of cheap souvenirs cute little bobby dolls that never beat up raving psychos tshirts with buckingham palace silkscreened on the front buttons that said london undergroundthe usual crap neals own favorite was a tshirt emblazoned with a map of the underground system he resisted buying one there were also the food and drink vendors who peddled warm syrupy cokes soft ice cream that lasted an average of thirtyfour seconds before melting down your wrist thick cadbury milk chocolate bars that melted even quicker and somehow always found their way onto your shirt salted peanuts that only a fargone lunatic would consume in this weather and that were always in hot demand neal craved craved a real new york city street frank one of the ones made from rat hairs industrial waste floor sweepings and god knows what else for which he cheerfully would have slaughtered the queen the closest he could come was a little stand run by some pakistanis that sold a product the locals called the death kabob it wasnt bad really except for being the main drags answer to exlax but it couldnt touch a columbus circle dog with hot mustard and onions spread all over it after the vendors arrived the tourists started in which makes perfect sense if you think about it there were a lot of americans but also great hordes of italian teenagers who always seemed to travel in groups of three thousand and tidy little gaggles of japanese photo freaks neal had never seen an ethnic cliche come to life before but it was really true about the japanese they would take a picture of anything and they all took the same pictures as if they didnt know you could make more than one print from a negative they drove neal nuts he had spent a lifetime avoiding having his picture taken and now he was sure he was going to pop up in five hundred photo albums in greater metropolitan kyoto not that it mattered it was as they say the principle of the thing however mostly the tourists were fellow americans my fellow americans neal thought once flashing on lyndon johnson and mostly they were that middleaged type who want to travel but dont want to leave home so they go to englishspeaking countries you can go to canada only so many times so here they were in london and boy were they surprised london had changed considerably from those great forties movies in those great forties movies people didnt have foothigh purple hair or say fuck every fourth word also it was always foggy and cool in those great forties movies uhhuh and their travel agents had told them there was no crime in london crime was reserved for those vaguely greasy people like italians and french not to mention africans indians and orientalsbut not the english neal sat and mused about crime in england one sultry day as he sat watching a pickpocket make his weeks wages from a single tour group meandering through the square why is it he wondered that about half of all great popular english literature is about crime and yet everybody english or foreign will tell you there is no crime in england the english popular tradition is obsessed with robbery and murder starting with robin hood moving up through dickens then to sherlock holmes and on to agatha christie who had singlehandedly depopulated fictional aristocracy even staid historical works featured setpiece public whippings and hangings and mass transportations to australia and so forth and yet england maintains the reputation for public order and civility maybe neal theorized people figure that england ridded itself through the rope or the longdistance boat trip of its criminal class so now everybody who was left in the country was genetically disposed toward being lawabiding he considered his theory for a while then dismissed it as he watched the pick maneuver toward his next victim neal wondered about a bunch of things as he watched his countrymen absorb the culture of the main drag he wondered how many of them wary of visiting really foreign lands where people spoke a different language and did really strange things realized that a good proportion of the third world had migrated right here to good old civilized london that many of the empires former subjects had taken the phrase commonwealth at face value and decided to try to get a little bit of the common wealth in the heart of the imperial city it was a cruel joke really considering the fact that these africans asians and west indians had created a big chunk of that wealth back in the good old days in their native lands when they bought at inflated prices the cheap consumer goods cranked out in factories in manchester and birmingham and marketed by london firms well the good old days were long gone blown away by the marne trenches and the blitz and the winds of change that had transformed the british empire into the british commonwealth or as some wags would have it the commonpoor neal wondered how many of the tourists would get beyond the artificial mary poppins land of tourist london to go into the brixton slums and notting hill gate hovels or onto the stretch of bayswater road that had become known as little karachi or how many would journey north from london to the vast rust belt of the industrial midlands where the factories had lost their markets or up into the sooty coal towns that made their west virginia cousins look like opryland usa he wondered how a supposedly intelligent man in his fifties could be so stupid as to carry his wallet in his back pants pocket another phenomenon that engaged neal what the hell he had nothing else to do while on this fools errand was the propensity of american tourists to wear clothing extolling the virtues of hometowns they had just paid lots of money to escape it seemed that half the people he observed wore tshirts with slogans such as no place but elkhart and i luv albuquerque or baseball caps proclaiming loyalty to home teams which under further consideration neal realized he understood perfectly after all he was the one who checked the papers twice a day to get the baseball scores and root in absentia for steinbrenners team to win the pennant which even neal acknowledged was like cheering for the nazis to overrun holland he wondered why he was being so goddamn superior to the tourists and their expression of affection for their homes shit he thought hed rather be home too he wondered why though he also wondered where the hell this dealer was and where oh where has my little allie gone seven weeks now and still counting meanwhile the hawkers and the gawkers were always well established by one or two oclock and by twothirty or so the freaks winos druggies and hardcore crazies moved on to their ordained places onstage waiting with varying degrees of patience for the bit players to clear off neal would get off his bench around this time and stroll over to the dilly on the odd chance that allie had opted out of the pro ranks to join the recalcitrant hippies and fake downandout young travel scene that gathered to sit like stoned vultures around the statue of eros these kids sat hunched over checking out the other kids watching the swirling traffic passing the surreptitious joint enormously selfsatisfied with their mass nonconformity allie was never there individual nonconformity being her particular taste and talent neal felt sorry though for poor eros doomed to watch over a mob of kids for whom sex had become so commonplace it was an absolute bore and arent you developing a fine and snooty sense of irony he thought he didnt like himself much these days the futile walk gave him an excuse to stretch his legs and shift the dried sweat around a little and also work up a little fresh sweat his route took him past and all too often into a wimpy bar which brought up melancholy memories of nicks he learned to smother the piece of cardboard the brits called a hamburger with mustard extra charge catsup ditto and salt on the house before choking it down along with the greasy chips which is what the brits called their poor facsimile of french fries after the first week he had begun to vary his route he would walk down st martins lane past the perpetual demonstration outside the south africa embassy over to trafalgar square hed check out the throngs of tourists and school groups milling around nelsons column good old lord nelson who in winning the great naval battle of trafalgar saved england from napoleon and assured the rights of all englishmen to drive on the wrong bloody side of the road then neal would cross over on to whitehall street and wend his way through the crowd on the narrow sidewalk then through horse guards barracks across horse guards road and into st jamess park if there was any spot in london that neal at his most xenophobic had to admit he loved it was st jamess park here was refuge built around a superbly designed manmade lake the park was an oasis of gentility in its finest sense the towers of buckingham palace peeked in the distance over the several hundred varieties of the parks trees neal would stroll yes stroll along the walkway to a large kiosk that sold tea sandwiches and pastries he didnt even mind standing in line at the cafeteria there but would purchase his cup of tea a couple of sugary doughnuts or perhaps a ham sandwich and then walk over to the lakeside here he would rent a chair for ten pence and throw bits of doughnut and bread to the ducks of which there were a stunning variety he was sure he would have noticed allie chase if she had been riding on the back of one of the humongous black swans that glided past him but otherwise he forgot about the case altogether on a bandstand near the kiosk a military band played show tunes and light classics to a crowd gathered in canvas chairs or picnicking on the grassy slope neal who hated military bands show tunes and light classics grew quite fond of the daily concert and was sorry when the ira blew up the bandstand later that summer putting an end to the music and killing two soldiers this was old england neal thought or at least it was what he thought old england might have been or should have been the tourists went mostly to hyde park but st jamess park was usually full of nannies wheeling prams or looking after toddlers government workers from the nearby whitehall ministries on lunch break and retirees for whom a walk in this place was a daily routine after finishing his tea neal would sometimes walk north to the mall up waterloo place to lower regent street and up to piccadilly or he would head south down horse guards road to great george street bridge street nod to big ben then take the long hike up victoria embankment this broad promenade along the bank of the thames was a haunt for some vagrants and kids but it never produced allie chase for him still he made it a habit he preferred active futility over passive futility even if he was breaking joe grahams philosophy of the fat and happy tiger hed get back to the square by or check out the scene and then steel himself for the coming ordeal in the underground each afternoon hed make the rounds of several tube stations during rush hour even amateur unaffiliated panhandlers can make out okay in a big city during rush hour if they have any smarts at all and a nice face allie had both so neal would launch himself on a twohour journey from leicester square to piccadilly change to the bakerloo line and go to charing cross check out the huge station there and then carry on to embankment change to the circle line hit victoria sloane square south kensington and gloucester road there he would switch to the district line for a quick swing to grimy earls court and then carry on up to notting hill gate where he hoped he wouldnt find her and on north to paddington where he would catch the metropolitan line make a quick check of baker street which always brought sherlock holmes to mind maybe he could locate allie and over to kings cross where hed take the long underground hike through the suburban commuter crowds to get back on the piccadilly line have a peek at the covent garden station and then back to leicester square all this in the faint hope that young allie was using some variation of the ive lost my purse and need enough money to get home scam that was a favorite of panhandlers worldwide this tends to work better at rush hour when there are a lot more potential samaritans to bilk and when one is not so obvious to the thugs who control the thriving begging trade a quick panhandler can keep moving better through large crowds and make a fair bit of change even if she couldnt occupy one of the key choke points smack dab in the middle of the traffic flow now there are a number of different strategies in this scam and it really depends on how gutsy you are and how well you can afford to dress if youre really down and out youre better off just asking for subway faresmall changeto a nearby stop because nobodys going to believe you live in the suburbs and need that much more money to get back but if you can get your hands on some better threads you might want to give the biggerticket items a try especially if youve got the nerve to attempt the im from out of town and need five or ten pounds to get home and here is my card with my name and address and ill send you the money first thing routine the truly wonderful thing about the world is that there are people in it who will actually believe this and give the money if youre a teenager and try this pick on women who look like they might have a kid your age because they dont want their own child stranded in the big bad city and theyre afraid not to give you the money or you can go for volume and stick with the triedandtrue buddy can you spare a dime routine but you have to hit a bunch of buddies to make this one pay anyway people would rather be conned even if they suspect theyre being conned because they want you to work a little bit for the money or take a shot at making a really good cardboard sign broke and desperate or hungry and alone always try to go for two bad conditions on the sign though its that and that gives it the poignant quality or maybe allie wasnt begging maybe she was trying to steal in the underground neal hoped this wasnt the case and really didnt expect it to be despite popular legend subways are terrible places to pick pockets picks like a crowd all right but they also like to be able to get away if something goes wrong subways are full of things such as turnstiles gates escalators and narrow passageways that make running damn near impossible add to this the fact that crowds of commuters have been getting increasingly irritated with increasing delays but it was the possibility that allie was finding her daily bread in the underground that sent neal on his daily tour of purgatory it brought to mind a sermon hed once heard when the priest really got cooking on hell about how it was a place where murderers thieves and lechers baked in perpetual torturous stench at the time that had sounded like the west side democratic clubs steam room when all the ryan brothers were in it but now he knew differently neal who had been raised on new yorks subway had never felt anything like londons underground steamy didnt quite describe it neither did grimy or any of the other dwarfs it was killer heat godlike heat allpervasive heat that denied even the possibility of the existence of cool still and sullen heat as if the air itself were heat as if a cool breeze was just a memory of something that once was but would never be again not that there was any room to breathe even if there had been something resembling oxygen the horrific crowding on the cars began to break down even the fabled english stoicism stiff upper lips wilted and that was when the train was moving when it got stuck between stations as it frequently did and a polite announcement came over the pa system the crowd responded with a single groan people dropped their heads and stared at their feet and watched their sweat drip on their shoes then the train would jerk forward again the movement providing no relief except the knowledge that the end of the ordeal was a bit closer except for neal who wasnt riding to get anywhere and who wasnt getting anywhere riding either allie wasnt on the underground no cool breeze no allie six weeks left like aging women cities are prettier at night the softer light shades the insults of aging darkness fades the lines and wrinkles that every good woman and every good city wear on their faces as signs that somebody has lived there if life in the city seems impossible in the daytime at night it is irresistible the night is for playing for dining and dancing for flirting and fucking for making eyes and making love the feet step a little lighter and the blood flows a little faster and the eyes race to the flash of neon blues and reds and ambers set off by the silky soft black of night people do things at night they wouldnt dream of by day they see things differently what was harsh becomes soft sordid becomes colorful whores become courtesans hookers are ladies of the evening light reflects prettily off the broken bottles in the gutters everyone has a bit of the devil in them at night therell be time to deal with god in the morning the barkers stood in soho doorways proclaiming the virtues of nude absolutely nude dancers inside but not one of the dancers was allie and the bouncers guarded the gates to the flashy discos beckoning the pretty and the welldressed and the hip and turning away the rest but none of the blessed or the cursed were allie and waiters served food and drink to the stylish aftertheater couples and parties who mobbed the west end pubs and cafes after the curtains had rung down but allie was not to be found among the servers or the served back on the square neal watched the phone box and every once in a while he would ring the number to see who if anybody answered but it was never allie or her dealer and neal kept watching only at night he watched more carefully he never sat still for long at night when the scent of a solitary sedentary stranger would waft its way to the delicate senses of the larger predators who prowled the night neal knew that the night like most pretty things was dangerous the money stakes were higher for one thing which brought the more serious players out and too many of them were fueled by booze and drugs which lent an ugly air of the unpredictable and neal hated the unpredictable so neal patrolled the area but he kept to the shadows using corners and doorways buying snacks at streetside windows fading to the back of small knots of people as they checked out movie times disco signs and buskers he used all the shading and masking and other subtle shit that graham had taught him and he didnt trust to the cover of darkness darkness covered everybody everybody was the hard core the ponces checked their ladies and the dealers checked their turf and the thugs worked the porn trade and the bodybuilders looked for poofters to roll and the gangs were dangerous looking for an excuse to fight and the schizoids were worse because they didnt need an excuse just the everpresent jangle of the voices in their heads and they were all out there except allie except her dealer they were nowhere five weeks thats how it went for a month neal was left with his slim lead and a bunch of maybes maybe the dealer had fucked up and was in the slammer maybe he hadnt paid his fees and was in the river maybe hed decided on a career change and had taken up actuarial science maybe allie had been with him that one night and that was it maybe all this was futile so neal would sit in his room in the small hours of the morning and choke down his carton of chinese takeaway wash it down with two warm roomservice beers and make his checkin call to graham ask if he should call it quits and come home get told no bitch about it for a minute and hang up take a bath to try to wash off the days accumulation of sweat and sleaze never quite manage it then hed think about calling diane hell he thought one night you have two women in your life and youve lost them both one you cant find and the other cant find you brilliant and youre about out of timewith diane as well as allie so call her and say what tell her all about friends and your fascinating line of work tell her that grad school is finished because youve fucked up the dirty job of finding an abused child and taking her back to her abusive father so hed think better of it try to read give up and drink scotch day after day night after night and the nights were bad worse as the days went by and he hadnt found the kid worse as images of the halperin kid crept into his head when he tried to sleep infecting his thoughts with images of death face it he thought allie could be anywhere she could be sick and she could be hurt she could be beatup aching or clappedup aging junkedup dying dead like the last kid theyd sent him after more and more he went to sleep with the picture of allie in his mind and in his mind she was dead she looked great he saw her reflection first as he was passing by one of the more expensive eateries that flanked the square he happened to glance up and her reflection caught his eye and jerked his head up and around she was inches away behind a pane of glass and she looked great her blond hair glittered from the light of the lamp hanging above her and even in the shadowy light of the restaurant she looked healthy alive at this moment she was laughing she wore a black sleeveless tshirt tucked into black jeans tucked into black ankle boots sort of a demonic female peter pan her hair was cut short and uneven above her ears and her left ear sported a delicate silver chain that hung almost to her shoulder she wore bloodred lipstick she was drinking beer from a bottle she was a beautiful girl having a wonderful time and she was stoned out of her gourd for one awful second neal thought he might actually tap on the glass and yell allie come on time to go home but he backed off quickly found an eddy in the traffic flow and watched he was surprised to hear his own heart beating allie was sitting with three other people one was a young man of about neals build his head was roughly shaved to a stubble and he wore an impossibly filthy tshirt that had been white in a time beyond memory the shirt was torn in several places and the message fuck the world had been crudely stenciled on the chest he had a safety pin jammed through his right earlobe he showed outrageously bad teeth when he grinned which was often as he was pointedly laughing at the witticism of the other man at the table the dominant one the laughter of the fawning ape this one would be no problem a young woman sat beside him she sported an orange purple and yellow crew cut black eye shadow and lipstick and had enormous boobs barely contained in a black leather jacket she was chunky her hips and butt jammed into leather pants and neal could barely imagine the rivulets of sweat that flowed underneath she might have stretched toward attractive but she was pretty enough for the laughing boy who was all over her she could be trouble neal thought but not too much the other man was trouble he was the a male the leader of the pack this was his table his party and his guests his allie he was of medium height wide stocky buildrugby type he wore a pale khaki suit over a plain black tshirt no socks under soft brown loafers a tiny stone that looked like an emerald adorned his left ear and three fresh shallow cuts ran straight down from his left eye to his cheekbone they had just scabbed over and neal guessed they were selfinflicted he was drinking something that looked like a tall gin and he sipped at it as he looked over his glass at allie and smiled he was trouble major league he uttered some fresh snippet of wit that sent fuck the world into a new paroxysm of laughter this was for allie and ftw probably didnt realize the joke was on him one very pissedoff waiter came to the table neal saw from his look that the staff here would like nothing better than to throw this punk quartet out into the alley and maybe set fire to them if the chance arose and they had a spare match but the punks had money and lots of it the manager probably just wanted to get them fed and get them out before the regular customers got the idea that this was more than a fluke the other customers were already getting nervous but looked too intimidated to complain the suit ordered for all four neal stepped back for a minute to think it over he had a choice to make here stand back and follow them or move in following was probably the safer choice there was a small chance that the smart one could make him but he doubted that he could follow them through the night get an address and then make a nice slow move but there was a chance as there always was with a oneman tail that he would lose them and he might never get another shot on the other hand if he moved in unprepared he might blow it for good he took a deep breath edged his way through the crowd on the sidewalk and entered the restaurant the headwaiter greeted him with the wooden smile reserved for lone diners that says i have to seat you but you ought to have gone to a counter where you wouldnt take up a whole table so please at least run up a big liquor tab that smile table for one please yes sir follow me please neal pointed to an empty deuce across the aisle from allie how about that one really sir honest to goodness the man shrugged as you wish sir he seated him at the table and handed him the menu enjoy your meal now what neal thought come on genius what next you could reach over tap her on the shoulder and say gotcha you could explain that youre on a scavenger hunt and you have to bring home a seventeenyearold girl to a vice presidential candidate and get twenty thousand points you could actually smell her perfume which was some wicked variety of musk you could suddenly understand how some poor prep school teacher could steady lad lets take it easy lets wipe the sweat off your palms christ youve only done about a thousand undercovers and the basic rule is always the same get close stay close wait for an opening he studied the menu might as well get a good meal out of this but there was nary a cheeseburger to be found he decided on the lamb waiter oh waiter he heard the suit say so he was local east end but he did a fine parody of an oxbridge twit the harried waiter came over where are our steaks cooking sir did you want them raw when i want any shit out of you ill squeeze your head his eyes narrowed he didnt like being fucked with kill im colin laughing boy said a name colin thank you baby jesus if sir isnt satisfied said the waiter sir isnt leaving if thats what youve got on your mind now get us our bloody food wimpys have better service better food too laughing boy was serious run along colin said laughing boy chimed in dutifully now the shout lifted every head in the place easy crisp said colin theres an art to this eat your salad if you dont i will im starving oh allie if you knew how long ive waited to hear you say that or say anything crisp pushed his plate to her youre always hungry how come you dont get fat yeah colin how come she asked it was a joke between them better living through chemistry love colin said better loving too oh boy have you decided sir the waiter startled him ill have the lamb please and the wine sir you decide thank you sir colin was playing to a full house and loving it he knew just how much he could bait the crowd of locals and tourists without forcing the manager to toss him he had just the right edge loud and sharp enough to disrupt the place putting it to the middle class he was and no mistake well colin asked his mates and anyone within earshot have you ever met a bloke from oxford who wasnt a buggerboy crisp tried to keep up with him have you ever met a bloke from oxford not me i hate buggerboys or do you just hate oxford boys asked allie oxford boys cambridge boys eton boys arundel boys theyre all buttjockeys what they get up to between the sheets when the lights go out would make me mother weep your mothers dead all the same i need to hit the loo allie said again its been a while do i detect a slight tinge of the defensive neal asked himself so go come with me youre a big girl now its the one with the frock on the door you know what i mean their voices had dropped this was private business neal saw that colin didnt like his act interrupted later colin said cmon collie now collie as in lassie as in woofwoof come quick timmy fell down the well cmon please neal checked out her eyes he could never remember whether the eyes were supposed to be the windows or the mirrors of the soul maybe both like those oneway mirrors they use in precinct houses and your finer department stores allies eyes were tilting toward teary moist and soft and neal could swear they had been sharp and clear when he came in a look like that on seventysecond street would draw the sales force for blocks around colin took control have another beer allies fingers started doing a buddy rich imitation on the bottle her nostrils as they say in the romance books flared then she turned on the charm shed learned from mom and dad maybe just a little something for my cold runny nose is it ever thus neal wondered he had a friend at columbia who claimed that life was just a stack of record albums on an automatic drop problem was they were all the same record colin smiled back at her a compromise had been reached yeah those summer colds are always the worst got a bit of a sniffle meself he stood up come on then love you two hold the table eh you can go when we get back the loos were in the basement at the end of a dark narrow corridor allie leaned against the corridor wall as colin screened her from view and held the spoon to her nose she steadied it against one nostril and rested her finger against the other to keep it closed she inhaled sharply and deeply and held her head back while colin carefully dipped another spoonful from the vial in his hand she snorted this one and shook her head gently back and forth colin dipped into the vial again for a quick hit then he ran the little finger of his right hand around the rim of the vial and with his left hand pushed allies shirt up and over her breasts he gently rubbed a little coke around each nipple and bent over and licked it off she bit down on the knuckle of her index finger and whimpered once softly as her right hand found his crotch and rubbed he pulled her shirt back down her nipples stood out against the thin black fabric colin smiled and removed her hand very sexy love very nice now be a good girl and pop back upstairs i have to use the shitter she brushed past neal on the stairway his hand almost reached for her instead he ignored her and followed colin into the gents to find that god had given it to him on a platter colin had draped his jacket over the stall door yes sir the headwaiter asked as neal stood at his station somebody lost a wallet i wanted to turn it in oh dear how good of you sir he looked through colins wallet and managed to mask the flood of what was welling up in his soul yes sir i shall just put it up here until someone claims it neal sat back down colin and company were happily devouring their steaks conversation having given way to gluttony they ate like pigs though so as not to let the side down neal enjoyed his lamb dessert coffee and well see how this shakes out he thought the headwaiter had obviously shared the happy news with the rest of the staff who wasted no time in leading colin down the primrose path of destruction a good waiter can hurry or stretch a dinner with a few chosen words and inflections and these guys were artists they had now begun to treat colin like the duke of toppingonsnot suggesting expensive extras in a tone that suggested that only lowlifes would refuse colin swayed in equal parts by gin beer wine cocaine heady sex and sheer hubris put up a feeble resistance pudding sir perhaps some brandy sir a liqueur for the coffee sir a bill that equals the gross national product of paraguay sir and finally your check sir thanks guy the table was littered with the detritus of a glorious bacchanal that would have done squire weston and his ten hungry friends proud crisp punctuated the trenchermans orgy with a satisfied belch of richterian tenor colin wiped the last trace of his third chocolate mousse off his lips and reached in his jacket for his wallet he reached again then the other pocket then his trouser pockets side and rear he stood up the waiter arched an amused eyebrow that did it some fucking bastard stole my fucking purse indeed sir the headwaiter came over and hovered ostentatiously making dead sure that everybody in the place was watching everybody was a problem sir he asked some groveling whelp of a poxy tart stole my money the headwaiter was nearly delirious with joy we will happily accept your personal check i dont have any bloody personal check oh dear allie chuckled a glance from colin stopped her credit card sir right he lifted me purse and handed me back me credit cards colin shouted crisp got up from the table lets just walk out come to a decent place and its full of thieves the headwaiter was unperturbed how do you intend to settle your bill sir ill come back with the money im afraid that wont do sir im quite capable of paying for it with what is the issue with the money in me fucking wallet now the headwaiter held center stage with generations of music hall behind him he gave a perfect delivery oh yesone two threeyour wallet he rolled his eyes for the benefit of his audience neal heard his cue enter stage left excuse me maybe hes talking about the wallet i turned in the headwaiter turned scarlet and stared at neal his eyes accusing him of base treachery he was trying to decide whether to bluff it out or not there was a lot of money in the wallet neal turned up the heat yeah the wallet i found in the mens room i turned it in to you he put a little extra new york street into his voice for colins benefit what colin stormed the headwaiter didnt take his eyes off neal as he hissed harry did we have a purse turned in ill go look thank you harry i should mash your ugly face in mate crisp said to the headwaiter shut up said colin he studied the headwaiters face memorizing details the purple and orange crew cut was looking around the restaurant making sure that everyone saw their vindication allie smiled behind a napkin the waiter came back is this it he asked he wasnt as good an actor as his boss yeah thats it said colin snatching it from him the headwaiter played it out do you have some identification sir colin flipped the wallet open to a picture of himself happy overjoyed colin flipped some bills on the table keep the change i owe you one guv then he addressed the crowd and to all you happy couples out there i hope you get fucked as good tonight as you got in this place cmon you lot he led his band out of the restaurant yeah okay now what neal thought youve made contact so you have to follow up on it otherwise if you try just to follow them and get spotted youre screwed youve walked through the door so its time to smile and say hello he left a tenquid note on the table and headed for the door the headwaiter stopped him thank you sir for returning the gentlemans purse he said with a smile as cold as his chilled salad forks i do hope we can do something equally helpful for you someday like forcefeed me pate with a coal scoop something along that line sir yes sounds like fun now get out of my way running off to join our new little friends are we sir the waiter wasnt moving and colin and friends were neal also saw that the other muchabused waiter was standing directly behind him attacked by a gang of vicious waiters for christs sake neal smiled pleasantly you know usually supercilious little fucks like you keep people like me out of the restaurant not trapped in it we just wanted to express our gratitude sir tick tick tick every second he stood there dealing with these assholes allie was getting farther away neal wondered whether the police were already on the way oh well what the fuck he thought he crossed his hands in front of his chest and grabbed the waiters lapels then he straightened his hands with a snap popping the waiters stiff collar into his carotid artery the world got all nice and woozy for the waiter who pitched forward into neal neal spun him and handed him to his startled assistant and ran out the door step one he told himself is to get lost in the crowd you dont want the waiter doing any funny he went thataway numbers for the local constabulary step two is to spot colin and the little lost kids before they fade back into a city of thirteen million other sweaty individuals so pick it kid right or left out this door and hope like hell you make the lucky choice neal would rather have licked every toilet bowl in greater cleveland than explain to graham and levine how he could possibly have lost allie chase when she had been sitting right beside him in a restaurant he made the choice to turn left outside the restaurant and plunged into the crowd of tourists who now thronged the street now most people dont know how to get through a crowd but most people didnt spend their entire adolescence chasing joe graham through chinatown on market days and down fifth avenue at christmastime neal silently blessed the malevolent leprechaun as he eased his way quickly through the traffic toward leicester square his best guess and hope as to colins destination he knew that angry people walk fast and that they also tend to go to familiar places to cool off colin was sure as hell angry neal thought hed grabbed a glimpse of crisps head bobbing in the crowd about a half block ahead but then he lost it if colin beat him to the square without neal getting a look at where he was headed it could be all over colin could head anywhere from the south side of the square leaving neal only a guess and a desperate search through the local pubs he quickened his pace finding every hole in the crowd and moving through it he worked his way to the edge of the crowd figuring he could race ahead and maybe even beat colin to the square thats when the cop grabbed him neal stared up at the huge bobby who had thrown an arm across his chest steady lad the cop intoned do you want to get run over neal saw the edge of the sidewalk under his feet and realized that he had been about to step into the street where even now taxis were rushing past his heart slowed to a mere race as he forced a smile and said no sir thank you he thought that hed rather get creamed by the fucking cab than lose colin and allie which was exactly what he was doing they had to be in the square by now and unless they were going there to hang out he might have blown his last chance the signal changed and neal ran across the street onto the broad sidewalk that made up the northwest corner of the square no colin no allie no crew cut no crisp go fish in fact he couldnt see a goddamn thing with all the people out there the unpleasant buzz of panic filled his ears for a second then he had a just might work idea he crossed the north sidewalk walking away from the square and ran up a flight of stairs on the outside of the corner building this was a secondfloor restaurant where a few tables looked out onto the square he walked in the place was packed and there was a line neal sidled his way up to the headwaiter he never suspected that his life would be so much in the hands of londons headwaiters sir said this one in a voice that told neal that these guys must all go to school together perhaps you noticed the people in queue behind you im meeting friends neal said and im very late and do your friends have names sir tick tick tick maybe the old lapel trick lord and lady hectare neal said as he stood on tiptoes and waved to an old couple seated by the window the puzzled old gentleman waved back feebly just in time for the guard at the gate to see bring another chair could you neal said before the waiter had a chance to check his reservation list neal was gambling that the waiter wouldnt fuck around with any friend of the nobility anyway and he headed straight for the table and stood over the couple smiling his most ingratiating smile hello neal said as he peered out the window you dont know me from a hole in the manor wall but i just need to stand here for a moment or so and look out the window he scanned the square from left to right farthest to nearest and perhaps now see here the old man was saying exactly answered neal i thought i saw a very rare bumbaileys pigeon a moment ago land in a tree in the square i just couldnt pass up a chance to spot it and add it to my list a bumbaileys pigeon the woman exclaimed ive never seen one either she turned to look out the window balls the old man said i think its a female actually of course i only got a brief look at it there they were headed down the west side of the square not stopping for anything presenting neal with the perfect hobsons choice he could stand up here and watch them walk out of range or he could run down into the square and lose sight of them i have my opera glasses in my bag the woman was saying neal wasnt listening he was swallowing the bitter taste of fucking it up good bumbaileys pigeon indeed he was about to run for the stairs and give it a futile shot when he heard the sound of drums and cymbals and saw colin and his trio stop dead in their tracks and try to turn around too late a crowd formed in back of them and in front of them were the hare krishnas fifty of them at least snaking their way up the west edge of the square in perfect formation as the lead members started to circle around colin and allie neal smiled a long smile maybe there is a god he thought hare krishna hare hare i think i see it the woman shouted other diners turned to stare at her a bumbaileys pigeon she explained patiently i guess ill be running along neal said thanks he made his way back to the foyer is something wrong sir asked the headwaiter neal looked at him with disgust that isnt lord hectare then he went to join the parade theyre pretty impressive these hare krishnas neal thought as he joined the edge of the crowd of spectators i mean you always think of them as airheads but they know how to throw a parade and colin certainly looks happy trapped in the middle of their intricately weaving patterns and all red in the face and staring at the ground while allie laughs and sings along neal worked his way around the chanting procession to put himself in colins path he found himself standing beside charlie chaplins statue never one to disregard a prop he casually leaned against the statue and faced front watching the hares jingle bang and chant with bemused detachment ultimate cool this also gave him time to catch his breath and stop sweating in streams he was the first thing colin saw as the figures finally cleared the way colin looked out past the last swirling krishna to see neal one foot planted against the statue grinning at him colin didnt believe in coincidence in his business as in neals there is a word for people who do believe in coincidence victims he matched neals grin and walked carefully toward him neal didnt move and the smile didnt fade and colin didnt like that one little effing bit this was his turf neal watched him coming and also watched crisp work his way around to neals left a minor tactical error neal thought as you should always play the odds that your adversary is righthanded and place yourself in position to grab that hand before it can do something nasty to your boss unless of course youre carrying something far nastier and dont mind using it neal pushed that ugly thought from his head and kept smiling as colin came right up into his face neal got off first i liked your alex and his droogs act in the restaurant its no act rugger no offense everybody has an act whats yours he was still smiling but neal saw the edge behind it he wanted to start crying and say it was all a mistake instead he said i steal wallets colins eyes turned killer cold the smile vanished into a frown he shook his head slowly back and forth while crisp waited for the order to bash neals head in neal could see allie over colins shoulder observing the scene with a petulant sneer neal knew he could duck crisps first shot it was the second and third that had him worried never mind what colin might decide to contribute bright idea he thought trapping yourself against a statue very clever colin finally spoke now why did you have to tell me sports fan you had a nice thing going the bit about returning my purse and all and then you have to ball it up and fookin tell me about it neal wasnt sure but he thought the speech had the whiny tone produced by the last straw on a bad day he sensed that colin was more embarrassed than angry and he almost started breathing again on the other hand hed seen embarrassed people do some pretty wicked things what am i supposed to do now eh colin continued youve put my balls to the mark and i should break your thieving fingers eh but im grateful for bailing me out back in the restaurant why do you want to put me in a position like this just bored i guess colin looked him square in the eye either this bloke was crazy or he was the coolest character hed seen since looking in the mirror that morning well rugger he started to say then burst out laughing if its excitement youre looking for beware the hospitality of the sociopath so thought neal carey as he leaned against the brick wall and threw up which started his nose bleeding again it had started mildly enough with a few pints thrown back in a congenial garrick street pub colin played host and introduced neal around starting with his own retinue meet crisp he said we call im at because es always eatin the ruddy things known im arf me life an i dont think i know is real name i play the guitar crisp said pleased to meet you colin introduced the girl with purple hair this is is bird vanessa im always eating crisp she said in a surprisingly middleclass accent and this colin said proudly clearly saving the best for last is alice your fellow yank alice neal thought alice the finest schools america has to offer and thats the best you can come up with he reached out to shake her hand nice to meet you where are you from she didnt take the hand and she didnt smile kansas she said her blue eyes challenged him to call her a liar well dorothy youre not in kansas anymore er name is alice shes from california clever alice thought neal what better to hype the fantasy of a citybound brit than a golden california sunshine girl ive been out there where in california she didnt pause a beat stockton a real shithole neal smiled at her youre not bad allie not bad at all i havent been to stockton she still didnt smile back just looked at him flatly and said you aint missed anything you aint missed anything dont push it kid my shout neal said the barkeep drew four guinnesses from the tap what brings you to london town then neal colin asked what wind blows you to our green and pleasant land a pusher who quotes blake this is getting weirder and weirder work an what would at be im a cop maybe colin didnt exactly choke on his beer but it sure didnt go down the smooth way lord ivey intended when he brewed the stuff it was so much fun to watch neal said a private detective no reaction at all from allie not a flinch get stuffed colin shouted scouts honor im over here guarding some executive stiff whos buying antiques or something an you thought you might as well snatch a little nicker on the side why not an when you saw me jacket anging over the shitter door you thought it belonged to john q tourist but when i saw who it belonged to i thought i better give it back now lets see how big an ego you have neal thought if you buy that one its a good job you did colin said you think a lot of yourself my pleasure neal said looking just enough over colins shoulder to flash his most charming sleazoid smile at allie where are you from she asked she wasnt making small talk new york new york the town so nice they named it twice neal answered he knew that one mistake inexperienced undercovers often make is telling too big a whopper as a cover story keep it close to home theres less chance of getting caught up in your own lies especially when youre just feeling your way the big apple colin said flashing his cosmopolitan outlook allie whispered something in colins ear neal didnt catch it later colin said she whispered again i said later colin answered again a trace of annoyance played across his face he turned to neal you want some excitement then rugger if you have any colins smile could best be described as mischievous oh we got some all right what kind would you like he opened his palm to show the capsules of speed that appeared slick as blackstone this neal thought is the point in the tv episode when the canny private eye figures a way to say no or cleverly palms the pills and fakes the effects but this is mostly because quaker oats is sponsoring the show and wouldnt buy ads if the hero gets stoned for any reason whatsoever unless of course the villains hold him down and pour the stuff down his throat then the camera gets all blurry but this was real life which is even trickier than televisionand often more blurry neal took one of the capsules and knocked it back with a swallow of stout colin spread the rest around lets go to the club allie said i wanna dance and i mean dance wha about your engagement asked colin i have over two hours the club it is then the club was your basic cave only more primitive than neal was used to in new yorks soho if new york was cromagnon this place was neanderthal it didnt really have a name i dunno rugger colin had explained when asked we just call it the club neal did feel he was being clubbed by the band which had a name murdering scum they were an opening act for the nights headliners the queen and all his family what part of town are we in neal shouted above the din earls court colin answered they had fought their way to the bar allie crisp and vanessa had joined the bobbing throng on the dance floor the place smelled of beer and sweat neal took a long sip of his beer which accomplished two things it gave him the closest acquaintance with horse urine he ever hoped to have and it gave him time to think this latter activity was becoming increasingly difficult sort of an imposition the band was playing four hundred beats to the measure colin was in better pharmacological shape than neal and less stoned so the pause in conversation dragged as things tend to do on amphetamine standard time but the ensuing two or three decades gave neal a chance to observe allie which was the point of the exercise after all good to keep your mind on that allie was dancing in a frenzied jerking motion that threatened to tear her head from her body and she was having a very good time the scum as they were known to their friends switched to a romantic ballad about fucking till its red and raw and the lead guitarist seemed to be demonstrating the technique with pelvic thrusts that would have sent elvis himself running to a revival meeting the band reduced its harmonic structure to the sublime simplicity of a single chord which made a certain kind of sense given the subject matter the crowd was sure going for it in a big way though of course most of them had safety pins jammed through their ears or noses which did indicate a tolerance for pain they sweated inside their leather and denim neal watched vanessa and crisp make watusi leaps on the crowded floor every now and again crisp amused a fellow celebrant by spewing beer in his face which seemed to be an acknowledged form of greeting neal looked around for allie and spotted her standing in front of the jerrybuilt platform that served as a stage a sheen of sweat shone off her blond hair as she swung her head in a rhythm all her own slow onebeattothemeasure cadence somewhere in the frenzied rock and roll allie didnt want her love red and raw she wanted it slow and soft beautiful isnt she colin asked he saw neal watching yeah off limits neal no problem not to worry colin old sod neal thought im only going to grab your beloved and carry her back over the big water whether she will or not oh well time to play kind of hard to control though isnt she neal asked alice not hard neal gave him a little more of a prod in the psychic balls if you say so he said smiling he watched the little knots in colins jaw tighten the pimp took a quick swallow of beer and set the bottle down hard on the bar right he said colin worked his way through the crowd to where allie was standing her eyes closed and body gently weaving he grabbed her by the shoulders straightened her up and gently lifted her chin with his left hand she opened her eyes and smiled at him he slapped her hard with his right hand her eyes widened and filled with tears neal checked the impulse to head over there too early for the white knight bit he thought also colin would beat the shit out of you and his friends would stomp on whatever was left colin stroked the reddening splotch on allies cheek then hauled back and hit her again harder this time snapping her head back good going neal thought to himself so far youre doing a real good job for this kid he watched as colin stood hands at his side and stared at allie she fought off her tears as her chin dropped to her chest and she stared at the floor without looking up she held her arms straight out in front of her after a couple of seconds that lasted about a week colin took her arms and pulled her to him she burrowed her face into his chest and held him tightly it was creepy but neal had witnessed worse at westchester cocktail parties what made this especially bad was that colin looked over found neal with his eyes and smiled alice hard to control right now where have i seen this shit before neal asked himself oh yeah about half my life a pimp is a pimp is a pimp come to daddy oops bad choice of words there he looked on as colin and allie started to dance she made your basic miraculous recovery and began to move with the music like bad art imitating bad life the band switched tunes working into a harddriving message song that the crowd seemed to know it was an anthem of sorts neal didnt catch the title but the chorus went burn it wreck it fuck it tear it down the crowd joined in with a passion that could spring only from deep feeling and neal found himself shamed at the condescension hed felt all night this was a song of the dispossessed a screaming angry cri de coeur born of a thousand years of a classbound society the dancers whirled in violent sweeps bumping and bouncing against each other surrogate objects for mutual rage no harm meant you bloke but burn it wreck it fuck it tear it down the inchoate fury swept around neal taking him along he felt their anger shared it anger at the hopelessness at da and granda and you all living off the dole in the same effin project on the same effin street with the same effin neighbors in the same effin heat anger at the toffs with their effin bbc and their effin oxbridge accents that keep out you and me so lets burn it wreck it fuck it tear it down fury at the useless effin effort of it all when every jobs the same arseholelickin beck and call and who needs their labour party and their socialprograms bull so lets burn it wreck it fuck it tear it down neal shook his head to clear it and then realized it was already clear who the hell expected the murderous scum to be eloquent much less articulate and didnt he feel the same sorts of things like real anger at the monied class whose messes he cleaned up for a living whose living rooms he occupied and whose scotch he drank when they were in trouble and wasnt he their sheepdog go fetch my kid fido good boy and suddenly he felt like a traitor in this place and the rage welled up inside him and he wanted to beat the shit out of senator john chase and tell him to go fuck himself and take ethan kitteredges little toy boat and crunch it in his hands and throw the pieces in his face and tell him what he could do with his private school education and that was to burn it wreck it fuck it tear it down and he found himself joining in the dance and in the chorus weaving bobbing bouncing and slamming off the other dancers as the music throbbed through him and he was hearing the words about your great damn stinking family who will never understand with their patriotic crap about this putrid dying land and the endless block of flats that make a prison you cant stand and christ he understood the sheer numbing stupefying fucking boredom of it that you can never escape your class so quit trying then he was dancing with allienot dancing really but slamming shoulder off shoulder laughing singing sweat flying from one to the other and he knocked her down off her feet but she bounced up laughing and spun around then put her shoulder into his chest and knocked him down and burn it wreck it fuck it tear it down tear it off tear it away tear it to shreds two thousand years of civilization to produce what senator chase for veep then allie picked him up and spun him around and pushed him off and then he was dancing with colin hands locked pushing forward and pushing back chests slamming into each other shouting at the top of their lungs the chorus that had now become a frenetic chant looking at colin and seeing himself there another country another time tear it down tear it down one chord beating against the wails in a shriek of fury hare krishna hare hare tear it down then he and colin fell down in a heap on the floor as the song ended in a crash of drums and they lay on the floor together laughing and laughing and then laughing more as allie fell face first on top of them shaking her hair so that her sweat sprayed on their faces neal listened to his heartbeat and felt himself breathing hard and he made some decisions then and there about colin allie kitteredge and himself allie washed up in the womens loo she slipped off her tshirt and splashed water on herself roiled on deodorant and sprayed a touch of perfume between her breasts she pulled a dark blue silk blouse out of her bag and put it on over her jeans then went to work with the tiny makeup kit she expertly penciled around her eyes used just a trace of mascara then a light blush bloodred lipstick topped off the look casual expensive a little dangerous killer said colin he shouted out the door neal come in lad and have a spot of tea neal took a look at allie and knew hed seen this movie before what are you decked out for not what who oh colin spooned out a generous dose of coke and held it up to allie she sighed something more babe later its always later she snorted the coke anyway doing two spoons with practiced ease colin took a hit and offered a spoon to neal he took it in and tasted that funny metallic taste deep down in his throat it wasnt very good coke colin handed allie a slip of paper you want me to send crisp along allie shook her head its an easy one ive done it before see you back at the flat she pecked him on the lips waved a goodbye and headed out the door neal didnt say anything thought hed let colin bring it up if he wanted its just fucking right colin asked sure i need a pint im buying the band was on a break you could hear yourself talk and think you liked it yeah its not so much bullshit most rocks become bullshit you know like they forgot what its about its physical its about living right now and forget that other crap theres no future anyway so forget about it me i wouldnt half mind if the ira blew the whole city up start with fuckingham palace you want to kill the rich i just want to take their money truer words neal old pal truer words you take their money you have to take their shit not if you do it right colin looked at him differently maybe well talk maybe they left the club at about am neal had a major buzz on from the speed the coke and god only knows how many pints his head rang from the combined effects of drugs alcohol noise and the nagging anxiety of not knowing where allie was maybe i should have split and followed her maybe she wants out and is just looking for her chance maybe i could have grabbed her at whatever hotel shes at and said here i am to save the day and gone straight to heathrow and caught the next flight out maybe but more likely id have blown the whole thing so he hung with colin crisp and vanessa come crash at my flat colin said no thanks ill catch a cab back to the hotel not at this time of night down here come on you can crash on the floor go home in the morning streets arent safe this time of the night crisp said lots of punks wandering around he grinned like an old horse headed for the stable yeah okay they walked along the monotonous streets lined with blocks of flats sweetshops and news brokers all the places were shut down for the night and few cars prowled the street it was pretty dull until they came across the pakis there were five of them and they were pissed pissed as in drunk pissed as in angry five larger than average pakistani immigrants in loud pastel shirts white jeans and black loafers they looked like a band at a cheap wedding they blocked the sidewalk hello colin said their leader he impressed neal as a muscular type your name wouldnt be ali would it colin inquired pleasantly in fact would all your names be ali alis name was in fact ali and he wasnt amused wheres your gang colin fucking your mother i should think for good measure crisp chimed in why dont you stinking wogs go back to pakistaniland where you belong ali smiled and said colin thinks hes a big man now because he has some protection down on the main drag but colin this is not the main drag and you dont have any protection here you see neal colin said youve gone and stumbled on what the bbc calls racial tension here we dont like the pakis we dont like them taking our jobs our flats our shops and our parks we dont like them crowding up our city with endless brats and their ugly wives we dont like their dingy color their smelly food their greasy hair their bad breath or their ugly stupid faces the only thing theyre good for is providing poor blokes like us with a bit of a hobby our version of bird shootingpaki bashing yes neal ali said in a voice that let him know he was in for it but one of the great features of paki bashing is that the white fellows need to be twice our number he pulled a very nastylooking leather sap from his jeans pocket neal carey hated fighting he hated fighting for several reasons one he thought it was stupid two it was scary and people got hurt three he was bad at it and was usually one of the people who got hurt another time then said neal and he began to move around ali this might have worked except that colin had a question to ask tell me is it your father or mother or both that take it up the arse in the loo at kings cross the sap flicked out and would have done considerable damage to colins brains except he wasnt there he had ducked beneath it and opened a deep cut from alis hip to knee with a single swipe of his blade ali dropped to his knees and let out a scream which colin quickly silenced with the toe of his shoe delivered soccerstyle to the mouth in the meantime crisp reacted somewhat negatively to a vicious kick in the balls by straightening up with the beer bottle in his hand and smashing it on his assailants chin undaunted the young pakistani punched crisp in the side of the head and broke two knuckles so he was a bit distracted when vanessa laced him across the throat with a chain neal was feeling considerable gratitude that his opponent seemed to be bearing no weapon and was prepared to duke it out in honorable manly fashion neal assumed the position right hand held in by his chest ready to strike left hand held high to block opponents right block and then counterpunch except this guy was lefthanded and launched a straight one that caught neal flush on the nose and hurt and hurt even more when he did it again neal wanted to fall down which had always worked in the gym but he figured that hitting the deck here would just invite a boot on the neck or a nice kick in the face so he stayed on his feet and waited for the kid to push his luck with a third shot which he did blessing his attackers lack of imagination neal stepped to his own left and dodged the punch and drove a hard left hook into the kids stomach son of a bitch if it didnt work the kid doubled over and neal took advantage of this to fall on top of him knock him over and lie on him colin was beating the uncouth piss out of the last pakistani when vanessa spotted the police car turning the corner peelers she yelled colin broke off his engagement and grabbed neal by the back of the collar run like a bastard neal wasnt sure exactly how a bastard ran but he assumed colin was following his own advice so he followed him they ran several blocks before ducking into the proverbial alley where he leaned against the wall gasped for air threw up and started bleeding again colins flat was a surprise it shouldnt have been neal thought dope dealers and pimps always make money even young corners like colin the flat was by no means luxurious but it was in a notsobad part of shabby earls court it was a secondfloor walkup but spacious and surprisingly well kept the sitting room was large and french windows led to a small balcony the kitchen was not small but certainly underused a coffeepot and a tea kettle sat on a stove along with jars of nescafe and sugar colins bedroom was large and dark a blackout shade hung even at night neal expected the water bed and the che guevara poster he expected the five locks that secured the main door he didnt expect the expensive television in the sitting room nor the pricey stereo equipment nor especially the brickandboard bookcases lined with paperback volumes of poetry coleridge blake and byron colin was doing all right for himself colin disappeared into the bedroom and came out with a bowl of hash here this will help cool you out he went into the kitchen and came out with ice wrapped in a paper towel he handed it to neal neal placed the cold cloth on his face it felt great his nose had started to throb he felt around it again and decided it really wasnt broken he loved undercover work colin lit the pipe took a long drag and handed it to neal neal shook his head more than enough is more than enough its mild neal bopper dope neal accepted the pipe and drew the hash into his lungs he held it for a long moment then exhaled it beat the shit out of oval tine carnal sounds came from the small bedroom violence turns vanessa on colin explained is it worth it for crisp it is whats his real name colin shrugged and took another drag he offered the pipe to neal neal declined more than enough is enough im going to get some kip ill get you a blanket daddy colin neal had just dropped off when allie came in he heard her long sigh and heard her put the kettle on the boil she stood impatiently until it whistled he listened as she stirred in milk and sugar and then tiptoed to the bedroom door he heard it open and shut again and was surprised to hear her tiptoe back into the sitting room she finished her tea while looking out the window then he heard her shuck off her shoes and her jeans and felt her lie down beside him push over and give me some of the blanket if colin comes out here i just want to sleep does he know that another sigh from allie hes not alone he came home alone so oh bright guy neal gave it a shot you like living like this yes now you want to shut up and let me get some sleep dear dad having a wonderful time wish you were here by the way tonight im sleeping with allie chase he woke up hurting his nose felt like someone had driven a fist into it and the rest of his body ached with righteous indignation he was hangover thirsty and went into the bathroom to get some water allie was sitting on the stool her knees tucked up under her chin she bent over with poignant grace the needle poised over the small vein between her toes she was concentrating hard and noticed neal only after she gently squeezed the plunger she looked up at him as the heroin hit her a small pop but there it was well neal said they do say that breakfast is the most important meal of the day dont tell colin its none of my business thats right he doesnt know you shoot up what happened to none of your business that shits bad for you but so good to me she got up carefully put the gear back into her bag and walked past him into the sitting room where she lay back down on the floor and stared at the ceiling he followed her in and lay down beside her how long have you been using a wakeup my arent we hip a couple of weeks i dont know expensive habit i pay for it i bet you do im not an addict i didnt say you were an addict she rolled over on her side away from him he knows i shoot up he doesnt know how much she drifted off neal propped his feet up on the balcony railing and gently leaned his chair back the last of the afternoon sun felt good on his face he had showered and shaved borrowed a clean tshirt from colin and was now sipping a cup of bitter nescafe on his way to feeling at least remotely human allie was safely tucked in and sound asleep crisp and vanessa had gone out in search of food and neal and colin had settled onto the balcony colin was dressed for leisure he was shirtless and wore denim jeans and biker boots reflective sunglasses shielded his eyes from the harsh glare of day sundays a hassle so i leave it alone he was saying too many citizens on the street and the coppers dont want to see you there sunday nights all right though i should get going neal said yawning what for the job colin stretched like a cat talk about the fox in the friggin en coop i dont screw around with it pity do you rip off your customers never they sat quietly for a while neal thought about what he was up to then tried not to think about it made him feel like shit so are you a heavy dealer colin not eavy enough bit of hash bit of coke heroin no wouldnt harf mind but the nicker lad the nicker he rubbed his thumb over his fingertips the universal sign language for cash takes a eap of the filthy lucre to get into smack in any serious way and the ladies wha is this the bbc just making conversation i have a few lady friends whod rather get paid for it i take a finders fee yeah i get a finders fee too neal thought so to speak colin set his head back to catch the rays better i was a little bugger during the ole ippie thing love and peace an all at shit the bloody beatles and their wog guru fucking sitars you got that right this punk thing it says the world is shit get pissed get stoned get your rocks off all there is these are a few of my favorite things we just got back from a oliday in france colin said got pissed got stoned got our rocks off in a different place you did you did it didnt take long for it to sink in you workingclass heroes were on some beach in france while i was sweating my balls off on the main drag looking for you colin you aspire to the middle class i aspire to a eap of filthy lucre yeah not arf maybe i know where you could get it there followed what could be called a significant silence wheres at neal set the chair back on the floor put his cup on the railing and stood up he stretched and yawned well talk he patted colin on the head and walked out always leave em wanting more he thought the next morning neal was in a doctors office wincing bravely fighting back the pain did that hurt dr ferguson asked him he bent neals leg back again a little neal answered lifting his head up from the examining table you have a nasty strain here i believe you can get dressed neal slowly brought himself into a sitting position and struggled back into his shirt thanks for seeing me at such short notice ferguson didnt look up from his prescription pad any friend of simons as the saying goes ferguson tended toward chubby and seemed quite content with it he had an owlish face and a full head of brown hair he lived in the same st johns wood house that held his office not that he needed to he had considerable private income in addition to his practice he confessed a public passion for cricket a private passion for his wife and a secret passion for firstedition books hence the simon keyes connection neal had found his number in simons address book i feel really silly falling down the stairs neal said yes well those stairs of simons ferguson answered he handed neal the scrip this will help you sleep also ease what we physicians like to call discomfort i just cant find a comfortable position as the actress said to the bishop yes back injuries are inconvenient that way next time you really should consider hurting your ankle simon tells me youre interested in books neal tossed in another small wince as he lowered himself from the table you talked with him i was motoring up north and popped in at the cottage unannounced he was quite gracious about it he tells me youre a smollett scholar hardly a scholar and youre here looking at his collection thank you simon neal thought its incredible does he still have the pickle neal gave him his best mona lisa inscrutable smile i see that he does ferguson said right try to stay off your feet lie flat no sitting if its still giving you trouble in a week come back and well have another look thanks again dont thank me just filch his pickle and bring it over in the dark of night ferguson chuckled at his joke neal chuckled then he winced then he chuckled again there was still a good hour or so before the shops would open so neal treated himself to a long walk through regents park he went down park road through hanover gate and found a footpath that took him across the lake past the boat house by the time he reached the south gate of the zoo his shirt was soaked but he felt good sweating the weekends poisons out of his system he stopped in at a grocers on regents park road and bought ten bottles of cocacola ten bottles of pepsi twenty aero chocolate bars three packages of sugarcoated tea biscuits a pound of white sugar two jars of honey a dozen eggs bread butter and jam he found a linen shop and bought two sets of sheets three bath towels and a dozen hand towels at a small athletic shop he bought four pairs of gym socks an expensive little stationers shop provided him with an expensive little attache case with combination locks his last stop was at the chemist where he exchanged fergusons prescription for a large plastic vial of sleeping pills simons flat was brutally hot and stuffy so the first thing neal did was open the windows then he laid his groceries out in the kitchen and put the soda in the refrigerator he tore the sheets up into thin strips and left them in the bedroom then taped the towels to the sharp corners of the dresser and bedside table he tied knots into each of the gym socks then he removed the bright white bulbs from the ceiling light and the bedside lamp and replaced them with lowwattage frosted bulbs he took half of the sleeping pills and left them in the bathroom cabinet and put the rest back in his pocket back in the sitting room he removed the four volumes of smolletts peregrine pickle and placed them in the new attache case he memorized the combination and locked it up by the time he was finished it was noon and already steamy hot out on the street he bought a times and grabbed an outdoor table under an umbrella at a sidewalk cafe he had an espresso and a truly goopy italian pastry as he scanned the paper it didnt take him long to find what he was looking for the london philharmonic at albert hall thursday night proceeds to go to the world wildlife fund prince philip to make opening remarks public welcome and a large sold out notice bannered across the ad buy early next time public he downed another espresso and grabbed a taxi back to the hotel an already harried concierge looked up from his list of problems the house was jampacked with tourists yes sir yes would you have any tickets available for the philharmonic on thursday evening july second let me check sir he looked into a thick book no sir terribly sorry all booked ive already booked name is carey the concierge sighed through his smile that is different sir let me find you he went back to the book sorry again mr carey i dont seem to find you here neal could hear impatient shuffling starting behind him maybe its under another name im with a party he let the silence hang the concierge gave in first which party might that be sir the henderson party back to the book at this hotel sir wouldnt use any other thank you sir the concierge looked over neals shoulder at the next guest and gave a quick smile indicating his tolerance then he perused the book again no sorry sir oh dear maybe shes using her married name the concierge could not resist a twobeat comic pause before he intoned and if we knew what that name was sir we might be able to find it zacharias z as in zebra a as in appropriate c as in choreography h as in i think i can take it from there sir no luck sorry once again mr carey are you quite certain well maybe susan didnt make the arrangements maybe nell did could you look under taglianetti mr carey we are just a bit busy at the moment would it be terribly rude of me to ask if you would be so kind as to look yourself and then inform me of your progress no not at all here you are then he handed neal the book neal scanned it looking for the names of married women who were going to the affair alone he found five their room numbers inked in beside them he ran a chant several times through his head harris goldman ulrich myers renaldi then he hurried to his room and wrote them down now for the tedious part he thought ulrich turned out to be german so that was no good neal hung up as soon as he heard the ja on the phone he tried harris may i speak to joe harris please the voice was an old womans im sorry dear you have the wrong party ask at the desk okeydoke lets give goldman a spin hello may i speak to mr goldman please speaking a mans voice american east coast sounds about the right age mr goldman this is mr panto of consolidated limited ringing to confirm our appointment tomorrow morning i think you have the wrong number im terribly sorry is this mr alan goldman of schreff and sons no this is dave goldman of just plain goldman im an attorney i am sorry

doesnt give a shit whos going to make opening remarks maybe ive found my couple better take a look at them to make sure nicelooking couple he thought which they better be after keeping me waiting an hour and a half in the hallway midforties stylish the wife an uptight brunette who puts in some time at the spa hes well built black hair just beginning to show a little silver what used to be called a snappy dresser amazingly white teeth full range of plastic amex diners club good tipper he didnt follow them out of the restaurant but finished his own mealan excuse for a hamburger that would have made the boys at nicks weepand read the international herald tribune the yankees were in first place the phone woke him from a pleasant nap it was only five oclock and he hadnt planned to head out until seven or so you havent called in for three days ed said no news then call and say no news levine answered no progress at all im doing the best i can do better you have four weeks jesus christ ed you and i both know this is a fools errand then youre just the man for the job call in neal got out of bed and stepped into the shower the cold water woke him up four weeks he thought a lot can happen in four weeks ed ed levine set the phone down nothing huh asked rich lombardi not yet lombardi set the case notes back on levines desk might have been too much to ask for anyway it was always a long shot lombardi left the friends office and went to the nearest phone booth he had a lot of calls to make the convention was just around the corner the senator was on the short list and there was so much to make sure of title this story the man behind the man allie was stoned out of her gourd when neal made it over to the earls court flat around eight oclock he found her pacing the floor muttering a semicoherent diatribe against television game shows particularly british ones where the contestants didnt win any money worth mentioning no frigidaires either no dinette sets no living room combinations washerdryers no toyotas no trips to honolulu cmon in vanessa said to neal colins not here though neal knew that already he had already placed colin back in leicester square where is he taking care of business spotting neal allie switched gears and launched into an assault on american men particularly the ones from new york who think they know everything about screwing but dont theyre pigs pigs new york boys just want to get into your pants and then they dont know what to do there i hate that vanessa disappeared into the bathroom and ice cream allie muttered you cant get any decent ice cream in this lousy country they give you some shit called ice cream but it isnt neal did you bring any real ice cream with you no sorry she stepped over to him and looked him in the eyes youre no good neal you know that no damn good at all she said it with such utter sincerity and then gave him a smile so dazzling that he couldnt quite believe she was strung out he couldnt help liking her it was almost as if she was aware of herself making fun of the american bitch for everyones entertainment and the weather she continued its too fucking hot we sang that in school glee club once its too fucking hot its too fucking hot ts too darn hot yeah its too darn fucking hot its supposed to be foggy and rainy in all the movies its foggy and rainy you ever see sherlock holmes with a tan but i havent seen any fog or any rain since i got here and thats weeks and weeks and weeks and weeks and what is nessa doing to her hair shaving half of it off vanessa answered neal looked into the bathroom sure as shit she was shaving half of it offthe left half fascinated allie floated into the bathroom why bored may i watch sure love but you cant help youd slice me to ribbons allie lay down on the tile floor and played with vanessas falling locks neal stood in the doorway alice he asked do you have any dates tonight do i have any dates tonight yes troy donahue is coming over and were going to the malt shop no frankie avalon and i are going to a beach party he broke up with that bitch with the boobs because he loves me no wally cleaver and i are going to the drivein and im going to

this look vanessa asked them the left side of her head was bald the right half was a cascade of magenta locks hike it neal said a lot he turned to leave allie followed him i just remembered another song we sang in good old glee club wanna hear it you could take her right now neal thought whisk her off on some excuse and be gone before vanessa ever thought to ring the phone box he hurried down the stairs and could still hear her singing a precious gem is what you are youre daddys bright and shining star he caught the district line train at earls court changed to the piccadilly line at south kensington and rode it to leicester square the long wooden escalator carried him to the street level he found colin in the square standing under the statue of the earl of leicester the inscription on the base read there is no darkness but ignorance hello rugger colin said crisp sat on the ground beside him in his faithfuldog pose hows business buggers are tying up the phone colin answered pointing to a queue outside the phone box shout you a pint colin looked around for a second then said why not crisp mind the shop theres a good lad they walked to a small pub on floral street neal found a table by the window and brought two pints over i looked for you over at your place earlier he said office hours alice is wrecked colin shrugged ats er business isnt it could affect your business high rollers dont like junkies colin stared out the window well rugger er business or my business its none of your business neal glanced out the window might be ows at i need a girl colin laughed not alice ill set you up with someone else i need a girl for a job colin took a long draw on his pint before he said my da was on the dole is ole fookin life he was always tellin me son ge a union job ge a union job an you can fook off your ole life that was my das great ambition is this a union job neal no were interested its a oneshot deal colin lots of money but very tricky no mistakes my ass is on the line how much money enough you wont have to send alice out on any more dates either a trace of shame passed across colins face or he was even a better actor than neal thought i love er neal right whats the job neal shook his head ill tell you tomorrow the serpentine one oclock because you cant make it too simple neal thought and you have to get him into a pattern of following instructions turn the relationship around otherwise the whole thing will screw up why all the bother colin asked yes or no yes rugger the tail had picked neal up in the square and followed him to the pub he waited across the street and then stayed with him back to the hotel he stayed a long way back and was real careful the kid was supposed to be a pro levine answered the phone im calling in neal said good boy take your fucking tail off me what next time send someone knows what hes doing hey neal take him off neal hung up levine looked at graham and lombardi that neal is some piece of work little shit thinks i put a tail on him asshole grahams rubber hand ground into his real one he had trained neal better than to see tails that werent there back off the kids on to something i can smell it the phone connection from london was bad so he had to repeat himself he made you back off he didnt make me whos paying you off you got it the guy hung up the phone he was pissed off the kid was a pro a real cute one two scotches and a hot bath didnt settle neal down much that fucking levine he thought that fucking levine is going to blow this whole thing if i as much as smell that guy again tuesday morning neal decided to have a whopping big breakfast he picked a table in the dining room that gave him an easy view of the door and dug into his times along with two fried eggs hot cereal toast bacon sausage and a pot of coffee he took his sweet time about it but nobody joined him then he went for a walk the day was a scorcher a real bitch but if they wanted to play games hed play games nobody picked him up at the hotel door certainly not the guy from last night but it would be just like friends to show him one tail so they could pin a different one on him and he just wasnt ready for company on this thingnot yet he took a right down piccadilly and set a torrid pace to green park tube station he bought a p ticket from the machine and headed down the stairs changed his mind and walked back out on the street he strolled down queens lane nice and slow stopped at a cart and bought an ice cream thought about allie and turned around and went back to the tube station but now he picked up the pace fast and hard so if anyone was following him it would cost them a hell of a sweat he took the train to leicester square rode the escalator to street level rode the escalator back down to the trains and took a northern line train to tottenham court road where he got off the train switched to the central line and continued on to bond street where he switched to the jubilee line and rode it back to green park by this time he was convinced that levine had called his boy off and he was soaked with sweat and covered with grime but he felt good as if he was working again as if he was in firstclass gumshoe shape he was psyching himself up talking himself into it going undercover deep undercover he could see the boathire dock on the serpentine from the deck of the restaurant he sipped an iced coffee and waited he had a good hour before colin was supposed to show up time enough to check out the terrain time enough to be ready if anyone was setting him up neal carey wasnt taking any chances i cant swim rugger colin warned as he gently lowered himself into the little squat paddleboat ill save you neal answered he watched allie crisp and vanessa getting into another boat neal was having a good time and taking a little spin around the manmade lake in the center of hyde park wasnt a bad way to kill a sweaty afternoon and he enjoyed colins discomfiture they paddled out toward the middle of the serpentine and then just let the boat drift neal placed his jacket on the bottom of the boat and lay down on top of it it felt gloriously cool down there he left colin sitting up in the heat in the distance he could hear crisp and vanessa singing at the top of their lungssome song he didnt recognize but guessed was a butchery of gilbert and sullivan so what is it rugger careful neal lad he thought to himself this is it my client is over here buying a book i hope youre avin me on the book is worth twenty thousand pounds that got your attention didnt it colin what book is worth twenty thousand quid colin asked suspiciously the pickle he went through the whole thing about smollett the first and second editions lady vane the trip to italy the missing volumes when he had finished colin said so so our client the guy im doing security for just bought it for ten thousand pounds ten int twenty lad and i know someone wholl buy it for twenty colin baby and i have you hooked neal thought colin was only a silhouette at the moment but the silhouette was leaning way forward listening hard you can get old of this book with your help im all ears jesus christ the boat rocked suddenly neal saw a head bobbing in the water then the head came over the side of the boat alice for bleeding jesuss sake i felt like a swim she hauled herself into their boat i was lonely she said i missed you besides look what those assholes are doing over there those assholes crisp and vanessa were ramming their paddleboat into any other boat they could catch they were at this moment in hot pursuit of a pair of japanese tourists security guards at the dock were climbing into a rowboat jump back in love me and neal are aving a business discussion let her stay its about her what about me i want you to ball a guy how much five thousand pounds what is he really gross or something they barely outpaddled the water cops who had picked crisp and vanessa up and wanted the whole gang the japanese couple had abandoned ship however necessitating a rather complicated bilingual rescue effort which gave neal and his crew time to paddle to shore dump the boat in some bushes and run out to rotten row they hailed a cab at alexandra gate westminster bridge neal told the cabbie im not balling anybody on westminster bridge said allie ten thousand colin said five and theres more to it im not balling anybody on westminster bridge ten or forget it forget what where on westminster bridge the driver asked no place said allie just on the embankment is fine neal paid the cabbie and started across the pedestrian walkway on the bridge the view up and down the thames was one of his favorites it might be the best spot to see london he thought and he stopped about halfway across to take it in off to his right was a postcard view of the tower of big ben and the houses of parliament to his right stretched victoria embankment right in front of him was colin seven then neal turned his back and leaned over the railing on the downriver side thursday night goldmans wife is going to a concert at albert hall goldman doesnt want to go says he hates that stuff and hes going to the latest james bond flick at the odeon but what he really wants is to get laid i mean laid he wants me to set him up so i told him okay ive worked it out hes going to go to my room to do it in case the old lady gets

out it was you no shit the agency will send people in fact i know just the guy theyll send guy named levine very big very tough im going to need to disappear for a while can you handle that sure if things get rough ill get rougher neal leaned farther over the railing pretending to think it over let colin see thousands of quid slipping away i dont know colin im taking a big risk here take it neal turned around and rested his back against the railing he took his time checking out the boats and barges in the river below him he studied waterloo bridge as if he was thinking of buying it he looked from colin to allie to colin to allie and back again allie could not care less colin would sell alice to the gypsies for a shot at five thousand pounds neal knew a few things about scams one thing was that you never talk anybody into a scam you let them talk you into it he ran his reluctantvirgin act for just a few more seconds all right he said but its going to take some preparation one more time neal said a collective sigh filled colins flat theyd already been at it for three hours and gone through it several dozen times and fucking neal had banned all alcohol hash pills and smack from the planning session come on he repeated crisp recited colin and me wait outside the otel and an i try to dress like a human being neal points out missus goin as she comes ou the door colin and me follow er an stick to er like glue good why ya didnt ask why before crisp whined tell me why you can have a pint four people instantly volunteered the answer neal hushed them and looked at crisp yes because if the missus gets bored a the concertwhich personally i cant imagineshe might decide to come ome an that would fuck up the ole thing correct neal heard echoes of joe graham telling him to always fill his lies with lots of details you have to keep crisp and colin out of the way for a while so give them a mission and make them concentrate on it neal took a bottle from his bag and dangled it in front of crisp then what would you do get to a phone box and ring you where goldmans room when crisp grinned proudly right away neal tossed him the bottle and looked at colin i stay with the missus and find a way to stall er but i dont urt er neal raised his eyebrows at all neal looked at allie who was making a very successful effort to look indifferent colin snatched the book out of her hand opened the window and threw the book into the street allie rolled her eyes i get all dressed up she said staring pointedly at neal like a little lady and i wait in the bar where where i have one drink thats all and i wait for neal to come get me neal introduces me to mr wonderful and leaves i ball his brains out and i take my time about it i make it last then i take my money and come straight back here what

theyd been over it so many times the past two nights that they didnt want to take a chance that hed make them do it again all right neal stood up and stretched the rest of them hustled for their drug of choice colin opened two pints and handed neal one of them vanessa and crisp lit a bowl of hash and flipped on the telly allie slipped into the bathroom shes a junkie neal said shes not how many times a day now two or three just little pops rugger not in her arms i hope goldman sees needle tracks might turn him off this little piggie went to market this little piggie stayed ome this little piggie went weeweewee doesnt it bother you you love her right shell get off it yeah neal stepped out on the balcony colin followed him five now he said a thousand a month for two months assuming im still in one piece done oh colin neal thought you agreed to that one awfully fast what are you up to ill take alice shopping tomorrow neal said get her something killer you do that neal lad yeah neal colin thought you go shopping ill go shopping colin hated tea hated the smell the taste even the feel of it as it slithered down his throat he had sworn when he split the home scene that hed never choke down another cup of the omnipresent shit the rest of his natural life nevertheless he sipped it graciously as he sat in a booth in the back room of the hunan garden across the table from a smiling dickie huan dickie huan was a middleaged chinese who had several restaurants an unshakable faith in free enterprise and a great tailor on this particular afternoon he sported a dark gray threepiece pinstripe a silk salmon shirt and a bloodred tie aware of dickies sartorial sensibilities colin had done his best to dress for the meeting he was aware that his allwhite suit looked a bit gamy compared to dickies conservatism but it was the best he could do for the occasion how is tea super dickie huan also hated tea but believed in tradition he smiled gently over his raised cup what brings me the pleasure of your visit colin swallowed hard this bit needed great balls im looking to expand my market dickie huan said nothing this was obvious everybody was looking to expand his market colin continued i want to enlarge the scope of my operation again dickie didnt respondjust for fun colin spit it out i want to buy heroin from you everyone does colin tugged at his collar the tie felt like a noose around his neck i understand youre expecting a shipment dickie raised an eyebrow and smiled although he was very pissed off that this roundeye freak with pins through his ear knew this much about his business so i want to buy a piece of it where will you get this kind of money colin ill ave it saturday give myself a day to take care of neal he thought saturday is not today what are you a fortune cookie colin thought but he said ill buy up to twenty thousand pounds worth dickie took a long time to answer he wanted to phrase the insult just right i usually dont sell such small allotments then you must have a small amount to spare not bad dickie thought not bad at all sorry colin i have promised another party every little bit colin took a big chance he thought for a moment about his fingers becoming moo goo gai colin and then said i can put you into markets that john chen cant touch dickies burst of cantonese obscenities brought three waiters trotting to the table one carried a double beefeater with a twist the other two hastily cleared the teacups as their boss regained his composure how you know so much dickie asked as he knocked back his drink colin felt a sweet surge of confidence i keep me ear to the ground now dickie this bit is just the first i can put you in markets all over the city places chinese cant go dickie huan needed no reminder of the unsubtle racism of britains punks he colored slightly at the insult but decided to ignore it for the time being after all he wouldnt mind expanding his own markets why you come to me colin colin smiled his most engaging smile and told the truth youre the only one who might give me credit dickie so the punk comes to the chink dickie thought outsider to outsider he liked the symmetry of it come on dickie ive never let you down on the hash deals have i that is childs play colin heroin is real business then think about real business think about where ill be selling your heroin twenty thousand is just the start dickie huan thought about it he had indeed told john chen he could have the whole shipment but he could give chen twenty thousand back tell him that the shipment was smaller than hed thought a chance to break into the roundeye neighborhoods didnt come every day come back into the kitchen colin dickie said he saw colin turn pale you see too many films come on colin followed him back into a little steamy kitchen where a half dozen sweating cooks were getting ready for the dinner crowd dickie leaned against a big squat wooden chopping block colin you know if i save a piece for you i cannot offer it back to the other party youll never miss him dickie nodded and said something in cantonese to one of the cooks the cook handed him a meat cleaver and stepped aside as dickie grabbed a large piece of pork and slapped it onto the chopping block dickie was the son of a nathan road butcher and knew what he was doing with rapid strokes he chopped the piece of meat into slices and then whirled the cleaver again and chopped the slices into little squares the whole demonstration took ten seconds then he swept the cubes of meat into a pan he hadnt as much as touched the sleeves of his threehundredpound suit he looked up at colin and smiled twenty thousand pounds saturday night dont disappoint me colin colin left the restaurant whistling meeting neal had been luck he knew but a lot of blokes would have settled for the twenty thousand colin had the balls to go for the big time allie pirouetted prettily the changingroom attendant beamed at her and then at neal they were such a cute couple do you approve allie asked him i approve she tilted her head in a parody of fashionmagazine models she looked dropdead gorgeous the new dress was a simple black sheath off the shoulders and cut just low enough to hint at the pleasures of intimacy a gold necklace highlighted the dress her hair and her eyes the makeup was subtle will there be anything else neal looked to allie its your movie she said that will be all thanks come on then dearie well get it all wrapped up as soon as the saleslady turned around allie stuck her fingers in her mouth pulled her lips apart and stuck her tongue out at neal then she went to change out on oxford street he asked her to lunch i didnt know crooks went to lunch she said dont do me any favors im hungry where do you want to go new york for a burger right i know what you mean they have good burgers in stockton they have mcdonalds they found a funky little french place that didnt care he wasnt wearing a tie or she was wearing jeans she knew her way around the menu he noticed with amusement stockton is famous for its continental cuisine she ordered the vichyssoise a fillet tarragon chicken and apricot mousse she also suggested the wines he had what she had maybe there was still tine to do this the easy way he thought ever think about going home what for she said through a mouthful of potato soup burgers she shook her head family thats what i ran away from maybe it would be different it wouldnt be she took a sip of the white wine and sat back in her chair anyway what about colin i dunno what about colin she gave him a cold smile a practiced ambiguous gesture meant to indicate simultaneous interest and indifference a poker player calling but not raising the pot are you coming on to me she asked no good she went back to her soup how come you dont like me he asked what did i do i like you lets just say i havent had a real good experience with men okay nothing personal okay okay during the chicken she said im in love with him with him or with his dope whats the difference none it was a great lunch and the bill said so he paid it and left a generous tip thank you for lunch she said when they got outside what did you say i said thank you it was nice of you not part of the bargain youre welcome thanks for the company you want to take a walk in the park she looked at him hard and smiled you are coming on to me im just saying you have options yeah what kind of options you can take a walk in the park if i told colin you came on to me hed kill you hed try youre a valuable piece of property he loves me sure why shouldnt he its not just for the money i make yeah whats your share of this job what is he cutting you in for five thousand three two were running out of numbers here alice she blushed colin handles all the money he takes care of me neal laughed at her he takes care of you he says i wont have to do that anymore after tonight he promised no more dates until he needs money again then hell turn you back out and he will need money youll shoot it all up your arm he saw her wince and watched her think which park theres another option right there she signaled a cab st jamess park she said by horse guards road he let her lead him to the tea kiosk there where she bought two huge sweet rolls after that lunch he asked not for us idiot come on she walked him over to the lake where the ducks drifted off the shore waiting for silly people with huge sweet rolls to feed them she handed neal one of the rolls and said quite seriously now you break it up into little bits and toss it to the ducks and try to spread the wealth around so they all get a little he watched her feed the ducks she gave it all her attention as if she was the only person there and that was all she had to do in the world her smile lost its angry edge for the ten minutes or so that the roll lasted you do this a lot he asked her no she trembled a little we better get going she said why big night tonight are you cold its a hundred and ten out i need to go home because the smack is there i need to get ready neal just breathe deep fuck you itll get worse alice she sat down on a bench he sat beside her so tonights my last date huh if you want she nodded her head a few times the color was starting to leave her face yeah sounds good to me then its your last date she chortled oh youll protect me right get me off the smack keep me off the street thats right okay white knight she said standing up get me into a cab i have to get home he dropped her at her flat kept the cab and went back to the hotel he didnt feel like watching her shoot up and he had stuff to do as the lady said big night tonight neal sat in one of the overstuffed wing chairs in the lobby of the hotel he had chosen a seat where he could see both the elevators and the revolving door that led to the street he tried hard to look composed and relaxed but his stomach was jumping and his heart beating about eight trillion times a minute please mrs goldman get going you dont want to be late for the concert please come out of the next elevator she didnt he glanced out into the street where he knew colin and crisp were waiting patience was not colins long suit come on mrs goldman another elevator two welldressed american ladies neither of them mrs g whos that another woman not mrs goldman he wondered about allie waiting in the hotel bar at least he hoped she was waiting in the hotel bar not shooting up in the ladies loo or worse yet out on the street looking for a connection time was not on his side in this thing so mrs goldman any haste would be appreciated the elevator bell rang again he had followed her to her room a bare two hours ago and held the surveillance so he knew she was in there performing the complicated ablutions and ritual that go with a big night out lets slip the frock on now mrs g and haul it down here she wasnt in the elevator colin shifted his weight from one foot to the other again and gave crisp a dirty look not that it was crisps fault he knew but because crisp was the only one there and didnt mind anyway that was what he was there for tardy tardy crisp said through a mouthful somethings wrong shes late thats all maybe shes giving the old man a quick one colin shot him an especially filthy look that would be just lovely now wouldnt it allie was trying to hold it together her hand shook a little as she reached into her bag for a handkerchief goddamn colin anyway she thought and double goddamn that bastard neal carey if they had let her have one little shot just one little shot shed be all right shed be perfect shed be fanfuckingtastic colin had even subjected herno doubt at that prick neals urgingto a search the fact thatd turned up a little envelope of powder didnt make it all right shed get even with him later now she just wanted to get this over with do this john pick up that triple motherfucker neal and get home for the promised fix she didnt even care that this was her last trick ever that colin had told her this was her farewell performance her retirement party her swan song fine and dandy collie baby but i need a little taste and if neal doesnt hurry up and get in here im going to go out and find one one thing shed learned in her short career as a lady of the evening every place has a back door mrs goldman looked good almost worth the wait neal thought as he watched her stride through the lobby and out the revolving door he gave her a few paces and then picked her up she asked the doorman to get her a cab and as he stood blowing his whistle colin and crisp walked to the corner where they had a cab waiting neal watched mrs g climb into her taxi and watched the car carrying colin pull into traffic behind her colin looked out the window saw neal and gave him a quick thumbsup sign lets hope so colin lets hope so he found allie in the bar working on her third gin he walked up in back of her and leaned over her shoulder she jumped when he whispered give it five minutes then come up she whipped her head around and glared at him where the hell have you been easy steady you look great fuck you five minutes neal went up to his room and fixed a tall gin and tonic and a scotch he dropped four muscle relaxers into the g ampt sat down on the bed and waited a few minutes later a soft knock came on the door come in its not locked she made an entrance slinky black dress bright smile her long strand of pearls held in one hand sexy young willing it was a great act her smile dropped as she saw neal and her eyebrows arched in question he just called hes on his way nervous i guess sit down i made you a drink your favorite she plopped down on the bed just how nervous is he she asked raising the ugly specter of potential impotence pretty nervous great cheers she took a gulp of the drink and then they sat there looking at each other a good two minutes passed while she sipped on her gin before she said is this supposed to be a long concert arent they all another couple of minutes and then look why dont i just go to his room whip my clothes off and that would kind of defeat the purpose oh yeah three minutes passed before she spoke again maybe hes killed himself couldnt stand the precoital guilt two minutes later she passed out cold neal picked up the phone rang the front desk and asked for hatcher five minutes later the detective called him back i have a problem neal said why does this fail to surprise me ill be up hatcher suppressed a sneer with some effort when he saw the young lady passed out on neals bed a bit too much of the old persuasion son she arrived this way hatcher sniffed the nearempty glass of gin and she brought this with her i suppose neal shrugged i could never deny a lady a drink i rather think you can never deny a lady at all in any case what is the problem i have to get her out of here that is your problem what is mine hatcher do you really want me to drag her through the lobby with all those people down there how will it look with all respect to your privacy why cant the young lady sleep it off right here neal did his best to work up a decent blush what with the nerves and the fear and all it wasnt tough because the young lady is quite young hatcher i just want to take her home help me get her out quietly and into a cab please this is a bit much okay youre right ill just drag her through the lobby he started to lift allie off the bed is this the niece hatcher asked neal nodded i dont believe you actually found her and managed to bag her im not sure i believe it either neal thought shes not in the bag yet ill ring a cab well use the service entrance hes got her the overseas connection wasnt the greatest the phone crackled and popped like a rice krispies commercial whos got her careys got the kid she went up to his room with him then they left out the back shit you know where they went the guy was enjoying this you said not to follow him there was a long silence i know where he went what now boss can you do it i dont do that kind of work but i know who will local talent named colin hes her pimp and you know pimps a lot of snaps crackles and pops went by before he got his answer okay make it happen heres the address phone number if you want it might come in handy hey just get it done colin was in a majorleague sweat hed been standing in the fooking covent garden tube station for close to an hour no neal he grabbed crisp by the shirt when he came back from the phone alice isnt back and no word from neal weve been fucked colin not yet we havent they hopped the train and rode it to piccadilly he breezed past the young doorman and got into the lift outside neals room he felt for the knife in his jacket pocket and got ready to use it he motioned crisp to the other side of the door and then rang the bell and waited waited a good five minutes before stationing crisp at the lift and going to work on the door lock inside the room everything was gone luggage clothes neal alice and the books two minutes later he was at the registration desk mr careys room please mr carey has checked out sir triple poxy whoredog asswipe did he leave a forwardin address let me see sir hurry mate hurry hurry hurry hurry no sir sorry colin slammed his fist on the counter then he headed for the door the doorman knew his lines did you lose something mate did you find somethin moments later colin and crisp were in a taxi colin was thinking about bloody murder the doorman found the gentleman in the bar just where he said he would be i did what you said the gentleman slipped him a tenner good job the gentleman went to a phone and waited for the overseas connection to go through its over hey you sure hes a duster what about her you kidding a junkie and a pimp its the perfect relationship forget about her okay get lost very lost allie started to come to as neal plopped her on simons bed he was out of breath from lugging her dead weight up the stairs and maneuvering her into the bedroom he was tying her wrists to the torn sheets when she woke up enough to speak are you kinky or something she asked looking at the restraints but not necessarily objecting i havent had the chance to find out he tightened the bonds just enough to hold her it seemed to wake her up a little neal whats going on nothing i want you to get some rest why are you tying me up neal sat down on the bed he took her chin in his hand and lifted her face so that they were looking at each other alice listen no more smack thats over with he saw a fine edge of panic creep into her eyes im going to give you something to cool you out itll be okay but no more heroin for you she was still too woozy to really take in what he was saying and he figured that was probably a blessing for them both he broke a valium in half and gave it to her with a swallow of coke the sugar would help she fought him a little at first but her body wanted sleep and her mind wanted refuge so after a few seconds she took the pill neal sat with her for the few minutes it took her to go to sleep then he shut the door went into the kitchen and fixed himself a cup of coffee seventytwo hours he needed seventytwo hours and that should get them through the worst of it she wasnt too badly hooked and there was no question of her dying of withdrawal he knew he could nurse her through it knew he could get her off smack and get hooked on neal because thats what it took three days of this and shed belong to him as if he bought her at an auction more than that because shed want it too thats the way junkies are and it takes a long time before they get to a place where they can stand up by themselves so hed wean her off the dope and tell her he loved her that hed be her new man and take care of her that theyd take the money and split and live happily ever after then he would whip her on an airplane and take her back and hand her over and that would be that and its a shifty world but there would be plenty of time to reflect on what a dark hole the universe is when this particularly shifty job was over and he wasnt letting her out of his sight because she wasnt going to be any halperin kid all he needed was seventytwo hours seventytwo mean sweaty hoursespecially for allie the ringing of the phone cut right through him made his heart jump a little before he reasoned that it was probably a friend of simons who didnt know his schedule he went into the sitting room and lifted the receiver hello hello rugger neal edged to the window and inched the curtain aside colin probably didnt have a gun much less a rifle but there was no sense taking chances colin waved to him from the phone boxa cheery little wave accompanied by a wide grin vanessa was with him he couldnt see crisp which meant that he was out backalong with god knows how many others neal closed the curtain and stepped back into the middle of the room hello colin youre dead she with you no lying bastard shes dead too come on up well talk ill be up all right rugger not to worry when im ready he rang off neals mind raced come on think cut through the fear and think you werent followed youre sure of that sure or just arrogant no sure okay who knew about this place simon hes out kitteredge levine and graham couldnt be kitteredge makes no sense levine and graham say it aint so joe and how would they hook up with colin unless they knew about him all along unless i was sent to make liz chase happy while the senator and everyone else wanted allie to stay lost so when i find her im written off i should have seen it no files on the kid fed the mackensen bullshit story like its gospel no backup no partner check in every day let us know how youre doing well im doing pretty shitty right now ed its give or take colin is waiting for the small hours when screams can be written off as nightmares when the streets are quiet no passersby then hes got you the fear hit him again the slash of the knife across his face there was no way he could take colin no way knock it off neal think run it through you could call the cops and tell them what that youve kidnapped a girl fed her drugs shes tied up in the other room not a good choice okay deal you have the books trade him the books for allie why should he he can have it all but he needs the name of the buyer for it to do him any good bargain there no he can get that out of you youll talk colin holds a knife to allies face shit babe be honest if he holds a knife to your face youll tell him and where would you go even if you got out of here where would you go you could make a break for it throw her over your shoulder and run for the tube its closed moron and youd never make it five steps a cab same that leaves the car down the back stairs and into the garage assuming you make it where could you take her fuck her maybe you can handle crisp on the back stairs and make it to the car but not with her dump her babe right he thought then youll have another face to add to the halperin collection so work backward go from the solution to the method where would you like to be whats the ideal safe quiet isolated a place the office doesnt know about think think think a place you can hear your own heartbeat how about a cottage in the yorkshire moors where did simon say it was get to work neal he started to search the apartment neal found what he was looking for almost immediately maybe his luck was changing it was a road map of britain with the route to simons yorkshire cottage marked in bright orange and notes on how to proceed on the unmarked roads neal went to the phone and dialed it rang a long time dad where are you just listen because i dont have much time theres some stuff you have to know neal sat down on the edge of the bed allie was still sound asleep her face and hair were damp with sweat he stroked her cheek with the back of his hand im sorry kid i screwed it up i tried to help you out and ended up getting you in more trouble im really sorry he figured he still had an hour or so before show time he didnt feel like sitting around letting the fear eat him out he thought some more about joe graham and then did a very joe graham thing he cleaned the place was a mess anyway and that was hardly the way to repay simons hospitality he found a broom and a mop some powdered cleanser and floor wax and set to work he vacuumed and dusted polished furniture and scrubbed and waxed the kitchen floor until the sucker gleamed like ice when he was done he felt much better then he sat down with a book to wait it out the footsteps woke him he could hear colin trying to sneak up the front stairs he checked his watch and was surprised that it was quarter to four the steps paused on the landing he heard fumbling he saw the thin piece of metal slip the lock the door opened just a crack apparently colin didnt fancy getting whacked in the face with something hard and heavy too bad neal felt the sickening bile of fear rise he fought to hold it down as colins foot pushed open the door colin stood in the doorway both hands tucked inside his leather jacket which hand has the knife neal wondered he remembered playing that game with the old italian men in the neighborhood which hand has the candy hed never been very good at it then either colin said youve been trying to ring but the line was engaged right what if i give up colin what if i throw up my hands and say you can take the book take allie instead he said you should have come with an army colin colin stepped in and locked the door shut behind him for you rugger mind ive seen you fight you want a cup of tea a beer we can start with a book start and finish colin shook his head where are we neal whose place is this neal saw colins left wrist tighten so itll come from that side if it comes when it comes a friends are you ripping him off too as a matter of fact ill give you the book you leave alice true love is it the bookll do me no good without the name of the buyer okay ill toss that in too colin took a tentative step toward him neal backed away colin said youre not in much of a position to toss anything are you neal lad i think ill take the book and the girl and youll give me the name the knife flashed out of his left pocket he held it blade turned flat level with neals eyes no more than a foot away the point sparkled and danced in front of neals eyes he felt the thud in his stomach and the tightness of breath in his chest hed seen people get cut he let the terror come up thought about his face sliced open the sickening flap of flesh dangling the scar he would wear for life tears filled his eyes shes dead colin she must have od d colins hand dropped not much but just enoughenough for neal to turn and run he ran through the sitting room and flung himself through the sharp left into the kitchen he had just enough lead to jump onto the counter colin was half a second behind neal when he hit the waxed kitchen floor at full speed his slick leather loafers went out from under him he landed hard on his back but not before his head took a nice bounce off the squeakyclean linoleum neal raised the mop high above his head and jammed the butt end down into colins crotch as if he was planting the flag on mount everest this gave colin a new relationship with the concept of pain and he rolled on the floor in a fetal position groaning neal picked the knife up from the floor and put it into his pocket then he stepped over to the refrigerator and pulled out the pan he had placed in the freezer it was now packed with solid ice crisp he yelled in his best imitation of colin get your arse in here crisp crashed through the flimsy back door and saw colin rolling on the floor he never saw neal swing the pan of ice like jimmy connors smashing a high backhand the heavy pan hit him square on the bridge of the nose crushing bone and cartilage crisp was out before he hit the floor which was probably a blessing as he fell right on his shattered nose you whores bastard hissed colin with unintended accuracy he tried to struggle to his feet but nauseating waves of pain held him to the floor neal went into the bedroom lifted allie in a firemans carry and hefted her down the back stairs he was breathing hard and heavy from excitement fear and the exertion of beating up colin and crisp so it took him a little longer than he wanted to get down to the garage he didnt have a great deal of time before colin would suck it up enough to come after him knife or no knife colin would wipe him out in a fair fight so neal was hurrying to make sure there wouldnt be one he leaned allie against the garage wall while he fumbled in his pants pocket for the key he noticed his hands were shaking just to make things better allie was starting to wake up he got the door open pulled her over to the dreaded keble opened the passenger door and worked her into the seat this maneuver felt as if it took about an hour and a half and he expected colin to come through the garage door any moment he finally got her and himself settled in the drivers seat allie came to life wazzup she asked sleepily were going for a ride thas nice she said happily and fell back to sleep yeah thas nice neal thought if i can get this thing started and get us out of here he put the key in the ignitionthe trunk key it didnt fit neither did the door key no matter which way he tried colin was fumbling with his own equipment which seemed to be all there even though that yank bitchs whelp had tried to geld him his nether parts ached though no mistake and his head hurt like sunday morning he got to his feet and stood over crisp who lay as stiff and still as a girl fresh out of the convent cmon mate get up colin said prodding crisp with his toe crisp didnt move the ignition key fit as if it had been made for the purpose neal turned it stepped on the gas pedal and waited for the demonic car to throb with malevolent life instead it whined a dry rhythmic hack he tried it again same thing neal said some words your mother never taught you and tried again crisp wouldnt move colin shook him a few times he came to my nose what happened to me that beggar neal smashed it lets go get him you go get him crisp moaned sinking back to the floor ive had enough of him colin gave him a boot in the groin for good measure and headed down the back stairs the motion joggled his throbbing balls and he decided he might take two or three days to kill neal when he found him then he heard the distinctive sound of an engine not starting coming from the garage at the bottom of the stairs if there isnt a god he thought there bloody well certainly is a devil the keble wouldnt start even though neal was about standing on the gas pedal all it would do was hack and spit and neal who hated cars anyway hated this car more than he had ever hated anything pullona choke allie said dreamily what pullona choke fucking gordonkeble wont start less you pullona fucking choke she leaned over his lap and pulled the choke knob out about halfway the engine roared to life how did you know that he asked but she was asleep again colin heard the engine too late neal bugger he thought as he tried to turn the knob to the garage door the fucker was locked from the inside he raised his leg to kick it in but the sheer agony that bolted through his right testicle changed his mind he limped around to the front of the garage stopping on his way to pick up a convenient twobytwo left over from the construction he posted himself outside the sliding door when you come to open this neal arms all nice and raised and all neal pressed down on what he figured to be the clutch and eased the car into first gear keeping a foot on the brake pedal he raced the engine a couple of times pleased with the resounding result this isnt so bad he thought he let off the brake colin waited patiently for the door to lift he held the twobytwo up around his shoulders ready to decapitate neal the delicious tingle of impending revenge eased the dull throb from his recent drubbing cmon neal lad first and third are a long way apart on a baseball diamond but on a gearbox they are barely distinguishable especially to a mechanical moron like neal carey he punched down on the accelerator and let off on the brake the car flew backward thats when neal remembered that hed forgotten to open the door except that colin had done it for him the impatience of rage had gotten the better of him and suspecting some trick he had leaned down to open the door and go in and get that bastard when the little sports car plowed straight into him colin took a short ride on the hood before rolling off to the right avoiding the crush of wheels by inches neal had swerved to avoid him hit the brakes and in doing so killed the engine fuck he yelled turning the ignition key he could see colin in the rearview mirror colin was on all fours in the street shaking his head as if to clear it the keble coughed again allie leaned against the door lost in a happy dream just aware enough of her surroundings to mumble choke you gotta pullona choke i know i know neal snapped a little too busy to reflect on the fact that a girl whose bloodstream contained enough drugs to sedate a small town could drive better than he could he pulled the fucking choke the car started and neal once again put it into first colin stumbled to his feet and realized hed been run over by a car he saw his assailant in front of him dead in the water he picked up his stick and was about to attack when the car started to back up slowly at first and then fasterstraight at him neal wasnt such a terrific driver going forward backward he was a complete disaster he tried to stop when he saw colin he really did but when you step on the foot feed instead of the brake you go faster colin did what any smart tough cookie would do he ran and not in a straight line either he zigged lie zagged he ran as fast as a man whos been smashed to the floor bashed in the balls and crashed with a car could run but the little auto kept coming after him as if he had a magnet strapped to his arse neal was trying to do just the opposite but that was the problem lacking any facility for thinking in reverse he made the precise opposite happen of what he intended each time he tried to steer away from the madly fleeing colin he headed right for him it was all pretty confusing especially at that speed colins scream woke up vanessa who had been dozing in the phone box she made a quick assessment of the scene and acted with dispatch stop she yelled as she chased the car down the street stop youre going to kill him stop neal stopped his scrambling feet and hands finally found the right combination and the highperformance vehicle screeched to a sudden halt slamming neal and allie into the dashboard and then flinging them back into their seats as it lunged forward which surprised vanessa who never really thought you could get anybody to actually stop just by yelling stop she was quite pleased with herself until she realized the little auto was now heading toward her and she was about to turn and run when a shout from the window distracted her he broke my nose vanessa crisp bellowed as he hung out the window he broke my fucking nose there were two things about vanessa that became important at this crucial point the first was that of all the players in the game she was the freshest that is to say she wasnt stoned into the enchanted forest and she hadnt been wrestling with a demonic triumph of automotive engineering nor had she smashed her head on the floor had rough sex with a mop handle or had her face smashed by a pan full of ice the second factor was that vanessa was relatively unattractive she had never had a horde of suitors fighting over her and she was bound and determined to hold on to the one she had a man who found her witty sexy and desirable a man who now stood in the window bleeding and disfigured crying for justice so as the car bore down on her vanessa stood her ground neal saw her standing in the middle of the street katiebarthedoor he was on the verge of gaining a semblance of control over this vehicular virago and even managed to slow down as he steered around her mistake youve heard all those stories about mothers lifting mack trucks off their children something about a chemical combination of maternal instincts and adrenaline vanessa had plenty of both going for her as she grabbed the drivers door handle and jumped onto the narrow running board you hurt my baby she screamed as she landed a nifty right hand through the open window onto neals jaw he hit the brake forgetting that damn thing about the clutch and the car shuddered to a stop as neal struggled to find the ignition key vanessa smacked him again in the side of the head you hurt my baby neal tried to push her off with his left hand but she had a death grip on the inside of the window neal glanced at the rearview mirror and saw colin hobbling toward him a stick in his hand and blood in his eye crisp felt ashamed as he looked out the window here was the love of his life and his best friend doing desperate battle in the street and here he was two stories above the fray snug and safe ill save you vanessa he yelled and went looking for a way to make that good nessa offa car allie said sweelly but thinly from her less than commanding position in neals lap jes goin for a ride vanessa was trying her best to pull the drivers door open and vent her full fury on her loves attacker but neal was at the same time holding the door shut and trying to start the car and was doing a pretty remarkable job of it considering the bashing he was taking but it wasnt working so neal let go of the gearshift to get leverage leaned back and popped vanessa square in the chops with an overhand right this girl can really take a punch he thought he had to give her that colin reached for the passenger door to get his hands on that bitch alice before he beat her new boyfriend into bread pudding he had the door half open okay nessa have it your way allie said her patience exhausted she wanted to go for a ride squeezing herself onto neals lap she shoved her left foot down on the clutch yanked the shift into first gear and stepped down hard on the accelerator this keble did just what daddys keble always did it took off like a rabbit on dexedrine neal was surprised when vanessa suddenly dropped from sight as glass shattered all over the roof of the car he didnt have time to think about it though he just had time to grab the wheel as the keble suddenly surged forward which action presented colin with a clear choice let go or lose his arm he took the former course and only rolled fifteen or sixteen times before coming to rest in the street sorry vanessa shouted crisp whose aim with the gin bottle had been off by that much he threw another one at the fleeing car the keble zoomed off into the night with its two fugitives neal gripped the wheel and played with the gearshift allie slept soundly against the door then the damnedest thing happened it started to rain the sky had been saving up all summer for this one and now it really let go it didnt take neal more than four or five minutes of frantic fumbling to figure out the windshield wipers and another minute or so to roll up the windows by which time he was soaked down to his shoulders he pulled the car over to the side of camden high street to check the map the route had seemed simple when hed memorized it earlier but everything looked different on the ground especially when you had a split lip a blossoming shiner and couldnt see a thing through sheets of rain in the dark he decided to take the seven sisters road to the a and the a to the m the major thoroughfare north he didnt even notice that he didnt have any trouble slipping into first gear and easing out onto the street colin hissed with pain as he straddled his motorbike rain he thought bloody rain it hasnt rained in three months and now it has to come down in great awful buckets there is a god he thought and hes a ballstomper well there was nothing to do but head off after them and see whether his luck was changing he turned up the throttle the kid at the gas station was thrilled to death to see neal pull up i need gas fill it up neal said the kid spit a mouthful of water out and answered if its gas you want go to the states we have petrol here whatever it is that makes this car run cars are on a train mate over here we call it an auto you want to stand there getting soaked or you want to hold a comparative linguistics seminar money first then the petrol for your auto neal handed him a tenpound note how do i get on the a he asked when the attendant had finished pumping roundabout straight on second right thanks dont mention it the kid was even more thrilled when some moron on a motorbike roared in little sports car pass by the biker shouted above the din of the rain didnt pass by stopped for petrol where was he going i dont know where he was going but he was using the a to get there how roundabout straight on second right thanks dont mention it neal took it nice and slow in the rain allie was peacefully sleeping and he was in no particular hurryuntil he saw a single headlight in the rearview mirror coming on fast neal slowed down if it was colin he might as well find out now instead of letting him follow them and blow another safe house he was going about forty when colin pulled up along the drivers side pull over colin shouted neal tapped the gas pedal and the keble shot ahead colin kept up with them pull over he shouted he was soaked flushed and furious his white suit clung to him neal tapped the accelerator again forcing colin to speed up neal knew the bike was no match for the keble trouble was he was afraid to go too fast in this rain colin could probably win a game of chicken oh well he thought what the hell he stepped on the pedal again getting a good head of steam and bringing colin speeding up beside him then he hit the brakes the back wheels skidded and turned out and the car sped sideways for a good hundred feet colin sped right past it twisted the brake handle and flipped the little bike over the top of himself neal remembered that old drivingschool bit about turning in the direction of the skid but didnt remember what it meant so he just kept spinning the steering wheel back and forth until the car pointed ahead again and came to a stop he looked in the mirror and saw colin disentangling himself from the bikevery slowly he fought off an insincere urge to go back and see whether he was all right then he put his foot on the gas and took the keble for a ride as fast as he dared all this action actually woke allie up for a second we there yet she asked just looking for a place to park colin watched the taillights of the little car disappear over the hill it had been a very bad night he had lost the book the money the dope alice neal his bike and about a pint of blood he was well and truly fucked neal eased off on the pedal until the keble slowed to something less than the speed of sound now that he didnt have to shift he felt okay driving the thing his heart was settling back into his chest and he was headed for a place he could actually hear it beat part three a place you can hear your heartbeat simons cottage was made of stone neal felt stupid when he thought about the third little pig who was safe when the big bad wolf came huffing and puffing but figured he was glad to be thinking at all tired as he was allie was asleep as he pulled the car slowly up the dirt trail that led through the moor and up to the cottage far below and behind the chimneys of the small village peeked above the last line of trees they had driven north out of the rain and the ground beneath the wheels was hard and firm so he had no trouble pulling up to the cottage leaving allie in the keble he got out stretched his sore legs and back and looked around him hed never been anyplace like this the view commanded miles of the barren moor the cottage sat on a plateau beneath a sharp rocky slope the moor ran fairly level to both his left and right and in front of him the hill ran down to a small stream and a copse of frees and a mile or so beyond that the village faint purple heather scrub grass and rock covered the ground it was windy up here and the cool breeze that dried the stale sweat on his face felt wonderful his eyes ached from fatigue and as he took a deep breath of the fresh air he knew he wanted sleep needed sleep he looked back to make sure allie was still asleep and then walked up to the cottage it was a twostory affair gray stone built around thick wooden beams he found the old skeleton key under a rock right where simon had said it would be and let himself in the first floor was lowceilinged and he stooped even though he really didnt have to a large fireplace dominated the front room which had a stone floor an old wooden table and two old overstuffed chairs a small bedroom ran off to the left it was filled with books no surprise there and a small bed covered with old quilts and a thick army blanket a kitchen of sorts ran off to the back it had creaky wooden counters and a few shelves and cupboards and a woodburning stove there was a basin but no tap a narrow wooden door opened onto the slope of the hill and a stone retaining wall someone had made a weak attempt at gardening out back and a sad rose trellis marked the effort a narrow staircase led from the kitchen up to the second floor which contained three bedrooms each was furnished with quilted beds and cane chairs the whole place had that comfortable discomfort of the beloved getaway old framed photos of simon and family and friends decorated the walls and bedside tables cheap paperbacks and slightly moldy hardcovers lay scattered about neal went back downstairs and out front he found the generator shack read the carefully printed directions thumbtacked to the wall and started it up he might as well he thought have such comforts as electricity an outhouse stood near the generator shack and a cottage he solved the mystery of water when he noticed the well about thirty yards in front of the cottage he cranked the handle and sure enough a bucket of water came up just like in the old movies when the city slicker goes to the country and learns real values he took a sip of the water it was clean and cold and tasted great he hoped he wouldnt die from it a true new yorker he believed that water should come out of faucets hmm well water outhouses a bathtub set in the open air he could get used to this he thought and the quiet he noticed it just then the complete and utter absence of mechanical or human sound he listened way off in the distance perhaps over the hill he could hear the faint sounds of what might have been sheep he could hear the soft gurgling of the brook below him that was all that was it he could hear his heartbeat this was all new stuff to neal carey who thought he had seen it all remembering why he was up here he walked back to the car and opened the passenger door allie was curled up her head resting on the top of the seat she was sticky with dried sweat and her face was puffy and pale the next few hours would be bad neal thought but he had to get it started no more candy for baby allie hey wake up he said shaking her she mumbled a few dark threats and cuddled up into a ball alice cmon up donwanna i dont give a shit what you wanna said neal who was damned if he was going to carry her anymore he still hurt from last night he pulled her out of the seat and let go she tumbled out onto the ground hey she said with more indignation than wit she sat on the ground looking up at him and then looking around it took her only a minute to realize they werent in downtown london where the fuck are we which reminded neal of an old joke about pygmies that he didnt bother relating were on the lam he said he watched her search her memory he watched real carefully how much did allie remember wheres colin i dont know she got up from the ground and brushed herself off i want to go back to london no right now forget it she brushed past him and headed for the drivers door i didnt want to do this neal thought he grabbed her by the elbow stuck his foot behind hers and threw her down she got over her surprise in about half a second and started to get up but he lifted her up by the shoulders and tossed her down on her back she landed hard but got up and headed back toward the car he stood in her way and she took a swing at him a clumsy looping swing that he caught easily turning her wrist and bending her arm in back of her he grabbed her hair with his other hand and forced her to her knees he bent her over until her face grazed the ground it shocked him that he wasnt sorry that this felt good and he wondered whom he was so goddamned angry at and he wondered where his mother was and whether she was even alive and he wondered whether allie was the only fuckedup person on this barren beautiful hill and why he had taken this job in the first place he lifted her up and turned her around so that they were facetoface it didnt help he wanted to hit her hard in the face he wanted to tell himself that he would do it to settle her down to get her in the house part of the job and all but he knew it wasnt true he wanted to hit her because she was a woman and a junkie and a whore just like the girl who hadnt married dear old dad that knowledge sickened him tired him out more than everything hed been through he let go of her shoulders she knew though he saw in her eyes that she had seen it in his the rage the violence she had flinched and braced herself for the slap she knew was coming he saw that to her he was just another man who beat up women the slap didnt come they stood on the windy hill staring at each other neal could hear his heartbeat all right it pounded along with his lungs reaching for breath finally he said i ripped colin off he thinks you helped me i let him think that jesus you asshole who told you to because i dont want you to be with him anymore i dont want you shooting smack anymore the words came out between gulps of air and it was as close to telling the truth as he could go right then he walked past her into the cottage allie caught her breath for a moment and then walked to the car neal was trying to build a fire when she came back in the afternoon had turned suddenly cold he wasnt having much luck and thought that maybe he should have joined the boy scouts instead of friends of the fucking family when she came through the door where are my drugs she demanded somewhere on the m you sleazy cocksucker people who live in glass houses he touched the match to the old newspaper and it caught flame he blew gently on it as hed seen in the movies and had a modest success dont you think its cold in here its fucking freezing thats because youre starting into withdrawal itll get worse there are some wool sweaters upstairs in a wardrobe i suggest you get a couple i suggest you get me some dope or im driving right back to london good idea call colin when you get in im sure hed love to see you he let her draw her own conclusions thanks for fucking up my life youre welcome you at least owe me some dope neal added a small piece of wood to the fire and almost smothered it he shifted things around with the poker and the fire came to life he was concentrating hard on making the fire it settled him down then he took his shot carefully because he knew that she wouldnt be lucid much longer what i owe you he said is ten thousand pounds i figure thats more than fair seeing as you didnt do a goddamn thing to earn it but thats not your fault what i owe you is a chance to get off the junk and stay off because that was also part of our deal no more junk no more dates what deal we didnt make any deal yeah we did feeding the ducks there are all kinds of ways to make a deal alice sometimes its on paper sometimes its in words and sometimes its just understood we had an understanding and you know it youre crazy okay how crazy am i i have the books and i have you i cool out here for a while then go back to the states i call the buyer he gets on the next plane and i get twenty thousand pounds crazy okay he poked the wood around a little more as hed seen in the movies he could feel allie thinking behind him now lets ask how crazy you are he said ill give you give you half the money ten thousand pounds all you have to do is get off the stuff come to the states with me and still be clean when i make the sale her hands were starting to shake soon her whole body would start in why she asked why would you do that for me she wasnt grateful she was suspicious that was okay with neal suspicion was easier to deal with im not doing it for you im doing it for me i dont get it what a surprise listen you didnt think i was going to trust colin to hide me out and keep me safe did you why would colin take half when he could get it all hed stab me in the back literallythe second i turned it on him i was always planning to screw him just like he was always planning to screw me i didnt plan on liking you i didnt want to leave you behind to be on the street for colin until he used you up and booted you out so i took you we can say it was against your will if thatll make you feel better but we both know the truth maybe you think shut up and listen so now that ive got you what do i do with you we have some time to spend together up here and i dont want to have to tie you up and all that shit i dont want to have to worry about you running off to the cops screaming that youve been kidnapped and i especially dont want you deciding that heroin and hooking are your true lifestyle and getting to a phone and taking your chances with old colin yeah so yeah so im making you my partner i want you to have a rooting interest in my survival there are going to be a lot of angry people looking for me over the next few months and i dont want you standing there pointing and saying he went thataway i wouldnt do that lets just say im giving you a little motivation she tried to come up with her best spoiledbrat smile the same one hed seen her use with colin motivate me with some smack no why not because i need to trust you and i wont trust a junkie junkies will do anything you get the money if and when youre off the stuff she was starting to shake but she was also listening it took an effort so you think you can buy me sure ten thousand pounds current exchange rate about sixteen thousand dollars you could be a very comfortable runaway for a long time on sixteen large if you dont have a habit to support its called a fresh start and they dont come around too often not this easily anyway id take it if i were you her eyes were starting to tear up pretty soon her knees would start to rattle and her ears would hum and it would be no good talking to her the smack would do all the talking and she would listen it was starting already what if i dont take your deal what if i say no you wont im only doing what you told me you wanted keep you off the smack and off the street she put her hands over her ears and shook her head thinking was hardher junkie body was telling her brain to get out of the way i cant get off the junk neal i cant i thought i wanted to but i cant ill help you what do you mean help me he turned away from the fire to look at her i mean help you couple of hours things are going to get bad for you youre going to get pretty sick ill help you get through it she looked scared it surprised him hed never seen her look scared before she said who are you marcus welby i know a little bit about this stuff you were a junkie no i wasnt a junkie i just know about it yeah okay diane more secrets more holding back more not trusting fuck you why is every woman in my life coming to visit just now allie started to pace around the room she ran her hands over the stone walls you bastard you prick you got me into this why couldnt you just leave me alone good goddamn question i dont want to quit she continued her pacing picked up neal saw she was starting to panic i can i just dont want to i like it all right who the fuck are you to do this to me another good goddamn question neal stirred his coffee allie sat on the floor she wrapped her arms around her knees and hung her head on her hands she started to rock slowly at first then faster and harder back and forth neal barely heard her crying and when he looked over he had to look hard to see the tears wetting her face the pain in his chest felt like his heart breaking he fought it it was like his body was wrapped in barbed wire and he couldnt move it was like being ten years old and watching his mother fight it and lose and walk out of the apartment and come back stoned it was the rage he felt and the hatred and the contempt and the heartbreak and it wrapped him up so tightly he wanted to scream he remembered stroking his mothers head with a wet cloth and holding her hand and telling her it was all right she could do it but she couldnt not for him not for her and he hated her for it for leaving him for loving it more than him for what she did to get it he heard allies quiet choking sobs and saw her hugging herself holding on to herself and he couldnt move damn it why couldnt he move grief and anger kept him pressed into the chair and he couldnt breathe and he wanted to scream to yell to shout out his fury and he couldnt instead he got up and went over to her and sat down beside her and held her while she rocked she grabbed his wrist and he rocked her then back and forth saying i know i know he left her a little while later to build a fire in the oven to heat water for tea he couldnt find any sugar but there was a large jar of honey in the cupboard he spooned a large dollop into the tea and held the cup while she sipped at it then he rocked her some more colin was in trouble he knew it as soon as he wheeled his bike down the old home street and saw two chinese hanging around the corner they were dickie huans boys and no mistake and colin flashed on the meat cleaver doing its bit on his fingers and he turned the bike around the two lazy effin bastards hadnt seen him and he headed toward east london and the old neighborhood hoping crisp would have the sense to do the same thing he didnt of course his first instinct was to find colin so he trudged dutifully back to the flat some good hash and a pint had helped to soothe his pains and as he turned the corner to home he was even thinking that the new facial arrangement might make him more interestinglooking he wont be here vanessa said pouting her head hurt her man looked as if hed been at a football game and she figured that cola had fucked everything up anyway well wait they didnt notice the leatherclad chinese kids on the corner chinese usually just fought chinese and stayed in their own neighborhoods so crisp had no problem with them he just wanted to quaff a couple more pints toss some dollers and go to bed it just wasnt his night they were good these chinese kids they gave the two kweilo the shittylooking boy and his strange girlfriend enough of a head start and then followed them into the building and up the stairs timing it so they arrived at the door just as crisp was opening it the larger one jumped crisp from behind hauled him through the door and landed on his back he drew the knife out and stuck it in crisps neck just enough to bring a trickle of blood the other one put a revolver to vanessas head and pulled the hammer back she kept her mouth shut wheres colin the big one asked edging up the pressure of the blade the day had really gone to shit crisp thought it really had dunno he owes money i dunno where he is he owes money ill get some let me up you know where he is it wasnt a question no i dont the chinese kid stuck the point of the stiletto into crisps ear just short of the eardrum crisp wondered whether the incredible thump of his own heart pounding was the last thing hed hear you know where colin is hes on a bike chasing some americans who stole his money the sound of vanessa shouting this surprised crisp who was trying to lie absolutely perfectly still he breathed a little then he felt the blade slip out of his ear what might be described as a heavy silence ensued finally the aural surgeon asked colin doesnt have the money he didnt sound real pleased colin wasnt exactly filled with delight to be skulking back to the old neighborhood either but he could go under here get lost and stay lost at least until he could figure out a way of finding neal and getting his money because if he didnt he was finished in london it isnt easy trail someone who knows you especially when your mark also knows youre a detective and especially when youre working on the same case it makes for a long day however joe graham didnt care how long the days were or the nights he did care that the last tune he had heard from neal carey the boy was trapped and about to get it but good and he also cared cared a whole lot about what neal had told him on the phone that hed been set upby their old buddy ed levine from some angles it made sense there were no files in the office on allies previous adventures and there should have been so maybe ed had destroyed them and ed was working real closely with john chase and ed was ambitious and senator chase had been diddling his stepdaughter which didnt make good campaign material so maybe it was possible that ed had sent neal to london not to make sure that allie came home but to make sure she didnt and ed hated neal so maybe it was possible that old ed was cleaning a bunch of troubles off his desk and settling an old score maybe but then from other angles it just didnt fit hed worked with ed for over ten years and in ten years you get to know a guy and ed had a good career going already why fuck it up to go with a prick like chase and ed wasnt the sort of guy who stands for somebody abusing a kid he had proved that in an alley years ago which was another thinged liked to settle his scores in person if he wanted a piece of neal hed take it himself no neal was wrong it wasnt ed unless ed was following orders from kitteredge who got them from chase no that wasnt possible the man wouldnt do that not for a crummy vicepresidential candidate not for the prez himself it couldnt be kitteredge either so who else who had access to information keyess address the answer was where it always was on the street and it wasnt easy staying on the street with a guy who knows who you are but now they were dealing with me joe graham thought and im the best there is i taught neal carey everything he knows how did you find me neal asked graham neal was nineteen then and disgusted graham had given him the simple assignment to get lost in a city of some million people graham had found him in two days graham smiled his filthy smile and looked around the small thirdfloor apartment on waverly place easy i told you to get lost and you didnt so you got found neal wasnt in the mood for this bullshit spring break was too short and he had a paper on the romantic poets to write he had seen this stupid training exercise as an opportunity to get some work done are you going to be cryptic or are you going to tell me he asked whats cryptic does it mean smart smarter than a stupid nineteenyearold who picks a classmates apartment to get lost in are you going to get me a coffee or anything ill have to grind some oh yeah this is the village i forgot he pointed to his crotch grind this just make some coffee you know if you were the fugitive that series would have been over after the first episode youre easier to find than rice on mott street neal took some expensive mocha blend out of the refrigerator he had bought it specially to help him work on the paper the coffee shop around the corner was his favorite in the city are you going to lecture me or just sit there he asked graham there were days many of them when he hated graham im going to lecture you im just dragging it out because im enjoying it so much you see neal when you want to get lost the first thing you got to lose is yourself you got to become a different person otherwise you bring all your habits and likes and dislikes and all your connections with you anybody who knows you has a good shot at finding you and i know you son yes you do dad i know you got this spring vacation i even know you got a thing to write i know you want peace and quiet i also know youre too cheap to rent a hotel room even though friends would have picked up the bill and i know you havent got your drivers license so you didnt drive out into the country where you probably should have gone neal carefully poured the ground coffee into the filter and measured out the water in the carafe i hate the country so where is neal going to find a place from a classmate who lives off campus but is going away on a nice little student vacation so your dad gives you this assignment and then does some asking around now i know neal isnt going out to queens or brooklyn because he wants to enjoy himself and i know hes not staying on the upper west side because he doesnt want to bump into his dad on the street but he also doesnt have the discipline to stay inside and really hide like he should and i know hes not going to the east side because its all rich people and hes prejudiced against them and i remember how many times neal has told me that if he ever left the west side he would move to the village so it became a simple matter of elimination and a little legwork how many of neals classmates live in the village and are going to florida for spring break one neal was disgusted i only waited the two days so you could get some work done on your paper so you dont flunk out and embarrass me neal looked at him with true awe thats amazing that really is thats like sherlock holmes right also you wrote down the address on your phone pad you broke into my apartment i have a key neal was confused yeah but i took the note with me i remember ripping it off the pad and putting it in my pocket are we going to drink the coffee or admire its delicate aroma its not done yet and tell me you tell me neal thought for a minute then he knew he was so goddamned angry at himself he wanted to scream i wrote the note with a ballpoint pen and it left an impression on the next page thats right youre an idiot i am but youre a live idiot graham stood up walked over to neal and took him by the collar with his one real hand listen son anytime you have to disappear its serious you disappear because you have to now your fuckup with the notepad made it easy but i would have found you anyway for all the reasons i told you when you disappear you dont leave anything behind except yourself you become somebody else or youll get found and the next time you get found it might not be me but someone who wants to kill you you got that son yes dad graham let go of him good now get lost ill drink the coffee neal walked down the stairs and onto the street two days later he was unhappily ensconced in a sleeping bag in a state park in rhode island he hated every minute of it graham didnt find him however getting off heroin wont kill you problem is you wish it would the body is a vindictive fucker it wants what it wants and when it cant get it it starts dreaming up ways to motivate you runny nose runny eyes aching joints aching muscles it makes your skin crawl and your nerves jump it makes you shake rattle and roll you get cold freezing cold and then you get colder and you think youre going to shake apart actually shake to bits you start to breathe in short nasal snorts and exhale in long sighs and groans sometimes the floor starts pitching like the deck of a small ship in a big storm and then you just want to lie there and hold on to your knees because they hurt so much and if you could just get warm neal wrapped allie in blankets she shivered anyway as she stalked the bedroom trying to walk away the ache and the cold she cant take much more captain she said huh didnt you ever watch star trek when captain kirk would make scotty take it up to warp eight and the enterprise would start shaking and scotty would get on the intercom and say she cant take much more captain and then theyd all tilt from one side to the other yeah right but then it would be okay until the next week give me something i dont have any please i threw it all away he was sitting on the bed she dropped to her knees in front of him ill blow you she said alice i will im good cmon he said lifting her up walk ill help you he put his arm around her shoulder as they paced the room neal im not going to make it through the night yeah you will ill die no you wont yeah you will no you wont brilliant stuff neal thought maybe you can open up an office charge forty bucks an hour and say yeah you will no you wont he almost wished he hadnt thrown the smack away this girl was hurting bad and his record at getting women off heroin wasnt so great im scared she said me too wrong answer you asshole youre scared now you fucking tell me this whole thing was your goddamn idea she started to laugh youre scared she was laughing as she started pounding on his chest and his arms with her fists her laughter quickly turned to tears the cramps started later she tried to throw up but couldnt and her retching dry heaves hurt as much as the cramps neal held her from behindone hand on her neck and the other pressed into her lower stomach muscles between heaves he draped her head with a cool cloth and talked to her telling her shed get past it shed be okay that she wouldnt die he sang her songs whatever lullabies he could remember from his mothers snatches of maternal cogency he summarized the plots of star trek episodes playing all the parts and making the noises of phasers and communicators they played games name a rock group for every letter of the alphabet the angry aardvarks the zony zebras sing the theme music from old tv shows they got the brady bunch but couldnt recall the partridge family morning came at last neal thought it had probably been the toughest night of his life he knew it had been the hardest of allies she had sweated it out hung tough all those good cliches now she was finally asleep with the dawn had come a little peace he needed it it had been a night spent with a tortured allie and a night spent with his own ghosts a girl that he could help a mother he couldnt a thousand memories of that woman in pain and need and a little boy unable to do a thing who hated her for it hating himself for it but on this night in the here and now he had helped and they got through it together as he slumped in his chair watching allie sleep getting rested for the next paroxysm of need that would hit her he realized that his rage was gone the sorrow would always be there he knew but the rage was gone maybe there is a god he thought and he sent me allie chase allie didnt know where she was when she woke up a while later she sat up with a start then noticed neal and managed a weak smile then she leaned over and threw up into the bucket neal had put there for the purpose i love morning dont you neal asked receiving a muttered obscenity in reply he tossed her a damp cloth to wipe her face she tried to get out of bed but her legs were wobbly neal grabbed her elbow and helped her up they made a shaky trip down the stairs and he plunked her down in a chair in front of the fireplace it took him a couple of minutes to get the fire started and then he carried a smoldering stick into the kitchen and lit the woodburning stove he put the water on for tea and spooned a large dollop of honey into allies cup you okay in there he yelled terrific he took the sarcastic tone as a good sign be right in yip yip he looked out the window while he waited for the water to boil up the hill to his left he could just make out a small dog hustling a herd of sheep along the crest he wondered where the shepherd was and how far away he lived surely hed notice the smoke from simons chimney and maybe stop by for a cup and a chat neal started to work on some lies to tell in that eventuality lost in mendacity he was startled by the shrill whistle of the kettle he dumped what he figured was a couple of teaspoons of smoky black tea into the bottom of the pot and poured the boiling water over it then he swished the pot gently a few times and let it set he found the strainer and a tray and took everything over by the fire where he poured allie the first cup drink he ordered yummy ill throw it up she warned jesus christ we wouldnt want you to throw up she took the cup and sipped sweet enough bitch bitch bitch thats what i am neal shook his head what im not a bitch yeah you are but i think its more of a habit than a permanent condition i like being a bitch are you hungry her look of total disdain answered his question i am he said then eat he found some oatmeal cookies in a cupboard and took them back in is today going to be as bad as yesterday she looked like a scared child it reminded neal how young she really was no you wont get as violently sick youll be real jittery though and youll get the aches again but not as bad how come you know so much about this i read a lot can i have a cookie he handed her the bag knock yourself out they sat quietly for a few minutes then she said i dont suppose theres like a radio in this hole theres like not sure make fun she got out of the chair slowly it looked as if it hurt she walked over to the front window and looked out pretty yeah more brilliant repartee neal thought i stink dont get so down on yourself no i mean i smell like bad so much for dr carey and positive reinforcement do you want to take a bath like yes she smiled back at him if you can make fun of me she was telling him so can i like okay wheres the bathroom i dont remember outside get real thats as real as it gets she lookod at him real hard next time i pick the hotel next time cmon ill show you where it is it took them a good five minutes to walk the hundred feet to the tub she was like an old lady they stopped twice while she bent over to ease the soreness in her lower back he hadnt planned to heat water for her but then he figured it would make her feel better ill get a chair you can sit outside for a while airll do you good what are you going to do heat the goddamn water how come youre being so nice im a jerk then can i have more tea he took the cup from her and strode back into the cottage student private eye butler may i help you it took forever to heat enough water for even a shallow bath hed check on her every few minutes look out to see that she was still in her chair and not gimping in the direction of the village to get the next bus back to london and the needle never trust a junkie he thought but she stayed in her chair dozing off from time to time or watching the sheepdog work his flock the awkward moment came when the water was ready neal poured it into the tub saving a bucket to rinse off with handed her a towel and started to walk away to give her privacy she got up stared at the tub stared at neal stared at the tub and then back at neal again what i dont think i can get in she tried lifting her left leg to demonstrate she could barely lift her foot to knee level you want me to help you he asked without the trace of a leer id have to get undressed she objected in front of you a shy hooker he thought the proverbial new wrinkle alice dont you get undressed in front of men all the time thats different theyre strangers he appreciated the inverted logic that made what she said make sense okay ill turn my back you get undressed ill help you into the tub as quickly as i can then ill go away you call me and well reverse the process i dont know the waters getting cold if youre not getting in i will she thought about it for a second neal checked her out to see whether this was just a hooker game a little hideandseek seducethecop game but she looked shy just then she really did okay but dont look where you dont have to think of me as your doctor i could tell you stories he turned around and heard her fumbling with her clothes her hands being none too steady it took a couple of minutes then he heard a long sigh before she said ready he tried to focus on her eyes but you know what its like when you try not to look at something her body was beautiful and neal quickly dismissed the sinking feeling in his gut come on before the water gets cold she said she was blushing and the gooseflesh must have come from the crisp morning air she crossed her arms over her breasts and looked away from him it might have been the sexiest gesture he had ever seen turn around he said what so i can lift you into the tub idiot you dont have to get mad im not mad you sound mad she turned around and neal made a determined effort not to look at her as he held her around her waist and struggled her into the tub she let out an unholy shriek as she hit the water getting cold this is boiling itll feel great in a minute i thought you were going to go inside on my way he talked as he walked now dont try to get out on your own you could fall and hit your head he realized he sounded like somebodys mother i have to get out of this business he thought he went inside and drank two cups of tea and ate six oatmeal cookies neal what i wanna get out okay she had spent a good half hour lying in the bath he had looked out every few minutes well she was in a tub you couldnt see anything to make sure she hadnt drowned or run away when he came out of the cottage she was sitting up her hair full of suds rinse me she asked i cant bend over to get my head in the water he poured the bucketful over her head and she shook her hair out like a wet dog she held her hand out and he turned her and lifted her out of the tub their bodies touched as he set her on her feet on the ground he let go of her quickly and wrapped a towel around her wed better get inside he said and started walking her to the cottage she did much better this time and only needed a little support climbing the stairs she got dressed in some old clothes he had found they were too big for her but the pants stayed up with a belt and the jersey was comfortably baggy neal was stoking the fire when she came downstairs all on her own she stepped gingerly into the sitting room neal yeah i need some smack she came into his arms and cried for a long time colin hated living this way he had scrunched himself down in his granddas flat a dingy cellar in the old east end he had a mattress in the corner of the sitting room and he could see the street through the one tiny window he tried hard not to watch every pair of feet that came by but the thought that dickie huan was tracking him down made it tough the room was a pit a real trash heap and the old man smelled bad what with the steady diet of cheap sausage and cheaper beer plus the filthy old codger watched telly every second that he wasnt down to the pub and he liked those quiz shows where fat old bags in pink frocks won holidays to brighton for knowing the christian names of every prime minister since christ was a road guard or the titles of every ultraboring song they used to sing before they took a quick poke up the old canal and started breeding if colin had to sit through one more episode of poldark he thought he would just let dickie huan slice and dice him into pigeon feed it might be less painful and the old one couldnt shut up either not for a moment he engaged in a neverending monologue about the war and then it was gerry this and gerry that until colin would scream out that he wished gerry had won the bleeding war anyway so that at the least the beer would be worth drinking or the old boy would maintain a running dialogue with the quizshow contestants shouting out the answers all of them wrong and then heaping abuse on the stupid cows when they rejected his wellintentioned advice his other hobby was getting on colin he enjoyed the spectacle of his bigshot grandson creeping hack to the old neighborhood to hide out and he never let colin forget that he owed his existence to the old mans sufferance the dirty drunken bastard would deliver lengthy soliloquies about the evils of drugs and fancy ladies about ponces and hores and dope peddlers and above all poofters and buggerboys he was convinced or pretended to be that colin fell into the last category so he made sure to spice his anecdotes with references to sodomites and bumjockeys he had known in the navy replete with tales of dark and murky deeds done in hammocks yere not such an effin great deal now are ye colin lad hed ask while gumming a sausage wi yer toff suits of clothes and yer leather shoes all nice and shiny now yer content to have a cup of tea with yer old gentlemans gentleman who ye havent bothered to as much as send a pack of fags to and a year gone past no you were too good then wi yer hores and yer poofters and floggin dope like a chinaman which brought up a touchy subject his grandda had tremendous stamina for such an old croaker colin thought as the coot launched into yet another diatribe against him colins only solace was that his grandmother had died so he didnt have to listen to this in stereo colin tuned him out and reflected on his own misery not only did he not have alice with her delicious body and the delicious things she did with it neither did he have his twenty thousand quid that bastard neal had done him out of worse than that his hardwon drug and prostitution business which he had spent years building up was going to skat because colin didnt dare show his face aboveground lest he be chopped into tuesdays lunch special which brought him back to brooding about neal who had caused this whole mess and here he was living in a root cellar with a crazy old man who smelled like a dead goat dribbled his breakfast egg down his one decent shirt and talked to the telly werent you the one colin asked himself who swore hed get out of this neighborhood and never come back now look at you colin lad with one shirt to your own back and afraid to go home he had to find neal and alice and that was an end to it life was no holiday for crisp these days either what with two chinamen following him every step that he took they had let him up off the floor that night pushed him around a little for emphasis and told him theyd be watching him hed better lead them to colin they said or they would hold him responsible for the money the girl too and they gave their opinion that it would take this girl one long time to work off twenty thousand pounds so now they followed him not even bothering to be subtle about it confident that he was frightened enough to lead them straight to colin he would too if he could figure out where the bugger had got to he wasnt anywhere on the main drag or on kings highway or at paddington or victoria or any of the clubs he had buggered off left his old china no pun intended holding the old bag he was probably in france by now soaking up the rays on the beach but crisp wasnt going to tell his twin shadows that they might get upset and go back to work with the knife so for the time being he settled for the uneasy status quo and wandered around london as if he was looking for someone sod colin anyway sod and double sod him in his mind colin kept going back to the flat on regents park road to be sure it was a painful and humiliating memory and he knew he had made mistakes there but he knew it was his only starting point as he lay on the filthy mattress he went over it again and again asking himself the same questions whose flat was it why bad neal gone there to sell a book perhaps or perhaps to take one home colin knew only one way to find out much to his surprise neal liked mornings best he had always been a night person but in the cool and quiet of the yorkshire mornings he found contentment of a sort he got up long before allie who still had tough nights a week after her last fix as she slept off her exhaustion neal would start the fire in the stove and fireplace and then haul water to the bathtub hed force himself into the cold water even coming to the point where he found it refreshing hed wash his hair quickly towel off and trot back inside to stand by the fire hed put the water to the boil make himself a strong pot of tea generously heaping in milk and sugar then hed make toast over the open fire and eat it outside with his second cup of tea all he found missing was a newspaper but after a few days he hadnt even missed that he didnt care about who was killing whom or even how the yankees were doing it didnt seem to matter up here sometimes in the early cool of morning he thought about just disappearing and not dealing at all with the troubles he knew were waiting he recognized it as a fantasygraham would track him down through keyes he would run out of money allie would recover and want to move on with their dealbut he was surprised at its appeal the quiet and seclusion were powerful drugs he started to forget about colin about john chase even about levine fucking him over thered be a time to deal with all of that not necessarily this morning howeveror any particular morning so sometimes hed read a book along with the second and third cup and other times hed just sitsomething he never thought hed doand enjoy the morning as it brightened and warmed hed watch the mist clear over the wood in the valley and watch the shepherd and his dog move their sheep over the crest of the ridge hed have maybe an hour of this quiet before allie would wake up he would hear her pad down the creaky stairs stop and look for him in the kitchen and then come outside she would bring her cup with her and pour the last tea out of the pot she liked it sticky sweet and would spread gobs of butter and jam on the toast hed make for her they spoke little on these early mornings sometimes she would tell him about her dreams from the night before but mostly they just sat and listened to the morning sometimes she would fall asleep in her chair for a few minutes and he would know that her dreams had been bad and her sleep shaky other mornings she would light one of her few remaining cigarettes and smoke it slowly with deep long drags shed sit far back in her chair and stare at the sky and neal didnt have to ask or wonder about what she was thinking it was always allie who broke their reverie suddenly standing up and carrying the teapot and cups back into the cottage shed come back a few minutes later dressed and her hair brushed and gently kick the leg of his chair where he would be taking a catnap he would get up and they would walk over the top of the hill the first time they did this three days into her withdrawal they made slow progress and she leaned on his arm for the few minutes that they walked he knew it embarrassed her he watched her determination take over as their morning walk became a symbol of her independence her shift from passive victim to active participant and he always let her set the pace she was recovering quickly the crest of the hill was a revelation as it sloped steeply on the other side to a deeply wooded valley which lay in stark contrast to the bleak beauty of the moor the first few times that they climbed to the crest they were content to stay there and enjoy the view the short tufts of stubby grass and heather giving way to the lush green meadow a brook and then the wood but on the third morning allie wordlessly set off down the slope leaving him to follow or not he did staying well behind her letting her lead them to the side of the brook he sat down beside her on a fallen log she was puffing fighting for air and her face was flushed with the effort she was smiling they sat for a long time until she could catch her breath and the climb back up to the cottage was hard for them both youre going to owe me sixteen thousand dollars mister she said between gasps and ill have earned every penny after that they pushed their walk a little farther every day they found some stones on which they could cross the brook without getting wet and it led to a natural footpath through the thick green wood it was cool in there cool and dark birds they didnt recognize fled in short hops in front of them scolding them for their intrusion sometimes neal and allie would sit in the dark of the wood and listen to the birds other times they would walk straight through and come out the other side to a meadow bordered by a rail fence the meadow was ovalshaped and at the far end was a narrow gate that opened onto a trail leading back up the slope to the open moor some mornings they arrived to find the shepherd there the old man would lean on the rails of the fence smoking a pipe a shotgun cradled in his arm as he directed the efforts of his dog the frenetic border collie would gather the sheep into a rough circle and then the shepherd would shout gate and the dog would drive the sheep headlong through the gate and up the trail barking and nipping at recalcitrant heels other times the shepherd would walk well ahead his mind on foxes and stouts and neal and allie would hear his shout from a distance the dog didnt care he knew his job the voice was good enough this ritual became a favorite part of their day and they tried to time the walk to the rhythms of the dog and the shepherd as allie got stronger she would push herself farther leading them out of the meadow and up the hill on the other side much to their surprise and delight they found a small deep pond over the opposite hill and decided that one afternoon they would go back and swim the return walk was usually slow and leisurely but they rarely spoke it was as if they feared words would bring the real world back and the real world was too full of memories and pain and problems and heroin and colin and heroin the walk always made them hungry after the first week neal trusted her enough to leave her at the cottage while he hiked down into the village to replenish their stores he didnt want to attract any more attention than he had to by bringing the keble london plates and all into the tiny village for lunch they would have bread cheese and fruit canned soup on colder days sometimes thick slices of ham with mustard allies appetite improved by the day and neal always ate like a pregnant horse anyway so lunch was a big occasion they ate outside when the weather let them on a table they had made from an old door and two sawhorses they drank cold tea syrupy lemonade or plain water neal would have loved a beer warm or no but was afraid to let allie have any and equally reluctant to be selfish by drinking in front of her they napped after lunch she would fall exhausted into her own bed in the large bedroom while neal would settle into his own bed in a guest room at first he didnt sleepsuspicious that this nap bit was a dodge for her to sneak off but she was truly tired especially if it had been a rough night and the exercise and fresh air did her in him too hed try to read but would fall asleep after a few minutes one of those deep heavy sleeps one afternoon they climbed the stairs together arriving at their respective doors at the same time they stood in the hall for a long moment before neal turned and went into his room he shut the door behind him and realized that he had never done that before he opened it quickly to see her standing there looking hurt and scared and they both laughed a nervous laugh she reached out and took his hand gave it a quick and gentle squeeze and went into her room she left the door open he went to his own bed and flopped down on it jesus neal he thought just jesus thats all he meant to brood on the whole thing for a long time but fell asleep instead after that afternoon it became another ritual they would climb the stairs together pause in the hallway she would squeeze his hand and they would go to their separate beds they would sleep for a couple of hours or so rising in the late afternoon to start the preparations for their supper and her bath she began to take over the chore of heating her own water and after a couple of days could easily manage getting in and out of the tub to neals simultaneous relief and regret the late afternoons could get heavy with doubts and fears sneaking in with the approaching dark she would really start to feel the need again and get jumpy and edgyhostile it often rained in the late afternoon the day brooding along with them the dark sky mocking their darker thoughts she of dope and parents and lover left behind he of the reality that was coming fast as summer waned of those same parents and friends of the family and nominations to high office and decisions that could not be put off much longer they thought about a truth she didnt want to know and he didnt want to tell so it was a tense silence that colored their lateafternoon teas forced inside by the weather they would sit by the fire and sip their tea pointedly reading old paperbacks and the quiet was not something they shared but something that divided them they were in the cottage for two weeks when the visitor came neal returned from a supply run in the village one afternoon to find allie pouring tea for the shepherd the collie lay by the fire savoring an oatmeal cookie the shotgun was in the corner behind the door pardon the intrusion the shepherd said getting up my name is hardin ive seen you work the sheep neal said looking at allie who gave him a warm domestic smile hardin continued the missus tells me youre here on honeymoon bit different that okay allie neal thought if you want to play actually im working on a book deal honey i thought you wanted to keep it a secret neal is very shy mr hardin its his first big sale yeah she wanted to play all right lot of money in books is there hardin asked he had a face like crinkly leather etched by wind and sun gray eyes peeked shyly out from under heavy gray eyebrows and his shy smile cracked the heavy bush of his gray beard long silver hairs flourished in his ears he looked woolly like an old ram in this one were hopingmay i warm that up for you allie asked she was having fun and neal had not seen her have much fun before perhaps your mister would like some hardin said gently im sorry darling ill be right back hardin stuck his hand out just to make it proper ivor hardin neal carey ohh your wife uses her maiden yes she does whatever it is whats the dogs name jim good name good dog allie returned with a mug of tea for neal then sat down she had a couple of hundred questions for hardin about being a shepherd and he was totally charmed by the time he had taken three more cups of tea and five more oatmeal cookies he lived alone it turned out and had for some years and jim was the only company he usually had mr keyes made it up only a few times a year anymore so hardin wasnt used to seeing folks in the cottage not folks as pretty as the missus meaning no offense life on the moor is lonely to be sure he allowed but i wouldnt live anywhere else and the dog is used to it its as hard to find a good working dog these days as it is to find a good working man and when jim gives it up i expect i will too move to the village and become a nuisance to the widows i cant imagine you as a nuisance allie said and neal believed she meant it kind of you missus me already having eaten half your biscuits next time i come calling ill shoot the rooks out of your garden to pay for my pudding he pointed his beard at the shotgun and winked we dont have a garden allie said i know hardin answered springing his little joke everyone laughed except jim whod probably heard it already hardin finished off his tea put an oatmeal cookie in his coat pocketfor jimand said his thankyous and goodbyes allie told him to stop in anytime and he did usually around teatime it was after one of hardins visits after an hour or so of playing house that allie lapsed into a sudden quiet she fidgeted for about twenty minutes then asked so when we get back to the states and sell the book split up the money then what he was ready with a clever response what do you mean i go my way you go yours if i knew my way allie i dont know oh she got up and went into the kitchen and came back a minute later with a fresh cup of tea i thought you kind of liked me she said standing behind him i do so why havent you done anything about it neal had never really known what the word nonplussed meant now he thought he knew jesus christ i kidnapped you what more could i do neal got up and took a walk in the rain he was drenched when he came back and just as confused as when he had left she met him at the door with a towel and a blanket then hurried into the kitchen returning with a hot cup of tea youre crazy she said as she rubbed his head with the towel i wont argue with you like they say in the movies she said in a mock scolding tone youd better get out of those wet things before you catch your death of cold neal climbed the stairs wondering just what the hell was going on with him it had started out to be a pretty straightforward job and turned into something different youre adrift he thought and drifting further away cut off from friends playing house with a teenage girl and the only crazy thing you havent done so far is go to bed with her did you just say so far jesus christ it was july time was running out and he didnt know what to do or how to do it supper that night was a simple repast of boiled potatoes and cold sliced ham and was quieter than usual the creak of the bedroom door woke neal allie was standing there clad in the plaid flannel shirt theyd found in one of the chests you okay he asked i need to talk to you why do the chase women always need to talk to me in the middle of the night neal wondered allie sat down on the edge of the bed inspiring in neal a simultaneous anxiety and a faith in genetics she started deliberately and slowly as if shed rehearsed and worried over each word there are things you need to know about me thats funny allie there are things you need to not know about me if were going to be partners she continued go ahead neal said feeling guilty allie he thought i already know i god this is so hard i didnt just run away i mean for just no reason same thing for the drugs i mean i know im screwed up she stopped and hung her head staring down at the rough fabric of the army blanket you dont have to tell me anything neal said were partners anyway i want to its been on my mind neal nodded my father i know baby i know slow tears dropped on the blanket he he and i no he used to neal forced himself to look at her forced himself to lift her chin and look her in the eyes i guess she said the word is incest he stroked her cheek im sorry i am so sorry the drugs helped me to forget and the sex i guess it helped me to get even i dont know neal felt her tears on his shoulder you can take away her pain he thought not all of it but a lot if you had half her courage you would tell her the truth hes not your father allie you have to live with a lot but you dont have to live with that hes not your father but if i tell you now i might blow it all and i dont have the guts to risk it and im sorry so instead he said its all right its all right it doesnt make a difference its behind you now its behind you im never going back you dont have to you dont have to he chanted softly until she fell asleep and he pulled her down beside him you dont have to betrayal he thought is the only ending to any undercover what do you think hes up to levine asked graham they were sweating out a hot afternoon in the new york office he hasnt called in hes checked out of the hotel if hes at the safe house hes not answering hes disappeared whats he up to graham wished he knew since the night of neals phone call he had worried his head off he had kept a close eye on the british papers and had seen nothing about an assault never mind a murder and he had called keyess apartment a hundred times if hed called it once neal had disappearedgotten lostjust as hed taught him but why hadnt he checked back in because he still thought that ed was dirty that there was a leak in the organization then why hadnt he gotten in touch with his old dad called him at mckeegans does he think im dirty now that im in on it no neal couldnt think that a worse option came to mind maybe neal hadnt escaped the trap maybe he was a prisoner somewhere or worse graham didnt want to believe it couldnt believe it neal carey was too good hed have gotten out and taken the client out with him but where or had neal decided that one doublecross deserved another taken the girl somewhere to cut a deal on his own or had the little fuckhead gone soft and fallen in love with her jesus christ weve got what ten days levine asked eleven lombardi said you think youre going to hear from him maybe he has allie and is working on some deal of his own maybe said graham levine looked at him real strange angry neal carey is a snotty little bastard but hes not a doublecrosser not with us ed said it firmly and to both of them ed was pissed thought graham hey you sent a head case to get a head case lombardi said theyre probably shooting up together shoot this said graham with an appropriate gesture hey are you boys finished ed asked because we have a problem to work out here lombardi stood up no you have a problem to work out here i have a problem to work out in newport one very angry senator graham handed lombardi his seersucker sport coat so go to newport he said let us know if allies home have you looked under the bed thats enough levine said lombardi gave graham a look that was meant to be tough maybe when this is all over he said you can get a job in a casino people can put quarters in your mouth and pull my arm is that the best you can do hey youre the clown lombardi picked up his briefcase and made his exit i should have gone to law school said levine its not too late ed plopped himself down on his desk and looked through the chase file for the thousandth time or pretended to then he said what are you not telling me joe nothing wheres the kid do i know do you no graham said with righteous indignation hey look out the window would you what neal and allie are out there no see if that fuck lombardi has left the building stupid shit forgot his wallet good come on ed looked he must still be in the elevator ill catch him yell at him when he comes out its seven floors you got lungs give him one of those kungfooey yells id like to ed muttered as graham headed out the door graham pressed the elevator button and went right to work when it came a sevenfloor ride was ample to memorize the creditcard numbers but he wasnt as young as he used to be colin couldnt stop sweating and it wasnt the heat as he maneuvered his motorbike through the outskirts of the city he could feel a hundred pairs of slanted eyes on him his mind creating gruesome pictures of flashing knives and cleavers it wasnt logical he knew that he had lost them when hed gone under in the east end but he was spooked nevertheless so he made triply sure that nobody was hanging about regents park road at three in the morning as he pulled his bike up to the sidewalk he waited outside for half an hour to see whether any lights came on in the darkened flat then decided that either heighho nobody home or the inhabitants were asleep he crept up the stairs stealthy and silent as an ox and paused in front of the door unpleasant memories of his humiliating defeat here checked him briefly and then he let himself in he let his eyes get used to the darkness and then pulled the window shades down he listened for the sound of breathing anywhere and then turned on a lamp he noticed instantly what he hadnt observed on his last visit here books everywhere the clue light was lit he wasnt sure what he was looking for but he knew that this flat was his only link with neal he didnt dare go to the hotel because dickie huan would hear about it twenty seconds later cozy as he was with that whoreson house pig hatcher besides he wasnt all that interested in the spot neal had run from this is where he had run to and hadnt planned on being found out either it didnt take long for colin to discern that the flat belonged to some bloke named simon keyes and that squire keyes was positively bonks about books could keyes be the mystery buyer the flat didnt look the home of a man who could plunk down twenty thousand quid for a book though or did it think about it colin if you was buying stolen goods would you have them delivered to your home say hello to the missus and set the hot stuff in the parlor theres a good man that might start a bit of a huff over brandy and cigars eh not bloody likely no youd have a little hideyhole somewhere like some gents have a piece of fluff stored away this chappies got himself a little library love nest a place to come in the afternoon and cuddle up with his books run his fingers through the pages rub the rich leather covers youve a filthy mind collie lad but a brilliant one at that but that wasnt helping to find the soontobelate neal carey where did you run to neal with your fancy motor and my fancy lady lets just have a looksee he pried open simons desk drawer and looked around letters mostly christ but this one liked to write letters looks like he had carbon copies of every letter he ever wrote no mention of neal though just lots of chatter about this writer and that publisher and please do come for the weekend sometime up to the moor and didnt that sound like a lot of fun he gave up on the desk drawer and started in on the card table this was even more boring catalogue on catalogue of books and pictures and bids put in writing to sothebys and the bloke did shit a ton of nicker on his books dont he and hold on collie you idiot something flashed in his brain up to the moor up he dove back into the desk drawer and found the letter dear larry it started and then lots of polite toff chatter right get to the good part please do come up to the moor weekend next followed by a lot of crap about how nice it would be to have some time with you and some chippie named mary and then bingo directions up the m as far as sound a bit familiar does it ring any bells dingdong big ben maybe colin thought ill have to invite myself up to the moor for a little weekend party of my own he grabbed the copy of the letter giving directions to the cottage and headed down the stairs and out the door he was thinking that maybe life wasnt such a kick in the balls after all when a swift one right in the old yobs dropped him to his knees through watery eyes he could make out the smiling face of one of dickie huans boys and behind him a rather relievedlooking crisp thanks colin muttered to crisp a whole bloody lot chum they dragged him into the backseat of a car one of the chinese drove and another held his revolver on the two prisoners you might have mentioned something colin like by the by crisp old friend if this thing goes down the crapper dickie huans boys might be looking for us you left me holding the bag what was i supposed to do how did you find me well it wasnt too fookin clever hiding at your granddas now was it you only have two fookin relations they didnt know that though did they only my dear chum crisp knew that id be bathing facedown in the river if i didnt know that next traffic signal im jumping out they speak english you bloody moron thats right you bloody moron said the one with the pistol so dont do anything stupid he shoved the gun in colins face for emphasis and fun trailing colin had been ridiculously easy much easier than following someone through the twisted maze of kowloon the car weaved up through soho and into the back streets of chinatown the driver hauled colin out of the back and pushed him toward the back door of the restaurant he gestured to crisp you go go where you kidding me just go crisp went colin watched him slump off toward the main drag faintly hoping hed come back with reinforcements fat chance dickie huan was in his tiny office in back of the kitchen colin didnt see any cleaver the thug pushed him into a small cane chair in front of the desk dickie huan looked over at him like a strict headmaster in a cheap school you disappointed me colin im a bit down in the mouth about it myself but go ahead and sell the heroin to jackie chen next time maybe jackie chen bought elsewhere bad news that you lose face huh colin asked fuck face i lose twenty thousand quid colin felt sort of warm and runny inside this is no time to panic lad he told himself im this close to having the money dickie youre this close to eating with your toes too where are you getting the money colin leaned in over the desk and whispered good dramatic effect im selling a book i kill you right now colin dickie huan didnt like being fucked with no really a rare book a rare stolen book the stolen bit was a good strategy on colins part your basic criminal always feels deep in his heart that theft increases the inherent value of an object stolen from who you got a buyer colin tasted the sweet air of life as the door to escape opened just a crack thats the problem dickie you put your finger right on it dickie huan valued justicewhich to him meant revenge but he didnt value it twenty thousand pounds worth hed have colin taken into the meat locker and kicked around just to make sure he was telling the truth and to teach him a lesson accounts the voice said with a practiced professional lilt yeah i have some questions about my bill name and number please lombardi richard graham said then rattled off the number yes you have me down for a bunch of calls to london england graham said as nastily as possible yes well i didnt make any damn calls to london our records show i dont give a damn what your records show our records show that you made five calls from a phone booth and charged them to your account from a phone booth who are you trying to joe graham was having fun particularly when the operator got huffy yes sir from area code twoonetwo number eightfivefive fiveseventwoeight to what number in london he challenged its on your bill i dont have my bill with me he listened to the long sigh the one meant to let him know that people who called to complain about their bill certainly ought to have said bill in front of their noses may i put you on hold time is money lady she returned a couple of minutes later and read off the number very slowly he asked her to repeat it and then hung up then he dialed the overseas number it rang seventeen times before someone picked it up ello may i speak to this is a phone box mate you ave the wrong a phone box where in the otel what hotel the piccadilly got to run graham hung around for a while thinking things over and then decided he could think better in mckeegans he had a beer and a hamburger then another beer and ambled back toward his apartment the walk let him think helped him make up his mind when he did he stopped in a phone booth on the corner and made a collect call to providence rhode island he was surprised that the man answered his own phone he expected a butler or something like that he told the man everything in the sunny days of late july the lake became their playground they would pack a picnic lunch of fruit and cold sliced meat and make the long hike over the moor and down through the sheep meadow to the wood where theyd sit in the shade and watch the daily performance of hardin and jim when the old man had shouted gate and the collie had driven his charges from the meadow and along the lane neal and allie would continue on climbing the next hill to reach the lake the lake wasnt really a lake at all but the remnants of a quarry a reminder of a turnofthecentury effort to make the moor bear more than tufts of grass to make its stony soil pay the villagers below had dreamed of selling the native stone to the gentry to build fine houses but the gentry found it cheaper to import scandinavian wood than transport yorkshire stone and the quarry failed after eight years of back and heartbreaking labor it became a convenient spot for the local youth to meet and produce more local youth who would in turn leave the village to make a living elsewhere however neal and allie had no idea of the quarrys history quickly dubbed it the lake and went every afternoon to skinnydip well allie did anyway neal could bring himself only to peel down to a pair of boxer shorts hed found in a chest of drawers this shyness was not faked neal had no intention of baring himself to allie mostly because she bared herself now so freely to him she would shuck her clothes as naturally as a young girl in love and if neal found it disconcerting all the better she was more than aware of its effect on him and of the reason that he clung so stubbornly to the thin facade of the ridiculous boxer shorts and why he stayed waistdeep in the water even when she sunbathed on the long slab of rock that rose from the cold blue of the quarry she would tease him about his modesty at the same time enjoying it immensely she thought about all the guys who could never wait to get into her pants and here was one she couldnt talk into getting out of his she flirted with him she played she luxuriated in feeling attractive she bathed in sunshine and his admiration for allie sex had always been a commodity something she traded for money or affection attention or revenge a quick exchange of need for need now she enjoyed the sweet leisure of courtship the tantalizing slowness of discovery the muted music of her body falling in love after a quick freezing swim she would lie on the rock letting the warm rays of the sun cover herand it was him covering her warming her his heat filling her and warming her him melting her and melting in her and then she would open her eyes a slit pretending to sleep but watching him shyly watching her watching him swim determined laps and thinking that wont help you neal that wont save you but go ahead she would laugh softly to herself and perhaps drift off into a sweet sleep wake up and find him on the rock above her reading a book and trying not to think about her stare at her gaze on her and she would know in that infallible infuriating feminine wisdom that makes life possible that he would eventually come to her come in her and she would enfold him and hold him inside her and they would feel the whole world in their joining there was time for all of that and now even the waiting was delicious the gentle pangs of want she loved him and she was in no hurry for neal the lake became the symbol of his dilemma there was the cold refreshing reality of the water against the sunbaked dream of the glistening rock and the golden girl the siren song of allie naked she would perch on the rock above him mythology sprung to seductive life her skin alone dappled in sunlight and shadow made him dizzy he was swimming in desire he could feel the insistent tug the hollow thump the fierce quick stir in his groin the pleasant ache he hadnt felt it since diane hell he thought he hadnt felt it before diane it complicates things he thought and things are complicated enough you can deal with it later now you have five days to make it work five days before the shit hits theres a lot to do make arrangements with dr ferguson about the book get on a plane with allie disappear that would be the hardest of all because levine would come after him joe graham sat in chases hotel suite listening to the tirade i didnt want you to send that kid chase was yelling but you all said he was the best the best what fuckup head case lets face it gentlemen he isnt coming back and he sure as hell isnt bringing my daughter with him he was red in the face graham noticed pure powertrip rage i think we had better consider damage control now gentlemen lombardi said ill bet you do graham thought levine hung tough we still have four days before your deadline expires a lot can happen in four days lets hope so ed thought graham lets hope so lombardi laughed and said you havent even heard from carey in weeks and will you stop doing that doing what graham asked rubbing your artificial hand into your palm its driving me nuts i do it when im worried and im worried about neal youd better worry about him if i ever get my hands on him chase roared fuck you graham thought fuck you all neal had allie and now hes missing and one of you pricks arranged it and i think know who if my kid is hurt if my kid is dead he rubbed his rubber hand into his palm and stared at lombardi it was after a particularly compelling afternoon at the lake during which she was certain neal was finally going to touch her she could feel him sitting on the rock above her could feel his glances and was sure that he was just on the verge of sliding down and laying his hands on her shoulders she could feel herself stroking the backs of his hands and pulling him tighter and she knew he was just about to come to her just about when he stood up and jumped into the cold water this time she was pissed off and she was quiet the whole walk back to the cottage and they ate their dinner in silence she went up to bed without a word of good night and watched the doorknob for a long time willing it to turn when it did neal stood in the doorway just stood in the doorway were leaving he said tomorrow after breakfast i dont want to im not asking its time its time for a lot of things he stood in the doorway for what seemed like an hour then he turned suddenly and shut the door behind him the night wind stung colins face but he didnt let up on the bikes throttle the pain felt almost goodit focused his fury dickie huans lads had stomped him pretty good pretty cute they were with their little hands and feet but he would meet them again sometime on his turf and on his time and then they would find out just how cute they were but that was for later now he was headed to settle with his old girl alice and his old buddy neal it had taken some talking to convince dickie to let him go alone dickie had wanted to send a fookin army but it was explained to him that yorkshire villages arent used to seeing a horde of chinese and it might attract negative attention and besides the book might be business but killing neal was personal and killing alice would be a nice hobby he might even get generous and let dickie play he let his mind imagine neal and alice in bed it helped him forget his cuts and bruises sweet dreams lovebirds he shouted into the wind colins on his way neal got up early and collected his few belongings he put the copy of the pickle in his briefcase and locked it he poured himself a cold bath washed up quickly then heated water to shave he heard allie get up she came down the stairs and brushed past him in the kitchen without a word she put up water on the stove for her own bath staring out the window while it heated good morning neal said she didnt answer youre not talking to me how does it feel then she carried the bucket outside poured it into the tub shucked her clothes and stepped in for once the cold air didnt seem to bother her and she took her time bathing when she came back in neal was sitting at the table reading some old paperback allie went into the kitchen pulled eggs and bread out of the pantry and began to make breakfast when it was ready she tossed neals plate of eggs and toast in front of him and said so were leaving today thats right dont i get a say i thought i was a partner a junior partner a fiftyfifty partner he looked up from his plate knock it off youre not getting off this easy neal she thought i didnt trade one colin for another youre not going to treat me like this no neal she said you knock it off i want to know whats next what happens when we get back to the states you get sixteen thousand dollars i mean what happens between you and me oh allie not now he thought just give me a few more days to work things out just trust me lets just take it slow okay slow havent we been taking it slow so lets keep taking it slow maybe ill just take my money and split he looked up from his plate and met her eyes you can if you want to alice you have to know that she ate a few bites of toast then got right to the heart of things why wont you make love to me jesus alice was the best he could manage at the moment why i dont you dont think im attractive i think youre very attractive then what is it he took his time how do i explain this then she got the idea the wrong idea but she got hold of it and it hurt her its because of my father isnt it thats why alice thats not it i shouldnt have told you no im glad you did her face contorted in pain she tried for the mocking laugh she used to have but it didnt work and she screamed at him i thought you loved me i but you cant love a junkie whore who fucked her own father he started to explain to try and tell her but she was already headed out the door let her go he thought let her blow off steam she cant go far let her be alone for a while colin was lost all these dirt roads look alike he thought and there are no signs he was consulting simons directions again when he saw a little dog running toward him barking jim colin heard the voice before be saw the old man the dog stopped in his tracks sat down and began to wag his tail thats better colin thought until he saw the shotgun who would you be the old man asked him good morning colin said in his best toff accent flashing his most charming smile im afraid im lost the old man didnt smile back hes looking at the cuts and bruises on my face colin realized went off the road with the motorbike he explained adding a selfdeprecatory chuckle stupid still no smile from the old coot and the dogs tail had stopped wagging i never liked those things the old one said now who would you be id be the aga bloody khan if i had the money you ancient hairy bastard im a friend of simons you dont look like a friend of simons colin knew how to handle the yeoman class nevertheless he intoned and let the awkward silence do the rest simons out of country the shepherd said thats all right actually colin said ive come to see neal and alice would you know if theyre in i would and could you tell me where the cottage is i could colin let the precise polite grimace of impatience cross his face and the shepherd turned around to point downhill and took his bloody time about itquite enough time for colin to grab the wrench from his toolbag leave her alone for a while neal thought again a few minutes after allie had left like you let the halperin kid alone poor stupid little jason halperin from cincinnati who you took from that gentle queen on twentythird street you took him to the hilton and it was late you were both hungry and room service was closed and jason halperin was so docile relieved almost to be caught and you figured you could leave him alone for ten minutes while you went across the street to grab a couple of sandwiches he was engrossed in some stupid movie on television and you told him that you were locking the door from the outside which is impossible and youd be right back and you didnt bother to cuff him because why put the kid through any more shit right and service was so slow it was a bit more like twenty minutes before you came back with the roastbeef sandwiches and the cokes and the twinkies and there was fourteenyearold jason halperin hanging from the clothes rod in the closet because you had left him alone and there were things he couldnt face alone and you should have known that the yapping of hardins dog woke him from the reverie and he took it as a signal no dont leave her alone for a while go find hernow neal rushed out the door the butt of the shotgun hit him square across the upper ribs and he dropped to his knees sucking for air he could barely raise his head to see colin standing there and allie standing frozen beside him avin a little spat were we colin asked lets all go back inside and talk it over he ushered allie inside with the barrel of the gun and sat her down on one of the kitchen chairs then he went back out and nudged the shotgun under neals chin trouble gettin up rugger want some elp neal struggled to his feet went in and crumpled into the other chair his ribs were burning and it was hard to breathe first things first colin said ill take the book now in the bedroom neal said his eyes began to focus he recognized the gun as hardins yeah ats right neal i thought the other cottage was your little love nest at first alice luv get the book will you dear before i blow neals ead off she went upstairs neal neal neal colin said sadly you ad to make this difficult take the book leave alice no i dont think so ah eres your beloved alice open the case both dials to fiftythree neal said she opened the case and set it on the table colin leaned over to gaze at the book better late than never hey rugger he was getting comfortable now he held the shotgun against his hip in the crook of one arm his finger was on the trigger and he had the barrel pointed at allie neal lad give us the name of the buyer ill trade you the name for alice well thats quite generous of you considerin i ave the book alice and this shotgun and you ave fuck all i have the name colin lowered the barrel dropping it down to allies knees it would be a shame neal but id do it his finger tightened ever so slightly on the trigger allie turned dead white her teeth sinking into her lower lip dr john ferguson eleven st johns wood the barrel swung to neals face truth neal nodded if i find it isnt neal ill take a knife to er pretty face and he winced and shook his head its the truth i believe you he stepped back and leveled the gun back at neals face well lad ive never shot anyone before dont hurt him and ill go with you allie said youll go with me anyway alice ill do anything you want for as long as you want just dont hurt him colin didnt take his eyes from neal he had made the mistake of underestimating him before how can i believe you alice i dont know i swear ive got an idea he fished out a set of works from his left pocket and dropped it on the table he followed with a small glassine envelope cook it up and shoot it theres a good girl allie grabbed it he had brought it all she had just lit the match under the spoon when neal said alice dont colin tightened his finger on the trigger shut up a gun makes you see the world in a whole different way all neal wanted came in one single fervent prayer dont let it go off please dont let it go off allie tied the rubber hose around her arm and pulled tight she chose a vein and lowered the needle to it she was crying promise me colin you wont hurt him now a deals a deal neal was trying to fight through the fear if he lost her now he lost her forever shed never fight her way back again not through the dope and the selling herself not through what colin was planning for her not through the ghosts that haunted her youve blown it he thought blown it you havent done anything you started out to do and you havent told her about her father hes not your father neal said he felt dizzy he saw colins jaw tighten saw the barrel of the shotgun what allie asked she froze with the syringe a millimeter from her arm shut up colin yelled another ounce of pressure on the trigger and it would go off neal felt as if he were swimming through fear fighting to the surface john chase is not your father what he did to you was horrible but hes not your father remember that who are you neal spat out the words as fast as he could before the shotguns roar could drown him out they sent me to bring you back your mother wants you back and john chase is not your father what are you fookin on about all this time she said staring at neal shoot it or i shoot im now she looked at neal for a moment more then touched the needle to her arm allie dont she pushed the plunger it was a strong mix and took only a couple of seconds to hit her knees buckled but she caught herself on the table then shook her head once twice peace flowed over her into her neal sank back in his chair right said colin well ere we go he grabbed the briefcase and shoved allie toward the door cheers rugger allies attack was feeble heroin slow but her raking nails hurt anyway and threw off his aim as he knocked her aside and turned to face neal who had sprung from the chair the blast caught neal square in the chest and set him down in a bloody heap on the floor colin hit allie in the stomach with the butt of the gun then crouched over neal and felt his neck for a pulse he didnt find one he grabbed allie by the elbow and shoved her outside toward his motorbike neal had felt the first wicked shot of pain and then a great sleepy bloody weight pressing down on his eyes and his chest and then blessed oblivion dr ferguson answered the telephone only mildly surprised that someone would be ringing him at that time of the evening he sometimes wished he had gone into specialized practice with its nicely specified hours but for the most part he was pleased with his work and with himself dr ferguson was a man content he had a public passion for books a private one for his wife of twentyodd years and an addiction to trout fishing that went beyond all reasonable bounds he lived modestly for a wealthy man an heir he preferred to put his money into important things such as rare books an argyll retreat and a share in a trout stream in that same shire so he set aside part of his house in londons st johns wood for an office and saw most of his patients there or at the hospital when the telephone rang on this particular evening his nurse was long gone so he answered it himself rare was the caller who warned him not to interrupt and ferguson listened with rapt if a tad annoyed attention to the manic streamofconsciousness verbal style of this lowerclass young man and allowed a good ten seconds of silence to pass before he deigned to respond ah he said may i speak now receiving an affirmative reply he said first may i inquire how you came to be in possession of these volumes actually it is my business considering that you are asking me to purchase them i see i see no tonight would not be convenient yes im quite sure i dont do business at night you understand regardless of what you have been led to believe i do in fact know a mr carey but he is a tobacconist and i rather doubt that he would the soonest i could possibly see you would be at let me think tomorrow at half past one yes and your name well i shall have to know yes mr smythe i shall look forward to meeting you at half past one tomorrow good evening when the rather desperate young man rang off ferguson sat down with two fingers of whiskey and searched his brain for any trace of a neal carey who had some connections with books an hour or so later he came up with an answer allies world had become a cloudy mix of grief and sleep lying in the filthy bayswater flat that was colins new retreat she would wake up from a drugged sleep and remember neal and the pain would start again it wouldnt last for long because vanessa would pop her a quick one again a small shot of smack that would send her back into reverie and sleep for a while she thought she might have dreamed the long ride to london when she had clung to colins back and hung on for life as he relentlessly sped back to the city they had stopped only three or four timesshe couldnt rememberfor gas and for colin to haul her behind some loo and shoot her up she knew she was a prisoner but after a while she couldnt remember why she could remember only the sight of the shotgun blast ripping open neals chest and the blood so much blood she could remember fighting colin during the first fix or two but the next time she didnt fight and after that she rolled her sleeve up and held her arm out and after that she became impatient when nessa was late with her shot she was in a tiny back bedroom of a small thirdstory flat either crisp or vanessa was always with her and sometimes a young oriental guy would come and check her out she could sometimes hear colin talking in the other rooma onesided conversation that she realized must be over the phone she didnt care she wanted her shot it let her sleep and gave her pretty dreams dreams where the blood blossomed from neals heart and floated in the air and became a shiny bouquet of wet roses in which she dove to the bottom of a deep cold lake and found him there smiling pretending to be asleep dreams of endless naps on warm fluffy clouds that glided slowly over the city and she could see everything and everybody soon there was little difference between being asleep and being awake and that was fine with allie she had tried real life and it had let her down badly crisp and vanessa were prisoners too prisoners of the stupid deal colin had made with dickie huan not to worry he told them one more small transaction and well be assdeep in filthy lucre one more small transaction colin thought he was nervous and hated admitting it to himself the idea of striking a deal with an upperclass doctor scared him and it was a blow to his pride the son of a whore had sounded so bloody cool so reserved he had spoken to colin with that same condescending tone he had heard from those bastards his whole life and his dad before him well never mind taking the old farts money was revenge enough and hed need the money now he thoughtfirst to pay off dickie and then to lay low someplace for a bit christ on the cross he hadnt wanted to kill neal had he had he maybe he had but he probably wouldnt have shot if neal hadnt gone for him silly bastard as if any tart was worth it even a sweet piece like alice he had spewed up after shooting neal hed given a few blokes the blade before but never for the sweet byandby it was sickening it was but then he remembered dickie huans lads better neal then me he thought and he did rip me off all that nicker and alice alice what to do with alice she wouldnt keep her trap shut would she mind you no one would likely believe a junkedup mess like alice but still maybe dickie would take her up sort of a bonus no no good if she blabbed it to dickie that would be the end dickie would own him charge him whatever price he wanted no amsterdam was the better answer go with uncle colin for a holiday let her peddle herself in the damestrasse behind a window she wouldnt last and it wasnt as if she didnt deserve it amsterdams the spot take dickies bloody heroin and flog it on a higher market anyway right but first to get rid of this fucking book it was still only three bloody hours christ such a ballsup could happen in three hours he glanced over at crisp who was sitting on the floor munching on a bag of that obnoxious shit hed have to lose this one and no mistake little bloody good it would do to set himself up on the continent with his new wealth only to have this idiot and his ugly gash trailing along ill ring you up when its all done and you can get out of here bring alice to the dilly and ill haul her up to her boyfriend neal seems to be taking this pretty easily crisp said colin noted that suspicion tainted his usual subservient whine i took care of old neal too true he thought he just wants the trouble and strife in there back again sweet isnt it i thought you were in love with her its a good job he was shaking crisp when he was bugger was beginning to get cheeky i was take a lesson from it colin took a few extra minutes with the mirror to knot his tie a maroon knit he fancied with the muslin jacket pink shirt and gray slacks he had chosen for the occasion then he slipped into the cordovan tasseled loafers and checked the shine on the toes hed show this oxbridge shit what class was he looked ridiculous well kiss me darling he said im off to make our fortune have a nice day at the office dearie crisp answered he hoped like hell colin didnt fuck this up colin gave huans thug a playful slap on the shoulder want to share a taxi sports fan rich lombardi was in a big hurry the convention was about to start and the senator was in his suite waiting for the big meeting about what to do without little allie it was a problem all right because little allie wasnt going to show title her story little girl lost oh well he could figure out something to tell the press he always had he tucked his shirt in zipped up his fly and smiled at the girl on the bed she smiled back she was young blond had incredible blue eyes and wanted to be an intern in the senators office next summer when she graduated from high school well that could probably be arranged rich lombardi loved his job gotta go he said meeting with the senator gotta hurry he rushed out the door past the little alcove with the coke machine past the little man with one arm who was crouched behind it graham had no trouble letting himself into the room colin took a long deep breath and rang the bell dr ferguson bugger took his own good time coming to the door colin tried to steady his heartbeat this was it mate the breakout dont take any crap from the bloke now he thought you have what he wants ferguson was a smallish fellow early fifties maybe and dressed savile row mr smythe is it dr ferguson i presume a little cheek to show the bastard im not afraid of him do come in nice nice place antique furniture hunting prints on the walls books of course you brought the item with you i hope colin pointed at the attache case clutched in his hand may i see it may i see the money ferguson sat down and pointed colin to a chair you are new at this mr smythe the merchandise first and if its genuine then we discuss the money colin put the case on his lap and opened it he handed the books to ferguson the doctor opened up the first volume checked out the cover the spine and the first few pages then he examined the other three volumes these are from simon keyess collection im surprised he let it go so is he ah yes colin leaned over lets cut the genteel bullshit you had an arrangement with neal carey im acting as shall we say his agent same terms and how did you get this from mr carey do you care no come on come on colin thought so close dont blow it now ten thousand was it ferguson was asking him colin smiled twenty actually up yours mate ah yes ah yes indeed twenty thousand sweet quid and colin is set ill turn that twenty to fifty quick as your sister drops her knickers youll accept a check colin looked nonplussed ferguson chuckled sorry a small joke ill smalljoke you you smarmy twit twenty thousand quid may be play money to you its my fucking life you do realize ferguson continued that i expected this delivery some weeks ago there were problems apparently no christ no dont let it go sour now the whoreson ballocks breaker spent about three hours lighting his fucking pipe then he said fortunately for you mr smythe truth be known i would kill for these volumes truth be known dr ferguson i did then you wont mind giving me my money ferguson gestured with his pipe to a closed door shall we step into the library yes we bloody well shall if thats where you keep the nicker a small evil thought of hitting the bastard over the head and taking it all crept into colins mind but he dismissed it mustnt be greedy after you colin stepped into the library hello rugger colin blinked hard twice is something wrong mr smythe ferguson asked you look like youve seen a ghost colin recovered quickly neal glad youre all right chappie and sweet bugger all if neal wasnt sitting right there not looking too good but a damn sight better than hed looked the last time colin saw him he was pale as a nun at an orgy and the shirt that was draped over his shoulders revealed a bloody bandage that covered most of his chest and he looked real tired totally fagged which wasnt bad considering he had been dead and all gods blood neal that gun had a hair trigger didnt it neal didnt answer him he didnt smile or laugh or nothing just sat and stared at him maybe he is dead after all when i was a lad ferguson intoned and double sod him on my first birdhunting jaunt my father taught me to always always check my load too heavy a shot you ruin the bird too small a shot you wound the bird of course a load of rock salt you lose the bird colin whirled on him yeah well you triplesodomized poxy piece of ape dung dad never took me bird hunting unless you count the time we boffed your grandmum in the gents at charing cross and what in the name of lord nelsons sausage is rock salt while were about it steady lad this contribution came from a big bloke in the corner and gods blood if it wasnt hatcher that halfhonest peeler from vine street who wouldnt even take a bribe from dickie huan and he already had the irons out this thing was turning to shit quick like think colin lad think wheres allie thank you neal god bless you rugger i can always count on you i dunnoo neal dont fuck with me colin ill take you out and shoot you colin wasnt thrilled that hatcher was nodding but maybe i could find out colin said colin watched and sweated as neal and the cop exchanged what could be called significant looks hatcher neal asked hatcher stroked his chin he was thinking colin saw which he knew was hard on cops not meaning to be difficult hatcher said but it leaves me as it were standing out in the cold looking through the window at the christmas pudding i understand what youre asking you get your girl back safe all well and good and mr keyes gets his books back and the young punk goes scotfree i get left in the same old deadend job putting the arm on ponces for the small money so much for halfhonest colin thought mustve left that half to home and it must have been a hell of a natter they had before i got here leave it to a greedy cop to queer a nice arrangement except it isnt so nice is it if i leave this room free as a bird i still have dickie to deal with the cop continued if i may offer a suggestion why dont you leave me and the lad to have a chat alone and ill wager next months take ill have your girl for you quick as a scotsmans funeral then what christ neal dont encourage him ill charge our friend here with an assortment of major crimes against the crown and perhaps win a pat on the back from my grateful superiors neal looked at hatcher enjoy he said and started out of his chair he took it slow and it still hurt hold on colin said lets not be hasty he gave hatcher his most engaging hustlers smile how would you like to be a superstar neal eased himself down on the bed in fergusons guest room the doctor had insisted he rest and neal supposed it made sense it would take a while for things to work out anyway his chest throbbed when the charge had first hit him hed thought he was dead he was sure now that his heart had stopped for a second or so either through pain or shock or fear and the sheer force of the blow that had taken him off his feet had driven the air out of his lungs he remembered hitting the floor and that was about it before hed passed out hed come to when the collie started licking his face and sniffing him and he saw hardin leaning over him the tough old shepherd got him to his feet and cleaned up the raw rasping wound he sterilized his knife with the flame of a match and used it to pick out the rock salt that was still imbedded in the flesh then he asked neal some hard questions when he heard the story hardin left neal in the cottage and returned an hour later in an old bedford lorry first they went to the village where they each had a whiskey and neal placed his call to london ferguson had already heard from mr smythe and had recalled neals name he reasoned that neal for some bizarre reason had betrayed his host by stealing his most valuable possession and ferguson was considering ringing the police he agreed to wait until neal could tell him the story in person and then run him in if he wished the long ride to london was a torment in the bumpy old truck and every jolt sent a burning stab through neals chest when they arrived at fergusons in the small hours of the morning neal was in bad shape good god man ferguson said as he helped hardin carry neal in what on earth has happened to you they took neal into the examining room and laid him out on the table ferguson went to work with real instruments but not without remarking that hardin had done a solid if primitive job and then he asked hardin about the nasty bump on his head hardin insisted it could wait the doctor worked on neal with tweezers tongs scalpel and sutures covered the whole bloody mess with sulfate ointment and stuck a variety of needles into neal shooting him up with antibiotics and a tetanus vaccination for good measure he tried to give neal some sleeping pills but he refused them he desperately needed to tell the doctor about allie ferguson listened to neals tale with some skepticism he was all for calling the police even after hed accepted neals version of the events it took all neals remaining energy to convince him that it would be the end of alison chase finally they had compromised neal put a call in to the piccadilly hotel and a few minutes later hatcher rang back he arrived at fergusons shortly thereafter over whiskey in the doctors study it all seemed very civilized almost like a game neal struggled to stay awake as they laid the plans for an ambush a trap thatif it workedwould set allie free he wont have her with him neal said ferguson agreed no hes too wily for that well then gentlemen said hatcher the only thing to do then is to get his nuts under the boot and step on them he had said goodbye to hardin at the door and thanked him hardin shook his hand and said you brought some excitement to the dog and me we dont much care for excitement sorry i dont suppose well be seeing you or the lady again i dont suppose you will im glad i had the gun loaded for crow young man so am i hardin fumbled for a minute then said thats a good young lady yes she is hope you get her back safe i will it was nine in the morning before neal had laid down to try to sleep tired as he was he couldnt drop off he was thinking about allie the same thing happened this afternoon as he tried to rest there was too much going on ferguson had made a few phone calls to the right people and arranged for twenty thousand pounds in cash a very nervous young accountant arrived with the briefcase a couple of hours later rather irregular this he observed to ferguson colin stared longingly at the stacks of bills its a great shame neal he moaned a bloody great shame get moving neal answered before i change my mind right rugger colin had left followed at some distance by hatcher an hour later the call came through hello neal colin said four oclock piccadilly circus theyll bring her theyre expecting me though colin how is she there was a long silence well sport you know junkies dickie didnt believe it but there it was twenty thousand pounds neatly laid out in a briefcase colins insipid face grinning at him behind it i hope this is good stuff youre selling me dickie dont push your luck colin right you are the waiter brought over two small glasses of fiery chinese wine all good deals begin with a toast dickie said heres to our new relationship gan bei bottoms up bottoms up he said lets go fetch my smack bottoms up indeed where youre headed you fat fart vanessa had a bit of trouble getting allie out of bed and she finally had to hold out the promise of a fix if shed be a big girl and come along they walked down into the tube station and got her on the train with no more difficulty they emerged at the piccadilly station with allie gentle as a lamb shes a walking zombie crisp noted thats colins problem vanessa said she hoped thered be no trouble getting their share of the money from colin she wanted to get crisp well away from him the dilly was crowded and noisy sirens blasted the afternoon air and it seemed like every cop in london was pouring down into soho it made vanessa edgy anxious to find colin shake him and quit this scene except colin wasnt there neal was the circus was crowded with tourists and zonedout kids they didnt stand out or draw any attention wheres colin vanessa asked crisp stood behind her he didnt trust neal a bit neal made a point of listening to the sirens figuring that colin with his twenty grand of kitteredge money in nicely marked bills must have made out all right in jail probably vanessa just nodded losing had become a way of life allie stared at neal this dream was one of the best shed had and she was running on low neal she asked that you in the flesh she took his face in her hands and looked into his eyes real close neal im very glad to see you but im very fucked up its okay its like were floating around the city you know all over everything is going whoosh whoosh like are you fucked up too i think so she hugged him tight oh good didnt want to be the only one didnt want to be alone you dont think i remember stuff but i remember they sent you to get me good old mom and pop did thats what you said you gonna make me go home now to good old mom and pop youre not huh neal im not promise promise good good good her face turned serious can we go now right now love you neal love you allie neal started walking her to oxford street to hail a taxi he wanted ferguson to see her as soon as possible he hadnt gone a block before he made them footsteps behind himtwo pairs not pros he picked up the pace and listened they were coming faster could he afford to pause even if there was a cab handy would it be a knife a sap or another gun maybe the thought of the gun got to him and he fought off the fear he slowed down a little but tightened his grasp around allies waist the steps pulled closer then alongside crisp on one side vanessa on the other neal kept moving as they talked you want something were in a bit of trouble vanessa said im not in the mood crisp grabbed him by the elbow listen mate neal straightened his elbow and grabbed crisp by his belt he lifted his arm as he moved the motion hurt like crazy but it kept crisp off balance and vulnerable im not your mate and if you give me any shitany shit at allill kill you right here neal didnt think he would or could kill crisp but it sounded good as i was saying were in a bit of trouble what with colin in the lockup and all your friends are your problem not mine vanessa was halfrunning to keep up with him thats not really true you know she shoved something into his stomach it was a magazine have a look at this it was a newsweek opened to a page on the page were the smiling faces of john chase wife liz and daughter allie neal tried to bluff so vanessa was much tougher much smarter than he ever gave her credit for come off it she said neal dropped his head he was so damn tired he looked up again what do you want out of here he thought about it for a few seconds it was doable and then how do i know i can trust you youre a fine one to be talking about trust true enough okay ill think about it go back to the old flat ill ring you tonight she let go of his arm midnight neal or i see if newsweek wants to print my pictures of allie crisp tossed him a decent imitation of a confident smirk and the pair walked away neal flagged a taxi and gave the driver fergusons address where we going allie asked someplace to get some sleep she narrowed her eyes like a bad actress doing suspicion youre not taking me home neal no promise promise assured of that much she fell asleep in the cab and was no problem putting to bed lombardi handed ed levine the phone its for you ed was grateful for a break from the sullen atmosphere of the hotel room where john chase sat in a nearcatatonic state of anger levine he said into the phone he had made a habit of answering phones this way it was professional efficient cool so ed said the mocking voice on the phone where do you want her providence new york newport carey you son of a bitch bastard where are you im with allie chase you got her that got their attention in the room heads lifted ears perked of course i got her what did you think they dont call me the best for nothing levine held the mouthpiece to his chest hes got her he said to chase and lombardi what kind of shape is she in lombardi asked quickly what kind of shape is she in shell take a nice picture i dont think youll want her to do minutes though chase smiled lombardi went to pour himself a healthy g ampt you and me have a lot to talk about neal ed muttered oh yeah you bet your fat ass we do your mother ed you get a pencil write this down its tricky british air flight one seventyseven arrives kennedy two pmtomorrow thats august first by the way be there or be square if youre screwing us around neal had hung up neal put down the phone and looked in on allie she was out cold he reflected for a moment on the subject of betrayal graham had been right as usual he thought as he looked down at the sleeping girl betrayal is the basic stuff of the undercover its in his bones then he went back to the phone as a rule joe graham liked other peoples phone conversations better than his own he was sitting in his apartment four cans into a sixpack and seven innings into a ball game when the phone rang three times and then stopped by the time hoyt had come out of his stretch and let loose a slow sinker the phone jangled again this time graham picked it up dad came the cheerfully mocking voice on the other end of the line son its been a long time meet me neal thought it over again and then dialed colins old number vanessa answered yeah what are the names on your passports he made her spell them out twice gave her instructions about where and when to meet him and then hung up ten minutes later miss vanessa brownlow and mister harold griffin had two reservations on british air from heathrow to boston then neal phoned hatcher heathrow airport on a sunday morning is the eighth circle of hell threequarters of the worlds population either are greeting or seeing off the remaining fourth jamming old cranky terminal three in a sweaty mass of emotional humanity give mother teresa a couple of hours in terminal three on a sunday shell be shopping for a machete neal carey was delighted to see the place allie firmly in tow holding his hand and a small dose of thorazine neal edged to the ba sales counter paid for his and allies tickets with plastic and crisp and vanessas by cash blackmail payments are not taxdeductible he avoided the crowd at the escalator and took the back stairs up to the departure floor hatcher was pretty good neal noted he stayed about fifty or sixty feet back and eased his bulk through the crowd without pushing or shoving neal recalled a grahamism a civilian sees the crowd a street man sees his way through the crowd neal led allie into the bookshop picked up some magazines she seemed to like and a paperback copy of peebless a short history of scotland for himself hatcher peeled off at this point and checked out the mobbed coffee shop he came back a few minutes later and nodded to neal crisp and vanessa were in the coffee shop and they were alone for once they hadnt screwed up neal hadnt really thought that even this dynamic duo would be dumb enough to try to snatch allie back in the middle of heathrow airport especially not during a terrorist campaign when about half the white males in the building were plainclothes cops but he wasnt taking the chance they had somehow commandeered a booth and seemed oblivious to the hostility of the sullen waitress and the stares of the various pakistanis indians and africans who found them bizarre neal slipped into the booth across from them allie followed he slid the ticket packet across the table to vanessa she looked it over and asked why boston you think i want to see you in new york you dont trust us maybe i dont want to get off the plane and be greeted by a photographer from newsweek this will make it just a little tougher for you to doublecross me vanessa didnt like it how am i supposed to get to new york then i dont care you see the big guy over there at the counter tea toast and sausage hes a cop neal cut crisps protest off i just want to make sure this all goes smoothly have you ever taken an

nobody was taking any chances neal didnt mind he had left plenty of time to catch the plane and hed just as soon the plane he was on didnt blow up in midair not after all this when it came their turn he let allie go first and turned to nod his goodbye to hatcher the cop should be having a good day his drug bust had made the morning editions and they had all spelled his name right he gave neal the thumbsup sign crisp and vanessa were through security he found them right at the coffee shop he said to vanessa allie should go to the loo now ill take her ill have your money you want pounds or dollars arent you the considerate one dollars please vanessa took allie by the hand and walked off neal looked at crisp and smiled how about you champ you want to hit the wc turning poofter on us neal lets do it the security lounge was far less crowded only people with tickets were in there so they made it to the gents loo with ease they walked to the last stall the handicapped one with lots of room took a quick glance and locked themselves inside you got everything through okay im not in bracelets am i vanessa too crisp nodded you worry too much crisp pulled the stuff out of a makeshift pocket sewn inside his jeans the alcohol felt nice and cool on neals skin the needle stung like a bastard neal picked a good spot to sit and watch them board their flight he wanted to make damn good and sure they got on he thought about lombardi call this book trust level zero they strolled through the gate as if theyd been doing this all their lives now it was his turn why do i feel so jumpy he wondered this is the easy part he gathered allie up and they hit the line ten minutes later they were at the last checkpoint and neal eyed the attendant nervously can he tell he thought nervously can he tell neal handed him the ticket and passport was the man looking at him more closely than he had the others can he tell is it the guilt in my eyes smile now just a little not too much he can tell im screwed enjoy your flight sir the agent said with just the trace of a smirk he passed allie right through the plane took off right on time levine hung the phone up theyre on board how do you know lombardi asked i have a source at british at kennedy he checked the computer ill call the senator tell him i want to come along to meet them you and me both this better be good lombardi chase said over the phone you hauled me out of a meeting with half the crackers in dixie theyre headed in have the car meet me have you called mrs chase yet i work for you senator call her she can get a helicopter down and still make it hows it going there we have a good shot at it do you think you can get born again i feel like a new man already senator allie liked the movie she didnt have the headset on but she made up her own dialogue which wasnt too bad neal thought she ate both their lunches and only had to go to the lay once for a refresher course in sedation she was in a pretty good mood for a young lady as sick as she was when she wasnt putting words into de niros mouth she talked about life after getting straight and california sunshine and getting them a little house around malibu somewhere she bet she could pry some cash out of the old trust fund dad or no dad neal nodded and made listening noises and drank heavily the firstplace yankees had a twilight doubleheader against the sox and he could just make the second game if he hustled he was sick of himself and sick of his lies and it would be real nice to get involved in a game where they had some rules u s senators with chauffeurs and limos and twentydollar bills park where they want to at kennedy airport even right beside signs saying unloading only chase and lombardi sat in the backseat chase drummed his feet and looked at his watch the plane was due any moment and liz hadnt shown up yet hung up in traffic how could a helicopter get hung up in traffic lombardi was on the phone to his people at the convention the senator was still hanging in there that cracker bastard was taking his time though probably praying about it ed levine was set standing at arrivals outside the customs gate he checked his troops again he had brought along four muscle types they were spread out well little neal wasnt getting by two would grab the kid and waltz her over to daddy for the hugs and kisses the other two would grab neal and stick him in a car they would drive to some lonely parking lot where ed would expound on his displeasure he had reluctantly promised graham he wouldnt break anything after all neal had brought the girl back a few minutes later the light flashed on ba ed stepped outside to the car lombardi rolled the window down yeah i dont want to bother you or anything but theyre down and headed into customs chase set the car phone down how long depends fuck you chase gave him a dirty look levine could care less this thing was about over and then he wouldnt have to deal with the sleazy sob anymore well be there in a minute you havent seen my wife have you ed knew thirtyeight good answers for that one but didnt use any of them one at a time senator one at a time chase stood with the flowers lombardi had handed hima nice touch in case any snoopy reporters stumbled on the scene he watched an endless throng of people come out of the gate none of them allie just like her though he thought lombardi wished theyd hurry the hell up so he could get back to the convention christ only knows what they were up to back there without him to handle it levine knew that neal was holding back deliberately letting most of the crowd come throughthe less chance of a scene he checked his guys one more time they seemed to pick up on the tension they were alert on edge just the way he liked them daddy the highpitched squeal echoed through the hall levine watched as some little schlump with short blond hair advanced toward chase with her arms out daddy she screamed again throwing her arms around him youre not my daughter chase said trying to disentangle himself from her more than fervent embrace no fucking shit she whispered flowers for me how sweet im famished you know airline food she proceeded to eat them one by one she did hand one to an anemiclooking boy standing beside her he popped a daisy in his mouth and swallowed it whole im crisp can i call you dad the security types started to move in ed beat them to it he grabbed vanessa and lifted her off her feet where are they you must be ed get your greasy hands off me ed before i scream for a reporter thats better i have a message for all of you from neal first youre to let us go immediately or i call the press second youre not to try to find him or the girl third he told you not to send him on this thing alrighty right now where can i get a taxi chase started to grab her you bitch let them go levine said he was red with rage but he knew neal carey let them go senator his boys were slick they moved the senator as if it was his idea they steered him back to the car forming a wall that masked his furious face and muffled his yelling rich lombardi stood there for a moment shaking his head then he looked up at ed levine title this bit youre finished in this business ed levine shoved him a big middle finger title this but as lombardi was hustling away to catch up with chase ed was thinking ill kill him ill find neal carey and kill him its over for himhis job his apartment his education hosed let him try the world with no friends and no family the guy at bostons logan airport didnt want to let them in but their papers were in order this fucking guy with the shaved head and a safety pin through his ear for chrissakes and his broad with the orange and purple crew cut so he hassled them a little then said welcome to boston mr griffin miss brownlow neal blushed the needle through his ear had stung but not like this homecoming he felt like a jerk he looked like a jerk the heavily muscled guy in the black polo shirt grabbed neal the second he stepped out onto the street he was professional his hand was like a soft vise around neals bicep while his partner gently took allie neal she wasnt nearly strong enough to put up a struggle but she leaned away from the muscle toward neal its okay allie its okay he said as his guy pushed on his chest blocking his way to the girl theyre going to take good care of you theyre going to get you straight neal she started to cry and held on to him tighter allie listen i do love you but sometimes the best thing you can do for someone you love is to leave he pried her hand off his arm then softly kissed the tips of her fingers goodbye allie the muscle started moving her toward a limo parked on the street neal looked over the thugs shoulder and saw liz chase get out of the back she stood on the sidewalk crying her fingers touching her bottom lip the thug started to turn neal away allie was looking back at neal as they pushed her along toward her mother she looked scared and hurt he didnt see her collapse in her mothers arms didnt see their embrace all he saw was a big chest and a big forearm hauling him away then he heard a voice say hurt him and ill cut your balls off the guy let him go neal saw graham standing there an evil smile that didnt cover up his worry spread across his face neal looked behind him and saw allies head through the rear window of the car it was rested on her mothers shoulder ethan kitteredge sat next to them ash blond hair impossible blue eyes hello son shes his daughter isnt she yeah thats news to me graham news to me too news to kitteredge news to the kid soon how long time all these blue bloods know each other when you called the other night let me change that when you finally called the other night told me what kind of shape she was in told me your demandsand thank you very much and by the way fuck youi called the mother like you said she mustve gotten on the honker to the man because in less time than it takes guidry to tank a threerun lead the phone goes off again and guess who neal kitteredge who says okay fuck chase and the kid goes to the best laughing academy money can buy along with mom by the way and you kept all this from ed yeah he set me up graham he was working the other side no he didnt how trust me he gave neal that satanic grin then put a fatherly arm around his shoulders by the way kid levine thinks you deliberately fucked us over so does chase they dont know anything about allie being the mans daughter or nothing theyre going to think you made an arrangement with mrs chase for a cut of the divorce settlement which should be wicked big but youre going to set them straight right no the senator is still useful to us after what we know about him the man can say that knowing what he knows about the senator and his daughter its business kid nothing personal eds going to think its personal graham tightened his hold a little yeah well thats why we want you to disappear for a while let things cool off you know so i get to take the fall neal thought you do the right thing and you get nailed for it now graham continued i know youre worried about graduass school your professor says youre on leave of absence to do research he handed neal an envelope neal opened it the note from kitteredge read thank you for my daughter you are indeed a friend of the family i hope this partially compensates you for any inconvenience we may have or will have caused you there was a draft for ten thousand pounds sterling and an open return ticket to london he handed the bank draft back to graham take half of it and get it to allie send me the change are you crazy the kids got more money than god i owe it to her its hers youre sick tell me about it did i get any mail he asked not from diane how does he know these things neal wondered you want me to track her down tell her where youll be graham asked neal shook his head you think shell be okay diane allie yeah shell be okay

out of his shirt pocket yankees versus red soxbox seats fenway park your old dad takes care of you doesnt he box seats father and son night two for one figures they started walking to the cab stand did i mention graham said that you look like shit with your head shaved and a safety pin sticking through your ear doesnt that hurt for chrissakes not as much as the needle that made the hole well take it out i dont want people thinking youre a fag im getting to kind of like it great whats next a simple strand of pearls they stopped at the cab stand you did good son thanks dad rich lombardi slipped into the drivers seat of his porsche all in all things hadnt worked out too badly the senator hadnt gotten the veep but that was okay this cracker wouldnt last more than one term and then theyd have a crack at the numberone slot and allie was tucked away in a rubber room somewhere and couldnt shoot off her mouth he leaned back into the seat and was about to start the engine when he heard that flicking sound again that rubbing but it was only for a split second because something cold and sharp was pressing into his neck you know what i read in the papers this morning joe graham said i read theyre training monkeys to help out quadriplegics you know guys who cant move their arms or legs yeah these monkeys run all around their apartment and bring them things books food beer you want one of those monkeys richie because if i press just a little right here youll need a monkey to make your calls to london for you dont you set my kid up didnt you no i the knife pricked his flesh yes what for afraid shed talk about what he hesitated then he felt a trickle of blood running down his neck things we did was there anyone who wasnt tapping that kid graham thought that was worth neal getting killed i didnt think theyd kill him allie going down the tubes she was there already youre scum you know that lombardi was trembling so hard graham was afraid hed cut him accidentally put both hands on the wheel lean forward close your eyes lombardi started to cry as he did what he was told graham slipped out the passenger door and came around to the drivers window take a message to your boss from kitteredge from me when this term is up he packs it in he quits he also doesnt fight this divorce tell him and then you resign you got that hotshot we see you anywhere near a politician again youre on a waiting list for one of those monkeys he stepped away from the porsche and into the waiting car you still want a piece of him he asked levine ed shook his head in disgust not worth it right i cant believe neal didnt trust me ed said as they were driving away pisses me off neal doesnt trust a lot of people you gonna call him tell him he can come home no lets leave him be for a while levine pulled the car out onto the street ill miss the little bastard though graham thought epilogue just neal the ringing startled neal he set the pickle down with a tinge of annoyance he stepped outside and saw the postman walking his bicycle up the road ringing the bell on the handlebars id have come to the village bill you didnt have to come all the way up hadley handed him a big pile of mail wrapped in string from the states looked important well thanks for the trouble no trouble can i offer you a cup of tea kettles on take the chill out wish i could but i havent the time next week well ta bill ta neal he watched the postman pedal down the track and then he checked out the sky it might snow before nightfall hardin would be bringing the sheep in early hed stop in for tea he went back into the cottage and looked at the mail a postcard from graham another letter from allie who was getting out in a week and going to a halfway house a journal on eighteenthcentury lit a letter from a don at oxford extending permission to use the archives sports illustrated ten of them and bless you graham an envelope with dianes return address on it i told you not to do that graham but thanks he set the letter down unopened and went back to his book maybe hed open it later when he had a scotch or two to help him maybe not he was lonely but he was used to that he had his books to read
