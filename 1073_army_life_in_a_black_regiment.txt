chapter introductory these pages record some of the adventures of the first south carolina volunteers the first slave regiment mustered into the service of the united states during the late civil war it was indeed the first colored regiment of any kind so mustered except a portion of the troops raised by majorgeneral butler at new orleans these scarcely belonged to the same class however being recruited from the free colored population of that city a comparatively selfreliant and educated race the darkest of them said general butler were about the complexion of the late mr webster the first south carolina on the other hand contained scarcely a freeman had not one mulatto in ten and a far smaller proportion who could read or write when enlisted the only contemporary regiment of a similar character was the first kansas colored which began recruiting a little earlier though it was not mustered in the usual basis of military seniority till later see appendix these were the only colored regiments recruited during the year the second south carolina and the fiftyfourth massachusetts followed early in this is the way in which i came to the command of this regiment one day in november i was sitting at dinner with my lieutenants john goodell and luther bigelow in the barracks of the fiftyfirst massachusetts colonel sprague when the following letter was put into my hands beaufort s c november my dear sir i am organizing the first regiment of south carolina volunteers with every prospect of success your name has been spoken of in connection with the command of this regiment by some friends in whose judgment i have confidence i take great pleasure in offering you the position of colonel in it and hope that you may be induced to accept i shall not fill the place until i hear from you or sufficient time shall have passed for me to receive your reply should you accept i enclose a pass for port royal of which i trust you will feel disposed to avail yourself at once i am with sincere regard yours truly r saxton briggenl mil gov had an invitation reached me to take command of a regiment of kalmuck tartars it could hardly have been more unexpected i had always looked for the arming of the blacks and had always felt a wish to be associated with them had read the scanty accounts of general hunters abortive regiment and had heard rumors of general saxtons renewed efforts but the prevalent tone of public sentiment was still opposed to any such attempts the government kept very shy of the experiment and it did not seem possible that the time had come when it could be fairly tried for myself i was at the head of a fine company of my own raising and in a regiment to which i was already much attached it did not seem desirable to exchange a certainty for an uncertainty for who knew but general saxton might yet be thwarted in his efforts by the proslavery influence that had still so much weight at headquarters it would be intolerable to go out to south carolina and find myself after all at the head of a mere plantationguard or a dayschool in uniform i therefore obtained from the war department through governor andrew permission to go and report to general saxton without at once resigning my captaincy fortunately it took but a few days in south carolina to make it clear that all was right and the return steamer took back a resignation of a massachusetts commission thenceforth my lot was cast altogether with the black troops except when regiments or detachments of white soldiers were also under my command during the two years following these details would not be worth mentioning except as they show this fact that i did not seek the command of colored troops but it sought me and this fact again is only important to my story for this reason that under these circumstances i naturally viewed the new recruits rather as subjects for discipline than for philanthropy i had been expecting a war for six years ever since the kansas troubles and my mind had dwelt on military matters more or less during all that time the best massachusetts regiments already exhibited a high standard of drill and discipline and unless these men could be brought tolerably near that standard the fact of their extreme blackness would afford me even as a philanthropist no satisfaction fortunately i felt perfect confidence that they could be so trained having happily known by experience the qualities of their race and knowing also that they had home and household and freedom to fight for besides that abstraction of the union trouble might perhaps be expected from white officials though this turned out far less than might have been feared but there was no trouble to come from the men i thought and none ever came on the other hand it was a vast experiment of indirect philanthropy and one on which the result of the war and the destiny of the negro race might rest and this was enough to tax all ones powers i had been an abolitionist too long and had known and loved john brown too well not to feel a thrill of joy at last on finding myself in the position where he only wished to be in view of all this it was clear that good discipline must come first after that of course the men must be helped andelevated in all ways as much as possible of discipline there was great need that is of order and regular instruction some of the men had already been under fire but they were very ignorant of drill and camp duty the officers being appointed from a dozen different states and more than as many regiments infantry cavalry artillery and engineers had all that diversity of methods which so confused our army in those early days the first need therefore was of an unbroken interval of training during this period which fortunately lasted nearly two months i rarely left the camp and got occasional leisure moments for a fragmentary journal to send home recording the many odd or novel aspects of the new experience camplife was a wonderfully strange sensation to almost all volunteer officers and mine lay among eight hundred men suddenly transformed from slaves into soldiers and representing a race affectionate enthusiastic grotesque and dramatic beyond all others being such they naturally gave material for description there is nothing like a diary for freshness at least so i think and i shall keep to the diary through the days of camplife and throw the later experience into another form indeed that matter takes care of itself diaries and letterwriting stop when fieldservice begins i am under pretty heavy bonds to tell the truth and only the truth for those who look back to the newspaper correspondence of that period will see that this particular regiment lived for months in a glare of publicity such as tests any regiment severely and certainly prevents all subsequent romancing in its historian as the scene of the only effort on the atlantic coast to arm the negro our camp attracted a continuous stream of visitors military and civil a battalion of black soldiers a spectacle since so common seemed then the most daring of innovations and the whole demeanor of this particular regiment was watched with microscopic scrutiny by friends and foes i felt sometimes as if we were a plant trying to take root but constantly pulled up to see if we were growing the slightest camp incidents sometimes came back to us magnified and distorted in letters of anxious inquiry from remote parts of the union it was no pleasant thing to live under such constant surveillance but it guaranteed the honesty of any success while fearfully multiplying the penalties had there been a failure a single mutiny such as has happened in the infancy of a hundred regiments a single miniature bull run a stampede of desertions and it would have been all over with us the party of distrust would have got the upper hand and there might not have been during the whole contest another effort to arm the negro i may now proceed without farther preparation to the diary chapter camp diary camp saxton near beaufort s c november yesterday afternoon we were steaming over a summer sea the deck level as a parlorfloor no land in sight no sail until at last appeared one lighthouse said to be cape romaine and then a line of trees and two distant vessels and nothing more the sun set a great illuminated bubble submerged in one vast bank of rosy suffusion it grew dark after tea all were on deck the people sang hymns then the moon set a moon two days old a curved pencil of light reclining backwards on a radiant couch which seemed to rise from the waves to receive it it sank slowly and the last tip wavered and went down like the mast of a vessel of the skies towards morning the boat stopped and when i came on deck before six the watchlights glittered on the land the shiplights on the sea hilton head lay on one side the gunboats on the other all that was raw and bare in the low buildings of the new settlement was softened into picturesqueness by the early light stars were still overhead gulls wheeled and shrieked and the broad river rippled duskily towards beaufort the shores were low and wooded like any new england shore there were a few gunboats twenty schooners and some steamers among them the famous planter which robert small the slave presented to the nation the riverbanks were soft and graceful though low and as we steamed up to beaufort on the floodtide this morning it seemed almost as fair as the smooth and lovely canals which stedman traversed to meet his negro soldiers in surinam the air was cool as at home yet the foliage seemed green glimpses of stiff tropical vegetation appeared along the banks with great clumps of shrubs whose pale seedvessels looked like tardy blossoms then we saw on a picturesque point an old plantation with stately magnolia avenue decaying house and tiny church amid the woods reminding me of virginia behind it stood a neat encampment of white tents and there said my companion is your future regiment three miles farther brought us to the pretty town of beaufort with its stately houses amid southern foliage reporting to general saxton i had the luck to encounter a company of my destined command marched in to be mustered into the united states service they were unarmed and all looked as thoroughly black as the most faithful philanthropist could desire there did not seem to be so much as a mulatto among them their coloring suited me all but the legs which were clad in a lively scarlet as intolerable to my eyes as if i had been a turkey i saw them mustered general saxton talked to them a little in his direct manly way they gave close attention though their faces looked impenetrable then i conversed with some of them the first to whom i spoke had been wounded in a small expedition after lumber from which a party had just returned and in which they had been under fire and had done very well i said pointing to his lame arm did you think that was more than you bargained for my man his answer came promptly and stoutly i been atinking masr dots jess what i went for i thought this did well enough for my very first interchange of dialogue with my recruits november thanksgivingday it is the first moment i have had for writing during these three days which have installed me into a new mode of life so thoroughly that they seem three years scarcely pausing in new york or in beaufort there seems to have been for me but one step from the camp of a massachusetts regiment to this and that step over leagues of waves it is a holiday wherever general saxtons proclamation reaches the chilly sunshine and the pale blue river seems like new england but those alone the air is full of noisy drumming and of gunshots for the prizeshooting is our great celebration of the day and the drumming is chronic my young barbarians are all at play i look out from the broken windows of this forlorn plantationhouse through avenues of great liveoaks with their hard shining leaves and their branches hung with a universal drapery of soft long moss like fringetrees struck with grayness below the sandy soil scantly covered with coarse grass bristles with sharp palmettoes and aloes all the vegetation is stiff shining semitropical with nothing soft or delicate in its texture numerous plantationbuildings totter around all slovenly and unattractive while the interspaces are filled with all manner of wreck and refuse pigs fowls dogs and omnipresent ethiopian infancy all this is the universal southern panorama but five minutes walk beyond the hovels and the liveoaks will bring one to something so unsouthern that the whole southern coast at this moment trembles at the suggestion of such a thing the camp of a regiment of freed slaves one adapts ones self so readily to new surroundings that already the full zest of the novelty seems passing away frommy perceptions and i write these lines in an eager effort to retain all i can already i am growing used to the experience at first so novel of living among five hundred men and scarce a white face to be seen of seeing them go through all their daily processes eating frolicking talking just as if they were white each day at dressparade i stand with the customary folding of the arms before a regimental line of countenances so black that i can hardly tell whether the men stand steadily or not black is every hand which moves in ready cadence as i vociferate battalion shoulder arms nor is it till the line of white officers moves forward as parade is dismissed that i am reminded that my own face is not the color of coal the first few days on duty with a new regiment must be devoted almost wholly to tightening reins in this process one deals chiefly with the officers and i have as yet had but little personal intercourse with the men they concern me chiefly in bulk as so many consumers of rations wearers of uniforms bearers of muskets but as the machine comes into shape i am beginning to decipher the individual parts at first of course they all looked just alike the variety comes afterwards and they are just as distinguishable the officers say as so many whites most of them are wholly raw but there are many who have already been for months in camp in the abortive hunter regiment yet in that loose kind of way which like average militia training is a doubtful advantage i notice that some companies too look darker than others though all are purer african than i expected this is said to be partly a geographical difference between the south carolina and florida men when the rebels evacuated this region they probably took with them the houseservants including most of the mixed blood so that the residuum seems very black but the men brought from fernandina the other day average lighter in complexion and look more intelligent and they certainly take wonderfully to the drill it needs but a few days to show the absurdity of distrusting the military availability of these people they have quite as much average comprehension as whites of the need of the thing as much courage i doubt not as much previous knowledge of the gun and above all a readiness of ear and of imitation which for purposes of drill counterbalances any defect of mental training to learn the drill one does not want a set of college professors one wants a squad of eager active pliant schoolboys and the more childlike these pupils are the better there is no trouble about the drill they will surpass whites in that as to camplife they have little to sacrifice they are better fed housed and clothed than ever in their lives before and they appear to have few inconvenient vices they are simple docile and affectionate almost to the point of absurdity the same men who stood fire in open field with perfect coolness on the late expedition have come to me blubbering in the most irresistibly ludicrous manner on being transferred from one company in the regiment to another in noticing the squaddrills i perceive that the men learn less laboriously than whites that double double toil and trouble which is the elementary vexation of the drillmaster that they more rarely mistake their left for their right and are more grave and sedate while under instruction the extremes of jollity and sobriety being greater with them are less liable to be intermingled these companies can be driven with a looser rein than my former one for they restrain themselves but the moment they are dismissed from drill every tongue is relaxed and every ivory tooth visible this morning i wandered about where the different companies were targetshooting and their glee was contagious such exulting shouts of ki ole man when some steady old turkeyshooter brought his gun down for an instants aim and then unerringly hit the mark and then when some unwary youth fired his piece into the ground at halfcock such guffawing and delight such rolling over and over on the grass such dances of ecstasy as made the ethiopian minstrelsy of the stage appear a feeble imitation evening better still was a scene on which i stumbled tonight strolling in the cool moonlight i was attracted by a brilliant light beneath the trees and cautiously approached it a circle of thirty or forty soldiers sat around a roaring fire while one old uncle cato by name was narrating an interminable tale to the insatiable delight of his audience i came up into the dusky background perceived only by a few and he still continued it was a narrative dramatized to the last degree of his adventures in escaping from his master to the union vessels and even i who have heard the stories of harriet tubman and such wonderful slavecomedians never witnessed such a piece of acting when i came upon the scene he had just come unexpectedly upon a plantationhouse and putting a bold face upon it had walked up to the door den i go up to de white man berry humble and say would he please gib ole man a mouthful for eat he say he must hab de valeration ob half a dollar den i look berry sorry and turn for go away den he say i might gib him dat hatchet i had den i say this in a tragic vein dat i must hab dat hatchet for defend myself from de dogs immense applause and one appreciating auditor says chuckling dat was your arms ole man which brings down the house again den he say de yankee pickets was near by and i must be very keerful den i say good lord masr am deywords cannot express the complete dissimulation with which these accents of terror were uttered this being precisely the piece of information he wished to obtain then he narrated his devices to get into the house at night and obtain some food how a dog flew at him how the whole household black and white rose in pursuit how he scrambled under a hedge and over a high fence etc all in a style of which gough alone among orators can give the faintest impression so thoroughly dramatized was every syllable then he described his reaching the riverside at last and trying to decide whether certain vessels held friends or foes den i see guns on board and sure sartin he union boat and i pop my head up den i beenatink think seceshkey hab guns too and my head go down again den i hide in de bush till morning den i open my bundle and take ole white shut and tie him on ole pole and wave him and ebry time de wind blow i beenatremble and drap down in de bushes because being between two fires he doubted whether friend or foe would see his signal first and so on with a succession of tricks beyond moliere of acts of caution foresight patient cunning which were listened to with infinite gusto and perfect comprehension by every listener and all this to a bivouac of negro soldiers with the brilliant fire lighting up their red trousers and gleaming from their shining black faces eyes and teeth all white with tumultuous glee overhead the mighty limbs of a great liveoak with the weird moss swaying in the smoke and the high moon gleaming faintly through yet tomorrow strangers will remark on the hopeless impenetrable stupidity in the daylight faces of many of these very men the solid mask under which nature has concealed all this wealth of motherwit this very comedian is one to whom one might point as he hoed lazily in a cottonfield as a being the light of whose brain had utterly gone out and this scene seems like coming by night upon some conclave of black beetles and finding them engaged with greenroom and footlights in enacting poor pillicoddy this is their university every young sambo before me as he turned over the sweet potatoes and peanuts which were roasting in the ashes listened with reverence to the wiles of the ancient ulysses and meditated the same it is natures compensation oppression simply crushes the upper faculties of the head and crowds everything into the perceptive organs cato thou reasonest well when i get into any serious scrape in an enemys country may i be lucky enough to have you at my elbow to pull me out of it the men seem to have enjoyed the novel event of thanksgivingday they have had company and regimental prizeshootings a minimum of speeches and a maximum of dinner bill of fare two beefcattle and a thousand oranges the oranges cost a cent apiece and the cattle were secesh bestowed by general saxby as they all call him december how absurd is the impression bequeathed by slavery in regard to these southern blacks that they are sluggish and inefficient in labor last night after a hard days work our guns and the remainder of our tents being just issued an order came from beaufort that we should be ready in the evening to unload a steamboats cargo of boards being some of those captured by them a few weeks since and now assigned for their use i wondered if the men would grumble at the nightwork but the steamboat arrived by seven and it was bright moonlight when they went at it never have i beheld such a jolly scene of labor tugging these wet and heavy boards over a bridge of boats ashore then across the slimy beach at low tide then up a steep bank and all in one great uproar of merriment for two hours running most of the time chattering all the time snatching the boards from each others backs as if they were some coveted treasure getting up eager rivalries between different companies pouring great choruses of ridicule on the heads of all shirkers they made the whole scene so enlivening that i gladly stayed out in the moonlight for the whole time to watch it and all this without any urging or any promised reward but simply as the most natural way of doing the thing the steamboat captain declared that they unloaded the ten thousand feet of boards quicker than any white gang could have done it and they felt it so little that when later in the night i reproached one whom i found sitting by a campfire cooking a surreptitious opossum telling him that he ought to be asleep after such a job of work he answered with the broadest grin o no gunnel das no work at all gunnel dat only jess enough for stretch we december i believe i have not yet enumerated the probable drawbacks to the success of this regiment if any we are exposed to no direct annoyance from the white regiments being out of their way and we have as yet no discomforts or privations which we do not share with them i do not as yet see the slightest obstacle in the nature of the blacks to making them good soldiers but rather the contrary they take readily to drill and do not object to discipline they are not especially dull or inattentive they seem fully to understand the importance of the contest and of their share in it they show no jealousy or suspicion towards their officers they do show these feelings however towards the government itself and no one can wonder here lies the drawback to rapid recruiting were this a wholly new regiment it would have been full to overflowing i am satisfied ere now the trouble is in the legacy of bitter distrust bequeathed by the abortive regiment of general hunter into which they were driven like cattle kept for several months in camp and then turned off without a shilling by order of the war department the formation of that regiment was on the whole a great injury to this one and the men who came from it though the best soldiers we have in other respects are the least sanguine and cheerful while those who now refuse to enlist have agreat influence in deterring others our soldiers are constantly twitted by their families and friends with their prospect of risking their lives in the service and being paid nothing and it is in vain that we read them the instructions of the secretary of war to general saxton promising them the full pay of soldiers they only half believe it with what utter humiliation were we their officers obliged to confess to them eighteen months afterwards that it was their distrust which was wise and our faith in the pledges of the united states government which was foolishness another drawback is that some of the white soldiers delight in frightening the women on the plantations with doleful tales of plans for putting us in the front rank in all battles and such silly talkthe object being perhaps to prevent our being employed on active service at all all these considerations they feel precisely as white men wouldno less no more and it is the comparative freedom from such unfavorable influences which makes the florida men seem more bold and manly as they undoubtedly do today general saxton has returned from fernandina with seventysix recruits and the eagerness of the captains to secure them was a sight to see yet they cannot deny that some of the very best men in the regiment are south carolinians december pm what a life is this i lead it is a dark mild drizzling evening and as the foggy air breeds sandflies so it calls out melodies and strange antics from this mysterious race of grownup children with whom my lot is cast all over the camp the lights glimmer in the tents and as i sit at my desk in the open doorway there come mingled sounds of stir and glee boys laugh and shouta feeble flute stirs somewhere in some tent not an officersa drum throbs far away in another wild kildeerplover flit and wail above us like the haunting souls of dead slavemastersand from a neighboring cookfire comes the monotonous sound of that strange festival half powwow half prayermeeting which they know only as a shout these fires are usually enclosed in a little booth made neatly of palmleaves and covered in at top a regular native african hut in short such as is pictured in books and such as i once got up from dried palmleaves for a fair at home this hut is now crammed with men singing at the top of their voices in one of their quaint monotonous endless negromethodist chants with obscure syllables recurring constantly and slight variations interwoven all accompanied with a regular drumming of the feet and clapping of the hands like castanets then the excitement spreads inside and outside the enclosure men begin to quiver and dance others join a circle forms winding monotonously round some one in the centre some heel and toe tumultuously others merely tremble and stagger on others stoop and rise others whirl others caper sideways all keep steadily circling like dervishes spectators applaud special strokes of skill my approach only enlivens the scene the circle enlarges louder grows the singing rousing shouts of encouragement come in half bacchanalian half devout wake em brudder stan up to em brudderand still the ceaseless drumming and clapping in perfect cadence goes steadily on suddenly there comes a sort of snap and the spell breaks amid general sighing and laughter and this not rarely and occasionally but night after night while in other parts of the camp the soberest prayers and exhortations are proceeding sedately a simple and lovable people whose graces seem to come by nature and whose vices by training some of the best superintendents confirm the first tales of innocence and dr zachos told me last night that on his plantation a sequestered one they had absolutely no vices nor have these men of mine yet shown any worth mentioning since i took command i have heard of no man intoxicated and there has been but one small quarrel i suppose that scarcely a white regiment in the army shows so little swearing take the progressive friends and put them in red trousers and i verily believe they would fill a guardhouse sooner than these men if camp regulations are violated it seems to be usually through heedlessness they love passionately three things besides their spiritual incantations namely sugar home and tobacco this last affection brings tears to their eyes almost when they speak of their urgent need of pay they speak of their lastremembered quid as if it were some deceased relative too early lost and to be mourned forever as for sugar no white man can drink coffee after they have sweetened it to their liking i see that the pride which military life creates may cause the plantation trickeries to diminish for instance these men make the most admirable sentinels it is far harder to pass the camp lines at night than in the camp from which i came and i have seen none of that disposition to connive at the offences of members of ones own company which is so troublesome among white soldiers nor are they lazy either about work or drill in all respects they seem better material for soldiers than i had dared to hope there is one company in particular all florida men which i certainly think the finestlooking company i ever saw white or black they range admirably in size have remarkable erectness and ease of carriage and really march splendidly not a visitor but notices them yet they have been under drill only a fortnight and a part only two days they have all been slaves and very few are even mulattoes december dwelling in tents with abraham isaac and jacob this condition is certainly mineand with a multitude of patriarchs beside not to mention caesar and pompey hercules and bacchus a moving life tented at night this experience has been mine in civil society if society be civil before the luxurious forest fires of maine and the adirondack or upon the lonely prairies of kansas but a stationary tent life deliberately going tohousekeeping under canvas i have never had before though in our barrack life at camp wool i often wished for it the accommodations here are about as liberal as my quarters there two walltents being placed end to end for office and bedroom and separated at will by a fly of canvas there is a good board floor and mopboard effectually excluding dampness and draughts and everything but sand which on windy days penetrates everywhere the office furniture consists of a good desk or secretary a very clumsy and disastrous settee and a remarkable chair the desk is a bequest of the slaveholders and the settee of the slaves being ecclesiastical in its origin and appertaining to the little old church or praisehouse now used for commissary purposes the chair is a composite structure i found a cane seat on a dustheap which a black sergeant combined with two legs from a broken bedstead and two more from an oakbough i sit on it with a pride of conscious invention mitigated by profound insecurity bedroom furniture a couch made of gunboxes covered with condemned blankets another settee two pails a tin cup tin basin we prize any tin or wooden ware as savages prize iron and a valise regulation size seriously considered nothing more appears needful unless ambition might crave another chair for company and perhaps something for a washstand higher than a settee today it rains hard and the wind quivers through the closed canvas and makes one feel at sea all the talk of the camp outside is fused into a cheerful and indistinguishable murmur pierced through at every moment by the wail of the hovering plover sometimes a face black or white peers through the entrance with some message since the light readily penetrates though the rain cannot the tent conveys a feeling of charmed security as if an invisible boundary checked the pattering drops and held the moaning wind the front tent i share as yet with my adjutant in the inner apartment i reign supreme bounded in a nutshell with no bad dreams in all pleasant weather the outer fly is open and men pass and repass a chattering throng i think of emersons saadi as thou sittest at thy door on the deserts yellow floorfor these bare sandplains gray above are always yellow when upturned and there seems a tinge of orientalism in all our life thrice a day we go to the plantationhouses for our meals camparrangements being yet very imperfect the officers board in different messes the adjutant and i still clinging to the household of william washingtonwilliam the quiet and the courteous the pattern of houseservants william the noiseless the observing the discriminating who knows everything that can be got and how to cook it william and his tidy ladylike little spouse hettya pair of wedded lovers if ever i saw oneset our table in their one room halfway between an un glazed window and a large woodfire such as is often welcome thanks to the adjutant we are provided with the social magnificence of napkins while lest pride take too high a flight our tablecloth consists of two new york tribunes and a leslies pictorial every steamer brings us a clean tablecloth here are we forever supplied with pork and oysters and sweet potatoes and rice and hominy and cornbread and milk also mysterious griddlecakes of corn and pumpkin also preserves made of pumpkinchips and other fanciful productions of ethiop art mr e promised the plantationsuperintendents who should come down here all the luxuries of home and we certainly have much apparent if little real variety once william produced with some palpitation something fricasseed which he boldly termed chicken it was very small and seemed in some undeveloped condition of antenatal toughness after the meal he frankly avowed it for a squirrel december give these people their tongues their feet and their leisure and they are happy at every twilight the air is full of singing talking and clapping of hands in unison one of their favorite songs is full of plaintive cadences it is not i think a methodist tune and i wonder where they obtained a chant of such beauty i cant stay behind my lord i cant stay behind o my father is gone my father is gone my father is gone into heaven my lord i cant stay behind deres room enough room enough room enough in de heaven for de sojer cant stay behind it always excites them to have us looking on yet they sing these songs at all times and seasons i have heard this very song dimly droning on near midnight and tracing it into the recesses of a cookhouse have found an old fellow coiled away among the pots and provisions chanting away with his cant stay behind sinner till i made him leave his song behind this evening after working themselves up to the highest pitch a party suddenly rushed off got a barrel and mounted some man upon it who said gib anoder song boys and ise gib you a speech after some hesitation and sundry shouts of rise de sing somebody and stan up for jesus brudder irreverently put in by the juveniles they got upon the john brown song always a favorite adding a jubilant verse which i had never before heardwell beat beauregard on de clare battlefield then came the promised speech and then no less than seven other speeches by as many men on a variety of barrels each orator being affectionately tugged to the pedestal and set on end by his special constituency every speech was good without exception with the queerest oddities of phrase and pronunciation there was an invariable enthusiasm a pungency of statement and an understanding of the points at issue which made them all rather thrilling those longwinded slaves in among the pines seemed rather fictitious and literary in comparisonthe most eloquent perhaps was corporal price lambkin just arrived from fernandina who evidently had a previous reputation among them his historical references were very interesting he reminded them that he had predicted this war ever since fremonts time to which some of the crowd assented he gave a very intelligent account of that presidential campaign and then described most impressively the secret anxiety of the slaves in florida to know all about president lincolns election and told how they all refused to work on the fourth of march expecting their freedom to date from that day he finally brought out one of the few really impressive appeals for the american flag that i have ever heard our masrs dey hab lib under de flag dey got dere wealth under it and ebryting beautiful for dere chilen under it dey hab grind us up and put us in dere pocket for money but de fus minute dey tink dat ole flag mean freedom for we colored people dey pull it right down and run up de rag ob dere own immense applause but well neber desert de ole flag boys neber we hab lib under it for eighteen hundred sixtytwo years and well die for it now with which overpowering discharge of chronologyatlongrange this most effective of stumpspeeches closed i see already with relief that there will be small demand in this regiment for harangues from the officers give the men an empty barrel for a stump and they will do their own exhortation december haroun alraschid wandering in disguise through his imperial streets scarcely happened upon a greater variety of groups than i in my evening strolls among our own campfires beside some of these fires the men are cleaning their guns or rehearsing their drillbeside others smoking in silence their very scanty supply of the beloved tobaccobeside others telling stories and shouting with laughter over the broadest mimicry in which they excel and in which the officers come in for a full share the everlasting shout is always within hearing with its mixture of piety and polka and its castanetlike clapping of the hands then there are quieter prayermeetings with pious invocations and slow psalms deaconed out from memory by the leader two lines at a time in a sort of wailing chant elsewhere there are conversazioni around fires with a woman for queen of the circleher nubian face gay headdress gilt necklace and white teeth all resplendent in the glowing light sometimes the woman is spelling slow monosyllables out of a primer a feat which always commands all earsthey rightly recognizing a mighty spell equal to the overthrowing of monarchs in the magic assonance of cat hat pat bat and the rest of it elsewhere it is some solitary old cook some aged uncle tiff with enormous spectacles who is perusing a hymnbook by the light of a pine splinter in his deserted cooking booth of palmetto leaves by another fire there is an actual dance redlegged soldiers doing rightandleft and nowleaddeladyober to the music of a violin which is rather artistically played and which may have guided the steps in other days of barnwells and hugers and yonder is a stumporator perched on his barrel pouring out his exhortations to fidelity in war and in religion tonight for the first time i have heard an harangue in a different strain quite saucy sceptical and defiant appealing to them in a sort of french materialistic style and claiming some personal experience of warfare you dont know notin about it boys you tink yous brave enough how you tink if you stan clar in de open fieldhere you and dar de secesh yous got to hab de right ting inside o you you must hab it served preserved in you like dese yer sour plums dey serve in de barrl yous got to harden it down inside o you or its notin then he hit hard at the religionists when a mans got de sperit ob de lord in him it weakens him all out cant hoe de corn he had a great deal of broad sense in his speech but presently some others began praying vociferously close by as if to drown this freethinker when at last he exclaimed i mean to fight de war through an die a good sojer wid de last kick dats my prayer and suddenly jumped off the barrel i was quite interested at discovering this reverse side of the temperament the devotional side preponderates so enormously and the greatest scamps kneel and groan in their prayermeetings with such entire zest it shows that there is some individuality developed among them and that they will not become too exclusively pietistic their love of the spellingbook is perfectly inexhaustiblethey stumbling on by themselves or the blind leading the blind with the same pathetic patience which they carry into everything the chaplain is getting up a schoolhouse where he will soon teach them as regularly as he can but the alphabet must always be a very incidental business in a camp december passages from prayers in the camp let me so

bressed mornin rises when i shall stan in de glory wid one foot on de water an one foot on de land den o lord i shall see my wife an my little chilen once more these sentences i noted down as best i could beside the glimmering campfire last night the same person was the hero of a singular little contretemps at a funeral in the afternoon it was our first funeral the man had died in hospital and we had chosen a picturesque burialplace above the river near the old church and beside a little nameless cemetery used by generations of slaves it was a regular military funeral the coffin being draped with the american flagthe escort marching behind and three volleys fired over the grave during the services there was singing the chaplain deaconing out the hymn in their favorite way this ended he announced his textthis poor man cried and the lord heard him and delivered him out of all his trouble instantly to my great amazement the cracked voice of the chorister was uplifted intoning the text as if it were the first verse of another hymn so calmly was it done so imperturbable were all the black countenances that i half began to conjecture that the chaplain himself intended it for a hymn though i could imagine no prospective rhyme for trouble unless it were approximated by debbil which is indeed a favorite reference both with the men and with his reverence but the chaplain peacefully awaiting gently repeated his text after the chant and to my great relief the old chorister waived all further recitative and let the funeral discourse proceed their memories are a vast bewildered chaos of jewish history and biography and most of the great events of the past down to the period of the american revolution they instinctively attribute to moses there is a fine bold confidence in all their citations however and the record never loses piquancy in their hands though strict accuracy may suffer thus one of my captains last sunday heard a colored exhorter at beaufort proclaim paul may plant and may polish wid water but it wont do in which the sainted apollos would hardly have recognized himself just now one of the soldiers came to me to say that he was about to be married to a girl in beaufort and would i lend him a dollar and seventyfive cents to buy the wedding outfit it seemed as if matrimony on such moderate terms ought to be encouraged in these days and so i responded to the appeal december today a young recruit appeared here who had been the slave of colonel sammis one of the leading florida refugees two white companions came with him who also appeared to be retainers of the colonel and i asked them to dine being likewise refugees they had stories to tell and were quite agreeable one was english born the other floridian a dark sallow southerner very well bred after they had gone the colonel himself appeared i told him that i had been entertaining his white friends and after a while he quietly let out the remark yes one of those white friends of whom you speak is a boy raised on one of my plantations he has travelled with me to the north and passed for white and he always keeps away from the negroes certainly no such suspicion had ever crossed my mind i have noticed one man in the regiment who would easily pass for whitea little sickly drummer aged fifty at least with brown eyes and reddish hair who is said to be the son of one of our commodores i have seen perhaps a dozen persons as fair or fairer among fugitive slaves but they were usually young children it touched me far more to see this man who had spent more than half a lifetime in this low estate and for whom it now seemed too late to be anything but a nigger this offensive word by the way is almost as common with them as at the north and far more common than with wellbred slaveholders they have meekly accepted it want to go out to de nigger houses sah is the universal impulse of sociability when they wish to cross the lines he hab twenty houseservants an two hundred head o nigger is a still more degrading form of phrase in which the epithet is limited to the fieldhands and they estimated like so many cattle this want of selfrespect of course interferes with the authority of the noncommissioned officers which is always difficult to sustain even in white regiments he neednt try to play de white man ober me was the protest of a soldier against his corporal the other day to counteract this i have often to remind them that they do not obey their officers because they are white but because they are their officers and guard duty is an admirable school for this because they readily understand that the sergeant or corporal of the guard has for the time more authority than any commissioned officer who is not on duty it is necessary also for their superiors to treat the noncommissioned officers with careful courtesy and i often caution the line officers never to call them sam or will nor omit the proper handle to their names the value of the habitual courtesies of the regular army is exceedingly apparent with these men an officer of polished manners can wind them round his finger while white soldiers seem rather to prefer a certain roughness the demeanor of my men to each other is very courteous and yet i see none of that sort of upstart conceit which is sometimes offensive among free negroes at the north the dandybarber strut this is an agreeable surprise for i feared that freedom and regimentals would produce precisely that they seem the worlds perpetual children docile gay and lovable in the midst of this war for freedom on which they have intelligently entered last night before taps there was the greatest noise in camp that i had ever heard and i feared some riot on going out i found the most tumultuous shamfight proceeding in total darkness two companies playing like boys beating tin cups for drums when some of them saw me they seemed a little dismayed and came and said beseechinglygunnel sah you hab no objection to we playin sahwhich objection i disclaimed but soon they all subsided rather to my regret and scattered merrily afterward i found that some other officer had told them that i considered the affair too noisy so that i felt a mild selfreproach when one said cunnel wish you had let we play a little longer sah still i was not sorry on the whole for these shamfights between companies would in some regiments lead to real ones and there is a latent jealousy here between the florida and south carolina men which sometimes makes me anxious the officers are more kind and patient with the men than i should expect since the former are mostly young and drilling tries the temper but they are aided by hearty satisfaction in the results already attained i have never yet heard a doubtexpressed among the officers as to the superiority of these men to white troops in aptitude for drill and discipline because of their imitativeness and docility and the pride they take in the service one captain said to me today i have this afternoon taught my men to loadinninetimes and they do it better than we did it in my former company in three months i can personally testify that one of our best lieutenants an englishman taught a part of his company the essential movements of the school for skirmishers in a single lesson of two hours so that they did them very passably though i feel bound to discourage such haste however i formed square on the third battalion drill three fourths of drill consist of attention imitation and a good ear for time in the other fourth which consists of the application of principles as for instance performing by the left flank some movement before learned by the right they are perhaps slower than better educated men having belonged to five different drillclubs before entering the army i certainly ought to know something of the resources of human awkwardness and i can honestly say that they astonish me by the facility with which they do things i expected much harder work in this respect the habit of carrying burdens on the head gives them erectness of figure even where physically disabled i have seen a woman with a brimming waterpail balanced on her head or perhaps a cup saucer and spoon stop suddenly turn round stoop to pick up a missile rise again fling it light a pipe and go through many evolutions with either hand or both without spilling a drop the pipe by the way gives an odd look to a welldressed young girl on sunday but one often sees that spectacle the passion for tobacco among our men continues quite absorbing and i have piteous appeals for some arrangement by which they can buy it on credit as we have yet no sutler their imploring cunnel we cant lib widout it sah goes to my heart and as they cannot read i cannot even have the melancholy satisfaction of supplying them with the excellent antitobacco tracts of mr trask december last night the water froze in the adjutants tent but not in mine today has been mild and beautiful the blacks say they do not feel the cold so much as the white officers do and perhaps it is so though their health evidently suffers more from dampness on the other hand while drilling on very warm days they have seemed to suffer more from the heat than their officers but they dearly love fire and at night will always have it if possible even on the minutest scalea mere handful of splinters that seems hardly more efficacious than a frictionmatch probably this is a natural habit for the shortlived coolness of an outdoor country and then there is something delightful in this rich pine which burns like a tarbarrel it was perhaps encouraged by the masters as the only cheap luxury the slaves had at hand as one grows more acquainted with the men their individualities emerge and i find first their faces then their characters to be as distinct as those of whites it is very interesting the desire they show to do their duty and to improve as soldiers they evidently think about it and see the importance of the thing they say to me that we white men cannot stay and be their leaders always and that they must learn to depend on themselves or else relapse into their former condition beside the superb branch of uneatable bitter oranges which decks my tentpole i have today hung up a long bough of fingersponge which floated to the riverbank as winter advances butterflies gradually disappear one species a vanessa lingers three others have vanished since i came mockingbirds are abundant but rarely sing once or twice they have reminded me of the red thrush but are inferior as i have always thought the colored people all say that it will be much cooler but my officers do not think so perhaps because last winter was so unusually mildwith only one frost they say december philoprogenitiveness is an important organ for an officer of colored troops and i happen to be well provided with it it seems to be the theory of all military usages in fact that soldiers are to be treated like children and these singular persons who never know their own age till they are past middle life and then choose a birthday with such precision fifty year old sah de fus last aprilprolong the privilege of childhood i am perplexed nightly for countersignstheir range of proper names is so distressingly limited and they make such amazing work of every new one at first to be sure they did not quite recognize the need of any variation one night some officer asked a sentinel whether he had the countersign yet and was indignantly answered should tink i hab em hab em for a fortnight which seems a long epoch for that magic word to hold out tonight i thought i would have fredericksburg in honor of burnsides reported victory using the rumor quickly for fear of a contradiction later in comes a captain gets the countersign for his own use but presently returns the sentinel having pronounced it incorrect on inquiry it appears that the sergeant of the guard being weak in geography thought best to substitute the more familiar word crockeryware which was with perfect gravity confided to all the sentinels and accepted without question o life what is the fun of fiction beside thee i should think they would suffer and complain these cold nights but they say nothing though there is a good deal of coughing i should fancy that the scarlet trousers must do something to keep them warm and wonder that they dislike them so much when they are so much like their beloved fires they certainly multiply firelight in any case i often notice that an infinitesimal flame with one soldier standing by it looks like quite a respectable conflagration and it seems as if a group of them must dispel dampnessdecember to a regimental commander no book can be so fascinating as the consolidated morning report which is ready about nine and tells how many in each company are sick absent on duty and so on it is ones newspaper and daily mail i never grow tired of it if a single recruit has come in i am always eager to see how he looks on paper tonight the officers are rather depressed by rumors of burnsides being defeated after all i am fortunately equable and undepressible and it is very convenient that the men know too little of the events of the war to feel excitement or fear they know general saxton and mede general and de gunneland seem to ask no further questions we are the war it saves a great deal of trouble while it lasts this childlike confidence nevertheless it is our business to educate them to manhood and i see as yet no obstacle as for the rumor the world will no doubt roll round whether burnside is defeated or succeeds christmas day well fight for liberty till de lord shall call us home well soon be free till de lord shall call us home this is the hymn which the slaves at georgetown south carolina were whipped for singing when president lincoln was elected so said a little drummerboy as he sat at my tents edge last night and told me his story and he showed all his white teeth as he added dey tink de lord meant for say de yankees last night at dressparade the adjutant read general saxtons proclamation for the new years celebration i think they understood it for there was cheering in all the companystreets afterwards christmas is the great festival of the year for this people but with new years coming after we could have no adequate programme for today and so celebrated christmas eve with pattern simplicity we omitted namely the mystic curfew which we call taps and let them sit up and burn their fires and have their little prayermeetings as late as they desired and all night as i waked at intervals i could hear them praying and shouting and clattering with hands and heels it seemed to make them very happy and appeared to be at least an innocent christmas dissipation as compared with some of the convivialities of the superior race hereabouts december the day passed with no greater excitement for the men than targetshooting which they enjoyed i had the private delight of the arrival of our muchdesired surgeon and his nephew the captain with letters and news from home they also bring the good tidings that general saxton is not to be removed as had been reported two different stands of colors have arrived for us and will be presented at new yearsone from friends in new york and the other from a lady in connecticut i see that frank leslies illustrated weekly of december th has a highly imaginative picture of the musterin of our first company and also of a skirmish on the late expedition i must not forget the prayer overheard last night by one of the captains o lord when i tink ob dis kismas and las year de kismas las kismas he in de secesh and notin to eat but grits and no salt in em dis year in de camp and too much victual this too much is a favorite phrase out of their grateful hearts and did not in this case denote an excess of dinneras might be supposedbut of thanksgiving december our new surgeon has begun his work most efficiently he and the chaplain have converted an old ginhouse into a comfortable hospital with ten nice beds and straw pallets he is now with a hearty professional faith looking round for somebody to put into it i am afraid the regiment will accommodate him for although he declares that these men do not sham sickness as he expected their catarrh is an unpleasant reality they feel the dampness very much and make such a coughing at dressparade that i have urged him to administer a dose of coughmixture all round just before that pageant are the colored race tough is my present anxiety and it is odd that physical insufficiency the only discouragement not thrown in our way by the newspapers is the only discouragement which finds any place in our minds they are used to sleeping indoors in winter herded before fires and so they feel the change still the regiment is as healthy as the average and experience will teach us something a second winters experience removed all this solicitude for they learned to take care of themselves during the first february the sicklist averaged about ninety during the second about thirty this being the worst month in the year for blacks december on the first of january we are to have a slight collation ten oxen or so barbecuedor not properly barbecued but roasted whole touching the length of time required to do an ox no two housekeepers appear to agree accounts varyfrom two hours to twentyfour we shall happily have enough to try all gradations of roasting and suit all tastes from miss as to mine but fancy me proffering a sparerib well done to some fair lady what ever are we to do for spoons and forks and plates each soldier has his own and is sternly held responsible for it by army regulations but how provide for the multitude is it customary i ask you to help to tenderloin with ones fingers fortunately the major is to see to that department great are the advantages of military discipline for anything perplexing detail a subordinate new years eve my housekeeping at home is not perhaps on any very extravagant scale buying beefsteak i usually go to the extent of two or three pounds yet when this morning at daybreak the quartermaster called to inquire how many cattle i would have killed for roasting i turned over in bed and answered composedly tenand keep three to be fatted fatted quotha not one of the beasts at present appears to possess an ounce of superfluous flesh never were seen such lean kine as they swing on vast spits composed of young trees the firelight glimmers through their ribs as if they were great lanterns but no matter they are cookingnay they are cooked one at least is taken off to cool and will be replaced tomorrow to warm up it was roasted three hours and well done for i tasted it it is so long since i tasted fresh beef that forgetfulness is possible but i fancied this to be successful i tried to imagine that i liked the homeric repast and certainly the whole thing has been far more agreeable than was to be expected the doubt now is whether i have made a sufficient provision for my household i should have roughly guessed that ten beeves would feed as many million people it has such a stupendous sound but general saxton predicts a small social party of five thousand and we fear that meat will run short unless they prefer bone one of the cattle is so small we are hoping it may turn out veal for drink we aim at the simple luxury of molassesandwater a barrel per company ten in all liberal housekeepers may like to know that for a barrel of water we allow three gallons of molasses half a pound of ginger and a quart of vinegar this last being a new ingredient for my untutored palate though all the rest are amazed at my ignorance hard bread with more molasses and a dessert of tobacco complete the festive repast destined to cheer but not inebriate on this last point of inebriation this is certainly a wonderful camp for us it is absolutely omitted from the list of vices i have never heard of a glass of liquor in the camp nor of any effort either to bring it in or to keep it out a total absence of the circulating medium might explain the abstinencenot that it seems to have that effect with white soldiersbut it would not explain the silence the craving for tobacco is constant and not to be allayed like that of a mother for her children but i have never heard whiskey even wished for save on christmasday and then only by one man and he spoke with a hopeless ideal sighing as one alludes to the golden age i am amazed at this total omission of the most inconvenient of all camp appetites it certainly is not the result of exhortation for there has been no occasion for any and even the pledge would scarcely seem efficacious where hardly anybody can write i do not think there is a great visible eagerness for tomorrows festival it is not their way to be very jubilant over anything this side of the new jerusalem they know also that those in this department are nominally free already and that the practical freedom has to be maintained in any event by military success but they will enjoy it greatly and we shall have a multitude of people january evening a happy new year to civilized peoplemere white folks our festival has come and gone with perfect success and our good general has been altogether satisfied last night the great fires were kept smouldering in the pit and the beeves were cooked more or less chiefly moreduring which time they had to be carefully watched and the great spits turned by main force happy were the merry fellows who were permitted to sit up all night and watch the glimmering flames that threw a thousand fantastic shadows among the great gnarled oaks and such a chattering as i was sure to hear whenever i awoke that night my first greeting today was from one of the most stylish sergeants who approached me with the following little speech evidently the result of some elaboration i tink myself happy dis new years day for salute my own cunnel dis day las year i was servant to a gunnel ob secesh but now i hab de privilege for salute my own cunnel that officer with the utmost sincerity reciprocated the sentiment about ten oclock the people began to collect by land and also by waterin steamers sent by general saxton for the purpose and from that time all the avenues of approach were thronged the multitude were chiefly colored women with gay handkerchiefs on their heads and a sprinkling of men with that peculiarly respectable look which these people always have on sundays and holidays there were many white visitors alsoladies on horseback and in carriages superintendents and teachers officers and cavalrymen our companies were marched to the neighborhood of the platform and allowed to sit or stand as at the sunday services the platform was occupied by ladies and dignitaries and by the band of the eighth maine which kindly volunteered for the occasion the colored people filled up all the vacantopenings in the beautiful grove around and there was a cordon of mounted visitors beyond above the great liveoak branches and their trailing moss beyond the people a glimpse of the blue river the services began at half past eleven oclock with prayer by our chaplain mr fowler who is always on such occasions simple reverential and impressive then the presidents proclamation was read by dr w h brisbane a thing infinitely appropriate a south carolinian addressing south carolinians for he was reared among these very islands and here long since emancipated his own slaves then the colors were presented to us by the rev mr french a chaplain who brought them from the donors in new york all this was according to the programme then followed an incident so simple so touching so utterly unexpected and startling that i can scarcely believe it on recalling though it gave the keynote to the whole day the very moment the speaker had ceased and just as i took and waved the flag which now for the first time meant anything to these poor people there suddenly arose close beside the platform a strong male voice but rather cracked and elderly into which two womens voices instantly blended singing as if by an impulse that could no more be repressed than the morning note of the songsparrow my country tis of thee sweet land of liberty of thee i sing people looked at each other and then at us on the platform to see whence came this interruption not set down in the bills firmly and irrepressibly the quavering voices sang on verse after verse others of the colored people joined in some whites on the platform began but i motioned them to silence i never saw anything so electric it made all other words cheap it seemed the choked voice of a race at last unloosed nothing could be more wonderfully unconscious art could not have dreamed of a tribute to the day of jubilee that should be so affecting history will not believe it and when i came to speak of it after it was ended tears were everywhere if you could have heard how quaint and innocent it was old tiff and his children might have sung it and close before me was a little slaveboy almost white who seemed to belong to the party and even he must join in just think of itthe first day they had ever had a country the first flag they had ever seen which promised anything to their people and here while mere spectators stood in silence waiting for my stupid words these simple souls burst out in their lay as if they were by their own hearths at home when they stopped there was nothing to do for it but to speak and i went on but the life of the whole day was in those unknown peoples song receiving the flags i gave them into the hands of two finelooking men jet black as colorguard and they also spoke and very effectivelysergeant prince rivers and corporal robert sutton the regiment sang marching along and then general saxton spoke in his own simple manly way and mrs francis d gage spoke very sensibly to the women and judge stickney from florida added something then some gentleman sang an ode and the regiment the john brown song and then they went to their beef and molasses everything was very orderly and they seemed to have a very gay time most of the visitors had far to go and so dispersed before dressparade though the band stayed to enliven it in the evening we had letters from home and general saxton had a reception at his house from which i excused myself and so ended one of the most enthusiastic and happy gatherings i ever knew the day was perfect and there was nothing but success i forgot to say that in the midst of the services it was announced that general fremont was appointed commanderinchiefan announcement which was received with immense cheering as would have been almost anything else i verily believe at that moment of high tide it was shouted across by the pickets abovea way in which we often receive news but not always trustworthy january once and once only thus far the water has frozen in my tent and the next morning showed a dense white frost outside we have still mockingbirds and crickets and rosebuds and occasional noonday baths in the river though the butterflies have vanished as i remember to have observed in fayal after december i have been here nearly six weeks without a rainy day one or two slight showers there have been once interrupting a drill but never dressparade for climate by day we might be among the isles of greecethough it may be my constant familiarity with the names of her sages which suggests that impression for instance a voice just now called near my tentcato whars plato the men have somehow got the impression that it is essential to the validity of a marriage that they should come to me for permission just as they used to go to the master and i rather encourage these little confidences because it is so entertaining to hear them now cunnel said a faltering swam the other day i want for get me one good lady which i approved especially the limitation as to number afterwards i asked one of the bridegrooms friends whether he thought it a good match o yes cunnel said he in all the cordiality of friendship johns gwine for marry venus i trust the goddess will prove herself a better lady than she appeared during her previous career upon this planet but this naturally suggests the isles of greece again january on first arriving i found a good deal of anxiety among the officers as to the increase of desertions that being the rock on which the hunter regiment split now this evil is very nearly stopped and we are every day recovering the olderabsentees one of the very best things that have happened to us was the halfaccidental shooting of a man who had escaped from the guardhouse and was wounded by a squad sent in pursuit he has since died and this very everung another man who escaped with him came and opened the door of my tent after being five days in the woods almost without food his clothes were in rags and he was nearly starved poor foolish fellow so that we can almost dispense with further punishment severe penalties would be wasted on these people accustomed as they have been to the most violent passions on the part of white men but a mild inexorableness tells on them just as it does on any other children it is something utterly new to me and it is thus far perfectly efficacious they have a great deal of pride as soldiers and a very little of severity goes a great way if it be firm and consistent this is very encouraging the single question which i asked of some of the plantation superintendents on the voyage was do these people appreciate justice if they did it was evident that all the rest would be easy when a race is degraded beyond that point it must be very hard to deal with them they must mistake all kindness for indulgence all strictness for cruelty with these freed slaves there is no such trouble not a particle let an officer be only just and firm with a cordial kindly nature and he has no sort of difficulty the plantation superintendents and teachers have the same experience they say but we have an immense advantage in the military organization which helps in two ways it increases their selfrespect and it gives us an admirable machinery for discipline thus improving both the fulcrum and the lever the wounded man died in the hospital and the general verdict seemed to be him brought it on heself another soldier died of pneumonia on the same day and we had the funerals in the evening it was very impressive a dense mist came up with a moon behind it and we had only the light of pinesplinters as the procession wound along beneath the mighty mosshung branches of the ancient grove the groups around the grave the dark faces the red garments the scattered lights the misty boughs were weird and strange the men sang one of their own wild chants two crickets sang also one on either side and did not cease their little monotone even when the three volleys were fired above the graves just before the coffins were lowered an old man whispered to me that i must have their position alteredthe heads must be towards the west so it was donethough they are in a place so veiled in woods that either rising or setting sun will find it hard to spy them we have now a good regimental hospital admirably arranged in a deserted ginhousea fine well of our own digging within the camp linesa full allowance of tents all flooreda wooden cookhouse to every company with sometimes a palmetto messhouse besidea substantial wooden guardhouse with a fireplace five feet in de clar where the men off duty can dry themselves and sleep comfortably in bunks afterwards we have also a great circular schooltent made of condemned canvas thirty feet in diameter and looking like some of the indian lodges i saw in kansas we now meditate a regimental bakery our aggregate has increased from four hundred and ninety to seven hundred and forty besides a hundred recruits now waiting at st augustine and we have practised through all the main movements in battalion drill affairs being thus prosperous and yesterday having been six weeks since my last and only visit to beaufort i rode in glanced at several camps and dined with the general it seemed absolutely like reentering the world and i did not fully estimate my past seclusion till it occurred to me as a strange and novel phenomenon that the soldiers at the other camps were white january this morning i went to beaufort again on necessary business and by good luck happened upon a review and drill of the white regiments the thing that struck me most was that same absence of uniformity in minor points that i noticed at first in my own officers the best regiments in the department are represented among my captains and lieutenants and very well represented too yet it has cost much labor to bring them to any uniformity in their drill there is no need of this for the prescribed tactics approach perfection it is never left discretionary in what place an officer shall stand or in what words he shall give his order all variation would seem to imply negligence yet even west point occasionally varies from the tacticsas for instance in requiring the line officers to face down the line when each is giving the order to his company in our strictest massachusetts regiments this is not done it needs an artists eye to make a perfect drillmaster yet the small points are not merely a matter of punctilio for the more perfectly a battalion is drilled on the paradeground the more quietly it can be handled in action moreover the great need of uniformity is this that in the field soldiers of different companies and even of different regiments are liable to be intermingled and a diversity of orders may throw everything into confusion confusion means bull run i wished my men at the review today for amidst all the rattling and noise of artillery and the galloping of cavalry there was only one infantry movement that we have not practised and that was done by only one regiment and apparently considered quite a novelty though it is easily taught forming square by caseys method forward on centre it is really just as easy to drill a regiment as a company perhaps easier because one has more time to think but it is just as essential to be sharp and decisive perfectly clearheaded and to put life into the men a regiment seems small when one has learned how to handle it a mere handful of men and i have no doubt that a brigade or a division would soon appear equally small but to handle eitherjudiciously ah that is another affair so of governing it is as easy to govern a regiment as a school or a factory and needs like qualities system promptness patience tact moreover in a regiment one has the aid of the admirable machinery of the army so that i see very ordinary men who succeed very tolerably reports of a six months armistice are rife here and the thought is deplored by all i cannot believe it yet sometimes one feels very anxious about the ultimate fate of these poor people after the experience of hungary one sees that revolutions may go backward and the habit of injustice seems so deeply impressed upon the whites that it is hard to believe in the possibility of anything better i dare not yet hope that the promise of the presidents proclamation will be kept for myself i can be indifferent for the experience here has been its own daily and hourly reward and the adaptedness of the freed slaves for drill and discipline is now thoroughly demonstrated and must soon be universally acknowledged but it would be terrible to see this regiment disbanded or defrauded january many things glide by without time to narrate them on saturday we had a mail with the presidents second message of emancipation and the next day it was read to the men the words themselves did not stir them very much because they have been often told that they were free especially on new years day and being unversed in politics they do not understand as well as we do the importance of each additional guaranty but the chaplain spoke to them afterwards very effectively as usual and then i proposed to them to hold up their hands and pledge themselves to be faithful to those still in bondage they entered heartily into this and the scene was quite impressive beneath the great oakbranches i heard afterwards that only one man refused to raise his hand saying bluntly that his wife was out of slavery with him and he did not care to fight the other soldiers of his company were very indignant and shoved him about among them while marching back to their quarters calling him coward i was glad of their exhibition of feeling though it is very possible that the one who had thus the moral courage to stand alone among his comrades might be more reliable on a pinch than some who yielded a more ready assent but the whole response on their part was very hearty and will be a good thing to which to hold them hereafter at any time of discouragement or demoralizationwhich was my chief reason for proposing it with their simple natures it is a great thing to tie them to some definite committal they never forget a marked occurrence and never seem disposed to evade a pledge it is this capacity of honor and fidelity which gives me such entire faith in them as soldiers without it all their religious demonstration would be mere sentimentality for instance every one who visits the camp is struck with their bearing as sentinels they exhibit in this capacity not an upstart conceit but a steady conscientious devotion to duty they would stop their idolized general saxton if he attempted to cross their beat contrary to orders i have seen them no feeble or incompetent race could do this the officers tell many amusing instances of this fidelity but i think mine the best it was very dark the other night an unusual thing here and the rain fell in torrents so i put on my indiarubber suit and went the rounds of the sentinels incognito to test them i can only say that i shall never try such an experiment again and have cautioned my officers against it tis a wonder i escaped with life and limbsuch a charging of bayonets and clicking of gunlocks sometimes i tempted them by refusing to give any countersign but offering them a piece of tobacco which they could not accept without allowing me nearer than the prescribed bayonets distance tobacco is more than gold to them and it was touching to watch the struggle in their minds but they always did their duty at last and i never could persuade them one man as if wishing to crush all his inward vacillation at one fell stroke told me stoutly that he never used tobacco though i found next day that he loved it as much as any one of them it seemed wrong thus to tamper with their fidelity yet it was a vital matter to me to know how far it could be trusted out of my sight it was so intensely dark that not more than one or two knew me even after i had talked with the very next sentinel especially as they had never seen me in indiarubber clothing and i can always disguise my voice it was easy to distinguish those who did make the discovery they were always conscious and simpering when their turn came while the others were stout and irreverent till i revealed myself and then rather cowed and anxious fearing to have offended it rained harder and harder and when i had nearly made the rounds i had had enough of it and simply giving the countersign to the challenging sentinel undertook to pass within the lines halt exclaimed this dusky man and brother bringing down his bayonet de countersign not correck now the magic word in this case was vicksburg in honor of a rumored victory but as i knew that these hard names became quite transformed upon their lips carthage being familiarized into cartridge and concord into corncob how could i possibly tell what shade of pronunciation my friend might prefer for this particular proper name vicksburg i repeated blandly but authoritatively endeavoring as zealously as one of christys minstrels to assimilate my speech to any supposed predilection of the ethiop vocal organs halt dar countersign not correck was the only answer the bayonet still maintained a position which in a military point of view was impressivei tried persuasion orthography threats tobacco all in vain i could not pass in of course my pride was up for was i to defer to an untutored african on a point of pronunciation classic shades of harvard forbid affecting scornful indifference i tried to edge away proposing to myself to enter the camp at some other point where my elocution would be better appreciated not a step could i stir halt shouted my gentleman again still holding me at his bayonets point and i wincing and halting i explained to him the extreme absurdity of this proceeding called his attention to the state of the weather which indeed spoke for itself so loudly that we could hardly hear each other speak and requested permission to withdraw the bayonet with mute eloquence refused the application there flashed into my mind with more enjoyment in the retrospect than i had experienced at the time an adventure on a lecturing tour in other years when i had spent an hour in trying to scramble into a country tavern after bedtime on the coldest night of winter on that occasion i ultimately found myself stuck midway in the window with my head in a temperature of degrees and my heels in a temperature of degrees with a heavy windowsash pinioning the small of my back however i had got safe out of that dilemma and it was time to put an end to this one call the corporal of the guard said i at last with dignity unwilling to make a night of it or to yield my incognito corporal ob de guard he shouted lustilypost number two while i could hear another sentinel chuckling with laughter this last was a special guard placed over a tent with a prisoner in charge presently he broke silence who am dat he asked in a stage whisper am he a buckra white man dunno whether he been a buckra or not responded doggedly my cerberus in uniform but is bound to keep him here till de corporal ob de guard come yet when that dignitary arrived and i revealed myself poor number two appeared utterly transfixed with terror and seemed to look for nothing less than immediate execution of course i praised his fidelity and the next day complimented him before the guard and mentioned him to his captain and the whole affair was very good for them all hereafter if satan himself should approach them in darkness and storm they will take him for de cunnel and treat him with special severity january in many ways the childish nature of this people shows itself i have just had to make a change of officers in a company which has constantly complained and with good reason of neglect and improper treatment two excellent officers have been assigned to them and yet they sent a deputation to me in the evening in a state of utter wretchedness wes bery grieved dis evening cunnel pears like we couldnt bear it to lose de capn and de lieutenant all two togeder argument was useless and i could only fall back on the general theory that i knew what was best for them which had much more effect and i also could cite the instance of another company which had been much improved by a new captain as they readily admitted so with the promise that the new officers should not be savage to we which was the one thing they deprecated i assuaged their woes twentyfour hours have passed and i hear them singing most merrily all down that company street i often notice how their griefs may be dispelled like those of children merely by permission to utter them if they can tell their sorrows they go away happy even without asking to have anything done about them i observe also a peculiar dislike of all intermediate control they always wish to pass by the company officer and deal with me personally for everything general saxton notices the same thing with the people on the plantations as regards himself i suppose this proceeds partly from the old habit of appealing to the master against the overseer kind words would cost the master nothing and he could easily put off any nonfulfilment upon the overseer moreover the negroes have acquired such constitutional distrust of white people that it is perhaps as much as they can do to trust more than one person at a tune meanwhile this constant personal intercourse is out of the question in a wellordered regiment and the remedy for it is to introduce by degrees more and more of system so that their immediate officers will become allsufficient for the daily routine it is perfectly true as i find everybody takes for granted that the first essential for an officer of colored troops is to gain their confidence but it is equally true though many persons do not appreciate it that the admirable methods and proprieties of the regular army are equally available for all troops and that the sublimest philanthropist if he does not appreciate this is unfit to command them another childlike attribute in these men which is less agreeable is a sort of blunt insensibility to giving physical pain if they are cruel to animals for instance it always reminds me of children pulling off flies legs in a sort of pitiless untaught experimental way yet i should not fear any wanton outrage from them after all their wrongs they are not really revengeful and i would far rather enter a captured city with them than with white troops for they would be more subordinate but for mere physical suffering they would have no fine sympathies the cruel things they have seen and undergone have helped to blunt them and if i ordered them to put to death a dozen prisoners i think they would do itwithout remonstrance yet their religious spirit grows more beautiful to me in living longer with them it is certainly far more so than at first when it seemed rather a matter of phrase and habit it influences them both on the negative and the positive side that is it cultivates the feminine virtues firstmakes them patient meek resigned this is very evident in the hospital there is nothing of the restless defiant habit of white invalids perhaps if they had more of this they would resist disease better imbued from childhood with the habit of submission drinking in through every pore that otherworld trust which is the one spirit of their songs they can endure everything this i expected but i am relieved to find that their religion strengthens them on the positive side alsogives zeal energy daring they could easily be made fanatics if i chose but i do not choose their whole mood is essentially mohammedan perhaps in its strength and its weakness and i feel the same degree of sympathy that i should if i had a turkish commandthat is a sort of sympathetic admiration not tending towards agreement but towards cooperation their philosophizing is often the highest form of mysticism and our dear surgeon declares that they are all natural transcendentalists the white camps seem rough and secular after this and i hear our men talk about a religious army a gospel army in their prayermeetings they are certainly evangelizing the chaplain who was rather a heretic at the beginning at least this is his own admission we have recruits on their way from st augustine where the negroes are chiefly roman catholics and it will be interesting to see how their type of character combines with that elder creed it is time for rest and i have just looked out into the night where the eternal stars shut down in concave protection over the yet glimmering camp and orion hangs above my tentdoor giving to me the sense of strength and assurance which these simple children obtain from their moses and the prophets yet external nature does its share in their training witness that most poetic of all their songs which always reminds me of the lykewake dirge in the scottish border minstrelsy i know moonrise i know starrise lay dis body down i walk in de moonlight i walk in de starlight to lay dis body down ill walk in de graveyard ill walk through de graveyard to lay dis body down ill lie in de grave and stretch out my arms lay dis body down i go to de judgment in de evening ob de day when i lay dis body down and my soul and your soul will meet in de day when i lay dis body down january in speaking of the military qualities of the blacks i should add that the only point where i am disappointed is one i have never seen raised by the most incredulous newspaper criticsnamely their physical condition to be sure they often look magnificently to my gymnasiumtrained eye and i always like to observe them when bathingsuch splendid muscular development set off by that smooth coating of adipose tissue which makes them like the southsea islanders appear even more muscular than they are their skins are also of finer grain than those of whites the surgeons say and certainly are smoother and far more free from hair but their weakness is pulmonary pneumonia and pleurisy are their besetting ailments they are easily made illand easily cured if promptly treated childish organizations again guardduty injures them more than whites apparently and doublequick movements in choking dust set them coughing badly but then it is to be remembered that this is their sickly season from january to march and that their healthy season will come in summer when the whites break down still my conviction of the physical superiority of more highly civilized races is strengthened on the whole not weakened by observing them as to availability for military drill and duty in other respects the only question i ever hear debated among the officers is whether they are equal or superior to whites i have never heard it suggested that they were inferior although i expected frequently to hear such complaints from hasty or unsuccessful officers of one thing i am sure that their best qualities will be wasted by merely keeping them for garrison duty they seem peculiarly fitted for offensive operations and especially for partisan warfare they have so much dash and such abundant resources combined with such an indianlike knowledge of the country and its ways these traits have been often illustrated in expeditions sent after deserters for instance i despatched one of my best lieutenants and my best sergeant with a squad of men to search a certain plantation where there were two separate negro villages they went by night and the force was divided the lieutenant took one set of huts the sergeant the other before the lieutenant had reached his first house every man in the village was in the woods innocent and guilty alike but the sergeants mode of operation was thus described by a corporal from a white regiment who happened to be in one of the negro houses he said that not a sound was heard until suddenly a red leg appeared in the open doorway and a voice outside said rally going to the door he observed a similar pair of red legs before every hut and not a person was allowed to go out until the quarters had been thoroughly searched and the three deserters found this was managed by sergeant prince rivers our colorsergeant who is provostsergeant also and has entire charge of the prisoners and of the daily policing of the camp he is a man of distinguished appearance and in old times was the crack coachman of beaufort in which capacity he once drove beauregard from this plantation to charleston i believe they tell me that he was once allowed to present a petition to the governor of south carolina in behalf of slaves for the redress of certain grievancesand that a placard offering two thousand dollars for his recapture is still to be seen by the wayside between here and charleston he was a sergeant in the old hunter regiment and was taken by general hunter to new york last spring where the chevrons on his arm brought a mob upon him in broadway whom he kept off till the police interfered there is not a white officer in this regiment who has more administrative ability or more absolute authority over the men they do not love him but his mere presence has controlling power over them he writes well enough to prepare for me a daily report of his duties in the camp if his education reached a higher point i see no reason why he should not command the army of the potomac he is jetblack or rather i should say wineblack his complexion like that of others of my darkest men having a sort of rich clear depth without a trace of sootiness and to my eye very handsome his features are tolerably regular and full of command and his figure superior to that of any of our white officersbeing six feet high perfectly proportioned and of apparently inexhaustible strength and activity his gait is like a panthers i never saw such a tread no antislavery novel has described a man of such marked ability he makes toussaint perfectly intelligible and if there should ever be a black monarchy in south carolina he will be its king january this morning is like may yesterday i saw bluebirds and a butterfly so this whiter of a fortnight is over i fancy there is a trifle less coughing in the camp we hear of other stations in the department where the mortality chiefly from yellow fever has been frightful dr is rubbing his hands professionally over the fearful tales of the surgeon of a new york regiment just from key west who has had two hundred cases of the fever i suppose he is a skilful highly educated man said i yes he responded with enthusiasm why he had seventy deathsas if that proved his superiority past question january and first sitting proud as a lung on his throne at the head of them all rode sir richard tyrone but i fancy that sir richard felt not much better satisfied with his following than i today j r l said once that nothing was quite so good as turtlesoup except mockturtle and i have heard officers declare that nothing was so stirring as real war except some exciting parade today for the first time i marched the whole regiment through beaufort and backthe first appearance of such a novelty on any stage they did march splendidly this all admit ms prediction was fulfilled will not be in bliss a thousand men every one as black as a coal i confess it to look back on twenty broad doubleranks of men for they marched by platoonsevery polished musket having a black face beside it and every face set steadily to the fronta regiment of freed slaves marching on into the futureit was something to remember and when they returned through the same streets marching by the flank with guns at a support and each man covering his fileleader handsomely the effect on the eye was almost as fine the band of the eighth maine joined us at the entrance of the town and escorted us in sergeant rivers said ecstatically afterwards in describing the affair and when dat band wheel in before us and march onmy god i quit dis world altogeder i wonder if he pictured to himself the many dusky regiments now unformed which i seemed to see marching up behind us gathering shape out of the dim air i had cautioned the men before leaving camp not to be staring about them as they marched but to look straight to the front every man and they did it with their accustomed fidelity aided by the sort of spontaneous eyeforeffect which is in all their melodramatic natures one of them was heard to say exultingly afterwards we didnt look to de right nor to de leff i didnt see notin in beaufort ebry step was worth a half a dollar and they all marched as if it were so they knew well that they were marching through throngs of officers and soldiers who had drilled as many months as we had drilled weeks and whose eyes would readily spy out every defect and i must say that on the whole with a few trivial exceptions those spectators behaved in a manly and courteous manner and i do not care to write down all the handsome things that were said whether said or not they were deserved and there is no danger that our men will not take sufficient satisfaction in their good appearance i was especially amused at one of our recruits who did not march in the ranks and who said after watching the astonishment of some white soldiers de buckra sojers look like a man who beenasteal a sheepthat is i suppose sheepish after passing and repassing through the town we marched to the paradeground and went through an hours drill forming squares and reducing them and doing other things which look hard on paper and are perfectly easy in fact and we were to have been reviewed by general saxton but he had been unexpectedly called to ladies island and did not see us at all which was the only thing to mar the mens enjoyment then we marched back to camp three miles the men singing the john brown song and all manner of thingsas happy creatures as one can well conceive it is worth mentioning before i close that we have just received an article about negro troops from the london spectator which is so admirably true to our experience that it seems as if written by one of us i am confident that there never has been in any american newspaper a treatment of the subject so discriminating and so wise january today brought a visit from majorgeneral hunter and his staff by general saxtons invitationthe former having just arrived in the department i expected them at dressparade but they came during battalion drill rather to my dismay andwe were caught in our old clothes it was our first review and i dare say we did tolerably but of course it seemed to me that the men never appeared so ill beforejust as one always thinks a party at ones own house a failure even if the guests seem to enjoy it because one is so keenly sensitive to every little thing that goes wrong after review and drill general hunter made the men a little speech at my request and told them that he wished there were fifty thousand of them general saxton spoke to them afterwards and said that fifty thousand muskets were on their way for colored troops the men cheered both the generals lustily and they were complimentary afterwards though i knew that the regiment could not have appeared nearly so well as on its visit to beaufort i suppose i felt like some anxious mamma whose children have accidentally appeared at dancingschool in their old clothes general hunter promises us all we wantpay when the funds arrive springfield rifled muskets and blue trousers moreover he has graciously consented that we should go on an expedition along the coast to pick up cotton lumber and above all recruits i declined an offer like this just after my arrival because the regiment was not drilled or disciplined not even the officers but it is all we wish for now what care i how black i be forty pounds will marry me quoth mother goose forty rounds will marry us to the american army past divorcing if we can only use them well our success or failure may make or mar the prospects of colored troops but it is well to remember in advance that military success is really less satisfactory than any other because it may depend on a moments turn of events and that may be determined by some trivial thing neither to be anticipated nor controlled napoleon ought to have won at waterloo by all reasonable calculations but who cares all that one can expect is to do ones best and to take with equanimity the fortune of war chapter up the st marys if sergeant rivers was a natural king among my dusky soldiers corporal robert sutton was the natural primeminister if not in all respects the ablest he was the wisest man in our ranks as large as powerful and as black as our goodlooking colorsergeant but more heavily built and with less personal beauty he had a more massive brain and a far more meditative and systematic intellect not yet grounded even in the spellingbook his modes of thought were nevertheless strong lucid and accurate and he yearned and pined for intellectual companionship beyond all ignorant men whom i have ever met i believe that he would have talked all day and all night for days together to any officer who could instruct him until his companions at least fell asleep exhausted his comprehension of the whole problem of slavery was more thorough and farreaching than that of any abolitionist so far as its social and military aspects went in that direction i could teach him nothing and he taught me much but it was his methods of thought which always impressed me chiefly superficial brilliancy he left to others and grasped at the solid truth of course his interest in the war and in the regiment was unbounded he did not take to drill with especial readiness but he was insatiable of it and grudged every moment of relaxation indeed he never had any such moments his mind was at work all the time even when he was singing hymns of which he had endless store he was not however one of our leading religionists but his moral code was solid and reliable like his mental processes ignorant as he was the years that bring the philosophic mind had yet been his and most of my young officers seemed boys beside him he was a florida man and had been chiefly employed in lumbering and piloting on the st marys river which divides florida from georgia down this stream he had escaped in a dugout and after thus finding the way had returned as had not a few of my men in other cases to bring away wife and child i wouldnt have left my child cunnel he said with an emphasis that sounded the depths of his strong nature and up this same river he was always imploring to be allowed to guide an expedition many other men had rival propositions to urge for they gained selfconfidence from drill and guardduty and were growing impatient of inaction ought to go to work sadont believe in we lyin in camp eatin up de perwisions such were the quaint complaints which i heard with joy looking over my notebooks of that period i find them filled with topographical memoranda jotted down by a flickering candle from the evening talk of the mennotes of vulnerable points along the coast charts of rivers locations of pickets i prized these conversations not more for what i thus learned of the country than for what i learned of the men one could thus measure their various degrees of accuracy and their average military instinct and i must say that in every respect save the accurate estimate of distances they stood the test well but no project took my fancy so much after all as that of the delegate from the st marys river the best peg on which to hang an expedition in the department of the south in those days was the promise of lumber dwelling in the very land of southern pine the department authorities had to send north for it at a vast expense there was reported to be plenty in the enemys country but somehow the colored soldiers were the only ones who had been lucky enough to obtain any thus far and the supply brought in by our men after flooring the tents of the white regiments and our own was running low an expedition of white troops four companies with two steamers and two schooners had lately returned emptyhanded after a weeks foraging and now it was our turn they said the mills were all burned but should we go up the st marys corporal sutton was prepared to offer more lumber than we had transportation to carry this made the crowning charm of his suggestion but there is never any danger of erring on the side of secrecy in a military department and i resolved to avoid all undue publicity for our plans by not finally deciding on any until we should get outside the bar this was happily approved by my superior officers majorgeneral hunter and brigadiergeneral saxton and i was accordingly permitted to take three steamers with four hundred and sixtytwo officers and men and two or three invited guests and go down the coast on my own responsibility we were in short to win our spurs and if as among the araucanians our spurs were made of lumber so much the better the whole history of the department of the south had been defined as a military picnic and now we were to take our share of the entertainment it seemed a pleasant share when after the usual vexations and delays we found ourselves january gliding down the full waters of beaufort river the three vessels having sailed at different hours with orders to rendezvous at st simons island on the coast of georgia until then the flagship so to speak was to be the ben de ford captain halletthis being by far the largest vessel and carrying most of the men major strong was in command upon the john adams an army gunboat carrying a thirtypound parrott gun two tenpound parrotts and an eightinch howitzer captain trowbridge since promoted lieutenantcolonel of the regiment had charge of the famous planter brought away from the rebels by robert small she carried a tenpound parrott gun and two howitzers the john adams was our main reliance she was an old east boston ferryboat a doubleender admirable for riverwork but unfit for seaservice she drew seven feet of water the planter drew only four but the latter was very slow and being obliged to go to st simons by an inner passage would delay us from the beginning she delayed us so much before the end that we virtually parted company and her career was almost entirely separated from our own from boyhood i have had a fancy for boats and have seldom been without a share usually more or less fractional in a rather indeterminate number of punts and wherries but when for the first time i found myself at sea as commodore of a fleet of armed steamersfor even the ben de ford boasted a sixpounder or soit seemed rather an unexpectedpromotion but it is a characteristic of army life that one adapts ones self as coolly as in a dream to the most novel responsibilities one sits on courtmartial for instance and decides on the life of a fellowcreature without being asked any inconvenient questions as to previous knowledge of blackstone and after such an experience shall one shrink from wrecking a steamer or two in the cause of the nation so i placidly accepted my naval establishment as if it were a new form of boatclub and looked over the charts balancing between one river and another as if deciding whether to pull up or down lake quinsigamond if military life ever contemplated the exercise of the virtue of humility under any circumstances this would perhaps have been a good opportunity to begin its practice but as the regulations clearly contemplated nothing of the kind and as i had never met with any precedent which looked in that direction i had learned to check promptly all such weak proclivities captain hallett proved the most frank and manly of sailors and did everything for our comfort he was soon warm in his praises of the demeanor of our men which was very pleasant to hear as this was the first time that colored soldiers in any number had been conveyed on board a transport and i know of no place where a white volunteer appears to so much disadvantage his mind craves occupation his body is intensely uncomfortable the daily emergency is not great enough to call out his heroic qualities and he is apt to be surly discontented and impatient even of sanitary rules the southern black soldier on the other hand is seldom seasick at least such is my experience and if properly managed is equally contented whether idle or busy he is moreover so docile that all needful rules are executed with cheerful acquiescence and the quarters can therefore be kept clean and wholesome very forlorn faces were soon visible among the officers in the cabin but i rarely saw such among the men pleasant still seemed our enterprise as we anchored at early morning in the quiet waters of st simons sound and saw the light fall softly on the beach and the low bluffs on the picturesque plantationhouses which nestled there and the graceful naval vessels that lay at anchor before us when we afterwards landed the air had that peculiar mediterranean translucency which southern islands wear and the plantation we visited had the loveliest tropical garden though tangled and desolate which i have ever seen in the south the deserted house was embowered in great blossoming shrubs and filled with hyacinthine odors among which predominated that of the little chickasaw roses which everywhere bloomed and trailed around there were figtrees and datepalms crapemyrtles and waxmyrtles mexican agaves and english ivies japonicas bananas oranges lemons oleanders jonquils great cactuses and wild florida lilies this was not the plantation which mrs kemble has since made historic although that was on the same island and i could not waste much sentiment over it for it had belonged to a northern renegade thomas butler king yet i felt then as i have felt a hundred times since an emotion of heartsickness at this desecration of a homesteadand especially when looking from a bare upper window of the empty house upon a range of broad flat sunny roofs such as children love to play on i thought how that place might have been loved by yet innocent hearts and i mourned anew the sacrilege of war i had visited the flagship wabash ere we left port royal harbor and had obtained a very kind letter of introduction from admiral dupont that stately and courtly potentate elegant as ones ideal french marquis and under these credentials i received polite attention from the naval officers at st simonsacting volunteer lieutenant budd of the gunboat potomska and acting master moses of the barque fernandina they made valuable suggestions in regard to the different rivers along the coast and gave vivid descriptions of the last previous trip up the st marys undertaken by captain stevens usn in the gunboat ottawa when he had to fight his way past batteries at every bluff in descending the narrow and rapid stream i was warned that no resistance would be offered to the ascent but only to our return and was further cautioned against the mistake then common of underrating the courage of the rebels it proved impossible to dislodge those fellows from the banks my informant said they had dug riflepits and swarmed like hornets and when fairly silenced in one direction they were sure to open upon us from another all this sounded alarming but it was nine months since the event had happened and although nothing had gone up the river meanwhile i counted on less resistance now and something must be risked anywhere we were delayed all that day in waiting for our consort and improved our time by verifying certain rumors about a quantity of new railroadiron which was said to be concealed in the abandoned rebel forts on st simons and jekyll islands and which would have much value at port royal if we could unearth it some of our men had worked upon these very batteries so that they could easily guide us and by the additional discovery of a large flatboat we were enabled to go to work in earnest upon the removal of the treasure these iron bars surmounted by a dozen feet of sand formed an invulnerable roof for the magazines and bombproofs of the fort and the men enjoyed demolishing them far more than they had relished their construction though the day was the th of january the sun was very oppressive upon the sands but all were in the highest spirits and worked with the greatest zeal the men seemed to regard these massive bars as their first trophies and if the rails had been wreathed with roses they could not have been got out in more holiday style nearly a hundred were obtained that day besides a quantity of fiveinch plank with which to barricade the very conspicuous pilothouses of the john adams still another day we were delayed and could still keep at this work not neglecting some foraging on the island from which horses cattle and agricultural implements were to be removed and the few remaining colored families transferred to fernandina i had now become quite anxious about the missing steamboat as the inner passage by which alone she could arrive was exposed at certain points to fire from rebel batteries and it would have been unpleasant to begin with a disaster i remember that as i stood on deck in the still and misty evening listening with strained senses for some sound of approach i heard a low continuous noise fromthe distance more wild and desolate than anything in my memory can parallel it came from within the vast girdle of mist and seemed like the cry of a myriad of lost souls upon the horizons verge it was dante become audible and yet it was but the accumulated cries of innumerable seafowl at the entrance of the outer bay late that night the planter arrived we left st simons on the following morning reached fort clinch by four oclock and there transferring two hundred men to the very scanty quarters of the john adams allowed the larger transport to go into fernandina while the two other vessels were to ascend the st marys river unless as proved inevitable in the end the defects in the boiler of the planter should oblige her to remain behind that night i proposed to make a sort of trialtrip up stream as far as township landing some fifteen miles there to pay our respects to captain clarks company of cavalry whose camp was reported to lie near by this was included in corporal suttons programme and seemed to me more inviting and far more useful to the men than any amount of mere foraging the thing really desirable appeared to be to get them under fire as soon as possible and to teach them by a few small successes the application of what they had learned in camp i had ascertained that the camp of this company lay five miles from the landing and was accessible by two roads one of which was a lumberpath not commonly used but which corporal sutton had helped to construct and along which he could easily guide us the plan was to go by night surround the house and negro cabins at the landing to prevent an alarm from being given then to take the side path and if all went well to surprise the camp but if they got notice of our approach through their pickets we should at worst have a fight in which the best man must win the moon was bright and the river swift but easy of navigation thus far just below township i landed a small advance force to surround the houses silently with them went corporal sutton and when after rounding the point i went on shore with a larger body of men he met me with a silent chuckle of delight and with the information that there was a negro in a neighboring cabin who had just come from the rebel camp and could give the latest information while he hunted up this valuable auxiliary i mustered my detachment winnowing out the men who had coughs not a few and sending them ignominiously on board again a process i had regularly to perform during this first season of catarrh on all occasions where quiet was needed the only exception tolerated at this time was in the case of one man who offered a solemn pledge that if unable to restrain his cough he would lie down on the ground scrape a little hole and cough into it unheard the ingenuity of this proposition was irresistible and the eager patient was allowed to pass muster it was after midnight when we set off upon our excursion i had about a hundred men marching by the flank with a small advanced guard and also a few flankers where the ground permitted i put my florida company at the head of the column and had by my side captain metcalf an excellent officer and sergeant mclntyre his first sergeant we plunged presently in pine woods whose resinous smell i can still remember corporal sutton marched near me with his captured negro guide whose first fear and sullenness had yielded to the magic news of the presidents proclamation then just issued of which governor andrew had sent me a large printed supplywe seldom found men who could read it but they all seemed to feel more secure when they held it in their hands we marched on through the woods with no sound but the peeping of the frogs in a neighboring marsh and the occasional yelping of a dog as we passed the hut of some cracker this yelping always made corporal sutton uneasy dogs are the detective officers of slaverys police we had halted once or twice to close up the ranks and had marched some two miles seeing and hearing nothing more i had got all i could out of our new guide and was striding on rapt in pleasing contemplation all had gone so smoothly that i had merely to fancy the rest as being equally smooth already i fancied our little detachment bursting out of the woods in swift surprise upon the rebel quartersalready the opposing commander after hastily firing a charge or two from his revolver of course above my head had yielded at discretion and was gracefully tendering in a stage attitude his unavailing swordwhen suddenly there was a trampling of feet among the advanced guard as they came confusedly to a halt and almost at the same instant a more ominous sound as of galloping horses in the path before us the moonlight outside the woods gave that dimness of atmosphere within which is more bewildering than darkness because the eyes cannot adapt themselves to it so well yet i fancied and others aver that they saw the leader of an approaching party mounted on a white horse and reining up in the pathway others again declare that he drew a pistol from the holster and took aim others heard the words charge in upon them surround them but all this was confused by the opening rifleshots of our advanced guard and as clear observation was impossible i made the men fix their bayonets and kneel in the cover on each side the pathway and i saw with delight the brave fellows with sergeant mclntyre at their head settling down in the grass as coolly and warily as if wild turkeys were the only game perhaps at the first shot a man fell at my elbow i felt it no more than if a tree had falleni was so busy watching my own men and the enemy and planning what to do next some of our soldiers misunderstanding the order fix bayonets were actually charging with them dashing off into the dim woods with nothing to charge at but the vanishing tail of an imaginary horsefor we could really see nothing this zeal i noted with pleasure and also with anxiety as our greatest danger was from confusion and scattering and for infantry to pursue cavalry would be a novel enterprise captain metcalf stood by me well in keeping the men steady as did assistant surgeon minor and lieutenant now captain jackson how the men in the rear were behaving i could not tell not so coolly i afterwards found because they were more entirely bewildered supposing until the shots came that the column had simply halted for a moments rest as had been done once or twice before they did not know who or where their assailants might be and the fall of the man beside me created a hasty rumor that i was killed so that it wason the whole an alarming experience for them they kept together very tolerably however while our assailants dividing rode along on each side through the open pinebarren firing into our ranks but mostly over the heads of the men my soldiers in turn fired rapidlytoo rapidly being yet beginnersand it was evident that dim as it was both sides had opportunity to do some execution i could hardly tell whether the fight had lasted ten minutes or an hour when as the enemys fire had evidently ceased or slackened i gave the order to cease firing but it was very difficult at first to make them desist the taste of gunpowder was too intoxicating one of them was heard to mutter indignantly why de cunnel order cease firing when de secesh blazin away at de rate ob ten dollar a day every incidental occurrence seemed somehow to engrave itself upon my perceptions without interrupting the main course of thought thus i know that in one of the pauses of the affair there came wailing through the woods a cracked female voice as if calling back some stray husband who had run out to join in the affray john john are you going to leave me john are you going to let me and the children be killed john i suppose the poor things fears of gunpowder were very genuine but it was such a wailing squeak and so infinitely ludicrous and john was probably ensconced so very safely in some hollow tree that i could see some of the men showing all their white teeth in the very midst of the fight but soon this sound with all others had ceased and left us in peaceful possession of the field i have made the more of this little affair because it was the first standup fight in which my men had been engaged though they had been under fire in an irregular way in their small early expeditions to me personally the event was of the greatest value it had given us all an opportunity to test each other and our abstract surmises were changed into positive knowledge hereafter it was of small importance what nonsense might be talked or written about colored troops so long as mine did not flinch it made no difference to me my brave young officers themselves mostly new to danger viewed the matter much as i did and yet we were under bonds of life and death to form a correct opinion which was more than could be said of the northern editors and our verdict was proportionately of greater value i was convinced from appearances that we had been victorious so far though i could not suppose that this would be the last of it we knew neither the numbers of the enemy nor their plans nor their present condition whether they had surprised us or whether we had surprised them was all a mystery corporal sutton was urgent to go on and complete the enterprise all my impulses said the same thing but then i had the most explicit injunctions from general saxton to risk as little as possible in this first enterprise because of the fatal effect on public sentiment of even an honorable defeat we had now an honorable victory so far as it went the officers and men around me were in good spirits but the rest of the column might be nervous and it seemed so important to make the first fight an entire success that i thought it wiser to let well alone nor have i ever changed this opinion for ones self montroses verse may be well applied to win or lose it all but one has no right to deal thus lightly with the fortunes of a race and that was the weight which i always felt as resting on our action if my raw infantry force had stood unflinchingly a nightsurprise from de boss cavalry as they reverentially termed them i felt that a good beginning had been made all hope of surprising the enemys camp was now at an end i was willing and ready to fight the cavalry over again but it seemed wiser that we not they should select the ground attending to the wounded therefore and making as we best could stretchers for those who were to be carried including the remains of the man killed at the first discharge private william parsons of company g and others who seemed at the point of death we marched through the woods to the landingexpecting at every moment to be involved in another fight this not occurring i was more than ever satisfied that we had won a victory for it was obvious that a mounted force would not allow a detachment of infantry to march two miles through open woods by night without renewing the fight unless they themselves had suffered a good deal on arrival at the landing seeing that there was to be no immediate affray i sent most of the men on board and called for volunteers to remain on shore with me and hold the plantationhouse till morning they eagerly offered and i was glad to see them when posted as sentinels by lieutenants hyde and jackson who stayed with me pace their beats as steadily and challenge as coolly as veterans though of course there was some powder wasted on imaginary foes greatly to my surprise however we had no other enemies to encounter we did not yet know that we had killed the first lieutenant of the cavalry and that our opponents had retreated to the woods in dismay without daring to return to their camp this at least was the account we heard from prisoners afterwards and was evidently the tale current in the neighborhood though the statements published in southern newspapers did not correspond admitting the death of lieutenant jones the tallahassee floridian of february th stated that captain clark finding the enemy in strong force fell back with his command to camp and removed his ordnance and commissary and other stores with twelve negroes on their way to the enemy captured on that day in the morning my invaluable surgeon dr rogers sent me his report of killed and wounded and i have been since permitted to make the following extracts from his notes one man killed instantly by ball through the heart and seven wounded one of whom will die braver men never lived one man with two bulletholes through the large muscles of the shoulders and neck brought off from the scene of action two miles distant two muskets and not a murmur has escaped his lips another robert sutton with three woundsone of which being on the skull may cost him his lifewould not report himself till compelled to do so by his officers while dressing his wounds he quietly talked of what they had done and of what they yet could do today i have had the colonel order him to obey me he is perfectly quiet and cool buttakes this whole affair with the religious bearing of a man who realizes that freedom is sweeter than life yet another soldier did not report himself at all but remained all night on guard and possibly i should not have known of his having had a buckshot in his shoulder if some duty requiring a sound shoulder had not been required of him today this last it may be added had persuaded a comrade to dig out the buckshot for fear of being ordered on the sicklist and one of those who were carried to the vessela man wounded through the lungsasked only if i were safe the contrary having been reported an officer may be pardoned some enthusiasm for such men as these the anxious night having passed away without an attack another problem opened with the morning for the first time my officers and men found themselves in possession of an enemys abode and though there was but little temptation to plunder i knew that i must here begin to draw the line i had long since resolved to prohibit absolutely all indiscriminate pilfering and wanton outrage and to allow nothing to be taken or destroyed but by proper authority the men to my great satisfaction entered into this view at once and so did perhaps a shade less readily in some cases the officers the greatest trouble was with the steamboat hands and i resolved to let them go ashore as little as possible most articles of furniture were already however before our visit gone from the plantationhouse which was now used only as a picketstation the only valuable article was a pianoforte for which a regular packingbox lay invitingly ready outside i had made up my mind in accordance with the orders given to naval commanders in that department to burn all picketstations and all villages from which i should be covertly attacked and nothing else and as this house was destined to the flames i should have left the piano in it but for the seductions of that box with such a receptacle all ready even to the cover it would have seemed like flying in the face of providence not to put the piano in i ordered it removed therefore and afterwards presented it to the school for colored children at fernandina this i mention because it was the only article of property i ever took or knowingly suffered to be taken in the enemys country save for legitimate military uses from first to last nor would i have taken this but for the thought of the school and as aforesaid the temptation of the box if any other officer has been more rigid with equal opportunities let him cast the first stone it is my desire to avoid the destruction of private property unless used for picket or guardstations or for other military purposes by the enemy of course if fired upon from any place it is your duty if possible to destroy it letter of admiral dupont commanding south atlantic squadron to lieutenantcommander hughes of united states gunboat mohawk fernandina harbor i think the zest with which the men finally set fire to the house at my order was enhanced by this previous abstemiousness but there is a fearful fascination in the use of fire which every child knows in the abstract and which i found to hold true in the practice on our way down river we had opportunity to test this again the ruined town of st marys had at that time a bad reputation among both naval and military men lying but a short distance above fernandina on the georgia side it was occasionally visited by our gunboats i was informed that the only residents of the town were three old women who were apparently kept there as spiesthat on our approach the aged crones would come out and wave white handkerchiefsthat they would receive us hospitably profess to be profoundly loyal and exhibit a portrait of washingtonthat they would solemnly assure us that no rebel pickets had been there for many weeksbut that in the adjoining yard we should find fresh horsetracks and that we should be fired upon by guerillas the moment we left the wharf my officers had been much excited by these tales and i had assured them that if this programme were literally carried out we would straightway return and burn the town or what was left of it for our share it was essential to show my officers and men that while rigid against irregular outrage we could still be inexorable against the enemy we had previously planned to stop at this town on our way down river for some valuable lumber which we had espied on a wharf and gliding down the swift current shelling a few bluffs as we passed we soon reached it punctual as the figures in a panorama appeared the old ladies with their white handkerchiefs taking possession of the town much of which had previously been destroyed by the gunboats and stationing the colorguard to their infinite delight in the cupola of the most conspicuous house i deployed skirmishers along the exposed suburb and set a detail of men at work on the lumber after a stately and decorous interview with the queens of society of st marysis it scott who says that nothing improves the manners like piracyi peacefully withdrew the men when the work was done there were faces of disappointment among the officersfor all felt a spirit of mischief after the last nights adventurewhen just as we had fairly swung out into the stream and were under way there came like the sudden burst of a tropical tornado a regular little hailstorm of bullets into the open end of the boat driving every gunner in an instant from his post and surprising even those who were looking to be surprised the shock was but for a second and though the bullets had pattered precisely like the sound of hail upon the iron cannon yet nobody was hurt with very respectable promptness order was restored our own shells were flying into the woods from which the attack proceeded and we were steaming up to the wharf again according to promise who shall describe the theatrical attitudes assumed by the old ladies as they reappeared at the frontdoorbeing luckily out of direct rangeand set the handkerchiefs in wilder motion than ever they brandished them they twirled them after the manner of the domestic mop they clasped their hands handkerchiefs included meanwhile their friends in the wood popped away steadily at us with small effect and occasionally an invisible fieldpiece thundered feebly from another quarter with equally invisible results reaching the wharf one company under lieutenant now captain danilson was promptly deployed in search of our assailants who soon grew silent not so the old ladies when i announcedto them my purpose and added with extreme regret that as the wind was high i should burn only that half of the town which lay to leeward of their house which did not after all amount to much between gratitude for this degree of mercy and imploring appeals for greater the treacherous old ladies manoeuvred with clasped hands and demonstrative handkerchiefs around me impairing the effect of their eloquence by constantly addressing me as mr captain for i have observed that while the sternest officer is greatly propitiated by attributing to him a rank a little higher than his own yet no one is ever mollified by an error in the opposite direction i tried however to disregard such low considerations and to strike the correct mean between the sublime patriot and the unsanctified incendiary while i could find no refuge from weak contrition save in greater and greater depths of courtesy and so melodramatic became our interview that some of the soldiers still maintain that dem dar ole secesh women been agwine for kiss de cunnel before we ended but of this monstrous accusation i wish to register an explicit denial once for all dropping down to fernandina unmolested after this affair we were kindly received by the military and naval commanderscolonel hawley of the seventh connecticut now brigadiergeneral hawley and lieutenantcommander hughes of the gunboat mohawk it turned out very opportunely that both of these officers had special errands to suggest still farther up the st marys and precisely in the region where i wished to go colonel hawley showed me a letter from the war department requesting him to ascertain the possibility of obtaining a supply of brick for fort clinch from the brickyard which had furnished the original materials but which had not been visited since the perilous rivertrip of the ottawa lieutenant hughes wished to obtain information for the admiral respecting a rebel steamerthe berosasaid to be lying somewhere up the river and awaiting her chance to run the blockade i jumped at the opportunity berosa and brickyardboth were near woodstock the former home of corporal sutton he was ready and eager to pilot us up the river the moon would be just right that evening setting at h m am and our boat was precisely the one to undertake the expedition its doubleheaded shape was just what was needed in that swift and crooked stream the exposed pilothouses had been tolerably barricaded with the thick planks from st simons and we further obtained some sandbags from fort clinch through the aid of captain sears the officer in charge who had originally suggested the expedition after brick in return for this aid the planter was sent back to the wharf at st marys to bring away a considerable supply of the same precious article which we had observed near the wharf meanwhile the john adams was coaling from naval supplies through the kindness of lieutenant hughes and the ben de ford was taking in the lumber which we had yesterday brought down it was a great disappointment to be unable to take the latter vessel up the river but i was unwillingly convinced that though the depth of water might be sufficient yet her length would be unmanageable in the swift current and sharp turns the planter must also be sent on a separate cruise as her weak and disabled machinery made her useless for my purpose two hundred men were therefore transferred as before to the narrow hold of the john adams in addition to the company permanently stationed on board to work the guns at seven oclock on the evening of january th beneath a lovely moon we steamed up the river never shall i forget the mystery and excitement of that night i know nothing in life more fascinating than the nocturnal ascent of an unknown river leading far into an enemys country where one glides in the dim moonlight between dark hills and meadows each turn of the channel making it seem like an inland lake and cutting you off as by a barrier from all behindwith no sign of human life but an occasional picketfire left glimmering beneath the bank or the yelp of a dog from some lowlying plantation on such occasions every nerve is strained to its utmost tension all dreams of romance appear to promise immediate fulfilment all lights on board the vessel are obscured loud voices are hushed you fancy a thousand men on shore and yet see nothing the lonely river unaccustomed to furrowing keels lapses by the vessel with a treacherous sound and all the senses are merged in a sort of anxious trance three tunes i have had in full perfection this fascinating experience but that night was the first and its zest was the keenest it will come back to me in dreams if i live a thousand years i feared no attack during our ascentthat danger was for our return but i feared the intricate navigation of the river though i did not fully know till the actual experience how dangerous it was we passed without trouble far above the scene of our first fightthe battle of the hundred pines as my officers had baptized it and ever as we ascended the banks grew steeper the current swifter the channel more tortuous and more encumbered with projecting branches and drifting wood no piloting less skilful than that of corporal sutton and his mate james bezzard could have carried us through i thought and no sidewheel steamer less strong than a ferryboat could have borne the crash and force with which we struck the wooded banks of the river but the powerful paddles built to break the northern ice could crush the southern pine as well and we came safely out of entanglements that at first seemed formidable we had the tide with us which makes steering far more difficult and in the sharp angles of the river there was often no resource but to run the bow boldly on shore let the stern swing round and then reverse the motion as the reversing machinery was generally out of order the engineer stupid or frightened and the captain excited this involved moments of tolerably concentrated anxiety eight times we grounded in the upper waters and once lay aground for half an hour but at last we dropped anchor before the little town of woodstock after moonset and an hour before daybreak just as i had planned and so quietly that scarcely a dog barked and not a soul in the town as we afterwards found knew of our arrival as silently as possible the great flatboat which we had brought from st simons was filled with men major strong was sent on shore with two companiesthose of captain james and captain metcalfwith instructions to surround the town quietly allow no one to leave it molest no one and hold as temporary prisoners every man whom he found i watched them push off into the darkness got the remaining force ready to land and then paced the deck for an hour insilent watchfulness waiting for rifleshots not a sound came from the shore save the barking of dogs and the morning crow of cocks the time seemed interminable but when daylight came i landed and found a pair of scarlet trousers pacing on their beat before every house in the village and a small squad of prisoners stunted and forlorn as falstaffs ragged regiment already hi hand i observed with delight the good demeanor of my men towards these forlorn anglosaxons and towards the more tumultuous women even one soldier who threatened to throw an old termagant into the river took care to append the courteous epithet madam i took a survey of the premises the chief house a pretty one with picturesque outbuildings was that of mrs a who owned the mills and lumberwharves adjoining the wealth of these wharves had not been exaggerated there was lumber enough to freight half a dozen steamers and i half regretted that i had agreed to take down a freight of bricks instead further researches made me grateful that i had already explained to my men the difference between public foraging and private plunder along the riverbank i found building after building crowded with costly furniture all neatly packed just as it was sent up from st marys when that town was abandoned pianos were a drug china glassware mahogany pictures all were here and here were my men who knew that their own labor had earned for their masters these luxuries or such as these their own wives and children were still sleeping on the floor perhaps at beaufort or fernandina and yet they submitted almost without a murmur to the enforced abstinence bed and bedding for our hospitals they might take from those storeroomssuch as the surgeon selectedalso an old flag which we found in a corner and an old fieldpiece which the regiment still possessesbut after this the doors were closed and left unmolested it cost a struggle to some of the men whose wives were destitute i know but their pride was very easily touched and when this abstinence was once recognized as a rule they claimed it as an honor in this and all succeeding expeditions i flatter myself that if they had once been set upon wholesale plundering they would have done it as thoroughly as their betters but i have always been infinitely grateful both for the credit and for the discipline of the regimentas well as for the mens subsequent livesthat the opposite method was adopted when the morning was a little advanced i called on mrs a who received me in quite a stately way at her own door with to what am i indebted for the honor of this visit sir the foreign name of the family and the tropical look of the buildings made it seem as indeed did all the rest of the adventure like a chapter out of amyas leigh but as i had happened to hear that the lady herself was a philadelphian and her deceased husband a newyorker i could not feel even that modicum of reverence due to sincere southerners however i wished to present my credentials so calling up my companion i said that i believed she had been previously acquainted with corporal robert sutton i never saw a finer bit of unutterable indignation than came over the face of my hostess as she slowly recognized him she drew herself up and dropped out the monosyllables of her answer as if they were so many drops of nitric acid ah quoth my lady we called him bob it was a group for a painter the whole drama of the war seemed to reverse itself in an instant and my tall welldressed imposing philosophic corporal dropped down the immeasurable depth into a mere plantation bob again so at least in my imagination not to that person himself too essentially dignified in his nature to be moved by words where substantial realities were in question he simply turned from the lady touched his hat to me and asked if i would wish to see the slavejail as he had the keys in his possession if he fancied that i was in danger of being overcome by blandishments and needed to be recalled to realities it was a masterstroke i must say that when the door of that villanous edifice was thrown open before me i felt glad that my main interview with its lady proprietor had passed before i saw it it was a small building like a northern cornbarn and seemed to have as prominent and as legitimate a place among the outbuildings of the establishment in the middle of the door was a large staple with a rusty chain like an oxchain for fastening a victim down when the door had been opened after the death of the late proprietor my informant said a man was found padlocked in that chain we found also three pairs of stocks of various construction two of which had smaller as well as larger holes evidently for the feet of women or children in a building near by we found something far more complicated which was perfectly unintelligible till the men explained all its parts a machine so contrived that a person once imprisoned in it could neither sit stand nor lie but must support the body half raised in a position scarcely endurable i have since bitterly reproached myself for leaving this piece of ingenuity behind but it would have cost much labor to remove it and to bring away the other trophies seemed then enough i remember the unutterable loathing with which i leaned against the door of that prisonhouse i had thought myself seasoned to any conceivable horrors of slavery but it seemed as if the visible presence of that den of sin would choke me of course it would have been burned to the ground by us but that this would have involved the sacrifice of every other building and all the piles of lumber and for the moment it seemed as if the sacrifice would be righteous but i forbore and only took as trophies the instruments of torture and the keys of the jail we found but few colored people in this vicinity some we brought away with us and an old man and woman preferred to remain all the white males whom we found i took as hostages in order to shield us if possible from attack on our way down river explaining to them that they would be put on shore when the dangerous points were passed i knew that their wives could easily send notice of this fact to the rebel forces along the river my hostages were a forlornlooking set of crackers far inferior to our soldiers in physique and yet quite equal the latter declared to the average material of the southern armies none were in uniform but this proved nothing as to their being soldiers one of them a mere boy wascaptured at his own door with gun in hand it was a fowlingpiece which he used only as his mother plaintively assured me to shoot little birds with as the guileless youth had for this purpose loaded the gun with eighteen buckshot we thought it justifiable to confiscate both the weapon and the owner in mercy to the birds we took from this place for the use of the army a flock of some thirty sheep forty bushels of rice some other provisions tools oars and a little lumber leaving all possible space for the bricks which we expected to obtain just below i should have gone farther up the river but for a dangerous boom which kept back a great number of logs in a large brook that here fell into the st marys the stream ran with force and if the rebels had wit enough to do it they might in ten minutes so choke the river with driftwood as infinitely to enhance our troubles so we dropped down stream a mile or two found the very brickyard from which fort clinch had been constructedstill stored with bricks and seemingly unprotected here sergeant rivers again planted his standard and the men toiled eagerly for several hours in loading our boat to the utmost with the bricks meanwhile we questioned black and white witnesses and learned for the first tune that the rebels admitted a repulse at township landing and that lieutenant jones and ten of their number were killedthough this i fancy to have been an exaggeration they also declared that the mysterious steamer berosa was lying at the head of the river but was a brokendown and worthless affair and would never get to sea the result has since proved this for the vessel subsequently ran the blockade and foundered near shore the crew barely escaping with their lives i had the pleasure as it happened of being the first person to forward this information to admiral dupont when it came through the pickets many months afterthus concluding my report on the berosa before the work at the yard was over the pickets reported mounted men in the woods near by as had previously been the report at woodstock this admonished us to lose no time and as we left the wharf immediate arrangements were made to have the gun crews all in readiness and to keep the rest of the men below since their musketry would be of little use now and i did not propose to risk a life unnecessarily the chief obstacle to this was their own eagerness penned down on one side they popped up on the other their officers too were eager to see what was going on and were almost as hard to cork down as the men add to this that the vessel was now very crowded and that i had to be chiefly on the hurricanedeck with the pilots captain clifton master of the vessel was brave to excess and as much excited as the men he could no more be kept in the little pilothouse than they below and when we had passed one or two bluffs with no sign of an enemy he grew more and more irrepressible and exposed himself conspicuously on the upper deck perhaps we all were a little lulled by apparent safety for myself i lay down for a moment on a settee in a stateroom having been on my feet almost without cessation for twentyfour hours suddenly there swept down from a bluff above us on the georgia side a mingling of shout and roar and rattle as of a tornado let loose and as a storm of bullets came pelting against the sides of the vessel and through a window there went up a shrill answering shout from our own men it took but an instant for me to reach the gundeck after all my efforts the men had swarmed once more from below and already crowding at both ends of the boat were loading and firing with inconceivable rapidity shouting to each other nebber gib it up and of course having no steady aim as the vessel glided and whirled in the swift current meanwhile the officers in charge of the large guns had their crews in order and our shells began to fly over the bluffs which as we now saw should have been shelled in advance only that we had to economize ammunition the other soldiers i drove below almost by main force with the aid of their officers who behaved exceedingly well giving the men leave to fire from the open portholes which lined the lower deck almost at the waters level in the very midst of the melee major strong came from the upper deck with a face of horror and whispered to me captain clifton was killed at the first shot by my side if he had said that the vessel was on fire the shock would hardly have been greater of course the military commander on board a steamer is almost as helpless as an unarmed man so far as the risks of water go a seaman must command there in the hazardous voyage of last night i had learned though unjustly to distrust every official on board the steamboat except this excitable brave warmhearted sailor and now among these added dangers to lose him the responsibility for his life also thrilled me he was not among my soldiers and yet he was killed i thought of his wife and children of whom he had spoken but one learns to think rapidly in war and cautioning the major to silence i went up to the hurricanedeck and drew in the helpless body that it should be safe from further desecration and then looked to see where we were we were now gliding past a safe reach of marsh while our assailants were riding by crosspaths to attack us at the next bluff it was reeds bluff where we were first attacked and scrubby bluff i think was next they were shelled in advance but swarmed manfully to the banks again as we swept round one of the sharp angles of the stream beneath their fire my men were now pretty well imprisoned below in the hot and crowded hold and actually fought each other the officers afterwards said for places at the open portholes from which to aim others implored to be landed exclaiming that they supposed de cunnel knew best but it was mighty mean to be shut up down below when they might be fightin de secesh in de clar field this clear field and no favor was what they thenceforward sighed for but in such difficult navigation it would have been madness to think of landing although one daring rebel actually sprang upon the large boat which we towed astern where he was shot down by one of our sergeants this boat was soon after swamped and abandoned then taken and repaired by the rebels at a later date and finally by a piece of dramatic completeness was seized by a party of fugitive slaves who escaped in it to our lines and some of whom enlisted in my own regiment it has always been rather a mystery to me why the rebels did not fell a few trees across the stream at some of the manysharp angles where we might so easily have been thus imprisoned this however they did not attempt and with the skilful pilotage of our trusty corporalphilosophic as socrates through all the din and occasionally relieving his mind by taking a shot with his rifle through the high portholes of the pilothousewe glided safely on the steamer did not ground once on the descent and the mate in command mr smith did his duty very well the plank sheathing of the pilothouse was penetrated by few bullets though struck by so many outside that it was visited as a curiosity after our return and even among the guncrews though they had no protection not a man was hurt as we approached some wooded bluff usually on the georgia side we could see galloping along the hillside what seemed a regiment of mounted riflemen and could see our shell scatter them ere we approached shelling did not however prevent a rather fierce fusilade from our old friends of captain darks company at watermans bluff near township landing but even this did no serious damage and this was the last it was of course impossible while thus running the gauntlet to put our hostages ashore and i could only explain to them that they must thank their own friends for their inevitable detention i was by no means proud of their forlorn appearance and besought colonel hawley to take them off my hands but he was sending no flags of truce at that time and liked their looks no better than i did so i took them to port royal where they were afterwards sent safely across the lines our men were pleased at taking them back with us as they had already said regretfully spose we leave dem secesh at fernandina general saxby wont see emas if they were some new natural curiosity which indeed they were one soldier further suggested the expediency of keeping them permanently in camp to be used as marks for the guns of the relieved guard every morning but this was rather an ebullition of fancy than a sober proposition against these levities i must put a piece of more tragic eloquence which i took down by night on the steamers deck from the thrilling harangue of corporal adam allston one of our most gifted prophets whose influence over the men was unbounded when i heard he said de bombshell ascreamin troo de woods like de judgment day i said to myself if my head was took off tonight dey couldnt put my soul in de torments perceps except god was my enemy and when de riflebullets came whizzin across de deck i cried aloud god help my congregation boys load and fire i must pass briefly over the few remaining days of our cruise at fernandina we met the planter which had been successful on her separate expedition and had destroyed extensive saltworks at crooked river under charge of the energetic captain trowbridge efficiently aided by captain rogers our commodities being in part delivered at fernandina our decks being full coal nearly out and time up we called once more at st simons sound bringing away the remainder of our railroadiron with some which the naval officers had previously disinterred and then steamed back to beaufort arriving there at sunrise february i made my way with dr rogers to general saxtons bedroom and laid before him the keys and shackles of the slaveprison with my report of the good conduct of the menas dr rogers remarked a message from heaven and another from hell slight as this expedition now seems among the vast events of the war the future student of the newspapers of that day will find that it occupied no little space in their columns so intense was the interest which then attached to the novel experiment of employing black troops so obvious too was the value during this raid of their local knowledge and their enthusiasm that it was impossible not to find in its successes new suggestions for the war certainly i would not have consented to repeat the enterprise with the bravest white troops leaving corporal sutton and his mates behind for i should have expected to fail for a year after our raid the upper st marys remained unvisited till in the large force with which we held florida secured peace upon its banks then mrs a took the oath of allegiance the government bought her remaining lumber and the john adams again ascended with a detachment of my men under lieutenant parker and brought a portion of it to fernandina by a strange turn of fortune corporal sutton now sergeant was at this time in jail at hilton head under sentence of courtmartial for an alleged act of mutinyan affair in which the general voice of our officers sustained him and condemned his accusers so that he soon received a full pardon and was restored in honor to his place in the regiment which he has ever since held nothing can ever exaggerate the fascinations of war whether on the largest or smallest scale when we settled down into camplife again it seemed like a butterflys folding its wings to reenter the chrysalis none of us could listen to the crack of a gun without recalling instantly the sharp shots that spilled down from the bluffs of the st marys or hear a sudden trampling of horsemen by night without recalling the sounds which startled us on the field of the hundred pines the memory of our raid was preserved in the camp by many legends of adventure growing vaster and more incredible as time wore onand by the morning appeals to the surgeon of some veteran invalids who could now cut off all reproofs and suspicions with doctor is been a sickly pusson eber since de expeditious but to me the most vivid remembrancer was the flock of sheep which we had lifted the post quartermaster discreetly gave us the charge of them and they rilled a gap in the landscape and in the larderwhich last had before presented one unvaried round of impenetrable beef mr obabiah oldbuck when he decided to adopt a pastoral life and assumed the provisional name of thyrsis never looked upon his flocks and herds with more unalloyed contentment than i upon that fleecy family i had been familiar in kansas with the metaphor by which the sentiments of an owner were credited to his property and had heard of a proslavery colt and an antislavery cow the fact that these sheep were but recently converted from secesh sentiments was their crowning charm methought they frisked and fattened in the joy of their deliverance from the shadow of mrs as slavejail and gladly contemplated translation into muttonbroth for sick or wounded soldiers the very slaves who once perchance were sold at auction with yon aged patriarch of the flock had now asserted theirhumanity and would devour him as hospital rations meanwhile our shepherd bore a sharp bayonet without a crook and i felt myself a peer of ulysses and rob roythose sheepstealers of less elevated aimswhen i met in my daily rides these wandering trophies of our wider wanderings chapter up the st johns there was not much stirring in the department of the south early in and the st marys expedition had afforded a new sensation of course the few officers of colored troops and a larger number who wished to become such were urgent for further experiments in the same line and the florida taxcommissioners were urgent likewise i well remember the morning when after some preliminary correspondence i steamed down from beaufort s c to hilton head with general saxton judge s and one or two others to have an interview on the matter with majorgeneral hunter then commanding the department hilton head in those days seemed always like some foreign military station in the tropics the long low white buildings with piazzas and verandas on the waterside the general impression of heat and lassitude existence appearing to pulsate only with the seabreeze the sandy almost impassable streets and the firm level beach on which everybody walked who could get there all these suggested jamaica or the east indies then the headquarters at the end of the beach the zouave sentinels the successive anterooms the lounging aids the goodnatured and easy generaleasy by habit and energetic by impulseall had a certain air of southern languor rather picturesque but perhaps not altogether bracing general hunter received us that day with his usual kindliness there was a good deal of pleasant chat miles oreilly was called in to read his latest verses and then we came to the matter in hand jacksonville on the st johns river in florida had been already twice taken and twice evacuated having been occupied by brigadiergeneral wright in march and by brigadiergeneral brannan in october of the same year the second evacuation was by majorgeneral hunters own order on the avowed ground that a garrison of five thousand was needed to hold the place and that this force could not be spared the present proposition was to take and hold it with a brigade of less than a thousand men carrying however arms and uniforms for twice that number and a months rations the claim was that there were fewer rebel troops in the department than formerly and that the st marys expedition had shown the advantage possessed by colored troops in local knowledge and in the confidence of the loyal blacks it was also urged that it was worth while to risk something in the effort to hold florida and perhaps bring it back into the union my chief aim in the negotiation was to get the men into action and that of the florida commissioners to get them into florida thus far coinciding we could heartily cooperate and though general hunter made some reasonable objections they were yielded more readily than i had feared and finally before half our logical ammunition was exhausted the desired permission was given and the thing might be considered as done we were now to leave as we supposed forever the camp which had thus far been our home our vast amount of surplus baggage made a heavy job in the loading inasmuch as we had no wharf and everything had to be put on board by means of flatboats it was completed by twentyfour hours of steady work and after some of the usual uncomfortable delays which wait on military expeditions we were at last afloat i had tried to keep the plan as secret as possible and had requested to have no definite orders until we should be on board ship but this larger expedition was less within my own hands than was the st marys affair and the great reliance for concealment was on certain counter reports ingeniously set afloat by some of the florida men these reports rapidly swelled into the most enormous tales and by the time they reached the new york newspapers the expedition was a great volcano about bursting whose lava will burn flow and destroy the sudden appearance in arms of no less than five thousand negroes a liberating host not the phantom but the reality of servile insurrection what the undertaking actually was may be best seen in the instructions which guided it headquarters beaufort s c march colonelyou will please proceed with your command the first and second regiments south carolina volunteers which are now embarked upon the steamers john adams boston and burnside to fernandina florida relying upon your military skill and judgment i shall give you no special directions as to your procedure after you leave fernandina i expect however that you will occupy jacksonville florida and intrench yourselves there the main objects of your expedition are to carry the proclamation of freedom to the enslaved to call all loyal men into the service of the united states to occupy as much of the state of florida as possible with the forces under your command and to neglect no means consistent with the usages of civilized warfare to weaken harass and annoy those who are in rebellion

colonel higginson comdg expeditionary corps in due time after touching at fernandina we reached the difficult bar of the st johns and were piloted safely over admiral dupont had furnished a courteous letter of introduction and we were cordially received by commander duncan of the norwich and lieutenant watson commanding the uncas like all officers on blockade duty they were impatient of their enforced inaction and gladly seized the opportunity for a different service it was some time since they had ascended as high as jacksonville for their orders were strict one vessels coal was low the other was in infirm condition and there were rumors of cottonclads and torpedoes but they gladly agreed to escort us up the river so soon as our own armed gunboat the john adams should arriveshe being unaccountably delayed flag ship wabash port royal harbor s c march siri am informed by majorgeneral hunter that he is sending colonel higginson on an important mission in the southerly part of his

to give respectfully your obedient servant s f dupont rearadm comdg s atl block squad to the senior officer at the different blockading stations on the coast of georgia and florida we waited twentyfour hours for her at the sultry mouth of that glassy river watching the great pelicans which floated lazily on its tide or sometimes shooting one to admire the great pouch into which one of the soldiers could insert his foot as into a boot he hold one quart said the admiring experimentalist hi boy retorted another quickly neber you bring dat quart measure in my peck o corn the protest came very promptly and was certainly fair for the strange receptacle would have held nearly a gallon we went on shore too and were shown a rather pathetic little garden which the naval officers had laid out indulging a dream of vegetables they lingered over the little microscopic sprouts pointing them out tenderly as if they were cradled babies i have often noticed this touching weakness in gentlemen of that profession on lonely stations we wandered among the bluffs too in the little deserted hamlet called pilot town the evershifting sand had in some cases almost buried the small houses and had swept around others a circular drift at a few yards distance overtopping then eaves and leaving each the untouched citadel of this natural redoubt there was also a dismantled lighthouse an object which always seems the most dreary symbol of the barbarism of war when one considers the national beneficence which reared and kindled it despite the service rendered by this once brilliant light there were many wrecks which had been strown upon the beach victims of the most formidable of the southern riverbars as i stood with my foot on the halfburied ribs of one of these vesselsso distinctly traced that one might almost fancy them human the old pilot my companion told me the story of the wreck the vessel had formerly been in the cuba trade and her owner an american merchant residing in havana had christened her for his young daughter i asked the name and was startled to recognize that of a favorite young cousin of mine besides the bones of whose representative i was thus strangely standing upon this lonely shore it was well to have something to relieve the anxiety naturally felt at the delay of the john adamsanxiety both for her safety and for the success of our enterprise the rebels had repeatedly threatened to burn the whole of jacksonville in case of another attack as they had previously burned its mills and its great hotel it seemed as if the news of our arrival must surely have travelled thirty miles by this time all day we watched every smoke that rose among the wooded hills and consulted the compass and the map to see if that sign announced the doom of our expected home at the very last moment of the tide just in time to cross the bar that day the missing vessel arrived all anxieties vanished i transferred my quarters on board and at two the next morning we steamed up the river again there was the dreamy delight of ascending an unknown stream beneath a sinking moon into a region where peril made fascination since the time of the first explorers i suppose that those southern waters have known no sensations so dreamy and so bewitching as those which this war has brought forth i recall in this case the faintest sensations of our voyage as ponce de leon may have recalled those of his wandering search in the same soft zone for the secret of the mystic fountain i remember how during that night i looked for the first time through a powerful nightglass it had always seemed a thing wholly inconceivable that a mere lens could change darkness into light and as i turned the instrument on the preceding gunboat and actually discerned the man at the wheel and the others standing about him all relapsing into vague gloom again at the withdrawal of the glassit gave a feeling of childish delight yet it seemed only in keeping with the whole enchantment of the scene and had i been some aladdin convoyed by genii or giants i could hardly have felt more wholly a denizen of some world of romance but the river was of difficult navigation and we began to feel sometimes beneath the keel that ominous sliding grating treacherous arrest of motion which makes the heart shudder as the vessel does there was some solicitude abouttorpedoes alsoa peril which became a formidable thing one year later in the very channel where we found none soon one of our consorts grounded then another every vessel taking its turn i believe and then in turn getting off until the norwich lay hopelessly stranded for that tide at least a few miles below jacksonville and out of sight of the city so that she could not even add to our dignity by her visible presence from afar this was rather a serious matter as the norwich was our main naval reliance the uncas being a small steamer of less than two hundred tons and in such poor condition that commander duncan on finding himself aground at first quite declined to trust his consort any farther alone but having got thus far it was plainly my duty to risk the remainder with or without naval assistance and this being so the courageous officer did not long object but allowed his dashing subordinate to steam up with us to the city this left us one naval and one army gunboat and fortunately the burnside being a black propeller always passed for an armed vessel among the rebels and we rather encouraged that pleasing illusion we had aimed to reach jacksonville at daybreak but these mishaps delayed us and we had several hours of fresh early sunshine lighting up the green shores of that lovely river wooded to the waters edge with sometimes an emerald meadow opening a vista to some picturesque houseall utterly unlike anything we had yet seen in the south and suggesting rather the penobscot or kennebec here and there we glided by the ruins of some sawmill burned by the rebels on general wrights approach but nothing else spoke of war except perhaps the silence it was a delicious day and a scene of fascination our florida men were wild with delight and when we rounded the point below the city and saw from afar its long streets its brick warehouses its white cottages and its overshadowing treesall peaceful and undisturbed by flamesit seemed in the mens favorite phrase too much good and all discipline was merged for the moment in a buzz of ecstasy the city was still there for us at any rate though none knew what perils might be concealed behind those quiet buildings yet there were children playing on the wharves careless men here and there lounged down to look at us hands in pockets a few women came to their doors and gazed listlessly upon us shading their eyes with their hands we drew momently nearer in silence and with breathless attention the gunners were at their posts and the men in line it was eight oclock we were now directly opposite the town yet no sign of danger was seen not a rifleshot was heard not a shell rose hissing in the air the uncas rounded to and dropped anchor in the stream by previous agreement i steamed to an upper pier of the town colonel montgomery to a lower one the little boathowitzers were run out upon the wharves and presently to the angles of the chief streets and the pretty town was our own without a shot in spite of our detention the surprise had been complete and not a soul in jacksonville had dreamed of our coming the day passed quickly in eager preparations for defence the people could or would give us no definite information about the rebel camp which was however known to be near and our force did not permit our going out to surprise it the night following was the most anxious i ever spent we were all tired out the companies were under arms in various parts of the town to be ready for an attack at any moment my temporary quarters were beneath the loveliest grove of lindentrees and as i reclined halfdozing the mockingbirds sang all night like nightingalestheir notes seeming to trickle down through the sweet air from amid the blossoming boughs day brought relief and the sense of due possession and we could see what we had won jacksonville was now a united states post again the only post on the mainland in the department of the south before the war it had three or four thousand inhabitants and a rapidly growing lumbertrade for which abundant facilities were evidently provided the wharves were capacious and the blocks of brick warehouses along the lower street were utterly unlike anything we had yet seen in that region as were the neatness and thrift everywhere visible it had been built up by northern enterprise and much of the property was owned by loyal men it had been a great resort for invalids though the rebels had burned the large hotel which once accommodated them mills had also been burned but the dwellinghouses were almost all in good condition the quarters for the men were admirable and i took official possession of the handsome brick house of colonel sunderland the established headquarters through every occupation whose accommodating flagstaff had literally and repeatedly changed its colors the seceded colonel reputed author of the state ordinance of secession was a newyorker by birth and we found his lawcard issued when in practice in easton washington county new york he certainly had good taste in planning the inside of a house though time had impaired its condition there was a neat office with ample bookcases and no books a billiardtable with no balls gasfixtures without gas and a bathingroom without water there was a separate building for servants quarters and a kitchen with every convenience even to a few jars of lingering pickles on the whole there was an air of substance and comfort about the town quite alien from the picturesque decadence of beaufort the town rose gradually from the river and was bounded on the rear by a long sluggish creek beyond which lay a stretch of woods affording an excellent covert for the enemy but without great facilities for attack as there were but two or three fords and bridges this brook could easily be held against a small force but could at any time and at almost any point be readily crossed by a large one north of the town the land rose a little between the river and the sources of the brook and then sank to a plain which had been partially cleared by a previous garrison for so small a force as ours however this clearing must be extended nearer to the town otherwise our lines would be too long for our numbers this deficiency in numbers at once became a source of serious anxiety while planning the expedition it had seemed soimportant to get the men a foothold in florida that i was willing to risk everything for it but this important post once in our possession it began to show some analogies to the proverbial elephant in the lottery to hold it permanently with nine hundred men was not perhaps impossible with the aid of a gunboat i had left many of my own regiment sick and on duty in beaufort and colonel montgomery had as yet less than one hundred and fifty but to hold it and also to make forays up the river certainly required a larger number we came in part to recruit but had found scarcely an ablebodied negro in the city all had been removed farther up and we must certainly contrive to follow them i was very unwilling to have as yet any white troops under my command with the blacks finally however being informed by judge s of a conversation with colonel hawley commanding at fernandina in which the latter had offered to send four companies and a light battery to swell our forcein view of the aid given to his position by this more advanced post i decided to authorize the energetic judge to go back to fernandina and renew the negotiation as the john adams must go thither at any rate for coal meanwhile all definite display of our force was avoided dressparades were omitted the companies were so distributed as to tell for the utmost and judicious use was made here and there of empty tents the gunboats and transports moved impressively up and down the river from time to time the disposition of pickets was varied each night to perplex the enemy and some advantage taken of his distrust which might be assumed as equalling our own the citizens were duly impressed by our supply of ammunition which was really enormous and all these things soon took effect a loyal woman who came into town said that the rebel scouts stopping at her house reported that there were sixteen hundred negroes all over the woods and the town full of them besides it was of no use to go in general finnegan had driven them into a bad place once and should not do it again they had lost their captain and their best surgeon in the first skirmish and if the savannah people wanted the negroes driven away they might come and do it themselves unfortunately we knew that they could easily come from savannah at any time as there was railroad communication nearly all the way and every time we heard the steamwhistle the men were convinced of their arrival thus we never could approach to any certainty as to their numbers while they could observe from the bluffs every steamboat that ascended the river to render our weak force still more available we barricaded the approaches to the chief streets by constructing barriers or felling trees it went to my heart to sacrifice for this purpose several of my beautiful lindens but it was no time for aesthetics as the giants lay on the ground still scenting the air with their abundant bloom i used to rein up my horse and watch the children playing hideandseek amongst their branches or some quiet cow grazing at the foliage nothing impresses the mind in war like some occasional object or association that belongs apparently to peace alone among all these solicitudes it was a great thing that one particular anxiety vanished in a day on the former expedition the men were upon trial as to their courage now they were to endure another test as to their demeanor as victors here were five hundred citizens nearly all white at the mercy of their former slaves to some of these whites it was the last crowning humiliation and they were or professed to be in perpetual fear on the other hand the most intelligent and ladylike woman i saw the wife of a rebel captain rather surprised me by saying that it seemed pleasanter to have these men stationed there whom they had known all their lives and who had generally borne a good character than to be in the power of entire strangers certainly the men deserved the confidence for there was scarcely an exception to their good behavior i think they thoroughly felt that their honor and dignity were concerned in the matter and took too much pride in their character as soldiersto say nothing of higher motivesto tarnish it by any misdeeds they watched their officers vigilantly and even suspiciously to detect any disposition towards compromise and so long as we pursued a just course it was evident that they could be relied on yet the spot was pointed out to me where two of our leading men had seen their brothers hanged by lynch law many of them had private wrongs to avenge and they all had utter disbelief in all pretended loyalty especially on the part of the women one citizen alone was brought to me in a sort of escort of honor by corporal prince lambkinone of the colorguard and one of our ablest menthe same who had once made a speech in camp reminding his hearers that they had lived under the american flag for eighteen hundred and sixtytwo years and ought to live and die under it corporal lambkin now introduced his man a german with the highest compliment in his power he hab true coloredman heart surrounded by mean cajoling insinuating white men and women who were all that and worse i was quite ready to appreciate the quality he thus proclaimed a coloredman heart in the rebel states is a fair synonyme for a loyal heart and it is about the only such synonyme in this case i found afterwards that the man in question a small grocer had been an object of suspicion to the whites from his readiness to lend money to the negroes or sell to them on credit in which perhaps there may have been some mixture of selfinterest with benevolence i resort to a notebook of that period well thumbed and pocketworn which sometimes received a fragment of the days experience march of course droll things are constantly occurring every white man woman and child is flattering seductive and professes union sentiment every black ditto believes that every white ditto is a scoundrel and ought to be shot but for good order and military discipline the provost marshal and i steer between them as blandly as we can such scenes as succeed each other rush of indignant africans a white man in womans clothes has

and indeed not one of them gave a drop of milkneither did hers let her wait till the next lot comes inthat is allyesterdays operations gave the following total yield thirty contrabands eighteen horses eleven cattle ten saddles and bridles and one new armywagon at this rate we shall soon be selfsupporting cavalry where complaints are made of the soldiers it almost always turns out that the women have insulted them most grossly swearing at them and the like one unpleasant old dutch woman came in bursting with wrath and told the whole narrative of her blameless life diversified with sobs last january i ran off two of my black people from st marys to fernandina sobthen i moved down there myself and at lake city i lost six women and a boy sobthen i stopped at baldwin for one of the wenches to be confined sobthen i brought them all here to live in a christian country sob sob then the blockheads blockades that is gunboats came and they all ran off with the blockheads sob sob sob and left me an old lady of fortysix obliged to work for a living chaos of sobs without cessation but when i found what the old sinner had said to the soldiers i rather wondered at their selfcontrol in not throttling her meanwhile skirmishing went on daily in the outskirts of the town there was a fight on the very first day when our men killed as before hinted a rebel surgeon which was oddly metamorphosed in the southern newspapers into their killing one of ours which certainly never happened every day after this they appeared in small mounted squads in the neighborhood and exchanged shots with our pickets to which the gunboats would contribute their louder share their aim being rather embarrassed by the woods and hills we made reconnoissances too to learn the country in different directions and were apt to be fired upon during these along the farther side of what we called the debatable land there was a line of cottages hardly superior to negro huts and almost all empty where the rebel pickets resorted and from whose windows they fired by degrees all these nests were broken up and destroyed though it cost some trouble to do it and the hottest skirmishing usually took place around them among these little affairs was one which we called company ks skirmish because it brought out the fact that this company which was composed entirely of south carolina men and had never shone in drill or discipline stood near the head of the regiment for coolness and couragethe defect of discipline showing itself only in their extreme unwillingness to halt when once let loose it was at this time that the small comedy of the goose occurredan anecdote which wendell phillips has since made his own one of the advancing line of skirmishers usually an active fellow enough was observed to move clumsily and irregularly it soon appeared that he had encountered a fine specimen of the domestic goose which had surrendered at discretion not wishing to lose it he could yet find no way to hold it but between his legs and so he went on loading firing advancing halting always with the goose writhing and struggling and hissing in this natural pair of stocks both happily came off unwounded and retired in good order at the signal or some time after it but i have hardly a cooler thing to put on record meanwhile another fellow left the field less exultingly for after a thoroughly courageous share in the skirmish he came blubbering to his captain and saidcappen make caesar gib me my cane it seemed that during some interval of the fighting he had helped himself to an armful of rebel sugarcane such as they all delighted in chewing the roman hero during another pause had confiscated the treasure whence these tears of the returning warrior i never could accustom myself to these extraordinary interminglings of manly and childish attributes our most untiring scout during this period was the chaplain of my regimentthe most restless and daring spirit we had and now exulting in full liberty of action he it was who was daily permitted to stray singly where no other officer would have been allowed to go so irresistible was his appeal you know i am only a chaplain methinks i see our regimental saint with pistols in belt and a ballard rifle slung on shoulder putting spurs to his steed and cantering away down some questionable woodpath or returning with some tale of rebel haunt discovered or store of foraging he would track an enemy like an indian or exhort him when apprehended like an early christian some of our devout soldiers shook their heads sometimes over the chaplains little eccentricities woffor mr chapman made a preacher for said one of them as usual transforming his title into a patronymic hes de fightingest more yankee i eber see in all my days and the criticism was very natural though they could not deny that when the hour for sunday service came mr f commanded the respect and attention of all that hour never came however on our first sunday in jacksonville we were too busy and the men too scattered so the chaplain made his accustomed foray beyond the lines instead is it not sunday slyly asked an unregenerate lieutenant nay quoth his reverence waxing fervid it is the day of judgment this reminds me of a raid up the river conducted by one of our senior captains an enthusiast whose gray beard and prophetic manner always took me back to the fifthmonarchy men he was most successful that day bringing backhorses cattle provisions and prisoners and one of the latter complained bitterly to me of being held stating that captain r had promised him speedy liberty but that doughty official spurned the imputation of such weak blandishments in this day of triumphant retribution promise him said he i promised him nothing but the day of judgment and periods of damnation often since have i rolled beneath my tongue this savory and solemn sentence and i do not believe that since the days of the long parliament there has been a more resounding anathema in colonel montgomerys hands these upriver raids reached the dignity of a fine art his conceptions of foraging were rather more western and liberal than mine and on these excursions he fully indemnified himself for any undue abstinence demanded of him when in camp i remember being on the wharf with some naval officers when he came down from his first trip the steamer seemed an animated hencoop live poultry hung from the foremast shrouds dead ones from the mainmast geese hissed from the binnacle a pig paced the quarterdeck and a ducks wings were seen fluttering from a line which was wont to sustain duck trousers the naval heroes mindful of their own short rations and taking high views of ones duties in a conquered country looked at me reproachfully as who should say shall these things be in a moment or two the returning foragers had landed captain said montgomery courteously would you allow me to send a remarkably fine turkey for your use on board ship lieutenant said major corwin may i ask your acceptance of a pair of ducks for your mess never did i behold more cordial relations between army and navy than sprang into existence at those sentences so true it is as charles lamb says that a single present of game may diffuse kindly sentiments through a whole community these little trips were called rest there was no other rest during those ten days an immense amount of picket and fatigue duty had to be done two redoubts were to be built to command the northern valley all the intervening grove which now afforded lurkingground for a daring enemy must be cleared away and a few houses must be reluctantly razed for the same purpose the fort on the left was named fort higginson and that built by my own regiment in return fort montgomery the former was necessarily a hasty work and is now i believe in ruins the latter was far more elaborately constructed on lines well traced by the fourth new hampshire during the previous occupation it did great credit to captain trowbridge of my regiment formerly of the new york volunteer engineers who had charge of its construction how like a dream seems now that period of daily skirmishes and nightly watchfulness the fatigue was so constant that the days hurried by i felt the need of some occasional change of ideas and having just received from the north mr brooks beautiful translation of jean pauls titan i used to retire to my bedroom for some ten minutes every afternoon and read a chapter or two it was more refreshing than a nap and will always be to me one of the most fascinating books in the world with this added association after all what concerned me was not so much the fear of an attempt to drive us out and retake the cityfor that would be against the whole policy of the rebels in that regionas of an effort to fulfil their threats and burn it by some nocturnal dash the most valuable buildings belonged to union men and the upper part of the town built chiefly of resinous pine was combustible to the last degree in case of fire if the wind blew towards the river we might lose steamers and all i remember regulating my degree of disrobing by the direction of the wind if it blew from the river it was safe to make ones self quite comfortable if otherwise it was best to conform to suwarrows idea of luxury and take off one spur so passed our busy life for ten days there were no tidings of reinforcements and i hardly knew whether i wished for themor rather i desired them as a choice of evils for our men were giving out from overwork and the recruiting excursions for which we had mainly come were hardly possible at the utmost i had asked for the addition of four companies and a light battery judge of my surprise when two infantry regiments successively arrived i must resort to a scrap from the diary perhaps diaries are apt to be thought tedious but i would rather read a page of one whatever the events described than any more deliberate narrativeit gives glimpses so much more real and vivid headquarters jacksonville march midnight for the last twentyfour hours we have been sending women and children out of town in answer to a demand by flag of truce with a threat of bombardment n b i advised them not to go and the majority declined doing so it was designed no doubt to intimidate and in our ignorance of the force actually outside we have had to recognize the possibility of danger and work hard at our defences at any time by going into the outskirts we can have a skirmish which is nothing but fun but when night closes in over a small and weary garrison there sometimes steals into my mind like a chill that most sickening of all sensations the anxiety of a commander this was the night generally set for an attack if any though i am pretty well satisfied that they have not strength to dare it and the worst they could probably do is to burn the town but tonight instead of enemies appear friendsour devoted civic ally judge s and a whole connecticut regiment the sixth under major meeker and though the latter are aground twelve miles below yet they enable one to breathe more freely i only wish they were black but now i have to show not only that blacks can fight but that they andwhite soldiers can act in harmony together that evening the enemy came up for a reconnoissance in the deepest darkness and there were alarms all night the next day the sixth connecticut got afloat and came up the river and two days after to my continued amazement arrived a part of the eighth maine under lieutenantcolonel twichell this increased my command to four regiments or parts of regiments half white and half black skirmishing had almost ceasedour defences being tolerably complete and looking from without much more effective than they really were we were safe from any attack by a small force and hoped that the enemy could not spare a large one from charleston or savannah all looked bright without and gave leisure for some small anxieties within it was the first time in the war so far as i know that white and black soldiers had served together on regular duty jealousy was still felt towards even the officers of colored regiments and any difficult contingency would be apt to bring it out the white soldiers just from shipboard felt a natural desire to stray about the town and no attack from an enemy would be so disastrous as the slightest collision between them and the black provostguard i shudder even now to think of the train of consequences bearing on the whole course of subsequent national events which one such mishap might then have produced it is almost impossible for us now to remember in what a delicate balance then hung the whole question of negro enlistments and consequently of slavery fortunately for my own serenity i had great faith in the intrinsic power of military discipline and also knew that a common service would soon produce mutual respect among good soldiers and so it proved but the first twelve hours of this mixed command were to me a more anxious period than any outward alarms had created let us resort to the notebook again jacksonville march it is sunday the bell is ringing for church and rev mr f from beaufort is to preach this afternoon our good quartermaster establishes a sundayschool for our little colony of contrabands now numbering seventy sunday afternoon the bewildering report is confirmed and in addition to the sixth connecticut which came yesterday appears part of the eighth maine the remainder with its colonel will be here tomorrow and report says majorgeneral hunter now my hope is that we may go to some point higher up the river which we can hold for ourselves there are two other points magnolia and pilatka which in themselves are as favorable as this and for getting recruits better so i shall hope to be allowed to go to take posts and then let white troops garrison themthat is my programme what makes the thing more puzzling is that the eighth maine has only brought ten days rations so that they evidently are not to stay here and yet where they go or why they come is a puzzle meanwhile we can sleep sound o nights and if the black and white babies do not quarrel and pull hair we shall do very well colonel rust on arriving said frankly that he knew nothing of the plans prevailing in the department but that general hunter was certainly coming soon to act for himself that it had been reported at the north and even at port royal that we had all been captured and shot and indeed i had afterwards the pleasure of reading my own obituary in a northern democratic journal and that we certainly needed reinforcements that he himself had been sent with orders to carry out so far as possible the original plans of the expedition that he regarded himself as only a visitor and should remain chiefly on shipboardwhich he did he would relieve the black provostguard by a white one if i approvedwhich i certainly did but he said that he felt bound to give the chief opportunities of action to the colored troopswhich i also approved and which he carried out not quite to the satisfaction of his own eager and daring officers i recall one of these enterprises out of which we extracted a good deal of amusement it was baptized the battle of the clotheslines a white company was out scouting in the woods behind the town with one of my best florida men for a guide and the captain sent back a message that he had discovered a rebel camp with twentytwo tents beyond a creek about four miles away the officers and men had been distinctly seen and it would be quite possible to capture it colonel rust at once sent me out with two hundred men to do the work recalling the original scouts and disregarding the appeals of his own eager officers we marched through the open pine woods on a delightful afternoon and met the returning party poor fellows i never shall forget the longing eyes they cast on us as we marched forth to the field of glory from which they were debarred we went three or four miles out sometimes halting to send forward a scout while i made all the men lie down in the long thin grass and beside the fallen trees till one could not imagine that there was a person there i remember how picturesque the effect was when at the signal all rose again like roderick dhus men and the green wood appeared suddenly populous with armed life at a certain point forces were divided and a detachment was sent round the head of the creek to flank the unsuspecting enemy while we of the main body stealing with caution nearer and nearer through ever denser woods swooped down at last in triumph upon a solitary farmhouse where the familywashing had been hung out to dry this was the rebel camp it is due to sergeant greene my invaluable guide to say that he had from the beginning discouraged any high hopes of a crossing of bayonets he had early explained that it was not he who claimed to have seen the tents and the rebel soldiers but one of the officersand had pointed out that our undisturbed approach was hardly reconcilable with theexistence of a hostile camp so near this impression had also pressed more and more upon my own mind but it was our business to put the thing beyond a doubt probably the place may have been occasionally used for a picketstation and we found fresh horsetracks in the vicinity and there was a quantity of iron bridlebits in the house of which no clear explanation could be given so that the armed men may not have been wholly imaginary but camp there was none after enjoying to the utmost the fun of the thing therefore we borrowed the only horse on the premises hung all the bits over his neck and as i rode him back to camp they clanked like broken chains we were joined on the way by our dear and devoted surgeon whom i had left behind as an invalid but who had mounted his horse and ridden out alone to attend to our wounded his green sash looking quite in harmony with the early spring verdure of those lovely woods so came we back in triumph enjoying the joke all the more because some one else was responsible we mystified the little community at first but soon let out the secret and witticisms abounded for a day or two the mildest of which was the assertion that the author of the alarm must have been three sheets in the wind another expedition was of more exciting character for several days before the arrival of colonel rust a reconnaissance had been planned in the direction of the enemys camp and he finally consented to its being carried out by the energy of major corwin of the second south carolina volunteers aided by mr holden then a gunner on the paul jones and afterwards made captain of the same regiment one of the tenpound parrott guns had been mounted on a handcar for use on the railway this it was now proposed to bring into service i took a large detail of men from the two white regiments and from my own and had instructions to march as far as the fourmile station on the railway if possible examine the country and ascertain if the rebel camp had been removed as was reported beyond that distance i was forbidden going any farther from camp or attacking the rebel camp as my force comprised half our garrison and should the town meanwhile be attacked from some other direction it would be in great danger i never shall forget the delight of that march through the open pine barren with occasional patches of uncertain swamp the eighth maine under lieutenantcolonel twichell was on the right the sixth connecticut under major meeker on the left and my own men under major strong in the centre having in charge the cannon to which they had been trained mr heron from the john adams acted as gunner the mounted rebel pickets retired before us through the woods keeping usually beyond range of the skirmishers who in a long linewhite black whitewere deployed transversely for the first time i saw the two colors fairly alternate on the military chessboard it had been the object of much labor and many dreams and i liked the pattern at last nothing was said about the novel fact by anybodyit all seemed to come as matterofcourse there appeared to be no mutual distrust among the men and as for the officers doubtless each crow thought its own young the whitesti certainly did although doing full justice to the eager courage of the northern portion of my command especially i watched with pleasure the fresh delight of the maine men who had not like the rest been previously in action and who strode rapidly on with their long legs irresistibly recalling as their gaunt athletic frames and sunburnt faces appeared here and there among the pines the lumber regions of their native state with which i was not unfamiliar we passed through a former camp of the rebels from which everything had been lately removed but when the utmost permitted limits of our reconnoissance were reached there were still no signs of any other camp and the rebel cavalry still kept provokingly before us their evident object was to lure us on to their own stronghold and had we fallen into the trap it would perhaps have resembled on a smaller scale the olustee of the following year with a good deal of reluctance however i caused the recall to be sounded and after a slight halt we began to retrace our steps straining our eyes to look along the reach of level railway which stretched away through the pine barren we began to see certain ominous puffs of smoke which might indeed proceed from some fire in the woods but were at once set down by the men as coming from the mysterious locomotive battery which the rebels were said to have constructed gradually the smoke grew denser and appeared to be moving up along the track keeping pace with our motion and about two miles distant i watched it steadily through a fieldglass from our own slowly moving battery it seemed to move when we moved and to halt when we halted sometimes in the dun smoke i caught a glimpse of something blacker raised high in the air like the threatening head of some great gliding serpent suddenly there came a sharp puff of lighter smoke that seemed like a forked tongue and then a hollow report and we could see a great black projectile hurled into the air and falling a quarter of a mile away from us in the woods i did not at once learn that this first shot killed two of the maine men and wounded two more this was fired wide but the numerous shots which followed were admirably aimed and seldom failed to fall or explode close to our own smaller battery it was the first time that the men had been seriously exposed to artillery firea danger more exciting to the ignorant mind than any other as this very war has shown so i watched them anxiously fortunately there were deep trenches on each side the railway with many stout projecting roots forming very tolerable bombproofs for those who happened to be near them the enemys gun was a sixtyfourpound blakely as we afterward found whose enormous projectile moved very slowly and gave ample time to coverinsomuch that while the fragments of shell fell all around and amongst us not a man was hurt this soon gave the men the most buoyant confidence and they shouted with childish delight over every explosion take this for example the effect was electrical the rebels were the best men in fords command being lieutenantcolonel showalters californians and they are brave men they had dismounted and sent their horses to the rear and were undoubtedly determined upon a desperate fight and their superior numbers made them confident of success butthey never fought with artillery and a cannon has more terror for them than ten thousand rifles and all the wild camanches on the plains of texas at first glimpse of the shining brass monsters there was a visible wavering in the determined front of the enemy and as the shells came screaming over their heads the scare was complete they broke ranks fled for their horses scrambled on the first that came to hand and skedaddled in the direction of brownsvillenew york evening post september the moment a shell had burst or fallen unburst our little gun was invariably fired in return and that with some precision so far as we could judge its range also being nearly as great for some reason they showed no disposition to overtake us in which attempt their locomotive would have given them an immense advantage over our heavy handcar and their cavalry force over our infantry nevertheless i rather hoped that they would attempt it for then an effort might have been made to cut them off in the rear by taking up some rails as it was this was out of the question though they moved slowly as we moved keeping always about two miles away when they finally ceased firing we took up the rails beyond us before withdrawing and thus kept the enemy from approaching so near the city again but i shall never forget that dantean monster rearing its black head amid the distant smoke nor the solicitude with which i watched for the puff which meant danger and looked round to see if my chickens were all under cover the greatest peril after all was from the possible dismounting of our gun in which case we should have been very apt to lose it if the enemy had showed any dash there may be other such tilts of railway artillery on record during the war but if so i have not happened to read of them and so have dwelt the longer on this this was doubtless the same locomotive battery which had previously fired more than once upon the townrunning up within two miles and then withdrawing while it was deemed inexpedient to destroy the railroad on our part lest it might be needed by ourselves in turn one night too the rebel threat had been fulfilled and they had shelled the town with the same battery they had the range well and every shot fell near the post headquarters it was exciting to see the great blakely shell showing a light as it rose and moving slowly towards us like a comet then exploding and scattering its formidable fragments yet strange to say no serious harm was done to life or limb and the most formidable casualty was that of a citizen who complained that a shell had passed through the wall of his bedroom and carried off his mosquito curtain in its transit little knew we how soon these small entertainments would be over colonel montgomery had gone up the river with his two companies perhaps to remain permanently and i was soon to follow on friday march th i wrote home the burnside has gone to beaufort for rations and the john adams to fernandina for coal we expect both back by sunday and on monday i hope to get the regiment off to a point farther upmagnolia thirtyfive miles or pilatka seventyfive either of which would be a good post for us general hunter is expected every day and it is strange he has not come the very next day came an official order recalling the whole expedition and for the third time evacuating jacksonville a council of military and naval officers was at once called though there was but one thing to be done and the latter were even more disappointed and amazed than the former this was especially the case with the senior naval officer captain steedman a southcarolinian by birth but who had proved himself as patriotic as he was courteous and able and whose presence and advice had been of the greatest value to me he and all of us felt keenly the wrongfulness of breaking the pledges which we had been authorized to make to these people and of leaving them to the mercy of the rebels once more most of the people themselves took the same view and eagerly begged to accompany us on our departure they were allowed to bring their clothing and furniture also and at once developed that insane mania for aged and valueless trumpery which always seizes upon the human race i believe in moments of danger with the greatest difficulty we selected between the essential and the nonessential and our few transports were at length loaded to the very waters edge on the morning of march thcolonel montgomery having by this time returned from upriver with sixteen prisoners and the fruits of foraging in plenty and upon that last morning occurred an act on the part of some of the garrison most deeply to be regretted and not to be excused by the natural indignation at their recallan act which through the unfortunate eloquence of one newspaper correspondent rang through the nationthe attempt to burn the town i fortunately need not dwell much upon it as i was not at the time in command of the postas the white soldiers frankly took upon themselves the whole responsibility and as all the fires were made in the wooden part of the city which was occupied by them while none were made in the brick part where the colored soldiers were quartered it was fortunate for our reputation that the newspaper accounts generally agreed in exculpating us from all share in the matter and the single exception which one correspondent asserted i could never verify and do not believe to have existed it was stated by colonel rust in his official report that some twentyfive buildings in all were burned and i doubt if the actual number was greater but this was probably owing in part to a change of wind and did not diminish the discredit of the transaction it made our sorrow at departure no less though it infinitely enhanced the impressiveness of the scene the colored regiments had nothing at all to do with it they behaved with propriety throughout boston journal correspondence carleton the negro troops took no part whatever in the perpetration of this vandalismnew york tribune correspondence n pwe know not whether we are most rejoiced or saddened to observe by the general concurrence of accounts that the negro soldiers had nothing to do with the barbarous act boston journal editorial april the excitement of the departure was intense the embarkation was so laborious that it seemed as if the flames must be upon us before we could get on board and it was also generally expected that the rebel skirmishers would be down among the houses wherever practicable to annoy us to the utmost as had been the case at the previous evacuation they were indeed there as we afterwards heard but did not venture to molest us the sight and roar of the flames and the rolling clouds of smoke brought home to the impressible minds of the black soldiers all their favorite imagery of the judgmentday and those who were not too much depressed by disappointment were excited by the spectacle and sang and exhorted without ceasing with heavy hearts their officers floated down the lovely river which we had ascended with hopes so buoyant and from that day to this the reasons for our recall have never been made public it was commonly attributed to proslavery advisers acting on the rather impulsive nature of majorgeneral hunter with a view to cut short the career of the colored troops and stop their recruiting but it may have been simply the scarcity of troops in the department and the renewed conviction at headquarters that we were too few to hold the post alone the latter theory was strengthened by the fact that when general seymour reoccupied jacksonville the following year he took with him twenty thousand men instead of one thousandand the sanguinary battle of olustee found him with too few chapter out on picket one can hardly imagine a body of men more disconsolate than a regiment suddenly transferred from an adventurous life in the enemys country to the quiet of a sheltered camp on safe and familiar ground the men under my command were deeply dejected when on a most appropriate daythe first of april they found themselves unaccountably recalled from florida that region of delights which had seemed theirs by the right of conquest my dusky soldiers who based their whole walk and conversation strictly on the ancient israelites felt that the prophecies were all set at naught and that they were on the wrong side of the red sea indeed i fear they regarded even me as a sort of reversed moses whose pisgah fronted in the wrong direction had they foreseen how the next occupation of the promised land was destined to result they might have acquiesced with more of their wonted cheerfulness as it was we were very glad to receive after a few days of discontented repose on the very ground where we had once been so happy an order to go out on picket at port royal ferry with the understanding that we might remain there for some time this picket station was regarded as a sort of military picnic by the regiments stationed at beaufort south carolina it meant blackberries and oysters wild roses and magnolias flowery lanes instead of sandy barrens and a sort of guerilla existence in place of the camp routine to the colored soldiers especially with their love of country life and their extensive personal acquaintance on the plantations it seemed quite like a christmas festival besides they would be in sight of the enemy and who knew but there might by the blessing of providence be a raid or a skirmish if they could not remain on the st johns river it was something to dwell on the coosaw in the end they enjoyed it as much as they expected and though we went out several times subsequently until it became an old story the enjoyment never waned and as even the march from the camp to the picket lines was something that could not possibly have been the same for any white regiment in the service it is worth while to begin at the beginning and describe it a regiment ordered on picket was expected to have reveille at daybreak and to be in line for departure by sunrise this delighted our men who always took a childlike pleasure in being out of bed at any unreasonable hour and by the time i had emerged the tents were nearly all struck and the great wagons were lumbering into camp to receive them with whatever else was to be transported the first rays of the sun must fall upon the line of these wagons moving away across the wide paradeground followed by the column of men who would soon outstrip them but on the occasion which i especially describe the sun was shrouded and when once upon the sandy plain neither camp nor town nor river could be seen in the dimness and when i rode forward and looked back there was only visible the long moving shadowy column seeming rather awful in its snakelike advance there was a swaying of flags and multitudinous weapons that might have been camels necks for all one could see and the whole thing might have been a caravan upon the desert soon we debouched upon the shell road the wagontrain drew on one side into the fog and by the time the sun appeared the music ceased the men took the route step and the fun began the route step is an abandonment of all military strictness and nothing is required of the men but to keep four abreast and not lag behind they are not required to keep step though with the rhythmical ear of our soldiers they almost always instinctively did so talking and singing are allowed and of this privilege at least they eagerly availed themselves on this day they were at the top of exhilaration there was one broad grin from one end of the column to the other it might soon have been a caravan of elephants instead of camels for the ivory and the blackness the chatter and the laughter almost drowned the tramp of feet and the clatter of equipments at crossroads and plantation gates the colored people thronged to see us pass every one found a friend and a greeting how you do aunty huddy how dye budder benjamin how you find yourself dis mornin tittawisa sister louisa such saluations rang out to everybody known or unknown in return venerable kerchiefed matrons courtesied laboriously to every one with an unfailing bress de lord budder grave little boys blacker than ink shook hands with our laughing and utterly unmanageable drummers who greeted them with this sure word of prophecy dems de drummers for de nex war pretty mulatto girls ogled and coquetted and made eyes as thackeray would say at half the young fellows in the battalion meantime the singing was brisk along the whole column and when i sometimes reined up to see them pass the chant of each company entering my ear drove out from the other ear the strain of the preceding such an odd mixture of things military and missionary as the successive waves of song drifted byl first john brown of course then what make old satan for follow me so then marching along then hold your light on canaans shore then when this cruel war is over a new favorite sung by a few yielding presently to a grand burst of the favorite marching song among them all and one at which every step instinctively quickened so light and jubilant its rhythm all true children gwine in de wilderness gwine in de wilderness gwine in de wilderness true believers gwine in de wilderness to take away de sins ob de world ending in a hoigh after each versea sort of irish yell for all the songs but especially for their own wild hymns they constantly improvised simple verses

ringing gwine to de landing de bell done ringing trust believer o de bell done ringing satans behind me de bell done ringing t is a misty morning de bell done ringing o de road am sandy de bell done ringing hell been open de bell done ringing and so on indefinitely the little drumcorps kept in advance a jolly crew their drums slung on their backs and the drumsticks perhaps balanced on their heads with them went the officers servantboys more uproarious still always ready to lend their shrill treble to any song at the head of the whole force there walked by some selfimposed preeminence a respectable elderly female one of the company laundresses whose vigorous stride we never could quite overtake and who had an enormous bundle balanced on her head while she waved in her hand like a sword a longhandled tin dipper such a picturesque medley of fun war and music i believe no white regiment in the service could have shown and yet there was no straggling and a single tap of the drum would at any moment bring order out of this seeming chaos so we marched our seven miles out upon the smooth and shaded roadbeneath jasmine clusters and great pinecones dropping and great bunches of misletoe still in bloom among the branches arrived at the station the scene soon became busy and more confused wagons were being unloaded tents pitched water brought wood cut fires made while the field and staff could take possession of the abandoned quarters of their predecessors and we could look round in the lovely summer morning to survey our empire and behold our home the only thoroughfare by land between beaufort and charleston is the shell road a beautiful avenue which about nine miles from beaufort strikes a ferry across the coosaw river war abolished the ferry and made the river the permanent barrier between the opposing picket lines for ten miles right and left these lines extended marked by wellworn footpaths following the endless windings of the stream and they never varied until nearly the end of the war upon their maintenance depended our whole foothold on the sea islands and upon that again finally depended the whole campaign of sherman but for the services of the colored troops which finally formed the main garrison of the department of the south the great march would never have been performed there was thus a region ten or twelve miles square of which i had exclusive military command it was level but otherwise broken and bewildering to the last degree no road traversed it properly speaking but the shell road all the rest was a wild medley of cypress swamp pine barren muddy creek and cultivated plantation intersected by interminable lanes and bridlepaths through which we must ride day and night and which our horses soon knew better than ourselves the regiment was distributed at different stations the main force being under my immediate command at a plantation close by the shell road two miles from the ferry and seven miles from beaufort our first picket duty was just at the time of the first attack on charleston under dupont and hunter and it was generally supposed that the confederates would make an effort to recapture the sea islands my orders were to watch the enemy closely keep informed as to his position and movements attempt no advance and in case any were attempted from the other side to delay it as long as possible sending instant notice to headquarters as to the delay that could be easily guaranteed there were causeways on the shell road which a single battery could hold against a large force and the plantations were everywhere so intersected by hedges and dikes that they seemed expressly planned for defence although creeks wound in and out everywhere yet these were only navigable at high tide and at all other times were impassable marshes there were but few posts where the enemy were within rifle range and their occasional attacks at those points were soon stopped by our enforcement of a pithy order from general hunter give them as good as they send so that with every opportunity for being kept on the alert there was small prospect of serious danger and all promised an easy life with only enough of care to make it pleasant the picket station was therefore always a coveted post among the regiments combining some undeniable importance with a kind of relaxation and as we were there three months on our first tour of duty and returned there several times afterwards we got well acquainted with it the whole region always reminded me of the descriptions of la vendee and i always expected to meet henri larochejaquelein riding in the woods how can i ever describe the charm and picturesqueness of that summer life our house possessed four spacious rooms and a piazza around it were grouped sheds and tents the camp was a little way off on one side the negroquarters of the plantation on the other and all was immersed in a dense mass of waving and murmuring locustblossoms the spring days were always lovely while the evenings were always conveniently damp so that we never shut the windows by day nor omitted our cheerful fire by night indoors the main headquarters seemed like the camp of some party of young engineers in time of peace only with a little female society added and a good many martial associations thrown in a large low dilapidated room with an immense fireplace and with windowpanes chiefly broken so that the sashes were still open even when closedsuch was our home the walls were scrawled with capital charcoal sketches by r of thefourth new hampshire and with a good map of the island and its woodpaths by c of the first massachusetts cavalry the room had the picturesqueness which comes everywhere from the natural grouping of articles of daily useswords belts pistols rifles fieldglasses spurs canteens gauntletswhile wreaths of gray moss above the windows and a pelicans wing three feet long over the high mantelpiece indicated more deliberate decoration this and the whole atmosphere of the place spoke of the refining presence of agreeable women and it was pleasant when they held their little court in the evening and pleasant all day with the different visitors who were always streaming in and outofficers and soldiers on various business turbaned women from the plantations coming with complaints or questionings fugitives from the mainland to be interrogated visitors riding up on horseback their hands full of jasmine and wild roses and the sweet sunny air all perfumed with magnolias and the southern pine from the neighboring camp there was a perpetual low hum louder voices and laughter reechoed amid the sharp sounds of the axe from the pine woods and sometimes when the relieved pickets were discharging their pieces there came the hollow sound of dropping rifleshots as in skirmishingperhaps the most unmistakable and fascinating association that war bequeaths to the memory of the ear our domestic arrangements were of the oddest description from the time when we began housekeeping by taking down the frontdoor to complete therewith a little office for the surgeon on the piazza everything seemed upside down i slept on a shelf in the corner of the parlor bequeathed me by major f my jovial predecessor and if i waked at any time could put my head through the broken window arouse my orderly and ride off to see if i could catch a picket asleep we used to spell the word picquet because that was understood to be the correct thing in that department at least and they used to say at post headquarters that as soon as the officer in command of the outposts grew negligent and was guilty of a k he was ordered in immediately then the arrangements for ablution were peculiar we fitted up a bathingplace in a brook which somehow got appropriated at once by the company laundresses but i had my revenge for i took to bathing in the family washtub after all however the kitchen department had the advantage for they used my solitary napkin to wipe the messtable as for food we found it impossible to get chickens save in the immature shape of eggs fresh pork was prohibited by the surgeon and other fresh meat came rarely we could indeed hunt for wild turkeys and even deer but such hunting was found only to increase the appetite without corresponding supply still we had our luxurieslarge delicious drumfish and alligator steakslike a more substantial fried halibutwhich might have afforded the theme for charles lambs dissertation on roast pig and by whose aid for the first time in our lives we tested crackling the post bakery yielded admirable bread and for vegetables and fruit we had very poor sweet potatoes and in their season an unlimited supply of the largest blackberries for beverage we had the vapid milk of that region in which if you let it stand the water sinks instead of the creams rising and the delicious sugarcane syrup which we had brought from florida and which we drank at all hours old floridians say that no one is justified in drinking whiskey while he can get canejuice it is sweet and spirited without cloying foams like ale and there were little spots on the ceiling of the diningroom where our lively beverage had popped out its cork we kept it in a whiskeybottle and as whiskey itself was absolutely prohibited among us it was amusing to see the surprise of our military visitors when this innocent substitute was brought in they usually liked it in the end but like the old frenchwoman over her glass of water wished that it were a sin to give it a relish as the foaming beakers of molasses and water were handed round the guests would make with them the courteous little gestures of polite imbiding and would then quaff the beverage some with gusto others with a slight afterlook of dismay but it was a delicious and cooling drink while it lasted and at all events was the best and the worst we had we used to have reveille at six and breakfast about seven then the mounted couriers began to arrive from half a dozen different directions with written reports of what had happened during the nighta boat seen a picket fired upon a battery erecting these must be consolidated and forwarded to headquarters with the daily report of the commandso many sick so many on detached service and all the rest this was our morning newspaper our herald and tribune i never got tired of it then the couriers must be furnished with countersign and instructions and sent off again then we scattered to our various rides all disguised as duty one to inspect pickets one to visit a sick soldier one to build a bridge or clear a road and still another to headquarters for ammunition or commissary stores galloping through green lanes miles of triumphal arches of wild rosesroses pale and large and fragrant mingled with great boughs of the white cornel fantastic masses snowy surprisessuch were our rides ranging from eight to fifteen and even twenty miles back to a late dinner with our various experiences and perhaps specimens to matcha thundersnake eight feet long a live opossum with a young clinging to the natural pouch an armful of great white scentless pondlilies after dinner to the tangled garden for rosebuds or early magnolias whose cloying fragrance will always bring back to me the full zest of those summer days then dressparade and a little drill as the day grew cool in the evening tea and then the piazza or the fireside as the case might bechess cardsperhaps a little music by aid of the assistant surgeons melodeon a few pages of jean pauls titan almost my only book and carefully husbandedperhaps a mail with its infinite felicities such was our day night brought its own fascinations more solitary and profound the darker they were the more clearly it was our duty to visit the pickets the paths that had grown so familiar by day seemed a wholly new labyrinth by night and every added shade of darkness seemed to shift and complicate them all anew till at last mans skill grew utterly baffled and the clew must be left to the instinct of the horse riding beneath the solemn starlight or soft gray mist or densest blackness the frogs croaking the strange chuckwutswidow droning his ominous note above my head the mockingbird dreaming in music the great southern fireflies rising to the treetops or hovering close to the ground like glowworms till the horseraised his hoofs to avoid them through pine woods and cypress swamps or past sullen brooks or white tents or the dimly seen huts of sleeping negroes down to the glimmering shore where black statues leaned against trees or stood alert in the pathwaysnever in all the days of my life shall i forget the magic of those haunted nights we had nocturnal boat service too for it was a part of our instructions to obtain all possible information about the enemys position and we accordingly as usual in such cases incurred a great many risks that harmed nobody and picked up much information which did nobody any good the centre of these nightly reconnoissances for a long time was the wreck of the george washington the story of whose disaster is perhaps worth telling till about the time when we went on picket it had been the occasional habit of the smaller gunboats to make the circuit of port royal islanda practice which was deemed very essential to the safety of our position but which the rebels effectually stopped a few days after our arrival by destroying the army gunboat george washington with a single shot from a light battery i was roused soon after daybreak by the firing and a courier soon came dashing in with the particulars forwarding these hastily to beaufort for we had then no telegraph i was soon at the scene of action five miles away approaching i met on the picket paths man after man who had escaped from the wreck across a halfmile of almost impassable marsh never did i see such objectssome stripped to their shirts some fully clothed but all having every garment literally pasted to thembodies with mud across the river the rebels were retiring having done their work but were still shelling from greater and greater distances the wood through which i rode arrived at the spot nearest the wreck a point opposite to what we called the brickyard station i saw the burning vessel aground beyond a long stretch of marsh out of which the forlorn creatures were still floundering here and there in the mud and reeds we could see the laboring heads slowly advancing and could hear excruciating cries from wounded men in the more distant depths it was the strangest mixture of war and dante and robinson crusoe our energetic chaplain coming up i sent him with four men under a flag of truce to the place whence the worst cries proceeded while i went to another part of the marsh during that morning we got them all out our last achievement being the rescue of the pilot an immense negro with a wooden legan article so particularly unavailable for mud travelling that it would have almost seemed better as one of the men suggested to cut the traces and leave it behind a naval gunboat too which had originally accompanied this vessel and should never have left it now came back and took off the survivors though there had been several deaths from scalding and shell it proved that the wreck was not aground after all but at anchor having foolishly lingered till after daybreak and having thus given time for the enemy to bring down then guns the first shot had struck the boiler and set the vessel on fire after which the officer in command had raised a white flag and then escaped with his men to our shore and it was for this flight in the wrong direction that they were shelled in the marshes by the rebels the case furnished in this respect some parallel to that of the kearsage and alabama and it was afterwards cited i believe officially or unofficially to show that the rebels had claimed the right to punish in this case the course of action which they approved in semmes i know that they always asserted thenceforward that the detachment on board the george washington had become rightful prisoners of war and were justly fired upon when they tried to escape this was at the tune of the first attack on charleston and the noise of this cannonading spread rapidly thither and brought four regiments to reinforce beaufort in a hurry under the impression that the town was already taken and that they must save what remnants they could general saxton too had made such capital plans for defending the post that he could not bear not to have it attacked so while the rebels brought down a force to keep us from taking the guns off the wreck i was also supplied with a section or two of regular artillery and some additional infantry with which to keep them from it and we tried to make believe very hard and rival the charleston expedition on our own island indeed our affair came to about as muchnearly nothingand lasted decidedly longer for both sides nibbled away at the guns by night for weeks afterward though i believe the mud finally got themat least we did not we tried in vain to get the use of a steamboat or floating derrick of any kind for it needed more mechanical ingenuity than we possessed to transfer anything so heavy to our small boats by night while by day we did not go near the wreck in anything larger than a dugout one of these nocturnal visits to the wreck i recall with peculiar gusto because it brought back that contest with catarrh and coughing among my own warriors which had so ludicrously beset me in florida it was always fascinating to be on those forbidden waters by night stealing out with muffled oars through the creeks and reeds our eyes always strained for other voyagers our ears listening breathlessly to all the marsh soundsblackflsh splashing and little wakened reedbirds that fled wailing away over the dim river equally safe on either side but it always appeared to the watchful senses that we were making noise enough to be heard at fort sumter and somehow the victims of catarrh seemed always the most eager for any enterprise requiring peculiar caution in this case i thought i had sifted them beforehand but as soon as we were afloat one poor boy near me began to wheeze and i turned upon him in exasperation he saw his danger and meekly said i wont cough gunnel and he kept his word for two mortal hours he sat grasping his gun with never a chirrup but two unfortunates in the bow of the boat developed symptoms which i could not suppress so putting in at a picket station with some risk i dumped them in mud kneedeep and embarked a substitute who after the first five minutes absolutely coughed louder than both the others united handkerchiefs blankets overcoats suffocation in its direst forms were tried in vain but apparently the rebel pickets slept through it all and we exploded the wreck in safety i think they were asleep for certainly across the level marshes there came a nasal sound as of the conthieveracy inits slumbers it may have been a bullfrog but it sounded like a human snore picket life was of course the place to feel the charm of natural beauty on the sea islands we had a world of profuse and tangled vegetation around us such as would have been a dream of delight to me but for the constant sense of responsibility and care which came between amid this preoccupation nature seemed but a mirage and not the close and intimate associate i had before known i pressed no flowers collected no insects or birds eggs made no notes on natural objects reversing in these respects all previous habits yet now in the retrospect there seems to have been infused into me through every pore the voluptuous charm of the season and the place and the slightest corresponding sound or odor now calls back the memory of those delicious days being afterwards on picket at almost every season i tasted the sensations of all and though i hardly then thought of such a result the associations of beauty will remain forever in february for instancethough this was during a later period of picket servicethe woods were usually draped with that net of shining haze which marks our northern may and the house was embowered in wildplumblossoms small white profuse and tenanted by murmuring bees there were peachblossoms too and the yellow jasmine was opening its multitudinous buds climbing over tall trees and waving from bough to bough there were fresh young ferns and white bloodroot in the edges of woods matched by snowdrops in the garden beneath budded myrtle and petisporum in this wilderness the birds were busy the two main songsters being the mockingbird and the cardinalgrosbeak which monopolized all the parts of our more varied northern orchestra save the tender and liquid notes which in south carolina seemed unattempted except by some stray bluebird jays were as loud and busy as at the north in autumn there were sparrows and wrens and sometimes i noticed the shy and whimsical chewink from this early springtime onward there seemed no great difference in atmospheric sensations and only a succession of bloom after two months ones notions of the season grew bewildered just as very early rising bewilders the day in the army one is perhaps roused after a bivouac marches before daybreak halts fights somebody is killed a long days life has been lived and after all it is not seven oclock and breakfast is not ready so when we had lived in summer so long as hardly to remember winter it suddenly occurred to us that it was not yet june one escapes at the south that mixture of hunger and avarice which is felt in the northern summer counting each hours joy with the sad consciousness that an hour is gone the compensating loss is in missing those soft sweet liquid sensations of the northern spring that burst of life and joy those days of heaven that even april brings and this absence of childhood in the year creates a feeling of hardness in the season like that i have suggested in the melody of the southern birds it seemed to me also that the woods had not those pure clean innocent odors which so abound in the new england forest in early spring but there was something luscious voluptuous almost oppressively fragrant about the magnolias as if they belonged not to hebe but to magdalen such immense and lustrous butterflies i had never seen but in dreams and not even dreams had prepared me for sandflies almost too small to be seen they inflicted a bite which appeared larger than themselvesa positive wound more torturing than that of a mosquito and leaving more annoyance behind these tormentors elevated dressparade into the dignity of a military engagement i had to stand motionless with my head a mere nebula of winged atoms while tears rolled profusely down my face from mere muscular irritation had i stirred a finger the whole battalion would have been slapping its cheeks such enemies were however a valuable aid to discipline on the whole as they abounded in the guardhouse and made that institution an object of unusual abhorrence among the men the presence of ladies and the homelike air of everything made the picket station a very popular resort while we were there it was the one agreeable ride from beaufort and we often had a dozen people unexpectedly to dinner on such occasions there was sometimes mounting in hot haste and an eager search among the outlying plantations for additional chickens and eggs or through the company kitchens for some of those villanous tin cans which everywhere marked the progress of our army in those cans so far as my observation went all fruits relapsed into a common acidulation and all meats into a similarity of tastelessness while the condensed milk was best described by the men who often unconsciously stumbled on a better joke than they knew and always spoke of it as condemned milk we had our own excursions tooto the barnwell plantations with their beautiful avenues and great liveoaks the perfection of southern beautyto halls island debatable ground close under the enemys fire where halfwild cattle were to be shot under military precautions like scottish mosstroopingor to the ferry where it was fascinating to the female mind to scan the rebel pickets through a fieldglass our horses liked the byways far better than the level hardness of the shell road especially those we had brought from florida which enjoyed the wilderness as if they had belonged to marions men they delighted to feel the long sedge brush their flanks or to gallop down the narrow woodpaths leaping the fallen trees and scaring the bright little lizards which shot across our track like live rays broken from the sunbeams we had an abundance of horses mostly captured and left in our hands by some convenient delay of the post quartermaster we had also two sidesaddles which not being munitions of war could not properly as we explained be transferred like other captured articles to the general stock otherwise the p q m a married man would have showed no unnecessary delay in their case for miscellaneous accommodation was there not an ambulancethat most inestimable of army conveniences equally ready to carry the merry to a feast or the wounded from a fray ambulance was one of those words rather numerous which ethiopian lips were not framed by nature to articulate only the highest stages of colored culture could compass it on the tongue of the many it was transformed mystically asamulet or ambitiously as epaulet or in culinary fashion as omelet but it was our experience that an ambulance under any name jolted equally hard besides these divertisements we had more laborious vocationsa good deal of fatigue and genuine though small alarms the men went on duty every third day at furthest and the officers nearly as oftenmost of the tours of duty lasting twentyfour hours though the stream was considered to watch itself tolerably well by daylight this kind of responsibility suited the men and we had already found as the whole army afterwards acknowledged that the constitutional watchfulness and distrustfulness of the colored race made them admirable sentinels soon after we went on picket the commanding general sent an aid with a cavalry escort to visit all the stations without my knowledge they spent the whole night and the officer reported that he could not get within thirty yards of any post without a challenge this was a pleasant assurance for me since our position seemed so secure compared with jacksonville that i had feared some relaxation of vigilance while yet the safety of all depended on our thorough discharge of duty jacksonville had also seasoned the men so well that they were no longer nervous and did not waste much powder on false alarms the rebels made no formal attacks and rarely attempted to capture pickets sometimes they came stealing through the creeks in dugouts as we did on their side of the water and occasionally an officer of ours was fired upon while making his rounds by night often some boat or scow would go adrift and sometimes a mere dark mass of riverweed would be floated by the tide past the successive stations eliciting a challenge and perhaps a shot from each i remember the vivid way in which one of the men stated to his officer the manner in which a faithful picket should do his duty after challenging in case a boat came in sight fus ting i shoot and den i shoot and den i shoot again den i creepcreep up near de boat and see who dey in em and spose anybody pop up he head den i shoot again spose i fire my forty rounds i tink he hear at de camp and send more manswhich seemed a reasonable presumption this soldiers name was paul jones a daring fellow quite worthy of his namesake in time however they learned quieter methods and would wade far out in the water there standing motionless at last hoping to surround and capture these floating boats though to their great disappointment the prize usually proved empty on one occasion they tried a still profounder strategy for an officer visiting the pickets after midnight and hearing in the stillness a portentous snore from the end of the causeway our most important station straightway hurried to the point of danger with wrath in his soul but the sergeant of the squad came out to meet him imploring silence and explaining that they had seen or suspected a boat hovering near and were feigning sleep in order to lure and capture those who would entrap them the one military performance at the picket station of which my men were utterly intolerant was an occasional flag of truce for which this was the appointed locality these farces for which it was our duty to furnish the stock actors always struck them as being utterly despicable and unworthy the serious business of war they felt i suppose what mr pickwick felt when he heard his counsel remark to the counsel for the plaintiff that it was a very fine morning it goaded their souls to see the young officers from the two opposing armies salute each other courteously and interchange cigars they despised the object of such negotiations which was usually to send over to the enemy some family of rebel women who had made themselves quite intolerable on our side but were not above collecting a subscription among the union officers before departure to replenish their wardrobes the men never showed disrespect to these women by word or deed but they hated them from the bottom of their souls besides there was a grievance behind all this the rebel order remained unrevoked which consigned the new colored troops and their officers to a felons death if captured and we all felt that we fought with ropes round our necks deres no flags ob truce for us the men would contemptuously say when de secesh fight de fus souf first south carolina he fight in earnest indeed i myself took it as rather a compliment when the commander on the other sidethough an old acquaintance of mine in massachusetts and in kansasat first refused to negotiate through me or my officersa refusal which was kept up greatly to the enemys inconvenience until our men finally captured some of the opposing pickets and their friends had to waive all scruples in order to send them supplies after this there was no trouble and i think that the first rebel officer in south carolina who officially met any officer of colored troops under a flag of truce was captain john c calhoun in florida we had been so recognized long before but that was when they wished to frighten us out of jacksonville such was our life on picket at port royala thing whose memory is now fast melting into such stuff as dreams are made of we stayed there more than two months at that tune the first attack on charleston exploded with one puff and had its end general hunter was ordered north and the busy gilmore reigned in his stead and in june when the blackberries were all eaten we were summoned nothing loath to other scenes and encampments new chapter a night in the water yes that was a pleasant life on picket in the delicious early summer of the south and among the endless flowery forests of that blossoming isle in the retrospect i seem to see myself adrift upon a horses back amid a sea of roses the various outposts were within a sixmile radius and it was one long delightful gallop day and night i have a faint impression that the moon shone steadily every night for two months and yet i remember certain periods of such dense darkness that in riding through the woodpaths it was really unsafe to go beyond a walk for fear of branches above and roots below and one of my officers was once shot at by a rebel scout who stood unperceived at his horses bridle to those doing outpostduty on an island however large the mainland has all the fascination of forbidden fruit and on a scale bounded only by the horizon emerson says that every house looks ideal until we enter itand it is certainly so if it be just the other side of the hostile lines every grove in that blue distance appears enchanted ground and yonder loitering grayback leading his horse to water in the farthest distance makes one thrill with a desire to hail him to shoot at him to capture him to do anything to bridge this inexorable dumb space that lies between a boyish feeling no doubt and one that time diminishes without effacing yet it is a feeling which lies at the bottom of many rash actions in war and of some brilliant ones for one i could never quite outgrow it though restricted by duty from doing many foolish things in consequence and also restrained by reverence for certain confidential advisers whom i had always at hand and who considered it their mission to keep me always on short rations of personal adventure indeed most of that sort of entertainment in the army devolves upon scouts detailed for the purpose volunteer aidesdecamp and newspaperreportersother officers being expected to be about business more prosaic all the excitements of war are quadrupled by darkness and as i rode along our outer lines at night and watched the glimmering flames which at regular intervals starred the opposite rivershore the longing was irresistible to cross the barrier of dusk and see whether it were men or ghosts who hovered round those dying embers i had yielded to these impulses in boatadventures by nightfor it was a part of my instructions to obtain all possible information about the rebel outpostsand fascinating indeed it was to glide along noiselessly paddling with a dusky guide through the endless intricacies of those southern marshes scaring the reedbirds which wailed and fled away into the darkness and penetrating several miles into the ulterior between hostile fires where discovery might be death yet there were drawbacks as to these enterprises since it is not easy for a boat to cross still water even on the darkest night without being seen by watchful eyes and moreover the extremes of high and low tide transform so completely the whole condition of those rivers that it needs very nice calculation to do ones work at precisely the right tune to vary the experiment i had often thought of trying a personal reconnoissance by swimming at a certain point whenever circumstances should make it an object the opportunity at last arrived and i shall never forget the glee with which after several postponements i finally rode forth a little before midnight on a night which seemed made for the purpose i had of course kept my own secret and was entirely alone the great southern fireflies were out not haunting the low ground merely like ours but rising to the loftiest treetops with weird illumination and anon hovering so low that my horse often stepped the higher to avoid them the dewy cherokee roses brushed my face the solemn chuckwillswidow croaked her incantation and the rabbits raced phantomlike across the shadowy road slowly in the darkness i followed the wellknown path to the spot where our most advanced outposts were stationed holding a causeway which thrust itself far out across the separating river thus fronting a similar causeway on the other side while a channel of perhaps three hundred yards once traversed by a ferryboat rolled between at low tide this channel was the whole river with broad oozy marshes on each side at high tide the marshes were submerged and the stream was a mile wide this was the point which i had selected to ascertain the numbers and position of the picket on the opposite causeway was my first object as it was a matter on which no two of our officers agreed to this point therefore i rode and dismounting after being duly challenged by the sentinel at the causewayhead walked down the long and lonely path the tide was well up though still on the flood as i desired and each visible tuft of marshgrass might but for its motionlessness have been a prowling boat dark as the night had appeared the water was pale smooth and phosphorescent and i remember that the phrase wan water so familiar in the scottish ballards struck me just then as peculiarly appropriate though its real meaning is quite different a gentle breeze from which i had hoped for a ripple had utterly died away and it was a warm breathless southern night there was no sound but the faint swash of the coming tide the noises of the reedbirds in the marshes and the occasional leap of a fish and it seemed to my overstrained ear as if every footstep of my own must be heard for miles however i could have no more postponements and the thing must be tried now or never reaching the farther end of the causeway i found my men couched like black statues behind the slight earthwork there constructed i expected that my proposed immersion would rather bewilder them but knew that they would say nothing as usual as for the lieutenant on that post he was a steady matteroffact perfectly disciplined englishman who wore a crimean medal and never asked a superfluous question in his life if i had casually remarked to him mr hooper the general has ordered me on a brief personal reconnoissance to the planet jupiter and i wish you to take care of my watch lest it should be damaged by the precession of the equinoxes he would have responded with a brief all rightsir and a quick military gesture and have put the thing in his pocket as it was i simply gave him the watch and remarked that i was going to take a swim i do not remember ever to have experienced a greater sense of exhilaration than when i slipped noiselessly into the placid water and struck out into the smooth eddying current for the opposite shore the night was so still and lovely my black statues looked so dreamlike at their posts behind the low earthwork the opposite arm of the causeway stretched so invitingly from the rebel main the horizon glimmered so low around mefor it always appears lower to a swimmer than even to an oarsmanthat i seemed floating in some concave globe some magic crystal of which i was the enchanted centre with each little ripple of my steady progress all things hovered and changed the stars danced and nodded above where the stars ended the great southern fireflies began and closer than the fireflies there clung round me a halo of phosphorescent sparkles from the soft salt water had i told any one of my purpose i should have had warnings and remonstrances enough the few negroes who did not believe in alligators believed in sharks the sceptics as to sharks were orthodox in respect to alligators while those who rejected both had private prejudices as to snappingturtles the surgeon would have threatened intermittent fever the first assistant rheumatism and the second assistant congestive chills nonswimmers would have predicted exhaustion and swimmers cramp and all this before coming within bulletrange of any hospitalities on the other shore but i knew the folly of most alarms about reptiles and fishes mans imagination peoples the water with many things which do not belong there or prefer to keep out of his way if they do fevers and congestions were the surgeons business and i always kept people to their own department cramp and exhaustion were dangers i could measure as i had often done bullets were a more substantial danger and i must take the chanceif a loon could dive at the flash why not i if i were once ashore i should have to cope with the rebels on their own ground which they knew better than i but the water was my ground where i too had been at home from boyhood i swam as swiftly and softly as i could although it seemed as if water never had been so still before it appeared impossible that anything uncanny should hide beneath that lovely mirror and yet when some floating wisp of reeds suddenly coiled itself around my neck or some unknown thing drifting deeper coldly touched my foot it caused that undefinable shudder which every swimmer knows and which especially comes over one by night sometimes a slight sip of brackish water would enter my lipsfor i naturally tried to swim as low as possibleand then would follow a slight gasping and contest against chocking that seemed to me a perfect convulsion for i suppose the tendency to choke and sneeze is always enhanced by the circumstance that ones life may depend on keeping still just as yawning becomes irresistible where to yawn would be social ruin and just as one is sure to sleep in church if one sits in a conspicuous pew at other times some unguarded motion would create a splashing which seemed in the tension of my senses to be loud enough to be heard at richmond although it really mattered not since there are fishes in those rivers which make as much noise on special occasions as if they were misguided young whales as i drew near the opposite shore the dark causeway projected more and more distinctly to my fancy at least and i swam more softly still utterly uncertain as to how far in the stillness of air and water my phosphorescent course could be traced by eye or ear a slight ripple would have saved me from observation i was more than ever sure and i would have whistled for a fair wind as eagerly as any sailor but that my breath was worth to me more than anything it was likely to bring the water became smoother and smoother and nothing broke the dim surface except a few clumps of rushes and my unfortunate head the outside of this member gradually assumed to its inside a gigantic magnitude it had always annoyed me at the hatters from a merely animal bigness with no commensurate contents to show for it and now i detested it more than ever a physical feeling of turgescence and congestion in that region such as swimmers often feel probably increased the impression i thought with envy of the aztec children of the headless horseman of sleepy hollow of saint somebody with his head tucked under his arm plotinus was less ashamed of his whole body than i of this inconsiderate and stupid appendage to be sure i might swim for a certain distance under water but that accomplishment i had reserved for a retreat for i knew that the longer i stayed down the more surely i should have to snort like a walrus when i came up again and to approach an enemy with such a demonstration was not to be thought of suddenly a dog barked we had certain information that a pack of hounds was kept at a rebel station a few miles off on purpose to hunt runaways and i had heard from the negroes almost fabulous accounts of the instinct of these animals i knew that although water baffled their scent they yet could recognize in some manner the approach of any person across water as readily as by land and of the vigilance of all dogs by night every traveller among southern plantations has ample demonstration i was now so near that i could dimly see the figures of men moving to and fro upon the end of the causeway and could hear the dull knock when one struck his foot against a piece of limber as my first object was to ascertain whether there were sentinels at that time at that precise point i saw that i was approaching the end of my experiment could i have once reached the causeway unnoticed i could have lurked in the water beneath its projecting timbers and perhaps made my way along the main shore as i had known fugitive slaves to do while coming from that side or had there been any ripple on the water to confuse the aroused and watchful eyes i could have made a circuit and approached the causeway at another point though i had already satisfied myself that there was only a narrow channel on each side of it even at high tide and not as on our side a broad expanse of water indeed this knowledge alone was worth all the trouble i had taken and to attempt much more than this in the face of acuriosity already roused would have been a waste of future opportunities i could try again with the benefit of this new knowledge on a point where the statements of the negroes had always been contradictory resolving however to continue the observation a very little longer since the water felt much warmer than i had expected and there was no sense of chill or fatigue i grasped at some wisps of straw or rushes that floated near gathering them round my face a little and then drifting nearer the wharf in what seemed a sort of eddy was able without creating further alarm to make some additional observations on points which it is not best now to particularize then turning my back upon the mysterious shore which had thus far lured me i sank softly below the surface and swam as far as i could under water during this unseen retreat i heard of course all manner of gurglings and hollow reverberations and could fancy as many rifleshots as i pleased but on rising to the surface all seemed quiet and even i did not create as much noise as i should have expected i was now at a safe distance since the enemy were always chary of showing their boats and always tried to convince us they had none what with absorbed attention first and this submersion afterwards i had lost all my bearings but the stars having been long out of sight of my original point of departure however the difficulties of the return were nothing making a slight allowance for the floodtide which could not yet have turned i should soon regain the place i had left so i struck out freshly against the smooth water feeling just a little stiffened by the exertion and with an occasional chill running up the back of the neck but with no nips from sharks no nudges from alligators and not a symptom of feverandague time i could not of course measureone never can in a novel position but after a reasonable amount of swimming i began to look with a natural interest for the pier which i had quitted i noticed with some solicitude that the woods along the friendly shore made one continuous shadow and that the line of low bushes on the long causeway could scarcely be relieved against them yet i knew where they ought to be and the more doubtful i felt about it the more i put down my doubts as if they were unreasonable children one can scarcely conceive of the alteration made in familiar objects by bringing the eye as low as the horizon especially by night to distinguish foreshortening is impossible and every low near object is equivalent to one higher and more remote still i had the stars and soon my eye more practised was enabled to select one precise line of bushes as that which marked the causeway and for which i must direct my course as i swam steadily but with some sense of fatigue towards this phantomline i found it difficult to keep my faith steady and my progress true everything appeared to shift and waver in the uncertain light the distant trees seemed not trees but bushes and the bushes seemed not exactly bushes but might after all be distant trees could i be so confident that out of all that low stretch of shore i could select the one precise point where the friendly causeway stretched its long arm to receive me from the water how easily some tempter whispered at my ear might one swerve a little on either side and be compelled to flounder over half a mile of oozy marsh on an ebbing tide before reaching our own shore and that hospitable volley of bullets with which it would probably greet me had i not already thus the tempter continued been swimming rather unaccountably far supposing me on a straight track for that inviting spot where my sentinels and my drapery were awaiting my return suddenly i felt a sensation as of fine ribbons drawn softly across my person and i found myself among some rushes but what business had rushes there or i among them i knew that there was not a solitary spot of shoal in the deep channel where i supposed myself swimming and it was plain in an instant that i had somehow missed my course and must be getting among the marshes i felt confident to be sure that i could not have widely erred but was guiding my course for the proper side of tie river but whether i had drifted above or below the causeway i had not the slightest clew to tell i pushed steadily forward with some increasing sense of lassitude passing one marshy islet after another all seeming strangely out of place and sometimes just reaching with my foot a soft tremulous shoal which gave scarce the shadow of a support though even that shadow rested my feet at one of these moments of stillness it suddenly occurred to my perception what nothing but this slight contact could have assured me in the darkness that i was in a powerful current and that this current set the wrong way instantly a flood of new intelligence came either i had unconsciously turned and was rapidly nearing the rebel shorea suspicion which a glance at the stars correctedor else it was the tide itself which had turned and which was sweeping me down the river with all its force and was also sucking away at every moment the narrowing water from that treacherous expanse of mud out of whose horrible miry embrace i had lately helped to rescue a shipwrecked crew either alternative was rather formidable i can distinctly remember that for about one halfminute the whole vast universe appeared to swim in the same watery uncertainty in which i floated i began to doubt everything to distrust the stars the line of low bushes for which i was wearily striving the very land on which they grew if such visionary things could be rooted anywhere doubts trembled in my mind like the weltering water and that awful sensation of having ones feet unsupported which benumbs the spent swimmers heart seemed to clutch at mine though not yet to enter it i was more absorbed in that singular sensation of nightmare such as one may feel equally when lost by land or by water as if ones own position were all right but the place looked for had somehow been preternaturally abolished out of the universe at best might not a man in the water lose all his power of direction and so move in an endless circle until he sank exhausted it required a deliberate and conscious effort to keep my brain quite cool i have not the reputation of being ofan excitable temperament but the contrary yet i could at that moment see my way to a condition in which one might become insane in an instant it was as if a fissure opened somewhere and i saw my way into a madhouse then it closed and everything went on as before once in my life i had obtained a slight glimpse of the same sensation and then too strangely enough while swimmingin the mightiest oceansurge into which i had ever dared plunge my mortal body keats hints at the same sudden emotion in a wild poem written among the scottish mountains it was not the distinctive sensation which drowning men are said to have that spasmodic passing in review of ones whole personal history i had no welldefined anxiety felt no fear was moved to no prayer did not give a thought to home or friends only it swept over me as with a sudden tempest that if i meant to get back to my own camp i must keep my wits about me i must not dwell on any other alternative any more than a boy who climbs a precipice must look down imagination had no business here that way madness lay there was a shore somewhere before me and i must get to it by the ordinary means before the ebb laid bare the flats or swept me below the lower bends of the stream that was all suddenly a light gleamed for an instant before me as if from a house in a grove of great trees upon a bank and i knew that it came from the window of a ruined plantationbuilding where our most advanced outposts had their headquarters the flash revealed to me every point of the situation i saw at once where i was and how i got there that the tide had turned while i was swimming and with a much briefer interval of slackwater than i had been led to supposethat i had been swept a good way down stream and was far beyond all possibility of regaining the point i had left could i however retain my strength to swim one or two hundred yards farther of which i had no doubtand if the water did not ebb too rapidly of which i had more fearthen i was quite safe every stroke took me more and more out of the power of the current and there might even be an eddy to aid me i could not afford to be carried down much farther for there the channel made a sweep toward the wrong side of the river but there was now no reason why i should not reach land i could dismiss all fear indeed except that of being fired upon by our own sentinels many of whom were then new recruits and with the usual disposition to shoot first and investigate afterwards i found myself swimming in shallow and shallower water and the flats seemed almost bare when i neared the shore where the great gnarled branches of the liveoaks hung far over the muddy bank floating on my back for noiselessness i paddled rapidly in with my hands expecting momentarily to hear the challenge of the picket and the ominous click so likely to follow i knew that some one should be pacing to and fro along that beat but could not tell at what point he might be at that precise moment besides there was a faint possibility that some chatty corporal might have carried the news of my bath thus far along the line and they might be partially prepared for this unexpected visitor suddenly like another flash came the quick quaint challenge halt whos go dar fffriend with the cccountersign retorted i with chilly but conciliatory energy rising at full length out of the shallow water to show myself a man and a brother acvance friend and give de countersign responded the literal soldier who at such a tune would have accosted a spirit of light or goblin damned with no other formula i advanced and gave it he recognized my voice at once and then and there as i stood a dripping ghost beneath the f trees before him the unconscionable fellow wishing to exhaust upon me the utmost resources of military hospitality deliberately presented arms now a soldier on picket or at night usually presents arms to nobody but a sentinel on campguard by day is expected to perform that ceremony to anything in human shape that has two rows of buttons here was a human shape but so utterly buttonless that it exhibited not even a rag to which a button could by any earthly possibility be appended buttonless even potentially and my blameless ethiopian presented arms to even this where then are the theories of carlyle the axioms of sartor resartus the inability of humanity to conceive a naked duke of windlestraw addressing a naked house of lords cautioning my adherent however as to the proprieties suitable for such occasions thenceforward i left him watching the river with renewed vigilance and awaiting the next merman who should report himself finding my way to the building i hunted up a sergeant and a blanket got a fire kindled in the dismantled chimney and sat before it in my single garment like a moist but undismayed choctaw until horse and clothing could be brought round from the causeway it seemed strange that the morning had not yet dawned after the uncounted periods that must have elapsed but when the wardrobe arrived i looked at my watch and found that my night in the water had lasted precisely one hour galloping home i turned in with alacrity and without a drop of whiskey and waked a few hours after in excellent condition the rapid changes of which that department has seen so manyand perhaps to so little purposesoon transferred us to a different scene i have been on other scouts since then and by various processes but never with a zest so novel as was afforded by that nights experience the thing soon got wind in the regiment and led to only one ill consequence so far as i know it rather suppressed a way i had of lecturing the officers on the importance of reducing their personal baggage to a minimum they got a trick of congratulating me very respectfully on the thoroughness with which i had once conformed my practice to my precepts chapter up the edisto in reading military history one finds the main interest to lie undoubtedly in the great campaigns where a man a regiment a brigade is but a pawn in the game but there is a charm also in the more free and adventurous life of partisan warfare where if the total sphere be humbler yet the individual has more relative importance and the sense of action is more personal and keen this is the reason given by the eccentric revolutionary biographer weems for writing the life of washington first and then that of marion and there were certainly hi the early adventures of the colored troops in the department of the south some of the same elements of picturesqueness that belonged to marions band on the same soil with the added feature that the blacks were fighting for their personal liberties of which marion had helped to deprive them it is stated by majorgeneral gillmore in his siege of charleston as one of the three points in his preliminary strategy that an expedition was sent up the edisto river to destroy a bridge on the charleston and savannah railway as one of the early raids of the colored troops this expedition may deserve narration though it was in a strategic point of view a disappointment it has already been told briefly and on the whole with truth by greeley and others but i will venture on a more complete account the project dated back earlier than general gillmores siege and had originally no connection with that movement it had been formed by captain trowbridge and myself in camp and was based on facts learned from the men general saxton and colonel w w h davis the successive postcommanders had both favored it it had been also approved by general hunter before his sudden removal though he regarded the bridge as a secondary affair because there was another railway communication between the two cities but as my main object was to obtain permission to go i tried to make the most of all results which might follow while it was very clear that the raid would harass and confuse the enemy and be the means of bringing away many of the slaves general hunter had therefore accepted the project mainly as a stroke for freedom and black recruits and general gillmore because anything that looked toward action found favor in his eyes and because it would be convenient to him at that time to effect a diversion if nothing more it must be remembered that after the first capture of port royal the outlying plantations along the whole southern coast were abandoned and the slaves withdrawn into the interior it was necessary to ascend some river for thirty miles in order to reach the black population at all this ascent could only be made by night as it was a slow process and the smoke of a steamboat could be seen for a great distance the streams were usually shallow winding and muddy and the difficulties of navigation were such as to require a full moon and a flood tide it was really no easy matter to bring everything to bear especially as every projected raid must be kept a secret so far as possible however we were now somewhat familiar with such undertakings half military half naval and the thing to be done on the edisto was precisely what we had proved to be practicable on the st marys and the st johnsto drop anchor before the enemys door some morning at daybreak without his having dreamed of our approach since a raid made by colonel montgomery up the combahee two months before the vigilance of the rebels had increased but we had information that upon the south edisto or ponpon river the rice plantations were still being actively worked by a large number of negroes in reliance on obstructions placed at the mouth of that narrow stream where it joins the main river some twenty miles from the coast this point was known to be further protected by a battery of unknown strength at wiltown bluff a commanding and defensible situation the obstructions consisted of a row of strong wooden piles across the river but we convinced ourselves that these must now be much decayed and that captain trowbridge an excellent engineer officer could remove them by the proper apparatus our proposition was to man the john adams an armed ferryboat which had before done us much serviceand which has now reverted to the pursuits of peace it is said on the east boston lineto ascend in this to wiltown bluff silence the battery and clear a passage through the obstructions leaving the john adams to protect this point we could then ascend the smaller stream with two lightdraft boats and perhaps burn the bridge which was ten miles higher before the enemy could bring sufficient force to make our position at wiltown bluff untenable the expedition was organized essentially upon this plan the smaller boats were the enoch deana river steamboat which carried a tenpound parrott gun and a small howitzerand a little mosquito of a tug the governor milton upon which with the greatest difficulty we found room for two twelvepound armstrong guns with their gunners forming a section of the first connecticut battery under lieutenant clinton aided by a squad from my own regiment under captain james the john adams carried i if i remember rightly two parrott guns of twenty and ten pounds calibre and a howitzer or two the whole force of men did not exceed two hundred and fifty we left beaufort s c on the afternoon of july th in former narrations i have sufficiently described the charm of a moonlight ascent into a hostile country upon an unknown stream the dark and silent banks the rippling water the wail of the reedbirds the anxious watch the breathless listening the veiled lights the whispered orders to this was now to be added the vexation of an insufficient pilotage for our negro guide knew only the upper river and as it finally proved not even that while to take us over the bar which obstructed the main stream we must borrow a pilot from captain dutch whose gunboat blockaded that point this active naval officer however whose boat expeditions had penetratedall the lower branches of those rivers could supply our want and we borrowed from him not only a pilot but a surgeon to replace our own who had been prevented by an accident from coming with us thus accompanied we steamed over the bar in safety had a peaceful ascent passed the island of jehosseethe fine estate of governor aiken then left undisturbed by both sidesand fired our first shell into the camp at wiltown bluff at four oclock in the morning the batterywhether fixed or movable we knew notmet us with a promptness that proved very shortlived after three shots it was silent but we could not tell why the bluff was wooded and we could see but little the only course was to land under cover of the guns as the firing ceased and the smoke cleared away i looked across the ricefields which lay beneath the bluff the first sunbeams glowed upon their emerald levels and on the blossoming hedges along the rectangular dikes what were those black dots which everywhere appeared those moist meadows had become alive with human heads and along each narrow path came a straggling file of men and women all on a run for the riverside i went ashore with a boatload of troops at once the landing was difficult and marshy the astonished negroes tugged us up the bank and gazed on us as if we had been cortez and columbus they kept arriving by land much faster than we could come by water every moment increased the crowd the jostling the mutual clinging on that miry foothold what a scene it was with the wild faces eager figures strange garments it seemed as one of the poor things reverently suggested like notin but de judgment day presently they began to come from the houses also with their little bundles on their heads then with larger bundles old women trotting on the narrow paths would kneel to pray a little prayer still balancing the bundle and then would suddenly spring up urged by the accumulating procession behind and would move on till irresistibly compelled by thankfulness to dip down for another invocation reaching us every human being must grasp our hands amid exclamations of bress you masr and bress de lord at the rate of four of the latter ascriptions to one of the former women brought children on their shoulders small black boys learned on their back little brothers equally inky and gravely depositing them shook hands never had i seen human beings so clad or rather so unclad in such amazing squalidness and destitution of garments i recall one small urchin without a rag of clothing save the basque waist of a ladys dress bristling with whalebones and worn wrong side before beneath which his smooth ebony legs emerged like those of an ostrich from its plumage how weak is imagination how cold is memory that i ever cease for a day of my life to see before me the picture of that astounding scene yet at the time we were perforce a little impatient of all this piety protestation and handpressing for the vital thing was to ascertain what force had been stationed at the bluff and whether it was yet withdrawn the slaves on the other hand were too much absorbed in their prospective freedom to aid us in taking any further steps to secure it captain trowbridge who had by this time landed at a different point got quite into despair over the seeming deafness of the people to all questions how many soldiers are there on the bluff he asked of the firstcomer masr said the man stuttering terribly i ccc tell me how many soldiers there are roared trowbridge in his mighty voice and all but shaking the poor old thing in his thirst for information o masr recommenced in terror the incapacitated witness i cccarpenter holding up eagerly a little stump of a hatchet his sole treasure as if his profession ought to excuse from all military opinions i wish that it were possible to present all this scene from the point of view of the slaves themselves it can be most nearly done perhaps by quoting the description given of a similar scene on the combahee river by a very aged man who had been brought down on the previous raid already mentioned i wrote it down in tent long after while the old man recited the tale with much gesticulation at the door and it is by far the best glimpse i have ever had through a negros eyes at these wonderful birthdays of freedom de people was all a hoein masr said the old man dey was a hoein in the ricefield when de gunboats come den ebry man drap dem hoe and leff de rice de masr he stand and call run to de wood for hide yankee come sell you to cuba run for hide ebry man he run and my god run

was gwine to de boat dores don quixote could not surpass the sublime absorption in which the gaunt old man with arm uplifted described this stage of affairs till he ended in a shrewd chuckle worthy of sancho panza then he resumed de brack sojers so presumptious this he repeated three times slowly shaking his head in an ecstasy of admiration it flashed upon me that the apparition of a black soldier must amaze those still in bondage much as a butterfly just from the chrysalis might astound his fellowgrubs i inwardly vowed that my soldiers at least should be as presumptious as icould make them then he went on ole woman and i go down to de boat den dey say behind us rebels cominl rebels comin ole woman say come ahead come plenty ahead i hab notin on but my shirt and pantaloon ole woman one

chilen gib tousand tank ebry day young people can go through force forcibly masr but de ole folk mus go slow such emotions as these no doubt were inspired by our arrival but we could only hear their hasty utterance in passing our duty being with the small force already landed to take possession of the bluff ascending with proper precautions the wooded hill we soon found ourselves in the deserted camp of a light battery amid scattered equipments and suggestions of a very unattractive breakfast as soon as possible skirmishers were thrown out through the woods to the farther edge of the bluff while a party searched the houses finding the usual large supply of furniture and pictures brought up for safety from belowbut no soldiers captain trowbridge then got the john adams beside the row of piles and went to work for their removal again i had the exciting sensation of being within the hostile linesthe eager explorations the doubts the watchfulness the listening for every sound of coming hoofs presently a horses tread was heard in earnest but it was a squad of our own men bringing in two captured cavalry soldiers one of these a sturdy fellow submitted quietly to his lot only begging that whenever we should evacuate the bluff a note should be left behind stating that he was a prisoner the other a very young man and a member of the rebel troop a sort of cadet corps among the charleston youths came to me in great wrath complaining that the corporal of our squad had kicked him after he had surrendered his air of offended pride was very rueful and it did indeed seem a pathetic reversal of fortunes for the two races to be sure the youth was a scion of one of the foremost families of south carolina and when i considered the wrongs which the black race had encountered from those of his blood first and last it seemed as if the most scrupulous recording angel might tolerate one final kick to square the account but i reproved the corporal who respectfully disclaimed the charge and said the kick was an incident of the scuffle it certainly was not their habit to show such poor malice they thought too well of themselves his demeanor seemed less lofty but rather piteous when he implored me not to put him on board any vessel which was to ascend the upper stream and hinted by awful implications the danger of such ascent this meant torpedoes a peril which we treated in those days with rather mistaken contempt but we found none on the edisto and it may be that it was only a foolish attempt to alarm us meanwhile trowbridge was toiling away at the row of piles which proved easier to draw out than to saw asunder either work being hard enough it took far longer than we had hoped and we saw noon approach and the tide rapidly fall taking with it inch by inch our hopes of effecting a surprise at the bridge during this time and indeed all day the detachments on shore under captains whitney and sampson were having occasional skirmishes with the enemy while the colored people were swarming to the shore or running to and fro like ants with the poor treasures of their houses our busy quartermaster mr binghamwho died afterwards from the overwork of that sultry daywas transporting the refugees on board the steamer or hunting up bales of cotton or directing the burning of ricehouses in accordance with our orders no dwellinghouses were destroyed or plundered by our menshermans bummers not having yet arrived though i asked no questions as to what the plantation negroes might bring in their great bundles one piece of property i must admit seemed a lawful capturea united states dresssword of the old pattern which had belonged to the rebel general who afterwards gave the order to bury colonel shaw with his niggers that i have retained not without some satisfaction to this day a passage having been cleared at last and the tide having turned by noon we lost no time in attempting the ascent leaving the bluff to be held by the john adams and by the small force on shore we were scarcely above the obstructions however when the little tug went aground and the enoch dean ascending a mile farther had an encounter with a battery on the rightperhaps our old enemyand drove it back soon after she also ran aground a misfortune of which our opponent strangely took no advantage and on getting off i thought it best to drop down to the bluff again as the tide was still hopelessly low none can tell save those who have tried them the vexations of those muddy southern streams navigable only during a few hours of floodtide after waiting an hour the two small vessels again tried the ascent the enemy on the right had disappeared but we could now see far off on our left another light battery moving parallel with the river apparently to meet us at some upper bend but for the present we were safe with the low ricefields on each side of us and the scene was so peaceful it seemed as if all danger were done for the first time we saw in south carolina blossoming riverbanks and low emerald meadows that seemed like new england everywhere there were the same rectangular fields smooth canals and bushy dikes a few negroes stole out to us in dugouts and breathlessly told us how others had been hurried away by theoverseers we glided safely on mile after mile the day was unutterably hot but all else seemed propitious the men had their combustibles all ready to fire the bridge and our hopes were unbounded but by degrees the channel grew more tortuous and difficult and while the little milton glided smoothly over everything the enoch dean my own boat repeatedly grounded on every occasion of especial need too something went wrong in her machineryher engine being constructed on some wholly new patent of which i should hope this trial would prove entirely sufficient the black pilot who was not a soldier grew more and more bewildered and declared that it was the channel not his brain which had gone wrong the captain a little elderly man sat wringing his hands in the pilotbox and the engineer appeared to be mingling his groans with those of the diseased engine meanwhile i in equal ignorance of machinery and channel had to give orders only justified by minute acquaintance with both so i navigated on general principles until they grounded us on a mudbank just below a wooded point and some two miles from the bridge of our destination it was with a pang that i waved to major strong who was on the other side of the channel in a tug not to risk approaching us but to steam on and finish the work if he could short was his triumph gliding round the point he found himself instantly engaged with a light battery of four or six guns doubtless the same we had seen in the distance the milton was within two hundred and fifty yards the connecticut men fought then guns well aided by the blacks and it was exasperating for us to hear the shots while we could see nothing and do nothing the scanty ammunition of our bow gun was exhausted and the gun in the stern was useless from the position in which we lay in vain we moved the men from side to side rocking the vessel to dislodge it the heat was terrific that august afternoon i remember i found myself constantly changing places on the scorched deck to keep my feet from being blistered at last the officer in charge of the gun a hardy lumberman from maine got the stern of the vessel so far round that he obtained the range of the battery through the cabin windows but it would be necessary he cooly added on reporting to me this fact to shoot away the corner of the cabin i knew that this apartment was newly painted and gilded and the idol of the poor captains heart but it was plain that even the thought of his own upholstery could not make the poor soul more wretched than he was so i bade captain dolly blaze away and thus we took our hand in the little game though at a sacrifice it was of no use down drifted out little consort round the point her engine disabled and her engineer killed as we afterwards found though then we could only look and wonder still pluckily firing she floated by upon the tide which had now just turned and when with a last desperate effort we got off our engine had one of its impracticable fits and we could only follow her the day was waning and all its range of possibility had lain within the limits of that one tide all our previous expeditions had been so successful it now seemed hard to turn back the riverbanks and ricefields so beautiful before seemed only a vexation now but the swift current bore us on and after our parthian shots had died away a new discharge of artillery opened upon us from our first antagonist of the morning which still kept the other side of the stream it had taken up a strong position on another bluff almost out of range of the john adams but within easy range of us the sharpest contest of the day was before us happily the engine and engineer were now behaving well and we were steering in a channel already traversed and of which the dangerous points were known but we had a long straight reach of river before us heading directly toward the battery which having once got our range had only to keep it while we could do nothing in return the rebels certainly served then guns well for the first time i discovered that there were certain compensating advantages in a slightly built craft as compared with one more substantial the missiles never lodged in the vessel but crashed through some thin partition as if it were paper to explode beyond us or fall harmless in the water splintering the chief source of wounds and death in wooden ships was thus entirely avoided the danger was that our machinery might be disabled or that shots might strike below the waterline and sink us this however did not happen fifteen projectiles as we afterwards computed passed through the vessel or cut the rigging yet few casualties occurred and those instantly fatal as my orderly stood leaning on a comrades shoulder the head of the latter was shot off at last i myself felt a sudden blow in the side as if from some prizefighter doubling me up for a moment while i sank upon a seat it proved afterwards to have been produced by the grazing of a ball which without tearing a garment had yet made a large part of my side black and blue leaving a sensation of paralysis which made it difficult to stand supporting myself on captain rogers i tried to comprehend what had happened and i remember being impressed by an odd feeling that i had now got my share and should henceforth be a great deal safer than any of the rest i am told that this often follows ones first experience of a wound but this immediate contest sharp as it was proved brief a turn in the river enabled us to use our stern gun and we soon glided into the comparative shelter of wiltown bluff there however we were to encounter the danger of shipwreck superadded to that of fight when the passage through the piles was first cleared it had been marked by stakes lest the rising tide should cover the remaining piles and make it difficult to run the passage but when we again reached it the stakes had somehow been knocked away the piles were just covered by the swift current and the little tugboat was aground upon them she came off easily however with our aid and when we in turn essayed the passage we grounded also but more firmly we getting off at last and making the passage the tug again became lodged when nearly past danger and all our efforts proved powerless to pull her through i therefore dropped down below and sent the john adams to her aid while i superintended the final recall of the pickets and the embarkation of the remaining refugeeswhile thus engaged i felt little solicitude about the boats above it was certain that the john adams could safely go close to the piles on the lower side that she was very strong and that the other was very light still it was natural to cast some anxious glances up the river and it was with surprise that i presently saw a canoe descending which contained major strong coming on board he told me with some excitement that the tug could not possibly be got off and he wished for orders it was no time to consider whether it was not his place to have given orders instead of going half a mile to seek them i was by this time so far exhausted that everything seemed to pass by me as by one in a dream but i got into a boat pushed up stream met presently the john adams returning and was informed by the officer in charge of the connecticut battery that he had abandoned the tug andworse news yetthat his guns had been thrown overboard it seemed to me then and has always seemed that this sacrifice was utterly needless because although the captain of the john adams had refused to risk his vessel by going near enough to receive the guns he should have been compelled to do so though the thing was done without my knowledge and beyond my reach yet as commander of the expedition i was technically responsible it was hard to blame a lieutenant when his senior had shrunk from a decision and left him alone nor was it easy to blame major strong whom i knew to be a man of personal courage though without much decision of character he was subsequently tried by courtmartial and acquitted after which he resigned and was lost at sea on his way home the tug being thus abandoned must of course be burned to prevent her falling into the enemys hands major strong went with prompt fearlessness to do this at my order after which he remained on the enoch dean and i went on board the john adams being compelled to succumb at last and transfer all remaining responsibility to captain trowbridge exhausted as i was i could still observe in a vague way the scene around me every available corner of the boat seemed like some vast auctionroom of secondhand goods great piles of bedding and bundles lay on every side with black heads emerging and black forms reclining in every stage of squalidness some seemed ill or wounded or asleep others were chattering eagerly among themselves singing praying or soliloquizing on joys to come bress de lord i heard one woman say i spec i got salt victual nownotin but fresh victual dese six months but ise get salt victual nowthus reversing under pressure of the saltembargo the usual anticipations of voyagers trowbridge told me long after that on seeking a fan for my benefit he could find but one on board that was in the hands of a fat old aunty who had just embarked and sat on an enormous bundle of her goods in everybodys way fanning herself vehemently and ejaculating as her gasping breath would permit oh do jesus oh do jesus when the captain abruptly disarmed her of the fan and left her continuing her pious exercises thus we glided down the river in the waning light once more we encountered a battery making five in all i could hear the guns of the assailants and could not distinguish the explosion of their shells from the answering throb of our own guns the kind quartermaster kept bringing me news of what occurred like rebecca in frontdeboeuf s castle but discreetly withholding any actual casualties then all faded into safety and sleep and we reached beaufort in the morning after thirtysix hours of absence a kind friend who acted in south carolina a nobler part amid tragedies than in any of her early stage triumphs met us with an ambulance at the wharf and the prisoners the wounded and the dead were duly attended the reader will not care for any personal record of convalescence though among the general military laudations of whiskey it is worth while to say that one life was saved in the opinion of my surgeons by an habitual abstinence from it leaving no food for peritoneal inflammation to feed upon the ablebodied men who had joined us were sent to aid general gillmore in the trenches while their families were established in huts and tents on st helena island a year after greatly to the delight of the regiment in taking possession of a battery which they had helped to capture on james island they found in their hands the selfsame guns which they had seen thrown overboard from the governor milton they then felt that their account with the enemy was squared and could proceed to further operations before the war how great a thing seemed the rescue of even one man from slavery and since the war has emancipated all how little seems the liberation of two hundred but no one then knew how the contest might end and when i think of that morning sunlight those emerald fields those thronging numbers the old women with their prayers and the little boys with them living burdens i know that the day was worth all it cost and more chapter the baby of the regiment we were in our winter camp on port royal island it was a lovely november morning soft and springlike the mockingbirds were singing and the cottonfields still white with fleecy pods morning drill was over the men were cleaning their guns and singing very happily the officers were in their tents reading still more happily their letters just arrived from home suddenly i heard a knock at my tentdoor and the latch clicked it was the only latch in camp and i was very proud of it and the officers always clicked it as loudly as possible in order to gratify my feelings the door opened and the quartermaster thrust in the most beaming face i ever saw colonel said he there are great news for the regiment my wife and baby are coming by the next steamer baby said i in amazement q m you are beside yourself we always called the quartermaster q m for shortness there was a pass sent to your wife but nothing was ever said about a baby baby indeed but the baby was included in the pass replied the triumphant fatherofafamily you dont suppose my wife would come down here without her baby besides the pass itself permits her to bring necessary baggage and is not a baby six months old necessary baggage but my dear fellow said i rather anxiously how can you make the little thing comfortable in a tent amidst these rigors of a south carolina winter when it is uncomfortably hot for drill at noon and ice forms by your bedside at night trust me for that said the delighted papa and went off whistling i could hear him telling the same news to three others at least before he got to his own tent that day the preparations began and soon his abode was a wonder of comfort there were posts and rafters and a raised floor and a great chimney and a door with hingesevery luxury except a latch and that he could not have for mine was the last that could be purchased one of the regimental carpenters was employed to make a cradle and another to make a bedstead high enough for the cradle to go under then there must be a bit of red carpet beside the bedstead and thus the progress of splendor went on the wife of one of the colored sergeants was engaged to act as nurserymaid she was a very respectable young woman the only objection to her being that she smoked a pipe but we thought that perhaps baby might not dislike tobacco and if she did she would have excellent opportunities to break the pipe in pieces in due time the steamer arrived and baby and her mother were among the passengers the little recruit was soon settled in her new cradle and slept in it as if she had never known any other the sergeants wife soon had her on exhibition through the neighborhood and from that time forward she was quite a queen among us she had sweet blue eyes and pretty brown hair with round dimpled cheeks and that perfect dignity which is so beautiful in a baby she hardly ever cried and was not at all timid she would go to anybody and yet did not encourage any romping from any but the most intimate friends she always wore a warm longsleeved scarlet cloak with a hood and in this costume was carried or toted as the soldiers said all about the camp at guardmounting in the morning when the men who are to go on guard duty for the day are drawn up to be inspected baby was always there to help inspect them she did not say much but she eyed them very closely and seemed fully to appreciate their bright buttons then the officeroftheday who appears at guardmounting with his sword and sash and comes afterwards to the colonels tent for orders would come and speak to baby on his way and receive her orders first when the time came for drill she was usually present to watch the troops and when the drum beat for dinner she liked to see the long row of men in each company march up to the cookhouse in single file each with tin cup and plate during the day in pleasant weather she might be seen in her nurses arms about the company streets the centre of an admiring circle her scarlet costume looking very pretty amidst the shining black cheeks and neat blue uniforms of the soldiers at dressparade just before sunset she was always an attendant as i stood before the regiment i could see the little spot of red out of the corner of my eye at one end of the long line of men and i looked with so much interest for her small person that instead of saying at the proper time attention battalion shoulder armsit is a wonder that i did not say shoulder babies our little lady was very impartial and distributed her kind looks to everybody she had not the slightest prejudice against color and did not care in the least whether her particular friends were black or white her especial favorites i think were the drummerboys who were not my favorites by any means for they were a roguish set of scamps and gave more trouble than all the grown men in the regiment i think annie liked them because they were small and made a noise and had red caps like her hood and red facings on their jackets and also because they occasionally stood on their heads for her amusement after dressparade the whole drumcorps would march to the great flagstaff and wait till just sunsettime when they would beat the retreat and then the flag would be hauled downa great festival for annie sometimes the sergeantmajor would wrap her in the great folds of the flag after it was taken down and she would peep out very prettily from amidst the stars and stripes like a newborn goddess of libertyabout once a month some inspecting officer was sent to the camp by the general in command to see to the condition of everything in the regiment from bayonets to buttons it was usually a long and tiresome process and when everything else was done i used to tell the officer that i had one thing more for him to inspect which was peculiar to our regiment then i would send for baby to be exhibited and i never saw an inspecting officer old or young who did not look pleased at the sudden appearance of the little fresh smiling creaturea flower in the midst of war and annie in her turn would look at them with the true baby dignity la her facethat deep earnest look which babies often have and which people think so wonderful when raphael paints it although they might often see just the same expression in the faces of their own darlings at home meanwhile annie seemed to like the camp style of housekeeping very much her fathers tent was double and he used the front apartment for his office and the inner room for parlor and bedroom while the nurse had a separate tent and washroom behind all i remember that the first time i went there in the evening it was to borrow some writingpaper and while babys mother was hunting for it in the front tent i heard a great cooing and murmuring in the inner room i asked if annie was still awake and her mother told me to go in and see pushing aside the canvas door i entered no sign of anybody was to be seen but a variety of soft little happy noises seemed to come from some unseen corner mrs c came quietly in pulled away the counterpane of her own bed and drew out the rough cradle where lay the little damsel perfectly happy and wider awake than anything but a baby possibly can be she looked as if the seclusion of a dozen family bedsteads would not be enough to discourage her spirits and i saw that camp life was likely to suit her very well a tent can be kept very warm for it is merely a house with a thinner wall than usual and i do not think that baby felt the cold much more than if she had been at home that winter the great trouble is that a tentchimney not being built very high is apt to smoke when the wind is in a certain direction and when that happens it is hardly possible to stay inside so we used to build the chimneys of some tents on the east side and those of others on the west and thus some of the tents were always comfortable i have seen babys mother running in a hard rain with little redridinghood in her arms to take refuge with the adjutants wife when every other abode was full of smoke and i must admit that there were one or two windy days that season when nobody could really keep warm and annie had to remain ignominiously in her cradle with as many clothes on as possible for almost the whole time the quartermasters tent was very attractive to us in the evening i remember that once on passing near it after nightfall i heard our majors fine voice singing methodist hymns within and mrs cs sweet tones chiming in so i peeped through the outer door the fire was burning very pleasantly in the inner tent and the scrap of new red carpet made the floor look quite magnificent the major sat on a box our surgeon on a stool q m and his wife and the adjutants wife and one of the captains were all sitting on the bed singing as well as they knew how and the baby was under the bed baby had retired for the night was overshadowed suppressed sat upon the singing went on and she had wandered away into her own land of dreams nearer to heaven perhaps than any pitch their voices could attain i went in and joined the party presently the music stopped and another officer was sent for to sing some particular song at this pause the invisible innocent waked a little and began to cluck and coo its the kitten exclaimed somebody its my baby exclaimed mrs c triumphantly in that tone of unfailing personal pride which belongs to young mothers the people all got up from the bed for a moment while annie was pulled from beneath wide awake and placid as usual and she sat in one lap or another during the rest of the concert sometimes winking at the candle but usually listening to the songs with a calm and critical expression as if she could make as much noise as any of them whenever she saw fit to try not a sound did she make however except one little soft sneeze which led to an immediate floodtide of red shawl covering every part of her but the forehead but i soon hinted that the concert had better be ended because i knew from observation that the small damsel had carefully watched a regimental inspection and a brigade drill on that day and that an interval of repose was certainly necessary annie did not long remain the only baby in camp one day on going out to the stables to look at a horse i heard a sound of babytalk addressed by some man to a child near by and looking round the corner of a tent i saw that one of the hostlers had something black and round lying on the sloping side of a tent with which he was playing very eagerly it proved to be his baby a plump shiny thing younger than annie and i never saw a merrier picture than the happy father frolicking with his child while the mother stood quietly by this was baby number two and she stayed in camp several weeks the two innocents meeting each other every day in the placid indifference that belonged to their years both were happy little healthy things and it never seemed to cross their minds that there was any difference in their complexions as i said before annie was not troubled by any prejudice in regard to color nor do i suppose that the other little maiden was annie enjoyed the tentlife very much but when we were sent out on picket soon after she enjoyed it still more our headquarters were at a deserted plantation house with one large parlor a diningroom and a few bedrooms babys father and mother had a room up stairs with a stove whose pipe went straight out at the window this was quite comfortable though half the windows were broken and there was no glass and no glazier to mend them the windows of the large parlor were in much the same condition though we had an immense fireplace where we had a bright firewhenever it was cold and always in the evening the walls of this room were very dirty and it took our ladies several days to cover all the unsightly places with wreaths and hangings of evergreen in the performance baby took an active part her duties consisted in sitting in a great nest of evergreen pulling and fingering the fragrant leaves and occasionally giving a little cry of glee when she had accomplished some piece of decided mischief there was less entertainment to be found in the camp itself at this time but the household at headquarters was larger than baby had been accustomed to we had a great deal of company moreover and she had quite a gay life of it she usually made her appearance in the large parlor soon after breakfast and to dance her for a few moments in our arms was one of the first daily duties of each one then the morning reports began to arrive from the different outpostsa mounted officer or courier coming in from each place dismounting at the door and clattering in with jingling arms and spurs each a new excitement for annie she usually got some attention from any officer who came receiving with her wonted dignity any daring caress when the messengers had ceased to be interesting there were always the horses to look at held or tethered under the trees beside the sunny piazza after the various couriers had been received other messengers would be despatched to the town seven miles away and baby had all the excitement of their mounting and departure her father was often one of the riders and would sometimes seize annie for a goodby kiss place her on the saddle before him gallop her round the house once or twice and then give her back to her nurses arms again she was perfectly fearless and such boisterous attentions never frightened her nor did they ever interfere with her sweet infantine selfpossession after the ridingparties had gone there was the piazza still for entertainment with a sentinel pacing up and down before it but annie did not enjoy the sentinel though his breastplate and buttons shone like gold so much as the hammock which always hung swinging between the pillars it was a pretty hammock with great open meshes and she delighted to lie in it and have the netting closed above her so that she could only be seen through the apertures i can see her now the fresh little rosy thing in her blue and scarlet wrappings with one round and dimpled arm thrust forth through the netting and the other grasping an armful of blushing roses and fragrant magnolias she looked like those pretty french basreliefs of cupids imprisoned in baskets and peeping through that hammock was a very useful appendage it was a couch for us a cradle for baby a nest for the kittens and we had moreover a little hen which tried to roost there every night when the mornings were colder and the stove up stairs smoked the wrong way baby was brought down in a very incomplete state of toilet and finished her dressing by the great fire we found her bare shoulders very becoming and she was very much interested in her own little pink toes after a very slow dressing she had a still slower breakfast out of a tin cup of warm milk of which she generally spilt a good deal as she had much to do in watching everybody who came into the room and seeing that there was no mischief done then she would be placed on the floor on our only piece of carpet and the kittens would be brought in for her to play with we had at different times a variety of pets of whom annie did not take much notice sometimes we had young partridges caught by the drummerboys in trapcages the children called them bob and chloe because the first notes of the male and female sound like those names one day i brought home an opossum with her blind bare little young clinging to the droll pouch where their mothers keep them sometimes we had pretty green lizards their color darkening or deepening like that of chameleons in light or shade but the only pets that took babys fancy were the kittens they perfectly delighted her from the first moment she saw them they were the only things younger than herself that she had ever beheld and the only things softer than themselves that her small hands had grasped it was astonishing to see how much the kittens would endure from her they could scarcely be touched by any one else without mewing but when annie seized one by the head and the other by the tail and rubbed them violently together they did not make a sound i suppose that a babys grasp is really soft even if it seems ferocious and so it gives less pain than one would think at any rate the little animals had the best of it very soon for they entirely outstripped annie in learning to walk and they could soon scramble away beyond her reach while she sat in a sort of dumb despair unable to comprehend why anything so much smaller than herself should be so much nimbler meanwhile the kittens would sit up and look at her with the most provoking indifference just out of arms length until some of us would take pity on the young lady and toss her furry playthings back to her again little baby she learned to call them and these were the very first words she spoke baby had evidently a natural turn for war further cultivated by an intimate knowledge of drills and parades the nearer she came to actual conflict the better she seemed to like it peaceful as her own little ways might be twice at least while she was with us on picket we had alarms from the rebel troops who would bring down cannon to the opposite side of the ferry about two miles beyond us and throw shot and shell over upon our side then the officer at the ferry would think that there was to be an attack made and couriers would be sent riding to and fro and the men would all be called to arms in a hurry and the ladies at headquarters would all put on their best bonnets and come down stairs and the ambulance would be made ready to carry them to a place of safety before the expected fight on such occasions baby was in all her glory she shouted with delight at being suddenly uncribbed and thrust into her little scarlet cloak and brought down stairs at an utterly unusual and improper hour to a piazza with lights and people and horses and general excitement she crowed and gurgled and made gestures with her little fists and screamed out what seemed to be her advice on the military situation as freely as if she had been a newspaper editor except that it was rather difficultto understand her precise direction i do not know but the whole rebel force might have been captured through her plans and at any rate i should much rather obey her orders than those of some generals whom i have known for she at least meant no harm and would lead one into no mischief however at last the danger such as it was would be all over and the ladies would be induced to go peacefully to bed again and annie would retreat with them to her ignoble cradle very much disappointed and looking vainly back at the more martial scene below the next morning she would seem to have forgotten all about it and would spill her bread and milk by the fire as if nothing had happened i suppose we hardly knew at the time how large a part of the sunshine of our daily lives was contributed by dear little annie yet when i now look back on that pleasant southern home she seems as essential a part of it as the mockingbirds or the magnolias and i cannot convince myself that in returning to it i should not find her there but annie went back with the spring to her northern birthplace and then passed away from this earth before her little feet had fairly learned to tread its paths and when i meet her next it must be in some world where there is triumph without armies and where innocence is trained in scenes of peace i know however that her little life short as it seemed was a blessing to us all giving a perpetual image of serenity and sweetness recalling the lovely atmosphere of faroff homes and holding us by unsuspected ties to whatsoever things were pure chapter negro spirituals the war brought to some of us besides its direct experiences many a strange fulfilment of dreams of other days for instance the present writer had been a faithful student of the scottish ballads and had always envied sir walter the delight of tracing them out amid their own heather and of writing them down piecemeal from the lips of aged crones it was a strange enjoyment therefore to be suddenly brought into the midst of a kindred world of unwritten songs as simple and indigenous as the border minstrelsy more uniformly plaintive almost always more quaint and often as essentially poetic this interest was rather increased by the fact that i had for many years heard of this class of songs under the name of negro spirituals and had even heard some of them sung by friends from south carolina i could now gather on their own soil these strange plants which i had before seen as in museums alone true the individual songs rarely coincided there was a line here a chorus therejust enough to fix the class but this was unmistakable it was not strange that they differed for the range seemed almost endless and south carolina georgia and florida seemed to have nothing but the generic character in common until all were mingled in the united stock of campmelodies often in the starlit evening i have returned from some lonely ride by the swift river or on the ploverhaunted barrens and entering the camp have silently approached some glimmering fire round which the dusky figures moved in the rhythmical barbaric dance the negroes call a shout chanting often harshly but always in the most perfect time some monotonous refrain writing down in the darkness as i best couldperhaps with my hand in the safe covert of my pocketthe words of the song i have afterwards carried it to my tent like some captured bird or insect and then after examination put it by or summoning one of the men at some period of leisurecorporal robert sutton for instance whose iron memory held all the details of a song as if it were a ford or a foresti have completed the new specimen by supplying the absent parts the music i could only retain by ear and though the more common strains were repeated often enough to fix their impression there were others that occurred only once or twice the words will be here given as nearly as possible in the original dialect and if the spelling seems sometimes inconsistent or the misspelling insufficient it is because i could get no nearer i wished to avoid what seems to me the only error of lowells biglow papers in respect to dialect the occasional use of an extreme misspelling which merely confuses the eye without taking us any closer to the peculiarity of sound the favorite song in camp was the following sung with no accompaniment but the measured clapping of hands and the clatter of many feet it was sung perhaps twice as often as any other this was partly due to the fact that it properly consisted of a chorus alone with which the verses of other songs might be combined at random i hold your light hold your light brudder robert hold your light hold your light on canaans shore what make ole satan for follow me so satan aint got notin for do wid me hold your light hold your light hold your light on canaans shore this would be sung for half an hour at a time perhaps each person present being named in turn it seemed the simplest primitive type of spiritual the next in popularity was almost as elementary and like this named successively each one of the circle it was however much more resounding and convivial in its music ii bound to go jordan river im bound to go bound to go bound to go jordan river im bound to go and bid em fare ye well my brudder robert im bound to go bound to go c my sister lucy im bound to go bound to go c sometimes it was tink em think them fare ye well the ye was so detached that i thought at first it was very or vary well another picturesque song which seemed immensely popular was at first very bewildering to me i could not make out the first words of the chorus and called it the romandar being reminded of some romaic song which i had formerly heard that association quite fell in with the orientalism of the new tentlifeiii room in there o my mudder is gone my mudder is gone my mudder is gone into heaven my lord i cant stay behind deres room in dar room in dar room in dar in de heaven my lord i cant stay behind cant stay behind my dear i cant stay behind o my fader is gone c o de angels are gone c o ise been on de road ise been on de road ise been on de road into heaven my lord i cant stay behind o room in dar room in dar room in dar in de heaven my lord i cant stay behind by this time every man within hearing from oldest to youngest would be wriggling and shuffling as if through some magic pipers bewitchment for even those who at first affected contemptuous indifference would be drawn into the vortex erelong next to these in popularity ranked a class of songs belonging emphatically to the church militant and available for camp purposes with very little strain upon their symbolism this for instance had a true companioninarms heartiness about it not impaired by the feminine invocation at the end iv hail mary one more valiant soldier here one more valiant soldier here one more valiant soldier here to help me bear de cross o hail mary hail hail mary hail hail mary hail to help me bear de cross i fancied that the original reading might have been soul instead of soldierwith some other syllable inserted to fill out the metreand that the hail mary might denote a roman catholic origin as i had several men from st augustine who held in a dim way to that faith it was a very ringing song though not so grandly jubilant as the next which was really impressive as the singers pealed it out when marching or rowing or embarking v my army cross over my army cross over my army cross over o pharaohs army drowndedl my army cross over well cross de mighty river my army cross over well cross de river jordan my army cross over well cross de danger water my army cross over well cross de mighty myo my army cross over thrice o pharaohs army drowndedl my army cross over i could get no explanation of the mighty myo except that one of the old men thought it meant the river of death perhaps it is an african word in the cameroon dialect mawa signifies to die the next also has a military ring about it and the first line is well matched by the music the rest is conglomerate and one or two lines show a more northern origin done is a virginia shibboleth quite distinct from the been which replaces it in south carolina yet one of their best choruses without any fixed words was de bell done ringing for which in proper south carolina dialect would have been substituted de bell been aring this refrain may have gone south with our army vi ride in kind saviour ride in kind saviour no man can hinder me o jesus is a mighty man no man c were marching through virginny fieldsno man c o satan is a busy man no man c and he has his sword and shield no man c o old secesh done come and gone no man can hinder me sometimes they substituted binder we which was more spicy to the ear and more in keeping with the usual headoverheels arrangement of their pronouns almost all their songs were thoroughly religious in their tone however quaint then expression and were in a minor key both as to words and music the attitude is always the same and as a commentary on the life of the race is infinitely pathetic nothing but patience for this lifenothing but triumph in the next sometimes the present predominates sometimes the future but the combination is always implied in the following for instance we hear simply the patience vii this world almost done brudder keep your lamp trimmin and aburnin keep your lamp trimmin and aburnin keep your lamp trimmin and aburnin for dis world most done so keep your lamp c dis world most done but in the next the final reward of patience is proclaimed as plaintively viii i want to go home deres no rain to wet you o yes i want to go home deres no sun to burn you o yes i want to go home o push along believers o yes c deres no hard trials o yes c deres no whips acrackin o yes c my brudder on de wayside o yes c o push along my brudder o yes c where deres no stormy weather o yes c deres no tribulation o yes c this next was a boatsong and timed well with the tug of the oar ix the coming day i want to go to canaan i want to go to canaan i want to go to canaan to meet em at de comin day o remember let me go to canaan thrice to meet em c o brudder let me go to canaan thrice to meet em c my brudder youohremember thrice to meet em at de comin day the following begins with a startling affirmation yet the last line quite outdoes the first this too was a capital boatsong x one more river o jordan bank was a great old bank dere aint but one more river to cross we have some valiant soldier here dere aint c o jordan stream will never run dry dere aint c deres a hill on my leff and he catch on my right dere aint but one more river to cross i could get no explanation of this last riddle except dat mean if you go on de leff go to struction and if you go on de right go to god for sure in others more of spiritual conflict is implied as in this nextxi o the dying lamb i wants to go where moses trod o de dying lamb for moses gone to de promised land o de dying lamb to drink from springs dat never run dry o c cry o my lord o c before ill stay in hell one day o c im in hopes to pray my sins away o c cry o my lord c brudder moses promised for be dar too o c to drink from streams dat never run dry o de dying lamb in the next the conflict is at its height and the lurid imagery of the apocalypse is brought to bear this book with the books of moses constituted their bible all that lay between even the narratives of the life of jesus they hardly cared to read or to hear xii down in the valley well run and never tire well run and never tire well run and never tire jesus set poor sinners free way down in de valley who will rise and go with me youve heern talk of jesus who set poor sinners free de lightnin and de flashin de lightnin and de flashin de lightnin and de flashin jesus set poor shiners free i cant stand the fire thrice jesus set poor sinners free de green trees aflamin thrice jesus set poor shiners free way down in de valley who will rise and go with me youve heern talk of jesus who set poor shiners free de valley and de lonesome valley were familiar words in their religious experience to descend into that region implied the same process with the anxiousseat of the campmeeting when a young girl was supposed to enter it she bound a handkerchief by a peculiar knot over her head and made it a point of honor not to change a single garment till the day of her baptism so that she was sure of being in physical readiness for the cleansing rite whatever her spiritual mood might be more than once in noticing a damsel thus mystically kerchiefed i have asked some dusky attendant its meaning and have received the unfailing answerframed with their usual indifference to the genders of pronounshe in de lonesome valley sa the next gives the same dramatic conflict while its detached and impersonal refrain gives it strikingly the character of the scotch and scandinavian ballads xiii cry holy cry holy holy look at de people dat is born of god and i run down de valley and i run down to pray says look at de people dat is born of god when i get dar cappen satan was dar says look at c says young man young man deres no use for pray says look at c for jesus is dead and god gone away says look at c and i made him out a liar and i went my way says look at c sing holy holy o mary was a woman and he had a one son says look at c and de jews and de romans had him hung says look at c cry holy holy and i tell you sinner you had better had praysays look at c for hell is a dark and dismal place says look at c and i tell you sinner and i wouldnt go dar says look at c cry holy holy here is an infinitely quaint description of the length of the heavenly road xiv oer the crossing venders my old mudder been awaggin at de hill so long its about time shell cross over get home bimeby keep prayin i do believe were a long time waggin oer de crossin keep prayin i do believe well get home to heaven bimeby hear dat mournful thunder roll from door to door calling home gods children get home bimeby little chilen i do believe were a

i do believe well get home to heaven bimeby one of the most singular pictures of future joys and with fine flavor of hospitality about it was this xv walk em easy o walk em easy round de heaven walk em easy round de heaven walk em easy round de heaven dat all de people may join de band walk em easy round de heaven thrice o shout glory till em join dat band the chorus was usually the greater part of the song and often came in paradoxically thus xvi o yes lord o must i be like de foolish mans o yes lord will build de house on de sandy hill o yes lord ill build my house on zion hill o yes lord no wind nor rain can blow me down o yes lord the next is very graceful and lyrical and with more variety of rhythm than usual xvii bow low mary bow low mary bow low martha for jesus come and lock de door and carry de keys away sail sail over yonder and view de promised land for jesus come c weep o mary bow low martha for jesus come c sail sail my true believer sail sail over yonder mary bow low martha bow low for jesus come and lock de door and carry de keys away but of all the spirituals that which surprised me the most i thinkperhaps because it was that in which external nature furnished the images most directlywas this with all my experience of their ideal ways of speech i was startled when first i came on such a flower of poetry in that dark soilxviii i know moonrise i know moonrise i know starrise lay dis body down i walk in de moonlight i walk in de starlight to lay dis body down ill walk in de graveyard ill walk through de graveyard to lay dis body down ill lie in de grave and stretch out my arms lay dis body down i go to de judgment in de evenin of de day when i lay dis body down and my soul and your soul will meet in de day when i lay dis body down ill lie in de grave and stretch out my arms never it seems to me since man first lived and suffered was his infinite longing for peace uttered more plaintively than in that line the next is one of the wildest and most striking of the whole series there is a mystical effect and a passionate striving throughout the whole the scriptural struggle between jacob and the angel which is only dimly expressed in the words seems all uttered in the music i think it impressed my imagination more powerfully than any other of these songs xix wrestling jacob o wrestlin jacob jacob days abreakin i will not let thee go o wrestlin jacob jacob days abreakin he will not let me go o i hold my brudder wid a tremblin hand i would not let him go i hold my sister wid a tremblin hand i would not let her go o jacob do hang from a tremblin limb he would not let him go o jacob do hang from a tremblin limb de lord will bless my soul o wrestlin jacob jacob c of occasional hymns properly so called i noticed but one a funeral hymn for an infant which is sung plaintively over and over without variety of words xx the baby gone home de little baby gone home de little baby gone home de little baby gone along for to climb up jacobs ladder and i wish id been dar i wish id been dar i wish id been dar my lord for to climb up jacobs ladder still simpler is this which is yet quite sweet and touching xxi jesus with us he have been wid us jesus he still wid us jesus he will be wid us jesus be wid us to the end the next seemed to be a favorite about christmas time when meditations on de rollin year were frequent among them xxii lord remember me o do lord remember me o do lord remember me o do remember me until de year roll round do lord remember me if lay you and you want to die like jesus died in de grave would fold your arms and close your eyes die wid a free good will for death is a simple ting and he go from door to door and he knock down some and he cripple op some and he leave some here to pray o do lord remember me o do lord remember memy old faders gone till de year roll round do lord remember me the next was sung in such an operatic and rollicking way that it was quite hard to fancy it a religious performance which however it was i heard it but once xxih early in the morning i meet little rosa early in de mornin o jerusalem early in de mornin and i ax her how you do my darter o jerusalem early in de mornin i meet my mudder early in de mornin o jerusalem c and i ax her how you do my mudder o jerusalem c i meet brudder robert early in de mornin o jerusalem c and i ax him how you do my sonny o jerusalem c i meet tittawisa early in de mornin o jerusalem c and i ax her how you do my darter o jerusalem c tittawisa means sister louisa in songs of this class the name of every person present successively appears their best marching song and one which was invaluable to lift their feet along as they expressed it was the following there was a kind of spring and lilt to it quite indescribable by words xxiv go in the wilderness jesus call you go in de wilderness go in de wilderness go in de wilderness jesus call you go in de wilderness to wait upon de lord go wait upon de lord go wait upon de lord go wait upon de lord my god he take away de sins of de world jesus awaitin go in de wilderness go c all dem chilen go in de wilderness to wait upon de lord the next was one of those which i had heard in boyish days brought north from charleston but the chorus alone was identical the words were mainly different and those here given are quaint enough xxv blow your trumpet gabriel o blow your trumpet gabriel blow your trumpet louder and i want dat trumpet to blow me home to my new jerusalem de prettiest ting dat ever i done was to serve de lord when i was young so blow your trumpet gabriel c o satan is a liar and he conjure too and if you dont mind hell conjure you so blow your trumpet gabriel c o i was lost in de wilderness king jesus hand me de candle down so blow your trumpet gabriel c the following contains one of those odd transformations of proper names with which their scriptural citations were often enriched it rivals their text paul may plant and may polish wid water which i have elsewhere quoted and in which the sainted apollos would hardly have recognized himself xxvi in the morning in de mornin in de mornin chilen yes my lord dont you hear de trumpet sound if i had adied when i was young i never would had de race for rundont you hear de trumpet sound o sam and peter was fishin in de sea and dey drop de net and follow my lord dont you hear de trumpet sound deres a silver spade for to dig my grave and a golden chain for to let me down dont you hear de trumpet sound in de mornin in de mornin chilen yes my lord dont you hear de trumpet sound these golden and silver fancies remind one of the king of spains daughter in mother goose and the golden apple and the silver pear which are doubtless themselves but the vestiges of some simple early composition like this the next has a humbler and more domestic style of fancy xxvii fare ye well my true believers fare ye well fare ye well fare ye well fare ye well by de grace of god for im going home massa jesus give me a little broom for to sweep my heart clean and i will try by de grace of god to win my way home among the songs not available for marching but requiring the concentrated enthusiasm of the camp was the ship of zion of which they had three wholly distinct versions all quite exuberant and tumultuous xxviii the ship of zion come along come along and let us go home o glory hallelujah dis de ole ship o zion halleloo halleloo dis de ole ship o zion hallelujah she has landed many a tousand she can land as many more o glory hallelujah c do you tink she will be able for to take us all home o glory hallelujah c you can tell em im a comin halleloo halleloo you can tell em im a comin hallelujah come along come along c xxix the ship of zion second version dis de good ole ship o zion dis de good ole ship o zion dis de good ole ship o zion and shes makin for de promise land she hab angels for de sailors thrice and shes c and how you know deys angels thrice and shes c good lord shall i be

jordan jordan jordan and shes c king jesus is de captain captain captain and shes makin for de promise land xxx the ship of zion third version de gospel ship is sailinhosannsann o jesus is de captain hosannsann de angels are de sailors hosannsann o is your bundle ready hosannsann o have you got your ticket hosannsann this abbreviated chorus is given with unspeakable unction the three just given are modifications of an old campmeeting melody and the same may be true of the three following although i cannot find them in the methodist hymnbooks each however has its characteristic modifications which make it well worth giving in the second verse of this next for instance saviour evidently has become soldier xxxi sweet music sweet music in heaven just beginning for to roll dont you love god glory hallelujah yes late i heard my soldier say come heavy soul i am de way dont you love god glory hallelujah ill go and tell to sinners round what a kind saviour i have found dont you love god glory hallelujah my grief my burden long has been because i was not cease from sin dont you love god glory hallelujahl xxxii good news o good news o good news de angels brought de tidings down just comin from de trone as grief from out my soul shall fly just comin from de trone ill shout salvation when i die good news o good news just comin from de trone lord i want to go to heaven when i die good news o good news c de white folks call us a noisy crew good news o good news but dis i know we are happy too just comin from de trone xxxiii the heavenly road you may talk of my name as much as you please and carry my name abroad but i really do believe im a child of god as i walk in de heavenly road o wont you go wid me thrice for to keep our garments clean o satan is a mighty busy ole man and roll rocks in my way but jesus is my bosom friend and roll em out of de way o wont you go wid me thrice for to keep our garments clean come my brudder if you never did pray i hope you may pray tonight for i really believe im a child of god as i walk in de heavenly road o wont you c some of the songs had played an historic part during the war for singing the next for instance the negroes had been put in jail in georgetown s c at the outbreak of the rebellion well soon be free was too dangerous an assertion and though the chant was an old one it was no doubt sung with redoubled emphasis during the new events de lord will call us home was evidently thought to be a symbolical verse for as a little drummerboy explained to me showing all his white teeth as he sat in the moonlight by the door of my tent dey tink de lord mean for say de yankeesxxxiv well soon be free well soon be free well soon be free well soon be free when de lord will call us home my brudder how long my brudder how long my brudder how long fore we done sufferin here it wont be long thrice fore de lord will call us home well walk de miry road thrice where pleasure never dies well walk de golden street thrice where pleasure never dies my brudder how long thrice fore we done sufferin here well soon be free thrice when jesus sets me free well fight for liberty thrice when de lord will call us home the suspicion in this case was unfounded but they had another song to which the rebellion had actually given rise this was composed by nobody knew whomthough it was the most recent doubtless of all these spiritualsand had been sung in secret to avoid detection it is certainly plaintive enough the peck of corn and pint of salt were slaverys rations xxxv many thousand go no more peck o corn for me no more no more no more peck o corn for me many tousand go no more drivers lash for me twice no more c no more pint o salt for me twice no more c no more hundred lash for me twice no more c no more mistress call for me no more no more no more mistress call for me many tousand go even of this last composition however we have only the approximate date and know nothing of the mode of composition allan ramsay says of the scotch songs that no matter who made them they were soon attributed to the minister of the parish whence they sprang and i always wondered about these whether they had always a conscious and definite origin in some leading mind or whether they grew by gradual accretion in an almost unconscious way on this point i could get no information though i asked many questions until at last one day when i was being rowed across from beaufort to ladies island i found myself with delight on the actual trail of a song one of the oarsmen a brisk young fellow not a soldier on being asked for his theory of the matter dropped out a coy confession some good sperituals he said are start jess out o curiosity i been araise a sing myself once my dream was fulfilled and i had traced out not the poem alone but the poet i implored him to proceed once we boys he said went for tote some rice and de niggerdriver he keep acallin on us and i say o de ole niggerdriver den anudder said fust ting my mammy tole me was notin so bad as niggerdriver den i made a sing just puttin a word and den anudder word then he began singing and the men after listening a moment joined in the chorus as if it were an old acquaintance though they evidently had never heard it before i saw how easily a new sing took root among them xxxvi the driver o de ole niggerdriver o gwine away fust ting my mammy tell me o gwine away tell me bout de niggerdriver o gwine away niggerdriver second devil o gwine away best ting for do he driver o gwine awayknock he down and spoil he labor o gwine away it will be observed that although this song is quite secular in its character yet its author called it a spiritual i heard but two songs among them at any time to which they would not perhaps have given this generic name one of these consisted simply in the endless repetitionafter the manner of certain college songsof the mysterious line rain fall and wet becky lawton but who becky lawton was and why she should or should not be wet and whether the dryness was a reward or a penalty none could say i got the impression that in either case the event was posthumous and that there was some tradition of grass not growing over the grave of a sinner but even this was vague and all else vaguer the other song i heard but once on a morning when a squad of men came in from picket duty and chanted it in the most rousing way it had been a stormy and comfortless night and the picket station was very exposed it still rained in the morning when i strolled to the edge of the camp looking out for the men and wondering how they had stood it presently they came striding along the road at a great pace with their shining rubber blankets worn as cloaks around them the rain streaming from these and from their equally shining faces which were almost all upon the broad grin as they pealed out this remarkable ditty hangman johnny o dey call me hangman johnny o ho o ho but i never hang nobody o hang boys hang o dey call me hangman johnny o ho o ho but well all hang togedder o hang boys hang my presence apparently checked the performance of another verse beginning de buckra list for money apparently in reference to the controversy about the payquestion then just beginning and to the more mercenary aims they attributed to the white soldiers but hangman johnny remained always a myth as inscrutable as becky lawton as they learned all their songs by ear they often strayed into wholly new versions which sometimes became popular and entirely banished the others this was amusingly the case for instance with one phrase in the popular campsong of marching along which was entirely new to them until our quartermaster taught it to them at my request the words gird on the armor were to them a stumblingblock and no wonder until some ingenious ear substituted guide on de army which was at once accepted and became universal well guide on de army and be marching along is now the established version on the sea islands these quaint religious songs were to the men more than a source of relaxation they were a stimulus to courage and a tie to heaven i never overheard in camp a profane or vulgar song with the trifling exceptions given all had a religious motive while the most secular melody could not have been more exciting a few youths from savannah who were comparatively men of the world had learned some of the ethiopian minstrel ditties imported from the north these took no hold upon the mass and on the other hand they sang reluctantly even on sunday the long and short metres of the hymnbooks always gladly yielding to the more potent excitement of their own spirituals by these they could sing themselves as had their fathers before them out of the contemplation of their own low estate into the sublime scenery of the apocalypse i remember that this minorkeyed pathos used to seem to me almost too sad to dwell upon while slavery seemed destined to last for generations but now that their patience has had its perfect work history cannot afford to lose this portion of its record there is no parallel instance of an oppressed race thus sustained by the religious sentiment alone these songs are but the vocal expression of the simplicity of their faith and the sublimity of their long resignation chapter life at camp shaw the edisto expedition cost me the health and strength of several years i could say long after in the words of one of the men ise been a sickly person eber since de expeditious justice to a strong constitution and good habits compels me however to say that up to the time of my injury i was almost the only officer in the regiment who had not once been off duty from illness but at last i had to yield and went north for a month we heard much said during the war of wounded officers who stayed unreasonably long at home i think there were more instances of those who went back too soon such at least was my case on returning to the regiment i found a great accumulation of unfinished business every member of the field and staff was prostrated by illness or absent on detailed service two companies had been sent to hilton head on fatigue duty and kept there unexpectedly long and there was a visible demoralization among the rest especially from the fact that their pay had just been cut down in violation of the express pledges of the government a few weeks of steady sway made all right again and during those weeks i felt a perfect exhilaration of health followed by a month or two of complete prostration when the work was done this passing i returned to duty buoyed up by the fallacious hope that the winter months would set me right again we had a new camp on port royal island very pleasantly situated just out of beaufort it stretched nearly to the edge of a shelving bluff fringed with pines and overlooking the river below the bluff was a hard narrow beach where one might gallop a mile and bathe at the farther end we could look up and down the curving stream and watch the few vessels that came and went our first encampment had been lower down that same river and we felt at home the new camp was named camp shaw in honor of the noble young officer who had lately fallen at fort wagner under circumstances which had endeared him to all the men as it happened they had never seen him nor was my regiment ever placed within immediate reach of the fiftyfourth massachusetts this i always regretted feeling very desirous to compare the military qualities of the northern and southern blacks as it was the southern regiments with which the massachusetts troops were brigaded were hardly a fair specimen of their kind having been raised chiefly by drafting and for this and other causes being afflicted with perpetual discontent and desertion we had of course looked forward with great interest to the arrival of these new colored regiments and i had ridden in from the picketstation to see the fiftyfourth apart from the peculiarity of its material it was fresh from my own state and i had relatives and acquaintances among its officers governor andrew who had formed it was an old friend and had begged me on departure from massachusetts to keep him informed as to our experiment i had good reason to believe that my reports had helped to prepare the way for this new battalion and i had sent him at his request some hints as to its formation commonwealth of massachusetts executive department boston february to col t w higginson commanding st regt s c vols port royal id s c coloneli am under obligations to you for your very interesting letter of january th which i considered to be too important in its testimony to the efficiency of colored troops to be allowed to remain hidden on my files i therefore placed some portions of it in the hands of hon stephen m weld of jamaica plain for publication and you will find enclosed the newspaper slip from the journal of february d in which it appeared during a recent visit at washington i have obtained permission from the department of war to enlist colored troops as part of the massachusetts quota and i am about to begin to organize a colored infantry regiment to be numbered the th massachusetts volunteers i shall be greatly obliged by any suggestions which your experience may afford concerning it and i am determined that it shall serve as a model in the high character of its officers and the thorough discipline of its men for all subsequent corps of the like material please present to general saxton the assurances of my respectful regard i have the honor to be respectfully and obediently yours john a andrew governor of massachusetts in the streets of beaufort i had met colonel shaw riding with his lieutenantcolonel and successor edward hallowell and had gone back with them to share their first meal in camp i should have known shaw anywhere by his resemblance to his kindred nor did it take long to perceive that he shared their habitual truthfulness and courage moreover he and hallowell had already got beyond the commonplaces of inexperience in regard to colored troops and for a wonder asked only sensible questions for instance he admitted the mere matter of courage to be settled as regarded the colored troops and his whole solicitude bore on this point would they do as well in lineofbattle as they had alreadydone in more irregular service and on picket and guard duty of this i had of course no doubt nor i think had he though i remember his saying something about the possibility of putting them between two fires in case of need and so cutting off their retreat i should never have thought of such a project but i could not have expected bun to trust them as i did until he had been actually under fire with them that doubtless removed all his anxieties if he really had any this interview had occurred on the th of june shaw and his regiment had very soon been ordered to georgia then to morris island fort wagner had been assaulted and he had been killed most of the men knew about the circumstances of his death and many of them had subscribed towards a monument for hima project which originated with general saxton and which was finally embodied in the shaw schoolhouse at charleston so it gave us all pleasure to name this camp for him as its predecessor had been named for general saxton the new camp was soon brought into good order the men had great ingenuity in building screens and shelters of light poles filled in with the gray moss from the liveoaks the officers had vestibules built in this way before all their tents the cookingplaces were walled round in the same fashion and some of the wide companystreets had sheltered sidewalks down the whole line of tents the sergeant on duty at the entrance of the camp had a similar bower and the architecture culminated in a praisehouse for school and prayermeetings some thirty feet in diameter as for chimneys and flooring they were provided with that magic and invisible facility which marks the second year of a regiments life that officer is happy who besides a constitutional love of adventure has also a love for the details of camp life and likes to bring them to perfection nothing but a hen with her chickens about her can symbolize the content i felt on getting my scattered companies together after some temporary separation on picket or fatigue duty then we went to work upon the nest the only way to keep a camp in order is to set about everything as if you expected to stay there forever if you stay you get the comfort of it if ordered away in twentyfour hours you forget all wasted labor in the excitement of departure thus viewed a camp is a sort of model farm or bit of landscape gardening there is always some small improvement to be made a trench a well more shade against the sun an increased vigilance in sweeping then it is pleasant to take care of the men to see them happy to hear them purr then the duties of inspection and drill suspended during active service resume their importance with a month or two of quiet it really costs unceasing labor to keep a regiment in perfect condition and ready for service the work is made up of minute and endless details like a birds pruning her feathers or a cats licking her kittens into their proper toilet here are eight hundred men every one of whom every sunday morning at farthest must be perfectly soigne in all personal proprieties he must exhibit himself provided with every article of clothing buttons shoestrings hooks and eyes company letter regimental number rifle bayonet bayonetscabbard cappouch cartridgebox cartridgebox belt cartridgebox beltplate gunsling canteen haversack knapsack packed according to rule forty cartridges forty percussion caps and every one of these articles polished to the highest brightness or blackness as the case may be and moreover hung or slung or tied or carried in precisely the correct manner what a vast and formidable housekeeping is here my patriotic sisters consider too that every corner of the camp is to be kept absolutely clean and ready for exhibition at the shortest notice hospital stables guardhouse cookhouses company tents must all be brought to perfection and every square inch of this farm of four acres must look as smooth as an english lawn twice a day all this beside the discipline and the drill and the regimental and company books which must keep rigid account of all these details consider all this and then wonder no more that officers and men rejoice in being ordered on active service where a few strokes of the pen will dispose of all this multiplicity of trappings as expended in action or lost in service for one the longer i remained in service the better i appreciated the good sense of most of the regular army niceties true these things must all vanish when the time of action comes but it is these things that have prepared you for action of course if you dwell on them only military life becomes millinery life alone kinglake says that the russian grandduke constantine contemplating his beautiful toyregiments said that he dreaded war for he knew that it would spoil the troops the simple fact is that a soldier is like the weapon he carries service implies soiling but you must have it clean in advance that when soiled it may be of some use the men had that year a christmas present which they enjoyed to the utmostfurnishing the detail every other day for provostguard duty in beaufort it was the only military service which they had ever shared within the town and it moreover gave a sense of selfrespect to be keeping the peace of their own streets i enjoyed seeing them put on duty those mornings there was such a twinkle of delight in their eyes though their features were immovable as the reliefs went round posting the guard under charge of a corporal one could watch the black sentinels successively dropped and the whites picked upgradually changing the complexion like lord somebodys black stockings which became white stockingstill at last there was only a squad of white soldiers obeying the support arms forward march of a black corporal then when once posted they glorified their office you may be sure discipline had grown rather freeandeasy in the town about that time and it is said that the guardhouse never was so full within human memory as after their first tour of duty i remember hearing that one young reprobate son of a leading northern philanthropist in those parts was much aggrieved at being taken to the lockup merely because he was found drunk in the streets why said he the whitecorporals always showed me the way home and i can testify that after an evening party some weeks later i beard with pleasure the officers asking eagerly for the countersign who has the countersign said they the darkeys are on guard tonight and we must look out for our lives even after a christmas party at general saxtons the guard at the door very properly refused to let the ambulance be brought round from the stable for the ladies because the driver had not the countersign one of the sergeants of the guard on one of these occasions made to one who questioned his authority an answer that could hardly have been improved the questioner had just been arrested for some offence know what dat mean said the indignant sergeant pointing to the chevrons on his own sleeve dat mean guvment volumes could not have said more and the victim collapsed the thing soon settled itself and nobody remembered to notice whether the face beside the musket of a sentinel were white or black it meant government all the same the men were also indulged with several raids on the mainland under the direction of captain j e bryant of the eighth maine the most experienced scout in that region who was endeavoring to raise by enlistment a regiment of colored troops on one occasion captains whitney and heasley with their companies penetrated nearly to pocataligo capturing some pickets and bringing away all the slaves of a plantationthe latter operation being entirely under the charge of sergeant harry williams co k without the presence of any white man the whole command was attacked on the return by a rebel force which turned out to be what was called in those regions a dogcompany consisting of mounted riflemen with half a dozen trained bloodhounds the men met these dogs with their bayonets killed four or five of their old tormentors with great relish and brought away the carcass of one i had the creature skinned and sent the skin to new york to be stuffed and mounted meaning to exhibit it at the sanitary commission fair hi boston but it spoiled on the passage these quadruped allies were not originally intended as dogs of war but simply to detect fugitive slaves and the men were delighted at this confirmation of their tales of dogcompanies which some of the officers had always disbelieved captain bryant during his scouting adventures had learned to outwit these bloodhounds and used his skill in eluding escape during another expedition of the same kind he was sent with captain metcalfs company far up the combahee river to cut the telegraphic wires and intercept despatches our adventurous chaplain and a telegraphic operator went with the party they ascended the river cut the wires and read the despatches for an hour or two unfortunately the attached wire was too conspicuously hung and was seen by a passenger on the railway train in passing the train was stopped and a swift stampede followed a squad of cavalry was sent in pursuit and our chaplain with lieutenant osborn of bryants projected regiment were captured also one privatethe first of our men who had ever been taken prisoners in spite of an agreement at washington to the contrary our chaplain was held as prisoner of war the only spiritual adviser in uniform so far as i know who had that honor i do not know but his reverence would have agreed with scotts piratelieutenant that it was better to live as plain jack bunce than die as frederick altamont but i am very sure that he would rather have been kept prisoner to the close of the war as a combatant than have been released on parole as a nonresistant after his return i remember he gave the most animated accounts of the whole adventure of which he had enjoyed every instant from the first entrance on the enemys soil to the final capture i suppose we should all like to tap the telegraphic wires anywhere and read our neighbors messages if we could only throw round this process the dignity of a sacred cause this was what our good chaplain had done with the same conscientious zest with which he had conducted his sunday foraging in florida but he told me that nothing so impressed him on the whole trip as the sudden transformation in the black soldier who was taken prisoner with him the chaplain at once adopted the policy natural to him of talking boldly and even defiantly to his captors and commanding instead of beseeching he pursued the same policy always and gained by it he thought but the negro adopted the diametrically opposite policy also congenial to his crushed race all the force seemed to go out of him and he surrendered himself like a tortoise to be kicked and trodden upon at their will this manly welltrained soldier at once became a slave again asked no questions and if any were asked made meek and conciliatory answers he did not know nor did any of us know whether he would be treated as a prisoner of war or shot or sent to a riceplantation he simply acted according to the traditions of his race as did the chaplain on his side in the end the soldiers cunning was vindicated by the result he escaped and rejoined us in six months while the chaplain was imprisoned for a year the men came back very much exhausted from this expedition and those who were in the chaplains squad narrowly escaped with their lives one brave fellow had actually not a morsel to eat for four days and then could keep nothing on his stomach for two days more so that his life was despaired of and yet he brought all his equipments safe into camp some of these men had led such wandering lives in woods and swamps that to hunt them was like hunting an otter shyness and concealment had grown to be their second nature after these little episodes came two months of peace we were clean comfortable quiet and consequently discontented it was therefore with eagerness that we listened to a rumor of a new florida expedition in which we might possibly take a hand chapter florida again let me revert once more to my diary for a specimen of the sharp changes and sudden disappointments that may come to troops in service but for a case or two of varioloid in the regiment we should have taken part in the battle of olustee and should have had as was reported the right of the line at any rate we should have shared the hard knocks and the glory which were distributed pretty freely to the colored troops then and there the diary will give better than can any continuous narrative our ups and down of expectation in those days camp shaw beaufort s c february great are the uncertainties of military orders since our recall from jacksonville we have had no such surprises as came to us on wednesday night it was our third day of a new tour of duty at the picket station we had just got nicely settled men well tented with good floors and in high spirits officers at outstations all happy mrs coming to stay with her husband we at headquarters just in order house cleaned mossgarlands up camellias and jessamines in the tin washbasins baby in blissour usual run of visitors had just set in two beaufort captains and a surgeon had just risen from a late dinner after a flag of truce general saxton and his wife had driven away but an hour or two before we were all sitting about busy with a great fire blazing mrs d had just remarked triumphantly last time i had but a mouthful here and now i shall be here three weekswhen in dropped like a bombshell a despatch announcing that we were to be relieved by the eighth maine the next morning as general gillmore had sent an order that we should be ready for departure from beaufort at any moment conjectures orders packing sending couriers to outstations were the employments of the evening the men received the news with cheers and we all came in next morning february for three days we have watched the river and every little steamboat that comes up for coal brings out spyglasses and conjectures and dars de fourf new hampshirefor when that comes it is said we go meanwhile we hear stirring news from florida and the men are very impatient to be off it is remarkable how much more thoroughly they look at things as soldiers than last year and how much less as homebound menthe southcarolinians i mean for of course the floridians would naturally wish to go to florida but in every way i see the gradual change in them sometimes with a sigh as parents watch their children growing up and miss the droll speeches and the confiding ignorance of childhood sometimes it comes over me with a pang that they are growing more like white menless naive and less grotesque still i think there is enough of it to last and that their joyous buoyancy at least will hold out while life does as for our destination our greatest fear is of finding ourselves posted at hilton head and going no farther as a dashing irish officer remarked the other day if we are ordered away anywhere i hope it will be either to go to florida or else stay here sublime uncertainties again after being ordered in from picket under marching orders after the subsequent ten days of uncertainty after watching every steamboat that came up the river to see if the fourth new hampshire was on boardat last the regiment came then followed another break there was no transportation to take us at last a boat was notified then general saxton as anxious to keep us as was the regiment to go played his last card in smallpox telegraphing to department headquarters that we had it dangerously in the regiment n b all varioloid light at that and besides we always have it then the order came to leave behind the sick and those who had been peculiarly exposed and embark the rest next day great was the jubilee the men were up i verily believe by three in the morning and by eight the whole camp was demolished or put in wagons and we were on our way the soldiers of the fourth new hampshire swarmed in every board was swept away by them there had been a time when colored boards if i may delicately so express myself were repudiated by white soldiers but that epoch had long since passed i gave my new tentframe even the latch to colonel bell ditto lieutenantcolonel to lieutenantcolonel down we marched the men singing john brown and marching along and gwine in de wilderness women in tears and smiles lined the way we halted opposite the dear generals we cheered he speeched i speeched we all embraced symbolically and cheered some more then we went to work at the wharf vast wagonloads of tents rationsordnance and whatnot disappeared in the capacious maw of the delaware in the midst of it all came riding down general saxton with a despatch from hilton head if you think the amount of smallpox in the first south carolina volunteers sufficient the order will be countermanded what shall i say quoth the guilty general perceiving how preposterously too late the negotiation was reopened say sir quoth i say that we are on board already and the smallpox left behind say we had only thirteen cases chiefly varioloid and ten almost well our blood was up with a tremendous mornings work done and rather than turn back we felt ready to hold down majorgeneral gillmore commanding department and all his staff upon the wharf and vaccinate them by main force so general saxton rode away and we worked away just as the last wagonload but one was being transferred to the omnivorous depths of the delawarewhich i should think would have been filled ten times over with what we had put into itdown rode the general with a fiendish joy in his bright eyes and held out a paperone of the familiar rescripts from headquarters the marching orders of the first south carolina volunteers are hereby countermanded major trowbridge said i will you give my compliments to lieutenant hooper somewhere in the hold of that steamer and direct him to set his men at work to bring out every individual article which they have carried hi and i sat down on a pile of boards you will return to your old campingground colonel said the general placidly now he added with serene satisfaction we will have some brigade drills brigade drills since mr pickwick with his heartless tomatosauce and warmingpans there had been nothing so aggravating as to try to solace us who were as good as on board ship and under waynay in imagination as far up the st johns as pilatka at leastwith brigade drills it was very kind and flattering in him to wish to keep us but unhappily we had made up our minds to go never did officer ride at the head of a battalion of more wobegone spiritless wretches than i led back from beaufort that day when i march down to de landin said one of the men afterwards my knapsack full of feathers comin back he lead and the lead instead of the feathers rested on the heart of every one as if the disappointment itself were not sufficient we had to return to our pretty camp accustomed to its drawingroom order and find it a desert every board gone from the floors the screens torn down from the poles all the little conveniences scattered and to crown all a cold breeze such as we had not known since newyears day blowing across the camp and flooding everything with dust i sincerely hope the regiment would never behave after a defeat as they behaved then every man seemed crushed officers and soldiers alike when they broke ranks they went and lay down like sheep where their tents used to be or wandered disconsolately about looking for their stray belongings the scene was so infinitely dolorous that it gradually put me in the highest spirits the ludicrousness of the whole affair was so complete there was nothing to do but laugh the horrible dust blew till every officer had some black spot on his nose which paralyzed pathos of course the only way was to set them all at work as soon as possible and work them we did i at the camp and the major at the wharfloading and unloading wagons and just reversing all which the morning had done the new hampshire men were very considerate and gave back most of what they had taken though many of our men were really too delicate or proud to ask or even take what they had once given to soldiers or to the colored people i had no such delicacy about my tentframe and by night things had resumed something of their old aspect and cheerfulness was in part restored yet long after this i found one first sergeant absolutely in tearsa florida man most of whose kindred were up the st johns it was very natural that the men from that region should feel thus bitterly but it shows how much of the habit of soldiers they have all acquired that the south carolina men who were leaving the neighborhood of their families for an indefinite time were just as eager to go and not one deserted though they knew it for a week beforehand no doubt my precarious health makes it now easier for me personally to remain hereeasier on reflection at leastthan for the others at the same time florida is fascinating and offers not only adventure but the command of a brigade certainly at the last moment there was not a sacrifice i would not have made rather than wrench myself and others away from the expedition we are of course thrown back into the old uncertainty and if the smallpox subsides and it is really diminishing decidedly we may yet come in at the wrong end of the florida affair february not a bit of it this morning the general has ridden up radiant has seen general gillmore who has decided not to order us to florida at all nor withdraw any of this garrison moreover he says that all which is intended in florida is done that there will be no advance to tallahassee and general seymour will establish a camp of instruction in jacksonville well if that is all it is a lucky escapewe little dreamed that on that very day the march toward olustee was beginning the battle took place next day and i add one more extract to show how the news reached beaufort february there was the sound of revelry by night at a ball in beaufort last night in a new large building beautifully decorated all the collected flags of the garrison hung round and over us as if the stars and stripes were devised for an ornament alone the array of uniforms was such that a civilian became a distinguished object much more a lady all would have gone according to the proverbial marriagebell i suppose had there not been a slight palpable shadow over all of us from hearing vague stories of a lost battle in florida and from the thought that perhaps the very ambulances in which we rode to the ball were ours only until the wounded or the dead might tenant them general gillmore only came i supposed to put a good face upon the matter he went away soon and general saxton went then came a rumor that the cosmopolitan had actually arrived with wounded but still the dance went on there was nothing unfeeling about itone gets used to thingswhen suddenly in the midst of the lancers there came a perfect hush the music ceasing a few surgeons went hastily to and fro as if consciencestricken i should think they might have beenthen there waved a mighty shadow in as in uhlands black knight and as we all stood wondering we were ware of general saxton who strode hastily down the hall his pale face very resolute and looking almost sick with anxiety he had just been on board the steamer there were two hundred and fifty wounded men just arrived and the ball must end not that there was anything for us to do but the revel was mistimed and must be ended it was wicked to be dancing with such a scene of suffering near by of course the ball was instantly broken up though with some murmurings and some longings of appetite on the part of some toward the wasted supper later i went on board the boat among the long lines of wounded black and white intermingled there was the wonderful quiet which usually prevails on such occasions not a sob nor a groan except from those undergoing removal it is not selfcontrol but chiefly the shock to the system produced by severe wounds especially gunshot wounds and which usually keeps the patient stiller at first than any later time a company from my regiment waited on the wharf in their accustomed dusky silence and i longed to ask them what they thought of our florida disappointment now in view of what they saw did they still wish we had been there i confess that in presence of all that human suffering i could not wish it but i would not have suggested any such thought to them i found our kindhearted ladies mrs chamberlin and mrs dewhurst on board the steamer but there was nothing for them to do and we walked back to camp in the radiant moonlight mrs chamberlin more than ever strengthened in her blushing womans philosophy i dont care who wins the laurels provided we dont february but for a few trivial cases of varioloid we should certainly have been in that disastrous fight we were confidently expected for several days at jacksonville and the commanding general told colonel hallowell that we being the oldest colored regiment would have the right of the line this was certainly to miss danger and glory very closely chapter the negro as a soldier there was in our regiment a very young recruit named sam roberts of whom trowbridge used to tell this story early in the war trowbridge had been once sent to amelia island with a squad of men under direction of commodore goldsborough to remove the negroes from the island as the officers stood on the beach talking to some of the older freedmen they saw this urchin peeping at them from front and rear in a scrutinizing way for which his father at last called him to account as thus hi sammy what yous doin chile daddy said the inquisitive youth dont you know masr tell us yankee hab tail i dont see no tail daddy there were many who went to port royal during the war in civil or military positions whose previous impressions of the colored race were about as intelligent as sams view of themselves but for once i had always had so much to do with fugitive slaves and had studied the whole subject with such interest that i found not much to learn or unlearn as to this one point their courage i had before seen tested their docile and lovable qualities i had known and the only real surprise that experience brought me was in finding them so little demoralized i had not allowed for the extreme remoteness and seclusion of their lives especially among the sea islands many of them had literally spent their whole existence on some lonely island or remote plantation where the master never came and the overseer only once or twice a week with these exceptions such persons had never seen a white face and of the excitements or sins of larger communities they had not a conception my friend colonel hallowell of the fiftyfourth massachusetts told me that he had among his men some of the worst reprobates of northern cities while i had some men who were unprincipled and troublesome there was not one whom i could call a hardened villain i was constantly expecting to find male topsies with no notions of good and plenty of evil but i never found one among the most ignorant there was very often a childlike absence of vices which was rather to be classed as inexperience than as innocence but which had some of the advantages of both apart from this they were very much like other men general saxton examining with some impatience a long list of questions from some philanthropic commission at the north respecting the traits and habits of the freedmen bade some staffofficer answer them all in two wordsintensely human we all admitted that it was a striking and comprehensive description for instance as to courage so far as i have seen the mass of men are naturally courageous up to a certain point a man seldom runs away from danger which he ought to face unless others run each is apt to keep with the mass and colored soldiers have more than usual of this gregariousness in almost every regiment black or white there are a score or two of men who are naturally daring who really hunger after dangerous adventures and are happiest when allowed to seek them every commander gradually finds out who these men are and habitually uses them certainly i had such and i remember with delight their bearing their coolness and their dash some of them were negroes some mulattoes one of them would have passed for white with brown hair and blue eyes while others were so black you could hardly see their features these picked men varied in other respects too some were neat and welldrilled soldiers while others were slovenly heedless fellowsthe despair of their officers at inspection their pride on a raid they were the natural scouts and rangers of the regiment they had the twooclockinthemorning courage which napoleon thought so rare the mass of the regiment rose to the same level under excitement and were more excitable i think than whites but neither more nor less courageous perhaps the best proof of a good average of courage among them was in the readiness they always showed for any special enterprise i do not remember ever to have had the slightest difficulty in obtaining volunteers but rather in keeping down the number the previous pages include many illustrations of this as well as of then endurance of pain and discomfort for instance one of my lieutenants a very daring irishman who had served for eight years as a sergeant of regular artillery in texas utah and south carolina said he had never been engaged in anything so risky as our raid up the st marys but in truth it seems to me a mere absurdity to deliberately argue the question of courage as applied to men among whom i waked and slept day and night for so many months together as well might he who has been wandering for years upon the desert with a bedouin escort discuss the courage of the men whose tents have been his shelter and whose spears his guard we their officers did not go there to teach lessons but to receive them there were more than a hundred men in the ranks who had voluntarily met more dangers in their escape from slavery than any of my young captains had incurred in all their lives there was a family named wilson i remember of which we had several representatives three or four brothers had planned an escape from the interior to our lines they finally decided that the youngest should stay and take care of the old mother the rest with their sister and her children came in a dugout down one of the rivers they were fired upon again and again by the pickets along the banks until finally every man on board was wounded and still they got safely through when the bullets began to fly about them the woman shed tears and her little girl of nine said to her dont cry mother jesus will help you and then the child began praying as the wounded men still urged the boat along this themother told me but i had previously heard it from on officer who was on the gunboat that picked them upa big rough man whose voice fairly broke as he described their appearance he said that the mother and child had been hid for nine months in the woods before attempting their escape and the child would speak to no oneindeed she hardly would when she came to our camp she was almost white and this officer wished to adopt her but the mother said i would do anything but that for oonah this being a sort of indian formation of the secondpersonplural such as they sometimes use this same officer afterwards saw a reward offered for this family in a savannah paper i used to think that i should not care to read uncle toms cabin hi our camp it would have seemed tame any group of men in a tent would have had more exciting tales to tell i needed no fiction when i had fanny wright for instance daily passing to and fro before my tent with her shy little girl clinging to her skirts fanny was a modest little mulatto woman a soldiers wife and a company laundress she had escaped from the mainland in a boat with that child and another her baby was shot dead in her arms and she reached our lines with one child safe on earth and the other in heaven i never found it needful to give any elementary instructions in courage to fannys husband you may be sure there was another family of brothers in the regiment named miller their grandmother a finelooking old woman nearly seventy i should think but erect as a pinetree used sometimes to come and visit them she and her husband had once tried to escape from a plantation near savannah they had failed and had been brought back the husband had received five hundred lashes and while the white men on the plantation were viewing the punishment she was collecting her children and grandchildren to the number of twentytwo in a neighboring marsh preparatory to another attempt that night they found a flatboat which had been rejected as unseaworthy got on boardstill under the old womans ordersand drifted forty miles down the river to our lines trowbridge happened to be on board the gunboat which picked them up and he said that when the flat touched the side of the vessel the grandmother rose to her full height with her youngest grandchild in her arms and said only my god are we free by one of those coincidences of which life is full her husband escaped also after his punishment and was taken up by the same gunboat i hardly need point out that my young lieutenants did not have to teach the principles of courage to this womans grandchildren i often asked myself why it was that with this capacity of daring and endurance they had not kept the land in a perpetual flame of insurrection why especially since the opening of the war they had kept so still the answer was to be found in the peculiar temperament of the races in their religious faith and in the habit of patience that centuries had fortified the shrewder men all said substantially the same thing what was the use of insurrection where everything was against them they had no knowledge no money no arms no drill no organizationabove all no mutual confidence it was the tradition among them that all insurrections were always betrayed by somebody they had no mountain passes to defend like the maroons of jamaicano unpenetrable swamps like the maroons of surinam where they had these even on a small scale they had used themas in certain swamps round savannah and in the everglades of florida where they united with the indians and would stand fireso i was told by general saxton who had fought them there when the indians would retreat it always seemed to me that had i been a slave my life would have been one long scheme of insurrection but i learned to respect the patient selfcontrol of those who had waited till the course of events should open a better way when it came they accepted it insurrection on their part would at once have divided the northern sentiment and a large part of our army would have joined with the southern army to hunt them down by their waiting till we needed them their freedom was secured two things chiefly surprised me in their feeling toward their former mastersthe absence of affection and the absence of revenge i expected to find a good deal of the patriarchal feeling it always seemed to me a very illapplied emotion as connected with the facts and laws of american slaverystill i expected to find it i suppose that my men and their families and visitors may have had as much of it as the mass of freed slaves but certainly they had not a particle i never could cajole one of them in his most discontented moment into regretting ole masr time for a single instant i never heard one speak of the masters except as natural enemies yet they were perfectly discriminating as to individuals many of them claimed to have had kind owners and some expressed great gratitude to them for particular favors received it was not the individuals but the ownership of which they complained that they saw to be a wrong which no special kindnesses could right on this as on all points connected with slavery they understood the matter as clearly as garrison or phillips the wisest philosophy could teach them nothing as to that nor could any false philosophy befog them after all personal experience is the best logician certainly this indifference did not proceed from any want of personal affection for they were the most affectionate people among whom i had ever lived they attached themselves to every officer who deserved love and to some who did not and if they failed to show it to their masters it proved the wrongfulness of the mastery on the other hand they rarely showed one gleam of revenge and i shall never forget the selfcontrol with which one of our best sergeants pointed out to me at jacksonville the very place where one of his brothers had been hanged by the whites for leading a party of fugitive slaves he spoke of it as a historic matter without any bearing on the present issue but side by side with this faculty of patience there was a certain tropical element in the men a sort of fiery ecstasy whenaroused which seemed to link them by blood with the french turcos and made them really resemble their natural enemies the celts far more than the anglosaxon temperament to balance this there were great individual resources when alonea sort of indian wiliness and subtlety of resource their gregariousness and love of drill made them more easy to keep in hand than white american troops who rather like to straggle or go in little squads looking out for themselves without being bothered with officers the blacks prefer organization the point of inferiority that i always feared though i never had occasion to prove it was that they might show less fibre less tough and dogged resistance than whites during a prolonged triala long disastrous march for instance or the hopeless defence of a besieged town i should not be afraid of their mutinying or running away but of their drooping and dying it might not turn out so but i mention it for the sake of fairness and to avoid overstating the merits of these troops as to the simple general fact of courage and reliability i think no officer in our camp ever thought of there being any difference between black and white and certainly the opinions of these officers who for years risked their lives every moment on the fidelity of their men were worth more than those of all the world beside no doubt there were reasons why this particular war was an especially favorable test of the colored soldiers they had more to fight for than the whites besides the flag and the union they had home and wife and child they fought with ropes round their necks and when orders were issued that the officers of colored troops should be put to death on capture they took a grim satisfaction it helped their esprit de corps immensely with us at least there was to be no playsoldier though they had begun with a slight feeling of inferiority to the white troops this compliment substituted a peculiar sense of selfrespect and even when the new colored regiments began to arrive from the north my men still pointed out this differencethat in case of ultimate defeat the northern troops black or white would go home while the first south carolina must fight it out or be reenslaved this was one thing that made the st johns river so attractive to them and even to meit was so much nearer the everglades i used seriously to ponder during the darker periods of the war whether i might not end my days as an outlawa leader of maroons meanwhile i used to try to make some capital for the northern troops in their estimate by pointing out that it was a disinterested thing in these men from the free states to come down there and fight that the slaves might be free but they were apt keenly to reply that many of the white soldiers disavowed this object and said that that was not the object of the war nor even likely to be its end some of them even repeated mr sewards unfortunate words to mr adams which some general had been heard to quote so on the whole i took nothing by the motion as was apt to be the case with those who spoke a good word for our government in those vacillating and half proslavery days at any rate this ungenerous discouragement had this good effect that it touched their pride they would deserve justice even if they did not obtain it this pride was afterwards severely tested during the disgraceful period when the party of repudiation in congress temporarily deprived them of their promised pay in my regiment the men never mutinied nor even threatened mutiny they seemed to make it a matter of honor to do then part even if the government proved a defaulter but one third of them including the best men in the regiment quietly refused to take a dollars pay at the reduced price wese gib our sogerin to de guvment gunnel they said but we wont spise ourselves so much for take de seben dollar they even made a contemptuous ballad of which i once caught a snatch ten dollar a month tree ob dat for clothinl go to washington fight for linkums darter this lincolns daughter stood for the goddess of liberty it would seem they would be true to her but they would not take the halfpay this was contrary to my advice and to that of other officers but i now think it was wise nothing less than this would have called the attention of the american people to this outrageous fraud see appendix the same slow forecast had often marked their action in other ways one of our ablest sergeants henry mclntyre who had earned two dollars and a half per day as a mastercarpenter in florida and paid one dollar and a half to his master told me that he had deliberately refrained from learning to read because that knowledge exposed the slaves to so much more watching and suspicion this man and a few others had built on contract the greater part of the town of micanopy in florida and was a thriving man when his accustomed discretion failed for once and he lost all he named his child william lincoln and it brought upon him such suspicion that he had to make his escape i cannot conceive what people at the north mean by speaking of the negroes as a bestial or brutal race except in some insensibility to animal pain i never knew of an act in my regiment which i should call brutal in reading kays condition of the english peasantry i was constantly struck with the unlikeness of my men to those therein described this could not proceed from my prejudices as an abolitionist for they would have led me the other way and indeed i had once written a little essay to show the brutalizing influences of slavery i learned to think that we abolitionists had underrated the suffering produced by slavery among the negroes but had overrated the demoralization or rather we did not know how the religious temperament of the negroes had checked the demoralization yet again it must be admitted that this temperament born of sorrow and oppression is far more marked in the slave than in the native africantheorize as we may there was certainly in our camp an average tone of propriety which all visitors noticed and which was not created but only preserved by discipline i was always struck not merely by the courtesy of the men but also by a certain sober decency of language if a man had to report to me any disagreeable fact for instance he was sure to do it with gravity and decorum and not blurt it out in an offensive way and it certainly was a significant fact that the ladies of our camp when we were so fortunate as to have such guests the young wives especially of the adjutant and quartermaster used to go among the tents when the men were off duty in order to hear their big pupils read and spell without the slightest fear of annoyance i do not mean direct annoyance or insult for no man who valued his life would have ventured that in presence of the others but i mean the annoyance of accidentally seeing or hearing improprieties not intended for them they both declared that they would not have moved about with anything like the same freedom in any white camp they had ever entered and it always roused their indignation to hear the negro race called brutal or depraved this came partly from natural good manners partly from the habit of deference partly from ignorance of the refined and ingenious evil which is learned in large towns but a large part came from their strongly religious temperament their comparative freedom from swearing for instancean abstinence which i fear military life did not strengthenwas partly a matter of principle once i heard one of them say to another in a transport of indignation haaa boy spose i no be a christian i cuss you solwhich was certainly drawing pretty hard upon the bridle cuss however was a generic term for all manner of evil speaking they would say he cuss me fool or he cuss me coward as if the essence of propriety were in harsh and angry speechwhich i take to be good ethics but certainly if uncle toby could have recruited his army in flanders from our ranks their swearing would have ceased to be historic it used to seem to me that never since cromwells time had there been soldiers in whom the religious element held such a place a religious army a gospel army were their frequent phrases in their prayermeetings there was always a mingling often quaint enough of the warlike and the pious if each one of us was a praying man said corporal thomas long in a sermon it appears to me that we could fight as well with prayers as with bulletsfor the lord has said that if you have faith even as a grain of mustardseed cut into four parts you can say to the sycamoretree arise and it will come up and though corporal long may have got a little perplexed in his botany his faith proved itself by works for he volunteered and went many miles on a solitary scouting expedition into the enemys country in florida and got back safe after i had given him up for lost the extremes of religious enthusiasm i did not venture to encourage for i could not do it honestly neither did i discourage them but simply treated them with respect and let them have their way so long as they did not interfere with discipline in general they promoted it the mischievous little drummerboys whose scrapes and quarrels were the torment of my existence might be seen kneeling together in their tents to say their prayers at night and i could hope that their slumbers were blessed by some spirit of peace such as certainly did not rule over their waking the most reckless and daring fellows in the regiment were perfect fatalists in theur confidence that god would watch over them and that if they died it would be because theur time had come this almost excessive faith and the love of freedom and of their families all cooperated with their pride as soldiers to make them do their duty i could not have spared any of these incentives those of our officers who were personally the least influenced by such considerations still saw the need of encouraging them among the men i am bound to say that this strongly devotional turn was not always accompanied by the practical virtues but neither was it strikingly divorced from them a few men i remember who belonged to the ancient order of hypocrites but not many old jim cushman was our favorite representative scamp he used to vex his righteous soul over the admission of the unregenerate to prayermeetings and went off once shaking his head and muttering too much goat shout wid de sheep but he who objected to this profane admixture used to get our messfunds far more hopelessly mixed with his own when he went out to buy chickens and i remember that on being asked by our major in that semiethiopian dialect into which we sometimes slid how much wife you got jim the veteran replied with a sort of penitence for lost opportunities ony but four sah another man of somewhat similar quality went among us by the name of henry ward beecher from a remarkable resemblance in face and figure to that sturdy divine i always felt a sort of admiration for this worthy because of the thoroughness with which he outwitted me and the sublime impudence in which he culminated he got a series of passes from me every week or two to go and see his wife on a neighboring plantation and finally when this resource seemed exhausted he came boldly for one more pass that he might go and be married we used to quote him a good deal also as a sample of a certain shakespearian boldness of personification in which the men sometimes indulged once i remember his captain had given him a fowlingpiece to clean henry ward had left it in the captains tent and the latter finding it had transferred the job to some one else then came a confession in this precise form with many dignified gesticulations cappen i took dat gun and i put bun in cappen tent den i look and de gun not dar den conscience say cappen mus hab gib dat gun to somebody else for clean den i say conscience you reason correck compare lancelot gobbos soliloquy in the two gentlemen of veronastill i maintain that as a whole the men were remarkably free from inconvenient vices there was no more lying and stealing than in average white regiments the surgeon was not much troubled by shamming sickness and there were not a great many complaints of theft there was less quarrelling than among white soldiers and scarcely ever an instance of drunkenness perhaps the influence of their officers had something to do with this for not a ration of whiskey was ever issued to the men nor did i ever touch it while in the army nor approve a requisition for any of the officers without which it could not easily be obtained in this respect our surgeons fortunately agreed with me and we never had reason to regret it i believe the use of ardent spirits to be as useless and injurious in the army as on board ship and among the colored troops especially who had never been accustomed to it i think that it did only harm the point of greatest laxity in their moral habitsthe want of a high standard of chastitywas not one which affected their camp life to any great extent and it therefore came less under my observation but i found to my relief that whatever their deficiency in this respect it was modified by the general quality of their temperament and indicated rather a softening and relaxation than a hardening and brutalizing of their moral natures any insult or violence in this direction was a thing unknown i never heard of an instance it was not uncommon for men to have two or three wives in different plantationsthe second or remoter partner being called a broad wifeie wife abroad but the whole tendency was toward marriage and this state of things was only regarded as a bequest from masr time i knew a great deal about their marriages for they often consulted me and took my counsel as lovers are wont to do that is when it pleased their fancy sometimes they would consult their captains first and then come to me in despairing appeal capn scroby trowbridge he acvise me not for marry dis lady cause she hab seben chilen what for use capn scroby cant lub for me i mus lub for myself and i lub he i remember that on this occasion he stood by a most unattractive woman jet black with an old pink muslin dress torn white cotton gloves and a very flowery bonnet that must have descended through generations of tawdry mistresses i felt myself compelled to reaffirm the decision of the inferior court the result was as usual they were married the next day and i believe that she proved an excellent wife though she had seven children whose father was also in the regiment if she did not i know many others who did and certainly i have never seen more faithful or more happy marriages than among that people the question was often asked whether the southern slaves or the northern free blacks made the best soldiers it was a compliment to both classes that each officer usually preferred those whom he had personally commanded i preferred those who had been slaves for their greater docility and affectionateness for the powerful stimulus which their new freedom gave and for the fact that they were fighting in a manner for their own homes and firesides every one of these considerations afforded a special aid to discipline and cemented a peculiar tie of sympathy between them and their officers they seemed like clansmen and had a more confiding and filial relation to us than seemed to me to exist in the northern colored regiments so far as the mere habits of slavery went they were a poor preparation for military duty inexperienced officers often assumed that because these men had been slaves before enlistment they would bear to be treated as such afterwards experience proved the contrary the more strongly we marked the difference between the slave and the soldier the better for the regiment one half of military duty lies in obedience the other half in selfrespect a soldier without selfrespect is worthless consequently there were no regiments in which it was so important to observe the courtesies and proprieties of military life as in these i had to caution the officers to be more than usually particular in returning the salutations of the men to be very careful in their dealings with those on picket or guardduty and on no account to omit the titles of the noncommissioned officers so in dealing out punishments we had carefully to avoid all that was brutal and arbitrary all that savored of the overseer any such dealing found them as obstinate and contemptuous as was topsy when miss ophelia undertook to chastise her a system of light punishments rigidly administered according to the prescribed military forms had more weight with them than any amount of angry severity to make them feel as remote as possible from the plantation this was essential by adhering to this and constantly appealing to their pride as soldiers and their sense of duty we were able to maintain a high standard of disciplineso at least the inspecting officers said and to get rid almost entirely of the more degrading class of punishmentsstanding on barrels tying up by the thumbs and the ball and chain in all ways we had to educate their selfrespect for instance at first they disliked to obey their own noncommissioned officers i dont want him to play de white man ober me was a sincere objection they had been so impressed with a sense of inferiority that the distinction extended to the very principles of honor i aint got coloredman principles said corporal london simmons indignantly defending himself from some charge before me ise got whitegemman principles ise do my best if capn tell me to take a man spose de man be as big as a house ill clam hold on him till i die inception excepting im sick but it was plain that this feeling was a bequest of slavery which military life would wear off we impressed it upon them that they did not obey their officers because they were white but because they were their officers just as the captain must obey me and i the general that we were all subject to military law and protected by it in turn then we taught them to take pride in having good material for noncommissioned officers among themselves and in obeying them on my arrival there was one white first sergeant and it was a question whether to appoint others this i prevented but left thatone hoping the men themselves would at last petition for his removal which at length they did he was at once detailed on other duty the picturesqueness of the regiment suffered for he was very tall and fair and i liked to see him step forward in the centre when the line of first sergeants came together at dressparade but it was a help to discipline to eliminate the saxon for it recognized a principle afterwards i had excellent battaliondrills without a single white officer by way of experiment putting each company under a sergeant and going through the most difficult movements such as divisioncolumns and obliquesquares and as to actual discipline it is doing no injustice to the lineofficers of the regiment to say that none of them received from the men more implicit obedience than colorsergeant rivers i should have tried to obtain commissions for him and several others before i left the regiment had their literary education been sufficient and such an attempt was finally made by lieutenantcolonel trowbridge my successor in immediate command but it proved unsuccessful it always seemed to me an insult to those brave men to have novices put over their heads on the ground of color alone and the men felt it the more keenly as they remained longer in service there were more than seven hundred enlisted men in the regiment when mustered out after more than three years service the ranks had been kept full by enlistment but there were only fourteen lineofficers instead of the full thirty the men who should have filled those vacancies were doing duty as sergeants in the ranks in what respect were the colored troops a source of disappointment to me in one respect onlythat of health their health improved indeed as they grew more familiar with military life but i think that neither their physical nor moral temperament gave them that toughness that obstinate purpose of living which sustains the more materialistic anglosaxon they had not to be sure the same predominant diseases suffering in the pulmonary not in the digestive organs but they suffered a good deal they felt malaria less but they were more easily choked by dust and made ill by dampness on the other hand they submitted more readily to sanitary measures than whites and with efficient officers were more easily kept clean they were injured throughout the army by an undue share of fatigue duty which is not only exhausting but demoralizing to a soldier by the unsuitableness of the rations which gave them salt meat instead of rice and hominy and by the lack of good medical attendance their childlike constitutions peculiarly needed prompt and efficient surgical care but almost all the colored troops were enlisted late in the war when it was hard to get good surgeons for any regiments and especially for these in this respect i had nothing to complain of since there were no surgeons in the army for whom i would have exchanged my own and this late arrival on the scene affected not only the medical supervision of the colored troops but their opportunity for a career it is not my province to write their history nor to vindicate them nor to follow them upon those larger fields compared with which the adventures of my regiment appear but a partisan warfare yet this at least may be said the operations on the south atlantic coast which long seemed a merely subordinate and incidental part of the great contest proved to be one of the final pivots on which it turned all now admit that the fate of the confederacy was decided by shermans march to the sea port royal was the objective point to which he marched and he found the department of the south when he reached it held almost exclusively by colored troops next to the merit of those who made the march was that of those who held open the door that service will always remain among the laurels of the black regiments chapter conclusion my personal forebodings proved to be correct and so were the threats of the surgeons in may i went home invalided was compelled to resign in october from the same cause and never saw the first south carolina again nor did any one else see it under that appellation for about that time its name was changed to the thirtythird united states colored troops a most vague and heartless baptism as the man in the story says it was one of those instances of injudicious sacrifice of esprit de corps which were so frequent in our army all the pride of my men was centred in de fus souf the very words were a recognition of the loyal south as against the disloyal to make the matter worse it had been originally designed to apply the new numbering only to the new regiments and so the early numbers were all taken up before the older regiments came in the governors of states by especial effort saved their colored troops from this chagrin but we found here as more than once before the disadvantage of having no governor to stand by us its a far cry to loch awe said the highland proverb we knew to our cost that it was a far cry to washington in those days unless an officer left his duty and stayed there all the time in june the regiment was ordered to folly island and remained there and on coles island till the siege of charleston was done it took part in the battle of honey hill and in the capture of a fort on james island of which corporal robert vendross wrote triumphantly in a letter when we took the pieces we found that we recapt our own pieces back that we lost on willtown revear river and thank the lord did not lose but seven men out of our regiment in february the regiment was ordered to charleston to do provost and guard duty in march to savannah in june to hamburg and aiken in september to charleston and its neighborhood and was finally mustered out of serviceafter being detained beyond its three years so great was the scarcity of troopson the th of february with dramatic fitness this musterout took place at fort wagner above the graves of shaw and his men i give in the appendix the farewell address of lieutenantcolonel trowbridge who commanded the regiment from the time i left it brevet brigadiergeneral w t bennett of the one hundred and second united states colored troops who was assigned to the command never actually held it being always in charge of a brigade the officers and men are scattered far and wide one of our captains was a member of the south carolina constitutional convention and is now state treasurer three of our sergeants were in that convention including sergeant prince rivers and he and sergeant henry hayne are still members of the state legislature both in that state and hi florida the former members of the regiment are generally prospering so far as i can hear the increased selfrespect of army life fitted them to do the duties of civil life it is not in nature that the jealousy of race should die out in this generation but i trust they will not see the fulfilment of corporal simon crams prediction simon was one of the shrewdest old fellows in the regiment and he said to me once as he was jogging out of beaufort behind me on the shell road ise goin to leave de souf cunnel when de war is over ise made up my mind dat dese yere secesh will neber be cibilized in my time the only member of the regiment whom i have seen since leaving it is a young man cyrus wiggins who was brought off from the mainland in a dugout in broad day before the very eyes of the rebel pickets by captain james s rogers of my regiment it was one of the most daring acts i ever saw and as it happened under my own observation i was glad when the captain took home with him this captive of his bow and spear to be educated under his eye in massachusetts cyrus has done credit to his friends and will be satisfied with nothing short of a collegetraining at howard university i have letters from the men very quaint in handwriting and spelling but he is the only one whom i have seen some time i hope to revisit those scenes and shall feel no doubt like a bewildered rip van winkle who once wore uniform we who served with the black troops have this peculiar satisfaction that whatever dignity or sacredness the memories of the war may have to others they have more to us in that contest all the ordinary ties of patriotism were the same of course to us as to the rest they had no motives which we had not as they have now no memories which are not also ours but the peculiar privilege of associating with an outcast race of training it to defend its rights and to perform its duties this was our especial meed the vacillating policy of the government sometimes filled other officers with doubt and shame until the negro had justice they were but defending liberty with one hand and crushing it with the other from this inconsistency we were free whatever the government did we at least were working in the right direction if this was not recognized on our side of the lines we knew that it was admitted on the other fighting with ropes round our necks denied the ordinary courtesies of war till we ourselves compelled then concession we could at least turn this outlawry into a compliment we had touched the pivot of the war whether this vast and dusky mass should prove the weakness of the nation or its strength must depend in great measure we knew upon our efforts till the blacks were armed there was no guaranty of their freedom it was their demeanor under arms that shamed the nation into recognizing them as men appendix appendix a roster of officers first

that the first systematic attempt to organize colored troops during the war of the rebellion was the socalled hunter regiment the officer originally detailed to recruit for this purpose was sergeant c t trowbridge of the new york volunteer engineers col serrell his detail was dated may s o dept south enlistments came in very slowly and no wonder the white officers and soldiers were generally opposed to the experiment and filled the ears of the negroes with the same tales which had been told them by their mastersthat the yankees really meant to sell them to cuba and the like the mildest threats were that they would be made to work without pay which turned out to be the case and that they would be put in the front rank in every battle nobody could assure them that they and their families would be freed by the government if they fought for it since no such policy had been adopted nevertheless they gradually enlisted the most efficient recruiting officer being sergeant william bronson of company a in my regiment who always prided himself on this service and used to sign himself by the very original title no african foundations in commemoration of his deeds by patience and tact these obstacles would in time have been overcome but before long unfortunately some of general hunters staff became impatient and induced him to take the position that the blacks must enlist accordingly squads of soldiers were sent to seize all the ablebodied men on certain plantations and bring them to the camp the immediate consequence was a renewal of the old suspicion ending in a widespread belief that they were to be sent to cuba as their masters had predicted the ultimate result was a habit of distrust discontent and desertion that it was almost impossible to surmount all the men who knew anything about general hunter believed in him but they all knew that there were bad influences around him and that the government had repudiated his promises they had been kept four months in service and then had been dismissed without pay that having been the case why should not the government equally repudiate general saxtons promises or mine as a matter of fact the government did repudiate these pledges for years though we had its own written authority to give them but that matter needs an appendix by itself the hunter regiment remained in camp on hilton head island until the beginning of august kept constantly under drill but much demoralized by desertion it was then disbanded except one company that company under command of sergeant trowbridge then acting as captain but not commissioned was kept in service and was sent august to garrison st simons island on the coast of georgia on this island made famous by mrs kembles description there were then five hundred colored people and not a single white man the black soldiers were sent down on the ben de ford captain hallett on arriving trowbridge was at once informed by commodore goldsborough naval commander at that station that there was a party of rebel guerillas on the island and was asked whether he would trust his soldiers in pursuit of them trowbridge gladly assented and the commodore added if you should capture them it will be a great thing for you they accordingly went on shore and found that the colored men of the island had already undertaken the enterprise twentyfive of them had armed themselves under the command of one of their own number whose name was john brown the second in command was edward gould who was afterwards a corporal in my own regiment the rebel party retreated before these men and drew them into a swamp there was but one path and the negroes entered single file the rebels lay behind a great log and fired upon them john brown the leader fell dead within six feet of the log probably the first black man who fell under arms in the warseveral other were wounded and the band of raw recruits retreated as did also the rebels in the opposite direction this was the first armed encounter so far as i know between the rebels and their former slaves and it is worth noticing that the attempt was a spontaneous thing and not accompanied by any white man the men were not soldiers nor in uniform though some of them afterwards enlisted in trowbridges company the father of this john brown was afterwards a soldier in my regiment and after his discharge for old age was for a time my servant uncle york as we called him was as good a specimen of a saint as i have ever met and was quite the equal of mrs stowes uncle tom he was a finelooking old man with dignified and courtly manners and his gray head was a perfect benediction as he sat with us on the platform at our sunday meetings he fully believed to his dying day that the john brown song related to his son and to him only trowbridge after landing on the island hunted the rebels all day with his colored soldiers and a posse of sailors in one place he found by a creek a canoe with a tarkettle and a fire burning and it was afterwards discovered that at that very moment the guerillas were hid in a dense palmetto thicket near by and so eluded pursuit the rebel leader was one miles hazard who had a plantation on the island and the party escaped at last through the aid of his old slave henry who found them a boat one of my sergeants clarence kennon who had not then escaped from slavery was present when they reached the mainland and he described them as being tattered and dirty from head to foot after their efforts to escape their pursuers when the troops under my command occupied jacksonville fla in march of the following year we found at the railroadstation packed for departure a box of papers some of them valuable among them was a letter from this very hazard to some friend describing the perils of that adventure and saying if you wish to know hell before your time go to st simons and be hunted ten days by niggers i have heard trowbridge say that not one of his men flinched and they seemed to take delight in the pursuit though the weather was very hot and it was fearfully exhausting this was early in august and the company remained two months at st simons doing picket duty within hearing of the rebel drums though not another scout ever ventured on the island to their knowledge every saturday trowbridge summoned the island people to drill with his soldiers and they came in hordes men women and children in every imaginable garb to the number of one hundred and fifty or two hundred his own men were poorly clothed and hardly shod at all and as no new supply of uniform was provided they grew more and more ragged they got poor rations and no pay but they kept up their spirits every week or so some of them would go on scouting excursions to the mainland one scout used to go regularly to his old mothers hut and keep himself hid under her bed while she collected for him all the latest news of rebel movements this man never came back without bringing recruits with him at last the news came that majorgeneral mitchell had come to relieve general hunter and that brigadiergeneral saxton had gone north and trowbridge went to hilton head in some anxiety to see if he and his men were utterly forgotten he prepared a report showing the services and claims of his men and took it with him this was early in october the first person he met was brigadiergeneral saxton who informed him that he had authority to organize five thousand colored troops and that he trowbridge should be senior captain of the first regiment this was accordingly done and company a of the first south carolina could honestly claim to date its enlistment back to may although they never got pay for that period of their service and their date of muster was november is the above facts were written down from the narration of lieutenantcolonel trowbridge who may justly claim to have been the first white officer to recruit and command colored troops in this war he was constantly in command of them from may to february except the louisiana soldiers mentioned in the introductionof whom no detailed reports have i think been published my regiment was unquestionably the first mustered into the service of the united states the first company muster bearing date november and the others following in quick succession the second regiment in order of muster was the first kansas colored dating from january the first enlistment in the kansas regiment goes back to august while the earliest technical date of enlistment in my regiment was october although as was stated above one company really dated its organization back to may my muster as colonel dates back to november several months earlier than any other of which i am aware among colored regiments except that of colonel stafford first louisiana native guards september colonel williams of the first kansas colored was mustered as lieutenantcolonel on january as colonel march these dates i have with the other facts relating to the regiment from colonel r j hinton the first officer detailed to recruit it to sum up the above facts my late regiment had unquestioned priority in muster over all but the louisiana regiments it had priority over those in the actual organization and term of service of one company on the other hand the kansas regiment had the priority in average date of enlistment according to the musterrolls the first detachment of the second south carolina volunteers colonel montgomery went into camp at port royal island february numbering one hundred and twenty men i do not know the date of his muster it was somewhat delayed but was probably dated back to about that time recruiting for the fiftyfourth massachusetts colored began on february and the first squad went into camp at readville massachusetts on february numbering twentyfive men colonel shaws commission and probably his muster was dated april report of adjutantgeneral of massachusetts for pp these were the earliest colored regiments so far as i knowappendix c general saxtons instructions the following are the instructions under which my regiment was raised it will be seen how unequivocal were the provisions in respect to pay upon which so long and weary a contest was waged by our friends in congress before the fulfilment of the contract could be secured war department washington city d c

to cut down the pay of the colored troops is too long too complicated and too humiliating to be here narrated in the case of my regiment there stood on record the direct pledge of the war department to general saxton that their pay should be the same as that of whites so clear was this that our kind paymaster major w j wood of new jersey took upon himself the responsibility of paying the price agreed upon for five months till he was compelled by express orders to reduce it from thirteen dollars per month to ten dollars and from that to seven dollars the pay of quartermasters men and daylaborers at the same time the stoppages from the payrolls for the loss of all equipments and articles of clothing remained the same as for all other soldiers so that it placed the men in the most painful and humiliating condition many of them had families to provide for and between the actual distress the sense of wrong the taunts of those who had refused to enlist from the fear of being cheated and the doubt how much farther the cheat might be carried the poor fellows were goaded to the utmost in the third south carolina regiment sergeant william walker was shot by order of courtmarital for leading his company to stack arms before their captains tent on the avowed ground that they were released from duty by the refusal of the government to fulfill its share of the contract the fear of such tragedies spread a cloud of solicitude over every camp of colored soldiers for more than a year and the following series of letters will show through what wearisome labors the final triumph of justice was secured in these labors the chief credit must be given to my admirable adjutant lieutenant g w dewhurst in the matter of bounty justice is not yet obtained there is a discrimination against those colored soldiers who were slaves on april every officer who through indolence or benevolent design claimed on his musterrolls that all his men had been free on that day secured for them the bounty while every officer who like myself obeyed orders and told the truth in each case saw his men and their families suffer for it as i have done a bill to abolish this distinction was introduced by mr wilson at the last session but failed to pass the house it is hoped that next winter may remove this last vestige of the weary contest to show how persistently and for how long a period these claims had to be urged on congress i reprint such of my own printed letters on the subject as are now in my possession there are one or two of which i have no copies it was especially in the senate that it was so difficult to get justice done and our thanks will always be especially due to hon charles sumner and hon henry wilson for their advocacy of our simple rights the records of those sessions will show who advocated the fraud to the editor of the new york tribune sirno one can overstate the intense anxiety with which the officers of colored regiments in this department are awaiting action from congress in regard to arrears of pay of their men it is not a matter of dollars and cents only it is a question of common honestywhether the united states government has sufficient integrity for the fulfillment of an explicit business contract the public seems to suppose that all required justice will be done by the passage of a bill equalizing the pay of all soldiers for the future but so far as my own regiment is concerned this is but half the question my men have been nearly sixteen months in the service and for them the immediate issue is the question of arrears they understand the matter thoroughly if the public do not every one of them knows that he volunteered under an explicit written assurance from the war department that he should have the pay of a white soldier he knows that for five months the regiment received that pay after which it was cut down from the promised thirteen dollars per month to ten dollars for some reason to him inscrutable he does not know for i have not yet dared to tell the menthat the paymaster has been already reproved by the pay department for fulfilling even in part the pledges of the war department that at the next payment the ten dollars are to be further reduced to seven and that to crown the whole all the previous overpay is to be again deducted or stopped from the future wages thus leaving them a little more than a dollar a month for six months to come unless congress interfere yet so clear were the terms of the contract that mr solicitor whiting having examined the original instructions from the war department issued to brigadiergeneral saxton military governor admits to me under date of december that the faith of the government was thereby pledged to every officer and soldier enlisted under that call he goes on to express the generous confidence that the pledge will be honorably fulfilled i observe that every one at the north seems to feel the same confidence but that meanwhile the pledge is unfulfilled nothing is said in congress about fulfilling it i have not seen even a proposition in congress to pay the colored soldiers from date of enlistment the same pay with white soldiers and yet anything short of that is an unequivocal breach of contract so far as this regiment is concerned meanwhile the land sales are beginning and there is danger of every foot of land being sold from beneath my soldiers feet because they have not the petty sum which government first promised and then refused to paythe officers pay comes promptly and fully enough and this makes the position more embarrassing for how are we to explain to the men the mystery that government can afford us a hundred or two dollars a month and yet must keep back six of the poor thirteen which it promised them does it not naturally suggest the most cruel suspicions in regard to us and yet nothing but their childlike faith in their officers and in that incarnate soul of honor general saxton has sustained their faith or kept them patient thus far there is nothing mean or mercenary about these men in general convince them that the government actually needs their money and they would serve it barefooted and on halfrations and without a dollarfor a time but unfortunately they see white soldiers beside them whom they know to be in no way their superiors for any military service receiving hundreds of dollars for reenlisting for this impoverished government which can only pay seven dollars out of thirteen to its black regiments and they see on the other hand those colored men who refused to volunteer as soldiers and who have found more honest paymasters than the united states government now exulting in wellfilled pockets and able to buy the little homesteads the soldiers need and to turn the soldiers families into the streets is this a school for selfsacrificing patriotism i should not speak thus urgently were it not becoming manifest that there is to be no promptness of action in congress even as regards the future pay of colored soldiersand that there is especial danger of the whole matter of arrears going by default should it be so it will be a repudiation more ungenerous than any which jefferson davis advocated or sydney smith denounced it will sully with dishonor all the nobleness of this opening page of history and fix upon the north a brand of meanness worse than either southerner or englishman has yet dared to impute the mere delay in the fulfillment of this contract has already inflicted untold suffering has impaired discipline has relaxed loyalty and has begun to implant a feeling of sullen distrust in the very regiments whose early career solved the problem of the nation created a new army and made peaceful emancipation possible t w higginson colonel commanding st s c vols beaufort s c january headquarters first south carolina volunteers beaufort s c sunday february to the editor of the new york times may i venture to call your attention to the great and cruel injustice which is impending over the brave men of this regiment they have been in military service for over a year having volunteered every man without a cent of bounty on the written pledge of the war department that they should receive the same pay and rations with white soldiers this pledge is contained in the written instructions of brigadiergeneral saxton military governor dated august mr solicitor whiting having examined those instructions admits to me that the faith of the government was thereby pledged to every officer and soldier under that call surely if this fact were understood every man in the nation would see that the government is degraded by using for a year the services of the brave soldiers and then repudiating the contract under which they were enlisted this is what will be done should mr wilsons bill legalizing the back pay of the army be defeated we presume too much on the supposed ignorance of these men i have never yet found a man in my regiment so stupid as not to know when he was cheated if fraud proceeds from government itself so much the worse for this strikes at the foundation of all rectitude all honor all obligation mr senator fessenden said in the debate on mr wilsons bill january that the government was not bound by the unauthorized promises of irresponsible recruiting officers but is the government itself an irresponsible recruiting officer and if men have volunteered in good faith on the written assurances of the secretary of war is not congress bound in all decency either to fulfill those pledges or to disband the regiments mr senator doolittle argued in the same debate that white soldiers should receive higher pay than black ones because the families of the latter were often supported by government what an astounding statement of fact is this in the white regiment in which i was formerly an officer the massachusetts fiftyfirst nine tenths of the soldiers families in addition to the pay and bounties drew regularly their state aid among my black soldiers with halfpay and no bounty not a family receives any aid is there to be no limit no end to the injustice we heap upon this unfortunate people cannot even the fact of their being in arms for the nation liable to die any day in its defence secure them ordinary justice is the nation so poor and so utterly demoralized by its pauperism that after it has had the lives of these men it must turn round to filch six dollars of the monthly pay which the secretary of war promised to their widows it is even so if the excuses of mr fressenden and mr doolittle are to be accepted by congress and by the people very respectfully your obedient servant t w higginson colonel commanding st s c

were the one hundred and third new york white the thirtythird united states formerly first south carolina volunteers and the fiftyfifth massachusetts the two last being colored they marched at one a m by the flank in the above order hoping to surprise the battery as usual the rebels were prepared for them and opened upon them as they were deep in one of those almost impassable southern marshes the one hundred and third new york which had previously been in twenty battles was thrown into confusion the thirtythird united states did better being behind the fiftyfifth massachusetts being in the rear did better still all three formed in line when colonel hartwell commanding the brigade gave the order to retreat the officer commanding the fiftyfifth massachusetts either misunderstanding the order or hearing it countermanded ordered his regiment to charge this order was at once repeated by major trowbridge commanding the thirtythird united states and by the commander of the one hundred and third new york so that the three regiments reached the fort in reversed order the colorbearers of the thirtythird united states and of the fiftyfifth massachusetts had a race to be first in the latter winning the one hundred and third new york entered the battery immediately after these colored regiments are two of the five which were enlisted in south carolina and massachusetts under the written pledge of the war department that they should have the same pay and allowances as white soldiers that pledge has been deliberately broken by the war department or by congress or by both except as to the short period since last newyears day every one of those killed in this action from these two colored regiments under a fire before which the veterans of twenty battles recoiled died defrauded by the government of nearly one half his petty pay mr fessenden who defeated in the senate the bill for the fulfillment of the contract with these soldiers is now secretary of the treasury was the economy of saving six dollars per man worth to the treasury the ignominy of the repudiation mr stevens of pennsylvania on his triumphal return to his constituents used to them this language he had no doubt whatever as to the final result of the present contest between liberty and slavery the only doubt he had was whether the nation had yet been satisfactorily chastised for their cruel oppression of a harmless and longsuffering race inasmuch as it was mr stevens himself who induced the house of representatives most unexpectedly to all to defeat the senate bill for the fulfillment of the national contract with these soldiers i should think he had excellent reasons for the doubt very respectfully t w higginson colonel st s c vols now d u s july to the editor of the new york tribune no one can possibly be so weary of reading of the wrongs done by government toward the colored soldiers as am i of writing about them this is my only excuse for intruding on your columns again by an order of the war department dated august it is at length ruled that colored soldiers shall be paid the full pay of soldiers from date of enlistment provided they were free on april not otherwise and this distinction is to be noted on the payrolls in other words if one half of a company escaped from slavery on april they are to be paid thirteen dollars per month and allowed three dollars and a half per month for clothing if the other half were delayed two days they receive seven dollars per month and are allowed three dollars per month for precisely the same articles of clothing if one of the former class is made first sergeant us pay is put up to twentyone dollars per month but if he escaped two days later his pay is still estimated at seven dollars it had not occurred to me that anything could make the payrolls of these regiments more complicated than at present or the men more rationally discontented i had not the ingenuity to imagine such an order yet it is no doubt in accordance with the spirit if not with the letter of the final bill which was adopted by congress under the lead of mr thaddeus stevens the ground taken by mr stevens apparently was that the country might honorably save a few dollars by docking the promised pay of those colored soldiers whom the war had made free but the government should have thought of this before it made the contract with these men and received their services when the war department instructed brigadiergeneral saxton august to raise five regiments of negroes in south carolina it was known very well that the men so enlisted had only recently gained their freedom but the instructions said the persons so received into service and their officers to be entitled to and receive the same pay and rations as are allowed by law to volunteers in the service of this passage mr solicitor whiting wrote to me i have no hesitation in saying that the faith of the government was thereby pledged to every officer and soldier enlisted under that call where is that faith of the government now the men who enlisted under the pledge were volunteers every one they did not get their freedom by enlisting they had it already they enlisted to serve the government trusting in its honor now the nation turns upon them and says your part of the contract is fulfilled we have had your services if you can show that you had previously been free for a certainlength of time we will fulfil the other side of the contract if not we repudiate it help yourselves if you can in other words a freedman since april has no rights which a white man is bound to respect he is incapable of making a contract no man is bound by a contract made with him any employer following the example of the united states government may make with him a written agreement receive his services and then withhold the wages he has no motive to honest industry or to honesty of any kind he is virtually a slave and nothing else to the end of time under this order the greater part of the massachusetts colored regiments will get their pay at last and be able to take their wives and children out of the almshouses to which as governor andrew informs us the gracious charity of the nation has consigned so many for so much i am grateful but toward my regiment which had been in service and under fire months before a northern colored soldier was recruited the policy of repudiation has at last been officially adopted there is no alternative for the officers of south carolina regiments but to wait for another session of congress and meanwhile if necessary act as executioners for those soldiers who like sergeant walker refuse to fulfil their share of a contract where the government has openly repudiated the other share if a years discussion however has at length secured the arrears of pay for the northern colored regiments possibly two years may secure it for the southern t w higginson colonel st s c vols now d v s august to the editor of the new york tribune siran impression seems to prevail in the newspapers that the lately published opinion of attorneygeneral bates dated in july last at length secures justice to the colored soldiers in respect to arrears of pay this impression is a mistake that opinion does indeed show that there never was any excuse for refusing them justice but it does not of itself secure justice to them it logically covers the whole ground and was doubtless intended to do so but technically it can only apply to those soldiers who were free at the commencement of the war for it was only about these that the attorneygeneral was officially consulted under this decision the northern colored regiments have already got their arrears of payand those few members of the southern regiments who were free on april but in the south carolina regiments this only increases the dissatisfaction among the remainder who volunteered under the same pledge of full pay from the war department and who do not see how the question of their status at some antecedent period can affect an express contract if in they were free enough to make a bargain with they were certainly free enough to claim its fulfilment the unfortunate decision of mr solicitor whiting under which all our troubles arose is indeed superseded by the reasoning of the attorneygeneral but unhappily that does not remedy the evil which is already embodied in an act of congress making the distinction between those who were and those who were not free on april the question is whether those who were not free at the breaking out of the war are still to be defrauded after the attorneygeneral has shown that there is no excuse for defrauding them i call it defrauding because it is not a question of abstract justice but of the fulfilment of an express contract i have never met with a man whatever might be his opinions as to the enlistment of colored soldiers who did not admit that if they had volunteered under the direct pledge of full pay from the war department they were entitled to every cent of it that these south carolina regiments had such direct pledge is undoubted for it still exists in writing signed by the secretary of war and has never been disputed it is therefore the plain duty of congress to repeal the law which discriminates between different classes of colored soldiers or at least so to modify it as to secure the fulfilment of actual contracts until this is done the nation is still disgraced the few thousand dollars in question are nothing compared with the absolute wrong done and the discredit it has brought

millions of your race in a bondage sanctioned by the laws of the land and protected by our flagon that day in the face of floods of prejudice that wellnigh deluged every avenue to manhood and true liberty you came forth to do battle for your country and your kindred for long and weary months without pay or even the privilege of being recognized as soldiers you labored on only to be disbanded and sent to your homes without even a hope of reward and when our country necessitated by the deadly struggle with armed traitors finally granted you the opportunity again to come forth in defence of the nations life the alacrity with which you responded to the call gave abundant evidence of your readiness to strike a manly blow for the liberty of your race and from that little band of hopeful trusting and brave men who gathered at camp saxton on port royal island in the fall of amidst the terrible prejudices that then surrounded us has grown an army of a hundred and forty thousand black soldiers whose valor and heroism has won for your race a name which will live as long as the undying pages of history shall endure and by whose efforts united with those of the white man armed rebellion has been conquered the millions of bondmen have been emancipated and the fundamental law of the land has been so altered as to remove forever the possibility of human slavery being
