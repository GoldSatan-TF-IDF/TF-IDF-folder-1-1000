soul dwelling in two bodies aristotle i monday february the room was dark he sat in the chair his arms hugging his legs it was happening again charley wouldnt stay locked in the secret place charley insisted on thinking about erin only two more charley whispered then ill stop he knew there was no use protesting but it was becoming more and more dangerous charley was becoming reckless charley wanted to show off go away charley leave me alone he begged charleys mocking laugh roared through the room if only nan had liked him he thought if only shed invited him to her birthday party fifteen years ago hed loved her so much hed followed her to darien with the present hed bought her at a discount house a pair of dancing slippers the cardboard shoebox had been plain and cheap and hed taken such trouble to decorate it drawing a sketch of the slippers on the lid her birthday was on march twelfth during spring break hed driven down to darien to surprise her with the present hed arrived to find her house ablaze with lights cars were being parked by valets hed driven slowly past shocked and stunned to recognize students from brown there it still embarrassed him to remember that hed cried like a baby as he turned around to drive back then the thought of the birthday gift made him change his mind nan had told him that every morning at seven oclock rain or shine she jogged in the wooded area near her home the next morning he was there waiting for her he remembered still vividly today her surprise at seeing him surprise not pleasure shed stopped her breath coming in gasps a stocking cap hiding her silky blond hair a school sweater over her running suit her feet in nikes hed wished her a happy birthday watched her open the box listened to her insincere thanks hed put his arms around her nan i love you so much let me see how pretty your feet look in the slippers ill fasten them for you we can dance together right here get lost she pushed him away threw the box at him started to jog past him it was charley who had run after her grabbed her thrown her to the ground charleys hands squeezed her throat until her arms stopped flailing charley fastened the slippers on her feet and danced with nan her head lolling on his shoulder charley lay her on the ground one of the dancing slippers on her right foot replacing the nike on her left a long time had passed charley had become a blurred memory a shadowy figure lurking somewhere in the recesses of his mind until two years ago then charley had started reminding him about nan about her slender higharched feet her narrow ankles her beauty and grace when she danced with him eeneymeeneymineymo catch a dancer by the toe ten piggy toes the game his mother used to play when he was small this little piggy went to market this little piggy stayed home play it ten times he used to beg when she stopped one for each piggy toe his mother had loved him so much then she changed he could still hear her voice what are these magazines doing in your room why did you take those pumps from my closet after all weve done for you youre such a disappointment to us when he reappeared two years ago charley ordered him to place ads in the personal columns so many ads charley dictated what he had to say in the special one now seven girls were buried on the property each with a dancing slipper on the right foot her shoe or sneaker or boot on the left hed begged charley to let him stop for a while he didnt want to do it anymore hed told charley that the ground was still frozenhe couldnt bury them and it was dangerous to keep their bodies in the freezer but charley shouted i want these last two to be found i want them found just the way i let nan be found charley had chosen these last two the same way he had chosen the others after nan they were named erin kelley and darcy scott they had each answered two different personal ads hed placed more important they had each answered his special ad in all the replies hed received it was their letters and pictures that had jumped out at charley the letters were amusing the cadence of the language attractive almost like hearing nan s voice that selfdeprecating wit that dry intelligent humor and there were the pictures both were inviting in different ways erin kelley had sent a snapshot of herself perched on the corner of a desk shed been leaning forward a bit as though speaking her eyes shining her long slim body poised as though she were waiting to be asked to dance darcy scotts picture showed her standing by a cushioned window seat her hand on the drapery she was halfturned toward the camera clearly shed been surprised when her picture was taken there were swatches of material over her arm an absorbed but amused expression on her face she had high cheekbones a slender frame and long legs accentuated by narrow ankles her slim feet encased in gucci loafers how much more attractive they would be in dancing slippers he told himself he got up and stretched the dark shadows falling across the room no longer disturbed him charleys presence was complete and welcome no more nagging voice begged him to resist as charley willingly receded into the dark cave from which he had emerged he reread erin s letter and ran his fingertips over her picture he laughed aloud as he thought of the beguiling ad that had summoned erin to him it began loves music loves to dance ii tuesday february cold slushy raw terrible traffic it didnt matter it was good to be back in new york darcy happily tossed off her coat ran her fingers through her hair and surveyed the neatly separated mail on her desk bev rothhouse skinny intense bright a night student at parsons school of design and her treasured secretary identified the stacks by order of importance bills she said pointing to the extreme right deposit slips next quite a few of them substantial i hope darcy suggested pretty good bev confirmed messages over there youve got requests to furnish two more rental apartments i swear you certainly knew what you were doing when you opened a secondhand business darcy laughed sanford and son thats me darcys corner budget interior design was what the placard on the office door read the office was in the flatiron building on twentythird street how was california bev asked amused darcy heard the note of awe in the other young womans voice what bev really meant was how are your mother and father whats it like to be with them are they really as gorgeous as they look in films the answer darcy thought is yes theyre gorgeous yes theyre wonderful yes i love them and im proud of them its just that ive never felt comfortable in their world when are they leaving for australia bev was trying to sound offhanded they left i caught the redeye back to new york after seeing them off darcy had combined a visit home with a business trip to lake tahoe where shed been hired to decorate a model ski house for budgetpriced buyers her mother and father were embarking on an international tour with their play she wouldnt see them for at least six months now she opened the container of coffee shed picked up at a nearby lunch counter and settled down at her desk you look great bev observed i love that outfit the squareneck red wool dress and matching coat were part of the rodeo drive shopping tour her mother had insisted upon for such a pretty girl you never pay enough attention to your clothes darling her mother had fussed you should emphasize that wonderful ethereal quality as her father frequently observed darcy could have posed for the portrait of the maternal ancestor for whom she had been named the original darcy had left ireland after the revolutionary war to join her french fianc√© an officer with lafayette s forces they had the same wideset eyes more green than hazel the same soft brown hair streaked with gold the same straight nose weve grown a bit since then darcy enjoyed pointing out im five eight darcy the first was a shrimp that helps when youre trying to look ethereal she had never forgotten when she was six and overheard a director comment how ever did two such stunning people manage to produce that mousylooking child she still remembered standing perfectly still absorbing the shock a few minutes later when her mother tried to introduce her to someone on the set and this is my little girl darcy she had shouted no and run away later she apologized for being rude this morning when she got off the plane at kennedy shed dropped her bags at the apartment then come directly to the office not taking time to change into her usual working garb jeans and a sweater bev waited for her to start sipping the coffee then picked up the messages do you want me to start getting these people for you let me give erin a quick call first erin picked up on the first ring her somewhat preoccupied greeting told darcy that she was already at her worktable theyd been college roommates together at mount holyoke then erin had studied jewelry design recently shed won the prestigious n w ayer award for young designers darcy had also found her professional niche after four years of working her way up in an advertising agency she had switched careers from account executive to budget interior decorating both women were now twentyeight and they were as close as theyd been when living together in school darcy could picture erin at her worktable dressed in jeans and a baggy sweater her red hair held back by a clip or in a ponytail absorbed by her work unaware of outside distraction the preoccupied hello gave way to a whoop of joy when erin heard darcys voice youre busy darcy said i wont keep you just wanted to report that ive arrived and of course i wanted to see how billy is billy was erin s father an invalid hed been in a nursing home in massachusetts for the past three years pretty much the same erin told her hows the necklace going when i phoned friday you sounded worried just after darcy had left last month erin had landed a commission from bertolini jewelers to design a necklace using the clients family gems bertolini was on a par with cartiers and tiffanys thats because i was still terrified the design might be off base it really was pretty intricate but all is well i deliver it tomorrow morning and if i say so myself its sensational how was belair glamorous they laughed together then darcy said update me on project personal nona roberts a producer at hudson cable network had become friendly with darcy and erin at their health club nona was preparing a documentary on personal columnsabout the kind of people who placed and answered the ads their experiences good or bad nona had asked darcy and erin to assist in the research by answering some of the ads you dont have to see anybody more than once shed urged half the singles at the network are doing it and having a lot of laughs and who knows you might meet someone terrific anyhow think about it erin typically the more daring had been unusually reluctant darcy had persuaded her it could be fun we wont place our own ads she argued well just answer some that look interesting we wont give our addresses just a phone number well meet them in public places whats to lose they had started six weeks ago darcy had had time for only one date before she left on the trip to lake tahoe and belair that man had written he was six one as she told erin afterward he must have been standing on a ladder when he measured himself also hed claimed he was an advertising executive but when darcy threw out a few names of agencies and clients he was totally at sea a liar and a jerk she reported to erin and nona now smiling in anticipation darcy asked erin to fill her in on her most recent encounters ill save it all for tomorrow night when we get together with nona erin said im writing every detail down in that notebook you gave me for christmas suffice it to say ive been out twice more since we talked that brings the total to eight dates in the last three weeks most of them were nerds with absolutely no redeeming social value one it turned out id met before one of the new ones was really attractive and needless to say hasnt called back im meeting somebody tonight he sounds okay but lets wait and see darcy grinned obviously i havent missed much how many ads have you answered for me about a dozen i thought it would be fun to send both our letters to some of the same ads we can really compare notes if those dudes call i love it where are you meeting tonights prize in a pub off washington square what does he do corporate law hes from philadelphia just relocating here you can make tomorrow night cant you sure they were meeting nona for dinner erin s tone changed im glad youre back in town darce ive missed you me too darcy said heartily okay see you then she started to say goodbye then impulsively asked whats the name of tonights piginapoke charles north sounds upscale waspy have fun eringobragh darcy hung up bev was waiting patiently with the messages now her tone was frankly envious i swear when you two talk you sound like a couple of school kids youre closer than sisters thinking about my sister id say youre a lot closer than sisters youre absolutely right darcy said quietly the sheridan gallery on seventyeighth street just east of madison avenue was in the midst of an auction the contents of the vast country home of mason gates the late oil baron had drawn an overflow crowd of dealers and collectors chris sheridan observed the scene from the back of the room reflecting with pleasure that it had been a coup to triumph over sothebys and christies for the privilege of auctioning this collection absolutely magnificent furniture from the queen anne period paintings distinguished less by their technique than by their rarity revere silver that he knew would set off feverish bidding at thirtythree chris sheridan still looked more like the linebacker he had been in college than a leading authority on antique furniture his sixfour height was accentuated by his straight carriage his broad shoulders tapered down to a trim waist his sandy hair framed a strongfeatured face his blue eyes were disarming and friendly as his competitors had learned however those eyes could quickly take on a keen nononsense glint chris folded his arms as he watched the final bids on a domenico cucci cabinet with panels of pietra dura and central reliefs of inlaid stones smaller and less elaborate than the pair cucci made for louis xiv it was nevertheless a magnificent flawless piece that he knew the met wanted desperately the room quieted as the bidding between the two highstakes players the met and the representative of a japanese bank continued a tug on his arm made chris turn with a distracted frown it was sarah johnson his executive assistant an art expert whom he had coaxed away from a private museum in boston her expression reflected concern chris im afraid theres a problem she said your mothers on the phone she says she has to talk to you immediately she sounds pretty upset the problem is that damn program chris strode toward the door shoved it open and ignoring the elevator raced up the stairs a month ago the popular television series true crimes had run a segment about the unsolved murder of chriss twin sister nan at nineteen nan had been strangled while jogging near their home in darien connecticut despite his vehement protests chris had not been able to prevent the camera crews from filming long shots of the house and grounds nor from reenacting nan s death in the nearby wooded area where her body had been found he had pleaded with his mother not to watch the program but she had insisted on viewing it with him the producers had managed to find a young actress who bore a startling resemblance to nan the docudrama showed her jogging the figure watching her from the protection of the trees the confrontation the attempt to escape the killer tackling her choking her pulling the nike from her right foot and replacing it with a highheeled slipper the commentary was delivered by an announcer whose sonorous voice sounded gratuitously horrified was it a stranger who accosted beautiful gifted nan sheridan she and her twin celebrated their nineteenth birthday the night before at the family mansion did someone nan knew someone who perhaps toasted her on her birthday become her killer in fifteen years no one has come forward with a shred of information that might solve this hideous crime was nan sheridan the random victim of a deranged monster or was her death an act of personal vengeance a montage of closing shots followed the house and grounds from a different angle the phone number to call if you have any information the last closeup was the police photo of nans body as it had been found neatly placed on the ground her hands folded together on her waist her left foot still wearing the nike her right foot in the sequined slipper the final line where are the mates to this sneaker to this graceful evening shoe does the killer still have them greta sheridan had watched the program dryeyed when it was finished shed said chris ive gone over it in my mind so often thats why i wanted to see this i couldnt function after nan died couldnt think but nan used to talk to me so much about everyone at school i i just thought that seeing that program might make me recall something that could be important remember the day of the funeral that huge crowd all those young people from college remember chief harriman said that he was convinced her killer was sitting there among the mourners remember how they had cameras set up to take pictures of everyone in the funeral home and at church then as though a giant hand had smashed her face greta sheridan had broken into heartrending sobs that girl looked so much like nan didnt she oh chris ive missed her so much all these years dad would still be alive if she were here that heart attack was his way of grieving i wish id taken an ax to every television in the house before i let mother watch that damn program chris thought as he ran down the corridor to his office the fingers of his left hand drummed on the desk as he grabbed the phone mother whats wrong greta sheridans voice was tense and unsteady chris im sorry to bother you during the auction but the strangest letter just came another fallout from that stinking program chris fumed all those crank letters they ranged from psychics offering to conduct seances to people begging for money in exchange for their prayers i wish you wouldnt read that garbage he said those letters tear you apart chris this one is different it says that in memory of nan a dancing girl from manhattan is going to die on the evening of february nineteenth in exactly the way nan died greta sheridans voice rose chris suppose this isnt a crank letter is there anything we can do is there anyone we can warn doug fox pulled on his tie carefully twisted it into a precise knot and studied himself in the mirror hed had a facial yesterday and his skin glowed the body wave had made his thinning hair seem abundant and the sandy rinse completely covered the touch of gray that was emerging at his temples a goodlooking guy he assured himself admiring the way his crisp white shirt followed the lines of his muscular chest and slim waist he reached for his suit jacket quietly appreciating the fine feel of the scottish wool dark blue with faint pinstripes accented by the small red print on his herm√®s tie he looked every inch the part of the investment banker upstanding citizen of scarsdale devoted husband of susan frawley fox father of four lively handsome youngsters no one doug thought with amused satisfaction would suspect him of his other life that of the single freelance illustrator with an apartment in the blessed anonymity of london terrace on west twentythird street plus a hideaway in pawling and a new volvo station wagon doug took a final look in the long mirror adjusted his pocket handkerchief and with a glance to make sure he hadnt forgotten anything walked to the door the bedroom always irritated him antique french provincial furniture damn place done by an upscale interior designer and susan still managed to make it look like the inside of fibber mcgees closet clothes piled on the chaise silver toilet articles haphazardly strewn over the top of the dresser kindergarten drawings taped on the wall let me out doug thought the kitchen was the scene of the usual mayhem thirteenyearold donny and twelveyearold beth jamming food in their mouths susan warning that the school bus was down the block the baby waddling around with a wet diaper and grubby hands trish saying she didnt want to go to kindergarten this afternoon she wanted to stay home and watch all my children with mommy susan was wearing an old flannel robe over her nightgown she had been a very pretty girl when they were married a pretty girl whod let herself go she smiled at doug and poured him coffee wont you have pancakes or something no would she ever stop asking him to stuff his face every morning doug jumped back as the baby tried to embrace his leg damn it susan if you cant keep him clean at least dont let him near me i cant go to the office looking grubby bus beth yelled bye mom bye dad donny grabbed his books can you come to my basketball game tonight dad wont be home till late son an important meeting next time for sure i promise sure donny slammed the door as he left three minutes later doug was in the mercedes heading for the train station susans reproachful try not to be too late ringing in his ears doug felt himself begin to unwind thirtysix years old and stuck with a fat wife four noisy kids a house in the suburbs the american dream at twentytwo hed thought he was making a smart move when he married susan unfortunately marrying the daughter of a wealthy man wasnt the same as marrying wealth susans father was a tightwad lend never give that motto had to be tattooed on his brain it wasnt that he didnt love the kids or that he wasnt fond enough of susan it was just that he should have waited to get into this paterfamilias routine hed thrown his youth away as douglas fox investment banker upstanding citizen of scarsdale his life was an exercise in boredom he parked and ran for the train consoling himself with the thought that as doug fields bachelor artist prince of the personals his life was swift and secretive and when the dark needs came there was a way to satisfy them iii wednesday february on wednesday evening darcy arrived at nona robertss office promptly at sixthirty shed had a meeting with a client on riverside drive and phoned nona to suggest they cab over to the restaurant together nonas office was a cluttered box in a row of cluttered boxes on the tenth floor of the hudson cable network it held a somewhat battered oak desk piled with papers several filing cabinets the drawers of which did not fully close shelves of reference books and tapes a distinctly uninvitinglooking love seat and an executive swivel chair which darcy knew no longer swiveled a plant which nona consistently forgot to water drooped wearily on the narrow windowsill nona loved that office darcy privately wondered why it didnt destroy itself by spontaneous combustion when she arrived nona was on the phone so she went out seeking water for the plant its begging for mercy she said when she returned nona had just completed the call she jumped up to embrace darcy a green thumb i have not she was wearing a khaki wool jumpsuit that faithfully followed the lines of her small frame a narrow leather belt with a whitegold clasp sculpted in the form of linked hands cinched her waist her mediumblond hair streaked with touches of gray was bluntcut and barely reached her chin her animated face was interesting rather than pretty darcy was glad to see that the pain in nonas dark brown eyes had been almost completely replaced by an expression of wry humor nonas recent divorce had hit her hard as she put it its traumatic enough turning forty without your husband bumping you for a twentyoneyearold nymphet im running late nona apologized were meeting erin at seven between seven and sevenfifteen darcy said her fingers itching to skim the dead leaves from the plant fifteen minutes to get over there provided i throw myself in front of an empty cab terrific theres one thing id like to do before we go why dont you come with me and witness the compassionate side of television i wasnt aware it had one darcy reached for her shoulder bag all the offices rimmed a large central area which was crowded with secretaries and writers at their desks computers hummed and fax machines clattered at the end of the room an announcer was on camera giving a news update nona waved a general greeting as she passed there isnt a single unattached person in that maze who isnt answering the personal ads for me as a matter of fact i suspect there are some supposedly attached guys who are also quietly getting together with an intriguing box number she led darcy into a screening room and introduced her to joan nye a pretty blonde who didnt look more than twentytwo joan does the obits she explained she just finished updating an important one and asked me to take a look at it she turned to nye i know it will be fine she added reassuringly joan sighed i hope so she said and pushed the button to start the film rolling the face of film great ann bouchard filled the screen the mellifluous voice of gary finch the hudson cable anchorman was properly subdued as he began to speak ann bouchard won her first oscar at the age of nineteen when she replaced ailing lillian marker in the classic perilous path film clips of ann bouchard in her most memorable roles were followed by highlights of her personal life her seven husbands her homes her wellpublicized battles with studio executives excerpts of interviews throughout her long career her emotional response to receiving a lifetime achievement award i have been blessed i have been loved and i love you all it was over i didnt know ann bouchard died darcy exclaimed my god she was on the phone with my mother last week when did that happen it didnt nona said we prepare the celebrity obits in advance just the way the newspapers do and we regularly update them the farewell to george burns has been revised twentytwo times when the inevitable occurs we just have to drop in the lead the rather irreverent name for the project is the toodleoo club toodleoo club uhhuh we do the final portion and say toodleoo to the deceased she turned to nye that was terrific im positively blinking back tears incidentally have you answered any new personals nye grinned it may cost you nona the other night i made a date to meet some jerk naturally got caught in traffic doubleparked my car to rush in and let him know id be right back rushed out to find a cop ticketing me finally found a garage six blocks away and when i came back he was gone nona suggested nyes eyes widened how did you know because ive heard this from some other people dont take it personally now wed better run at the door nona called over her shoulder give me the ticket ill take care of it in the cab on the way to meet erin darcy found herself wondering what it was that made someone pull a trick like that nye was genuinely attractive was she too young for the man she had met when she answered the ad she must have given her age did he have some image in mind that nye didnt fit it was a disquieting thought as the cab bumped and lurched through seventysecond street traffic she commented nona when we started answering these ads i thought of it as a joke now im not so sure its like having a blind date without the security of being introduced to the guy because hes the best friend of somebodys brother can you imagine any man you know doing that even if for some reason nyes date hated the way she dressed or wore her hair or whatever all he had to do was have a quick drink and say he was rushing for a plane he still gets away fast and doesnt leave her feeling like a fool darcy lets face it nona said from all the reports im hearing most of the people who place or answer these ads are pretty insecure whats a lot more scary is that just today i got a letter from an fbi agent whod heard about the program and said he wants to talk to me hed like us to include a warning that these ads are a natural for sexual psychopaths what a lovely thought as usual bella vita offered encompassing warmth the wonderful familiar garlicky aroma was in the air there was a faint hum of talk and laughter adam the owner greeted them ah the beautiful ladies i have your table he indicated one by the window erin should be along any minute darcy told him as they were seated im surprised she isnt waiting shes always so prompt it actually gives me a complex shes probably stuck in traffic nona said lets order wine we know shell have chablis half an hour later darcy pushed her chair back im going to phone erin the only thing i can imagine is that when she delivered the necklace she designed for bertolinis there might have been some adjustment needed she loses track of time when shes working the answering machine was on in erin s studio apartment darcy returned to the table and realized nonas anxious expression mirrored her own feelings i left a message that were waiting for her and to call here if she cant make it they ordered dinner darcy loved this restaurant but tonight she was hardly aware of what she was eating every few minutes she glanced at the door hoping that erin would come flying in with a perfectly reasonable explanation of why she had been delayed she did not come darcy lived on the top floor of a brownstone on east fortyninth street nona in a coop on central park west when they left the restaurant they took separate cabs promising that whoever heard from erin first would contact the other the minute she got home darcy tried erin s number again she tried an hour later just before she went to bed this time she left an emphatic message erin im worried about you its wednesday i dont care how late you get in call me eventually darcy fell into an uneasy sleep when she awakened at am her immediate thought was that erin had not called jay stratton stared out the corner window of his thirtiethfloor apartment in waterside plaza on twentyfifth street and the east river drive the view was spectacular the east river arced by the brooklyn and williamsburg bridges the twin towers to the right the hudson behind them the streams of traffic agonizingly slow in the evening rush hour flowing well enough now it was seventhirty jay frowned a gesture that caused his narrow eyes to become almost invisible a head of dark brown hair expensively cut and attractively threaded with gray helped to foster his cultivated look of casual elegance he was aware of the tendency of his waistline to thicken and exercised vigorously he knew he looked a bit older than his age which was thirtyseven but that had proved to be an advantage hed always been considered unusually handsome by most people certainly the newspaper magnates widow whom hed escorted to the taj mahal casino in atlantic city last week had found him attractive though when he had mentioned that hed like to have some jewelry created for her her face turned to stone no sales pitch please she snapped lets understand that he hadnt bothered with her again jay did not believe in wasting time today hed lunched at the jockey club and while he waited for a table hed started chatting with an older couple the ashtons were in new york on holiday celebrating their fortieth anniversary obviously wellheeled they were somewhat at loose ends outside their familiar north carolina surroundings and responded eagerly to his conversational overtures the husband had looked pleased at jays query as to whether hed chosen a suitable piece of jewelry for his wife to commemorate their forty years together i keep telling frances that she ought to let me buy her some real nice jewelry but she says to save the money for frances junior jay had suggested that at some time in the distant future frances junior might enjoy wearing a lovely necklace or bracelet and telling her own daughter or granddaughter that this was a very special gift from grampa to nana its what royal families have been doing for centuries he explained as he handed them his card the phone rang jay hurried to answer it maybe it was the ashtons he thought it was aldo marco the manager at bertolinis aldo jay said heartily i was planning to call you alls well i trust all is certainly not well marcos tone was icy when you introduced me to erin kelley i was most impressed with her and her portfolio the design she submitted was superb and as you know we gave her our clients family gems to reset the necklace was supposed to have been delivered this morning miss kelley failed to keep the appointment and has not answered our repeated messages mr stratton i want either that necklace or my clients gems back immediately jay ran his tongue over his lips he realized the hand holding the phone was damp he had forgotten about the necklace he chose his answer carefully i saw miss kelly a week ago she showed me the necklace it was exquisite there must be some misunderstanding the misunderstanding is that she has failed to deliver the necklace which is needed for an engagement party friday night i repeat i want it or my clients gems back tomorrow i hold you responsible to execute one or the other alternative is that clear the sharp click of the phone sounded in strattons ears michael nash saw his last patient gerald renquist at five oclock on wednesday afternoon renquist was the retired ceo of an international pharmaceutical company retirement had thrown a man whose personal identity was linked to the intrigue and politics of the boardroom to the status of unwilling sideliner i know i should consider myself lucky renquist was saying but i feel so damn useless even my wife pulled that old saw on mei married you for better or worse but not for lunch you must have had a game plan for retirement nash suggested mildly renquist laughed i did avoid it at all cost depression nash thought the common cold of mental illness he realized he was tired and not giving renquist his full attention not fair he told himself hes paying for me to listen still it was a distinct relief when at ten of six he was able to wrap up the session after renquist left nash began to lock up his office was on seventyfirst and park his apartment on the twentieth floor of the same building he went out through the door that led to the lobby the new tenant in b a blonde in her early thirties was waiting for the elevator he fought down irritation at the prospect of riding up with her the undisguised interest in her eyes was a nuisance as were her almost inevitable invitations to drop in for a drink michael nash had the same problem with a number of his women patients he could read their minds nicelooking guy divorced no children midtolate thirties available a diffident reserve had become second nature to him at least tonight the new neighbor did not repeat the invitation maybe she was learning when they stepped from the elevator he murmured good night his apartment reflected the precise care he took with everything in his life ivory flax upholstery on the twin sofas in the living room was repeated on the dining room chairs surrounding the round oak table that table had been a find at an antique auction in bucks county the area carpets had muted geometric patterns on an ivory background a wall of bookcases plants on the windowsills a colonial dry sink which served as a bar bricabrac hed gathered on trips abroad good paintings a comfortable handsome room the kitchen and study were to the left of the living room the bedroom suite and bath to the right a pleasant apartment and an attractive complement to the big place in bridgewater that had been his parents pride and joy nash was often tempted to sell it but knew hed miss riding on weekends he took off his jacket and debated between watching the tail end of the six oclock news or listening to his new compact disc a mozart symphony mozart won as the familiar opening bars softly filled the room the doorbell rang nash knew exactly who it would be resigned he answered it the new neighbor stood holding an ice bucketthe oldest trick in the book thank god he hadnt started to mix his drink he gave her the ice explained that no he couldnt join her he was on his way out and steered her to the door when she was gone still twittering about maybe next time he made straight for the bar mixed a dry martini and ruefully shook his head settling on the sofa near the window he sipped the cocktail appreciating its smooth soothing taste and wondered about the young woman he was meeting for dinner at eight oclock her response to his ad had been downright amusing his publisher was ecstatic about the first half of the book he was writing the book analyzing the people who placed or answered personal ads their psychological needs their flights into fantasy in the way they described themselves his working title was the personal ads quest for companionship or departure from reality iv thursday february darcy sat at the dinette table sipping coffee and staring unseeingly out the window at the gardens below barren now scattered with unmelted snow in the summer they were exquisitely planted and manicured to perfection the prestigious owners of the private brownstones they backed included the aga khan and katharine hepburn erin loved to come over when the gardens were in bloom from the street youd never guess they exist shed sigh i swear darce you sure lucked out when you found this place erin where was she the minute she woke up and realized that erin had not phoned darcy had called the nursing home in massachusetts mr kelleys condition was unchanged the semicomatose state could go on indefinitely although he was certainly getting weaker no there had been no emergency call to his daughter the day nurse really couldnt say if erin had made her usual phone call last evening what should i do darcy wondered aloud report her missing call the police and inquire about accidents a sudden thought made her shiver suppose erin had had an accident in the apartment she had a habit of tilting back in her chair when she was concentrating suppose shed been lying there unconscious all this time it took her three minutes to throw on a sweater and slacks grab a coat and gloves she waited agonizing minutes on second avenue before getting a cab oneohone christopher street and please hurry everybody says hurry i say take it easy youll live longer the cabbie winked into the rearview mirror darcy turned her head she was in no mood to banter with the driver why hadnt she thought of the possibility of an accident last month just before she went to california erin had dropped by for dinner theyd watched the news one of the commercials showed a frail old woman falling and getting help by touching the emergency signal on a chain around her neck thatll be us in fifty years erin had said shed imitated the commercial moaning helllp helllp ive fallen and i cant get up gus boxer the superintendent of christopher street had an eye for pretty women that was why when he hurried to the lobby to answer the persistent ring of the doorbell his annoyed scowl was quickly replaced by an ingratiating twist of his mouth he liked what he saw the visitors light brown hair was tossed by the wind it fell forward on her face reminding him of the veronica lake movies he stayed up to watch her hiplength leather jacket was old but had that classy look that gus had come to recognize since taking this job in greenwich village his appraising eyes lingered on her long slim legs then he realized why she looked familiar hed seen her a couple of times with b erin kelley he opened the vestibule door and stepped aside at your service he said in what he considered to be a winning manner darcy walked past him trying not to show her distaste from time to time erin complained about the sixtyyearold casanova in dirty flannel boxer gives me the creeps shed said i hate the idea he has a master key to my place once i walked in and found him there and he gave me some cockandbull story about a leak in the wall was anything ever missing darcy had asked no i keep any jewelry im working on in the safe theres nothing else worth pocketing its more that he has a nasty flirtatious way about him that makes my skin crawl oh well ive got a safety bolt when im inside and the place is cheap hes probably harmless darcy came straight to the point im concerned about erin kelley she told the superintendent she was supposed to meet me last night and didnt show up she doesnt answer her phone i want to check her apartment something may have happened to her boxer squinted she was okay yesterday yesterday thick lids drooped over faded eyes parted lips were moistened with his tongue his forehead collapsed into erratic lines no im wrong i seen her tuesday late afternoon she come in with some groceries his tone became virtuous i offered to carry em up for her that was tuesday afternoon did you see her go out or return tuesday evening nope cant say i did but listen im not a doorman tenants have their own keys delivery guys gotta use the intercom to get let in darcy nodded knowing it was useless she had rung erin s apartment before she buzzed for the superintendent please im afraid there may be something wrong ive got to get into her place do you have your passkey the twisted smile returned you gotta understand i dont normally let people into an apartment just because they wanna go in but i seen you with kelley i know youre friends youre like her classy good lookin ignoring the compliment darcy started up the stairs the stairs and landings were clean but dreary the patched walls were battleship gray the tiles on the steps uneven walking into erin s apartment had the effect of going from a cave into daylight when erin moved here three years ago darcy had helped her paint and paper theyd hired a uhaul and made forays into connecticut and new jersey for garagesale furnishings theyd painted the walls a stark white colorful indian rugs were scattered over the scratched but polished parquet floor framed museum posters were arranged over a studio couch that was covered in bright red velour and piled with vividly assorted throw pillows the windows faced the street even though the sky was overcast the light was excellent under the windows a long worktable held erin s supplies neatly placed side by side torch hand drill files and pliers ring clamps and spring tweezers soldering block gauges drills darcy had always been fascinated to watch erin at work her slender fingers skillfully handling delicate gems next to the table was erin s one extravagance a tall chest with several dozen narrow drawers a nineteenthcentury pharmaceutical cabinet the bottom drawers were a facade concealing a safe one easy chair a television and a good stereo system completed the pleasant room darcys immediate impression was a surge of relief there was nothing out of order here gus boxer at her heels she walked swiftly into the tiny kitchen a small windowless cubicle that theyd painted a bright yellow and decorated with framed tea towels the narrow hallway led to the bedroom the pewter and brass bed and a twoonthree dresser were the only furniture in the closetsized room the bed was made there was nothing out of place clean dry towels were on the rack in the bathroom darcy opened the medicine chest with a practiced eye she noted that erin s toothbrush cosmetics and creams were all there boxer was becoming impatient looks okay to me you satisfied no darcy went back into the living room and walked over to the worktable the message machine showed twelve calls had come in she pressed playback hey i dont know she cut off boxers protest erin is missing have you got that straight shes missing im going to listen to these messages and see if they might somehow give me an idea of where she might be then im going to call the police and inquire about accidents for all i know shes unconscious in a hospital somewhere you can stay here with me or if youre busy you can go which is it boxer shrugged i guess its okay to leave you here darcy turned her back on him reached into her purse and took out her notebook and pen she did not hear boxer leave as the messages began the first one had come on tuesday evening at six fortyfive someone named tom swartz thanks for answering his ad just discovered a great little inexpensive restaurant could they meet for dinner hed phone again erin was supposed to meet charles north on tuesday evening at seven oclock at a pub near washington square by quarter of seven she had undoubtedly already left darcy thought the next call came in at seven twentyfive michael nash erin i certainly enjoyed meeting you and hope you might be free for dinner sometime this week if you have a chance call me back this evening nash left both his home and office numbers wednesday morning the calls began at nine oclock the first few were runofthemill businessrelated the one that made darcys throat close was from an aldo marco of bertolinis miss kelley i am disappointed you did not keep our ten oclock appointment it is essential that i see the necklace and be sure there is no lastminute adjustment necessary please get back to me immediately that call had come in at eleven there were three more followups from the same man increasing in irritation and urgency besides darcys own messages there was another one concerning the bertolini assignment erin this is jay stratton whats going on marcos bugging me for the necklace and holding me responsible for bringing you to him darcy knew that stratton was the jeweler who had given erin s portfolio to bertolinis his message came in around seven wednesday evening darcy started to push the rewind button then paused maybe it would be better not to erase these she looked in the phone book for the number of the nearest precinct i want to report someone missing she said when the call was answered she was told that she would have to come in personally that this kind of information about a competent adult could not be accepted over the phone ill stop there on my way home darcy thought she went into the kitchen and made coffee noting that the only milk container was unopened erin started her day with coffee and always drank it light boxer had seen her with groceries tuesday afternoon darcy looked into the garbage pail under the sink there were a few odds and ends but no empty milk container she wasnt here yesterday morning darcy thought she never got back tuesday night she brought the coffee back to the worktable a daily reminder was in the top drawer she flipped through it starting with today there were no appointments listed yesterday wednesday there were two bertolinis am bella vita pm darcy and nona in the preceding weeks there were notations of dates with names of men unfamiliar to darcy they were usually scheduled between five and seven oclock most of them had the meeting place listed oneals mickey mantles p j clarkes the plaza the sheraton all hotel cocktail lounges and popular pubs the phone rang let it be erin darcy prayed as she grabbed it hello erin a mans voice no this is darcy scott erin s friend do you know where i can reach erin disappointment intense and overwhelming swept over darcy who is this jay stratton jay stratton had left the message about the bertolini jewelry what was he saying if you have any idea where erin is please tell her that if they dont get that necklace theyll file a criminal complaint darcys eyes flickered to the pharmaceutical cabinet she knew that erin kept the combination in her address book under the name of the safe company stratton was still talking i know erin kept that necklace in a safe in her studio is there any possibility you can check to see if its there he urged hold on a minute darcy put her hand over the speaker then thought what a dumb thing to do theres no one here i can ask but in a way she was asking erin if the necklace wasnt in the safe it might mean that erin had been the victim of a robbery when she attempted to deliver it if it was there it was almost certain proof that something had happened to her nothing would have kept erin from delivering the necklace on time she opened erin s address book and turned to d next to dalton safe was the series of numbers i have the combination she told stratton ill wait for you to come here i dont want to open erin s safe without a witness and in case the necklace is here ill want a receipt for it from you he said hed be right over after she replaced the receiver darcy decided that shed ask the superintendent to be present as well she didnt know anything about jay stratton except that erin told her he was a jeweler and the one who got her the bertolini commission while she waited darcy went through erin s files under project personal she found sheets of personal columns torn from magazines and newspapers on each page a number of the ads were circled were these the ones erin had answered or had thought about answering dismayed darcy realized that there were at least two dozen of them which if any of them had been placed by charles north the man erin was to meet on tuesday evening when she and erin agreed to answer the personal ads theyd gone about it systematically theyd had inexpensive letterheads made with only their names at the top theyd each chosen a favorite snapshot to send when requested theyd spent a hilarious evening composing letters they had no intentions of sending i love to clean clean clean erin had suggested my favorite hobby is doing the wash by hand i inherited my grandmothers scrub board my cousin wanted it too it caused a big family fight i get a little nasty during my period but im a very good person please call soon they had finally come up with what they decided were reasonably alluring responses when darcy was leaving for california erin had said darce ill send yours out about two weeks before youre due back ill just change a sentence here or there to fit the ad erin didnt own a computer darcy knew she typed out the responses on her electric typewriter but did not xerox them she kept all the input in the notebook she carried in her purse the box numbers of the ads she answered the names of the people she called her impressions of the ones she dated jay stratton leaned back in the cab his eyes halfclosed the speaker behind his right ear was blaring rock music will you turn that down he snapped man you trying to deprive me of my music the cabbie was in his early twenties wispy snarled hair hung around his neck he glanced over his shoulder caught the look on strattons face and muttering under his breath lowered the volume stratton felt sweat forming in his armpits he had to pull this off he tapped his pocket the receipts erin had given him for the bertolini gems and for the diamonds hed given her last week were in his wallet darcy scott sounded smart he mustnt arouse the slightest suspicion the nosy superintendent must have been watching for him he was in the foyer when stratton arrived obviously he recognized him ill bring you up he said im supposed to stay while she opens the safe stratton swore to himself as he followed the squat figure up the stairs he didnt need two witnesses when darcy opened the door for them strattons face was set in a pleasant somewhatconcerned expression he had planned to sound reassuring but the worry in scotts eyes warned him against banalities instead he agreed with her that something must be dreadfully wrong smart girl he thought darcy had obviously memorized the combination of the safe she was not about to let anyone know where erin kept it she had a pad and pen ready i want to itemize everything we find in there stratton deliberately turned his back while she twisted the dial then crouched beside her as she pulled the door open the safe was fairly deep boxes and pouches lined the shelves let me hand everything out to you he suggested ill describe what we find you write it down darcy hesitated then realized it was a sensible suggestion he was the jeweler his arm was brushing against hers instinctively she moved aside stratton looked over his shoulder an irritatedlooking boxer was lighting a cigarette and glancing around the room probably searching for an ashtray it was strattons only chance i think that velvet case is the one erin kept the necklace in reaching for it he deliberately knocked a small box onto the floor darcy jumped as she saw the glitter of stones scattering around her and scrambled to collect them an instant later stratton was beside her cursing his carelessness they searched the area thoroughly im sure we got them all he said these are semiprecious suitable for good costume jewelry but more important he opened the velvet case heres the bertolini darcy stared down at the exquisite necklace emeralds diamonds sapphires moonstones opals and rubies were set in an elaborate design that reminded her of the medieval jewelry shed seen in portraits at the metropolitan museum of art lovely isnt it stratton asked you can understand why the manager at bertolinis was so upset at the prospect of something happening to it erin is remarkably gifted she not only managed to create a setting that made those stones look ten times their own considerable value but she did it in the byzantine style the family who commissioned the necklace was originally from russia these gems were the only valuable possessions they were able to take when they fled in darcy could visualize erin sitting at this worktable her ankles around the rungs of the chair the way she used to sit when she was studying in college the sense of impending disaster was overwhelming where would erin willingly go without delivering this necklace on time no where willingly she decided biting her lip to keep it from quivering she picked up the pen will you describe this for me and i think we should identify every precious stone in it so theres no question that any are missing as stratton removed other pouches velvet cases and boxes from the safe she noticed that he was becoming increasingly more agitated finally he said im going to open the rest all at once then well list them he looked directly at her the bertolini necklace is here but a pouch i gave erin with a quarter of a million dollars worth of diamonds is gone darcy left the apartment with stratton im going to the police station to file a missingperson report she told him youre absolutely right he said ill take care of getting the necklace to bertolinis immediately and if we havent heard from erin in a week ill contact the insurance company about the diamonds it was exactly noon when darcy entered the sixth precinct on charles street at her insistence that something was terribly wrong a detective came out to see her a tall black man in his midforties with military bearing he introduced himself as dean thompson and listened sympathetically as he tried to allay her fears we really cant file a missingperson report for an adult woman simply because no one has heard from her for a day or two he explained it violates freedom of movement what i will do if you give me her description is check it against accident reports anxiously darcy gave the information five feet seven one hundred and twenty pounds auburn hair blue eyes twentyeight years old wait i have her picture in my wallet thompson studied it then handed it back a very attractive woman he gave her his card and asked for hers well keep in touch susan frawley fox hugged fiveyearold trish and guided her reluctant feet to the waiting school bus that would take her to the afternoon session of kindergarten trishs woebegone face was on the verge of crumbling into tears the baby firmly held under susans other arm reached down and pulled trishs hair it gave the needed excuse trish began to wail susan bit her lip torn between annoyance and sympathy he didnt hurt you and youre not staying home the bus driver a matronly woman with a warm smile said coaxingly come on trish you sit right up here near me susan waved vigorously and sighed with relief as the bus pulled away shifting the babys weight she hurried from the corner back to their rambling brick and stucco home patches of snow still covered isolated sections of the lawn the trees seemed stark and bloodless against the gray sky in a few months the property would be lush with flowering hedges and the willows would be heavily laden with cascades of leaves even as a small child susan had studied the willows for the first hint of spring she shoved the side door open heated a bottle for the baby brought him to his room changed him and put him down for a nap her quiet time had begun the hour and a half before he woke up she knew she should get busy the beds werent made the kitchen was a mess this morning trish had wanted to make cupcakes and spilled batter was still lumped on the table susan glanced at the baking pan on the countertop and halfsmiled the cupcakes looked delicious if only trish wouldnt carry on so about kindergarten its almost march susan worried whats it going to be like when shes in the first grade and has to be gone all day doug blamed susan for trishs reluctance to go to school if youd go out more yourself have lunch at the club volunteer for some committees trish would be used to being minded by other people susan put the kettle on sponged the table and fixed a grilled cheese and bacon sandwich there is a god she thought gratefully as she reveled in the blessed silence over a second cup of tea she permitted herself to face the anger that was burning inside her doug hadnt come home again last night when he stayed in for late meetings he used the company suite at the gateway hotel near his office in the world trade center he got furious when she called him there damn it susan unless theres an earthshattering emergency give me a break i cant be called out of meetings and by the time theyre over its usually well past midnight taking the tea with her susan got up and walked down the long hall to the master bedroom the antique fulllength standing mirror was in the righthand corner opposite the wall of closets deliberately she stood in front of it and appraised herself thanks to the babys exploring fingers her short curly brown hair was disheveled she seldom bothered with makeup during the day but really didnt need it her skin was clear and unlined her complexion fresh at five feet four she could certainly afford to lose fifteen pounds shed been one hundred and five when she and doug were married fourteen years ago sweats and sneakers had become her daily wardrobe especially since trish and conner were born i am thirtyfive years old susan told herself i could lose some weight but contrary to what my husband thinks i am not fat im not a great housekeeper but i know im a good mother a good cook too i dont want to spend my time outside the house when i have young children who need me especially since their father wont give them the time of day she swallowed the rest of the tea her anger building tuesday night when donny came home from the basketball game he had been in the nevernever land between ecstasy and misery he had sunk the winning shot everybody stood up and cheered for me mom then he added dad was practically the only father who wasnt there susans heart had wrenched at the pain in her sons eyes the babysitter had canceled at the last minute which was why she hadnt been able to be at the game either this is an earthshattering event shed said firmly lets see if we can reach dad and tell him all about it douglas fox was not registered at the hotel there was no conference room in use the suite kept for personnel of keldon equities was not being occupied probably some dumb new operator susan had told donny trying to keep her tone even sure thats it mom but donny wasnt fooled at dawn susan had awakened to the sound of muffled sobs shed stood outside donnys door knowing that he wouldnt want her to see him crying my husband doesnt love me or his children susan told her reflected image he lies to us he stays in new york a couple of nights a week hes bullied me into almost never calling him hes made me feel like a fat frowsy dull useless clod and im sick of it she turned from the mirror and analyzed the cluttered bedroom i could be a lot more organized she acknowledged i used to be when did i give up when did i become so damn discouraged that it wasnt worth trying to please him not hard to answer nearly two years ago when she was pregnant with the baby theyd had a swedish au pair and susan was sure that doug had had an affair with her why didnt i face it then she wondered as she began to make the bed because i was still in love with him because i hated to admit my father was right about him she and doug had been married a week after she was graduated from bryn mawr her father offered her a trip around the world if shed change her mind under that schoolboy charm theres a foultempered sneak he had warned her i went into it with my eyes open susan acknowledged as she returned to the kitchen if dad had known the half of it hed have had a stroke she thought there was a pile of magazines on the wall desk in the kitchen she riffled through them until she found the one she was looking for an issue of people with an article about a female private investigator in manhattan professional women hired her to check out the men they were considering marrying she also handled divorce cases susan got the phone number from information and dialed it when she reached the investigator she was able to make an appointment for the following monday february i believe my husband is seeing other women she explained quietly i am thinking of divorce and i want to know all about his activities when she hung up she resisted the temptation to simply sit and continue to think things through instead she attacked the kitchen vigorously time to shape up this place by summer with any luck it would be on the market it wouldnt be easy raising four children alone susan knew that doug would pay little if any attention to the kids after the divorce he was a splashy spender but cheap in hundreds of little ways hed balk at adequate child support but it would be a lot easier to live on a tight budget than to go on with this farce the telephone rang it was doug complaining again about the damn late meetings these last two nights he was exhausted today and they still hadnt settled everything hed be home tonight but late real late dont worry dear susan said soothingly i understand perfectly the country road was narrow winding and dark charley didnt pass a single other car his driveway was almost hidden by brush at the point where it intersected the road a secret and quiet place removed from curious eyes hed bought it six years ago an estate sale estate giveaway was more like it the place had been owned by an eccentric bachelor who as a hobby renovated it himself built in the exterior was unpretentious inside the renovation had consisted of turning the entire first floor into one open room complete with a kitchen area and fireplace wide plank oak flooring shone with a satiny finish the furniture was pennsylvania dutch austere handsome charley had added a long upholstered couch covered in maroon tapestry a matching chair an area rug between the couch and fireplace the second floor was exactly as hed found it two small rooms made into one decentsized bedroom shaker furniture a carved headboard bed and tall chest both made of pine the original tub freestanding on claw feet had been left in the modernized bath only the basement was different the eightfoot freezer that no longer held an ounce of food the freezer where when necessary he left the bodies of the girls here ice maidens theyd waited for their graves to be dug under the warming rays of the spring sun there was a worktable in the basement as well the worktable with a stack of ten cardboard shoe boxes there was only one left to decorate a charming house nestled in the woods hed never brought anyone here until two years ago when hed begun to dream about nan before that owning the house had been enough when he wanted to escape this was his retreat the aloneness the ability to pretend that he was dancing with beautiful girls hed play old movies on the vcr movies in which he became fred astaire and danced with ginger rogers and rita hayworth and leslie caron hed follow astaires graceful movements until he could step with his every step mimic the way astaire would turn his body always he sensed ginger and rita and leslie and freds other partners in his arms their eyes worshipful loving the music loving the dance then one day two years ago it was over in the middle of the dance ginger drifted away and nan was in charleys arms again just like the moments after he killed her waltzing on the jogging path her light svelte body so easy to hold her head lolling on his shoulder when that memory came back hed run to the basement and taken the mates of the sequined dancing slipper and the nike that hed left on her feet from the shoe box and cradled them in his arms while he swayed to the music on the stereo it was like being with nan again and hed known what he had to do first hed set up a hidden video camera so he could relive every single moment of what was to happen then hed begun to bring the girls here one by one erin was the eighth to die here but erin would not join the others in the wooded fields that surrounded the house tonight he would move erin s body he had decided exactly where he would leave her the station wagon moved silently down the driveway around to the back of the house he stopped at the metal doors that led to the basement charleys breath began to come in short excited gasps he reached for the handle to open the back door of the wagon then stood irresolutely every instinct warned him not to delay he must lift erin s body from the freezer carry it to the car drive back to the city leave it on the abandoned fiftysixth street dock bordering the west side highway but the thought of watching the video of erin of dancing with her just one more time was irresistible charley hurried around the house to the front door let himself in snapped on the light and without bothering to remove his overcoat ran across the room to the vcr erin s tape was on top of the others on the cabinet he popped it in and sat back on the couch smiling in anticipation the tape began to play erin so pretty smiling coming in the door exclaiming with delight over the house i envy you this haven he fixing a drink for them she sitting curled on the couch he sitting across from her in the easychair getting up and setting a match to the kindling in the fireplace dont bother to light a fire shed told him i really must get back even for half an hour its worth it hed assured her then hed turned on the stereo muted soft and pleasant the songs of the forties our next date is going to be at the rainbow room he said you enjoydancing as much as i do erin had laughed the lamp beside her accentuated the glints of red in her auburn hair as i wrote when i answered your ad i love to dance hed stood up held out his arms how about now then as though struck by a thought said wait a minute lets do this right what shoe size are you seven seven and a half eight seven and a half narrow perfect believe it or not i have a pair of evening slippers that should fit you my sister asked me to pickup a pair she had ordered in that size like the good big brother i did as i was told then she phoned and told me to take them back shed found a pair she liked better erin had laughed with him just like a kid sister im not going to be bothered running around returning them the camera stayed on her catching her smiling content expression as she looked around the room hed gone up to the bedroom opened the closet where boxes of new evening shoes were lined up on the shelf hed bought the ones hed chosen for her in a variety of sizes pink and silver open toes and backs heels as narrow as stilettos a gossamer ankle strap he reached for the pair that were seven and a half narrow and carried them down still wrapped in tissue try these on erin even then she wasnt suspicious theyre lovely hed knelt and slipped off her ankletop leatherboots his hands impersonal shed said oh really i dont think ignoring her protest hed fastened the slippers on her feet will you promise to wear these next saturday when we go to the rainbow room she had lifted her right foot a few inches off the carpet and smiled at the sheer beauty of the shoes i cant accept these as a gift please he had smiled up at her well let me buy them from you the funny thing is theyd go perfectly with a new dress ive only worn once it had been on the tip of his tongue to say i saw you in that dress instead hed murmured well talk about payment later then hed put his hand on her ankle letting it linger just enough to begin to alert her hed stood up gone over to the stereo the cassette he had specially prepared was already in place till there was you was the first song the tommy dorsey orchestra began to play and the unforgettable voice of the young frank sinatra filled the room he walked back to the couch and reached for erin s hands lets practice the look hed been waiting for came into erin s eyes that tiny first flicker of awareness that something wasnt quite right she recognized the subtle change in his tone and manner erin was like the others they all reacted the same way speaking too quickly nervously i think i really had better start back i have an early appointment tomorrow morning just one dance all right her tone had been reluctant when they began to dance she seemed to relax all the girls had been good dancers but erin was perfection hed felt disloyal thinking she might even be better than nan she was weightless in his arms she was grace but when the last notes of till there was you faded away she stepped back time to go then when he said youre not going anywhere erin began to run like the others she slipped and slid on the floor he had polished so lovingly the dancing slippers became her enemy as she scurried to escape him raced toward the door to find it bolted pushed the panic button on the alarm system to learn it was a farce it emitted a hollow maniacal laugh when touched a little extra bit of irony that set most of them sobbing as he reached for their throats erin had been particularly satisfying at the end she seemed to know it was useless to plead and in an animal burst of strength she fought him clawing at the hands that gripped her slender neck it was only when he twisted that heavy gold necklace around her throat and she began to lose consciousness that she had whispered oh god please help me oh daddy when she was dead he danced with her again no resistance now in that lovely body she was his ginger his rita his leslie his nan and all the others when the music stopped he took off her left slipper and replaced it with her boot the video ended as he carried her body down to the basement where he laid her in the freezer and placed the other slipper and boot in the waiting shoe box charley got up from the sofa and sighed he rewound the videotape removed it and turned off the vcr the cassette tape he had prepared for erin was still in the stereo he pressed play as the music filled the room charley hurried downstairs and opened the freezer lovely lovely he sighed as he saw the still face the bluish veins that showed in the iceblue skin tenderly he reached for her it was the first time hed danced with one of the girls whose body he had frozen it was a different but thrilling experience erin s limbs werent pliant now her back would not bend in a dip her cheek pressed against his neck his chin rested on the auburn hair that hair once so soft now beaded with frost minutes passed finally as the third song was ending he twirled her around one last time then satisfied glided to a halt and bowed it had all begun with nan fifteen years ago on march thirteenth he thought he kissed erins lips just the way he had kissed nan s march thirteenth was three weeks away by then he would have brought darcy here and it would be over he realized that erin s blouse was beginning to feel damp he must get her to the city holding her in one arm he halfdragged her to the stereo as he turned off the dials charley did not notice that an onyx ring with a gold e slipped from erin s frozen finger neither did he hear the faint ping as it landed on the floor and lay almost hidden in the fringe on the rug v friday february darcy stared unseeingly at the blueprint of the apartment she was decorating the owner was spending a year in europe and was specific about her needs i want to rent the place furnished but im putting my own things in storage i dont want some klutz burning a hole in my carpets or upholstery fix the place up tastefully but cheaply i hear youre a genius at that yesterday after shed left the police station darcy had forced herself to follow up a movingeverything must go sale in old tappan new jersey shed hit a bonanza of good furniture that was practically a giveaway some of it would exactly suit this apartment the rest shed store for future jobs she picked up her pen and sketching pad the sectional should be on the long wall arcing to face the windows the she laid down the pen and put her face in her hands i have got to get this job finished ive got to concentrate she thought desperately a memory came unbidden the week of finals of their sophomore year she and erin holing up in their room cracking the books the music of bruce springsteen coming from the stereo in the next room echoing through the walls tempting them to join the celebrants whose exams were over erin lamenting darce when bruce is playing i cant concentrate youve got to maybe i can buy us earplugs erin a mischievous look on her face ive got a better idea after dinner theyd gone to the library when it was closing they hid in stalls in the bathroom until the security guards left theyd settled themselves on the seventh floor at the desks by the elevator where fluorescent lights burned all night and studied in perfect peace letting themselves out through a window at dawn darcy bit her lip realizing she was on the verge of tears again impatiently she dabbed at her eyes reached for the phone and called nona i tried you last night but you were out she told her about going to erin s apartment about jay stratton about finding the bertolini necklace about the missing diamonds strattons going to wait a few days to see if erin shows up before he makes a report to the insurance company the police cant accept a missingperson report because it interferes with erin s right to freedom of movement thats nonsense nona said flatly of course its nonsense nona erin was meeting someone tuesday night shed answered his ad thats what worries me do you think you should call that fbi agent who wrote to you and talk to him a few minutes later bev poked her head in darcys office i wouldnt bother you but its nona there was sympathetic understanding in her face darcy had told her about erin s disappearance nona was brief i left a message for the fbi guy to call ill get back to you when he does if he wants to meet you id like to be there when darcy hung up she looked across the room at the coffee brewer on a side table near the window she made a new pot deliberately heaping a generous amount of ground coffee into the filter erin had brought along a thermos of strong black coffee that night they had hidden in the library this makes the gray cells stand at attention she had announced after the second cup now after the second cup darcy was finally able to fully concentrate on the apartment plan youre always right eringobragh she thought as she reached for her sketchpad vince dambrosio returned to his twentyeighthfloor office from the conference room in the fbi headquarters on federal plaza he was tall and trim and no one observing him would doubt that after twentyfive years he still held the record for the mile run at his high school alma mater st joes in montvale new jersey his reddishbrown hair was cut short his warm brown eyes were wideset his thin face broke easily into a smile people instinctively liked and trusted vince dambrosio vince had served as a criminal investigative officer in vietnam completed his masters degree in psychology on his return then entered the bureau ten years ago at the fbi training academy on the quantico marine base near washington dc hed helped set up the violent criminal apprehension program vicap as it was called was a computerized national master file with a particular emphasis on serial killers vince had just conducted an update session on vicap for detectives from the new york area who had taken the vicap course at quantico the purpose of todays meeting had been to alert them that the computer which tracked seemingly unrelated crimes had sent out a warning signal there was a possible serial killer loose in manhattan it was the third time in as many weeks vince had delivered the same sobering news as you all are aware vicap is able to establish patterns in what heretofore have been considered isolated cases the vicap analysts and investigators have recently alerted us to a possible connection between six young women who have vanished in the past two years all of them had apartments in new york no one is sure whether they were actually in new york when they disappeared theyre all still officially listed as missing persons we now believe that is a mistake foul play is a probability the similarities between these women are striking they are all slender and very attractive they range in age from twentytwo to thirtyfour all are upscale in background and education outgoing extroverted finally every one of them had begun to regularly answer personal ads i am convinced we have another personalad serial killer out there and a damn clever one if we are right the profile of the subject is the following welleducated sophisticated late twenties to early forties physically attractive these women wouldnt have been interested in a diamondintherough he may never have been arrested for a violent crime but could have a juvenile history of being a peeping tom maybe stealing womens personal items at school his hobby could be photography the detectives had left all promising to be on the lookout for any reports of missing young women who fit that category dean thompson the detective from the sixth precinct lingered behind the others vince and he had met in vietnam and had remained friends over the years vince a young woman came in yesterday wanting to file a missingperson report on a friend of hers erin kelley who hasnt been seen since tuesday night shes a young woman who fits the profile youve described and she was answering a personal ad ill stay on top of it keep me posted now as vince flipped through the messages on his desk he nodded with satisfaction when he saw that nona roberts had called him he dialed her gave his name to her secretary and was immediately put through he frowned as nona robertss troubled voice explained erin kelley a young woman i talked into answering personal ads for my documentary has been missing since tuesday night there is no way erin would have dropped out of sight unless shed been in an accident or worse id stake my life on that vince looked at his list of appointments he had meetings in the building the rest of the morning he was due at the mayors office at onethirty nothing he could skip would three oclock work out for you he asked roberts after he replaced the receiver he said aloud another one a moment after she telephoned darcy about the three oclock appointment with vincent dambrosio nona received an unexpected visit from austin hamilton ceo and sole owner of hudson cable network hamilton had an icy sarcastic manner which his staff regarded with intense apprehension nona had managed to talk hamilton into the personalads documentary despite the fact that his initial reaction had been who cares about a bunch of losers meeting other losers she had secured his reluctant goahead by showing him the pages upon pages of personal ads in magazines and newspapers its the social phenomenon of our society shed argued these ads arent cheap to place its the old story boy wants to meet girl aging executive wants to meet wealthy divorc√©e the point is does prince charming find sleeping beauty or are these ads a colossal and even humiliating waste of time hamilton had grudgingly agreed that there might be a story there in my day hed pointed out you met people socially at prep school and college and at comingout parties you acquired a select group of friends and through them met other social equals hamilton was a sixtyyearold professional preppie and the consummate snob he had however singlehandedly built hudson cable and his innovative programming was a serious challenge to the three big networks when he stopped in nonas office his mood was frosty even though he was as always impeccably dressed nona decided that he still managed to remain remarkably unattractive his savile row suit did not quite conceal his narrow shoulders and thickening waist his sparse hair was tinted a silvery blond shade that did not succeed in looking natural his narrow lips which were capable of selectively breaking into a warm smile were set in an almost invisible line his pale blue eyes were chilly he got right to the point nona im damn sick of this project of yours i dont think theres an unattached person in this building who isnt placing or answering personal ads and wasting time comparing results ad nauseam either wrap this project up fast or forget it there was a time to placate hamilton a time to intrigue him nona chose the second option i had no idea how explosive this personalads business might be she fished on her desk for the letter from vincent dambrosio and handed it to hamilton his eyebrows went up as he read it hes coming here at three oclock nona swallowed as you can see he points out that theres a dark side to these ads a good friend of mine erin kelley answered one on tuesday night shes missing hamilton s instinct for news overcame his petulance do you think theres a connection nona turned her head abstractly noted that the plant darcy had watered two days ago was beginning to droop again i hope not i dont know talk to me after you meet with this guy disgusted nona realized hamilton was salivating over the potential media value of erin s disappearance with a visible effort to sound sympathetic he said your friends probably fine dont worry when he was gone nonas secretary connie frender poked her head in the door are you still alive barely nona tried to smile had she ever been twentyone she wondered connie was the black counterpart of joan nye the toodleoo club president young pretty bright smart matts new wife was now twentytwo and ill be fortyone nona thought with neither chick nor child lovely thought this single black female wishes to meet anyone who breathes connie laughed ive got a whole new batch of responses from some of the box numbers you wrote to ready to look at them sure want some more coffee after awesome austin you probably need it this time nona knew her smile was almost maternal connie did not seem to know that offering the boss a cup of coffee was frowned upon by some feminists id love one she returned with it five minutes later nona matts on the phone i told him you were in conference and he said it was vital that he talk to you im sure it is nona waited for the door to close and took a swig of coffee before she reached for the phone matthew she thought meaning of the name gift of god for sure hi matt how are you and the prom queen nona is it possible for you to stop being nasty had he always sounded this querulous no it really isnt damn nona thought after nearly two years it still hurts to talk with him nona i was wondering why dont you buy me out of the house jeanie doesnt like the hamptons the markets still lousy so ill give you a real break on the price you know you can always borrow from your folks matty the moocher nona thought marriage to the childbride had reduced matt to this i dont want the house she said quietly im going to buy my own place when we unload this one nona you love that place youre just doing this to punish me see you nona broke the connection youre wrong matt she thought i loved the house because we bought it together and cooked lobsters to celebrate our first night in it and every year we did something else to make it even greater now i want to start absolutely fresh no memories she began to go through the new batch of letters shed sent out over a hundred to people who had placed recent ads requesting them to share their experiences shed also persuaded the cable anchorman gary finch to invite people to write in about the results of personal ads theyd either placed or answered and the reason they no longer would do it the result of the onair announcement was proving to be a bonanza a relatively small number wrote ecstatically about meeting the most wonderful person in the world and now were engaged living together married many others expressed disappointment he said he was an entrepreneur meaning hes broke tried to borrow money the first time i met him from bashful single white male she criticized me all through dinner said i had a nerve putting in the ad that i was attractive boy did she make me feel lousy i started getting obscene phone calls in the middle of the night when i got back home from work i found him sitting on my doorstep sniffing coke several letters were unsigned i dont want you to know who i am but im sure one of the men i met through a personal column is the man who burglarized my house i brought a very attractive fortyish executive home and found him trying to kiss my seventeenyearold daughter nona felt heartsick at the final letter in the pile it was from a woman in lancaster pennsylvania my twentytwoyearold daughter an actress disappeared almost two years ago when she did not return our calls we went to her new york apartment it was obvious that she had not been there in days she was answering personal ads we are frantic there has been absolutely no trace of her oh god nona thought oh god please let erin be all right her hands trembling she began to sort through the letters adding the most interesting to one of three files happy about ads disappointed serious problem the last letter she held out to show agent dambrosio at one oclock connie brought her in a ham and cheese sandwich nothing like a little cholesterol nona commented theres no point in ordering tuna for you when you never eat it connie commented by two nona had dictated letters to potential guests she made a note to herself to invite a psychiatrist or psychologist to be on the program i ought to have someone who can do a wrapup analysis of the whole personalads scene she decided vincent dambrosio arrived at quarter of three he knows hes early connie told nona and doesnt mind waiting no thats fine ask him to come in in less than one minute vince dambrosio forgot the remarkable discomfort of the green love seat in nona robertss office he considered himself a good judge of people and liked nona immediately her manner was straightforward pleasant he liked her looks not pretty but attractive especially those large reflective brown eyes she wore little if any makeup he also liked the touches of gray in her dark blond hair alice his exwife was also blond but her sunny tresses were the result of regular appointments at vidal sassoon well at least now she was married to a guy who could afford them it was obvious that roberts was desperately worried your letter coincides with the most recent responses ive been receiving she told him people writing about meeting thieves moochers addicts lechers perverts and now she bit her lip and now someone who never would have dreamed of answering a personal ad and did it as a favor to me is missing tell me about her nona was fleetingly grateful that vince dambrosio did not waste time with empty reassurances erin is twentyseven or eight we met six months ago in our health club she darcy scott and i were in the same dance classes and became friendly darcy will be here in a few minutes she picked up the letter from the woman in lancaster and handed it to vince this just arrived vince read it quickly and whistled silently somebody didnt file a report with us this girl isnt on our list she brings the count up to seven missing in the cab on the way to nonas office darcy thought of the time she and erin had gone skiing at stowe their senior year of college the slopes had been icy and most people had headed for the lodge early at her urging she and erin went for one last run erin hit a patch of ice and fell her leg snapping under her when the patrol came with the meat wagon for erin darcy skied beside her then accompanied her in the ambulance she remembered erins ashen face erin trying to joke hope this doesnt affect my dancing i plan to be queen of the stardust ballroom you will be at the hospital when the xrays were developed the surgeon raised his eyebrows you really did a job on yourself but well fix you up hed smiled at darcy dont look so worried shell be fine im not just worried i feel so damn guilty shed told the doctor erin didnt want to make the last run now as she entered nonas office and was introduced to agent dambrosio darcy realized she was experiencing exactly the same reaction the same relief that somebody was in charge the same guilt that she had urged erin to answer the ads with her nona only asked if we wanted to try them i was the one who pushed erin to do it she told dambrosio he took notes as she talked about the phone call on tuesday about erin s saying she was meeting someone named charles north in a pub near washington square she noticed the change in dambrosios manner when she spoke about opening the safe about giving the bertolini necklace to jay stratton about strattons claim that there were diamonds missing he asked her about erin s family darcy stared at her hands remember arriving at mount holyoke first day of freshman year erin already there her suitcases piled neatly in the corner theyd sized each other up both liked what they saw erin s eyes widening as she recognized mother and dad but not losing her composure when darcy wrote to me this summer introducing herself i didnt realize that her parents were barbara thorne and robert scott shed said i dont think i ever missed one of your films then she added darcy i didnt want to settle in until you were here i thought you might have a preference about which closet or bed you wanted remember the look mother and dad exchanged they were thinking what a nice girl erin is they asked her to join us for dinner erin had come to college alone her father was an invalid she explained we wondered why she never even mentioned her mother later she told me that when she was six her father developed multiple sclerosis and needed a wheelchair her mother took off when she was seven i didnt bargain for this shed said erin you can come with me if you want i cant leave daddy all alone he needs me over the years erin completely lost touch with her mother the last i heard she was living with some guy who owned a charter sailboat in the caribbean she was at mount holyoke on a scholarship as daddy says being immobilized gives you plenty of time to help your kid with her homework if you cant pay for college at least you can help her get a free ride oh erin where are you whats happened to you darcy realized that dambrosio was waiting for her to answer his question her fathers been in a nursing home in massachusetts for the last few years she said hes not aware of much anymore i guess im the closest thing erin has to a relative besides him vince saw the pain in darcys eyes in my business ive observed that having one good friend can beat having a passel of relatives darcy managed a smile erin s favorite quote is from aristotle what is a friend a single soul dwelling in two bodies nona got up stood beside darcys chair and put her hands reassuringly on her shoulders she looked squarely at dambrosio what can we do to help find erin along time ago petey potters had been a construction worker big jobs as he liked to boast to anyone whose ear he could get world trade center i usta be out on one of them girders tell ye the wind wuz whippin so ye wondered if ye were gonna stay up there hed laugh a wheezy chortle some view lemme tell ye some view but at night the thought of going back up on the girder began to get to petey a coupla shots of rye a coupla beer chasers and the warmth would flow into the pit of his stomach and spread through his body youre just like your father his wife began to scream at him a nogood drunk petey never got insulted he understood hed start to laugh when his wife ranted about pop pop had been some card hed disappear for weeks at a time dry out in a flophouse on the bowery and then come back home when im hungry its no problem hed confided to eightyearold petey i go to the salvation army shelter take a dive get a meal a bath a bed never fails whats take a dive mean petey had asked when you go to the shelter they tell you about god and forgiveness and were all brothers and we want to be saved then they ask anyone who believes in the good book to come forward and acknowledge his maker so you get religion you run up fall on your knees and shout something about being saved thats taking a dive nearly forty years later the memory still tickled the homeless derelict petey potters hed created his own shelter a combination of wood and tin and old rags that hed piled together into a tentlike structure against the sagging shuttered terminal on the abandoned west fiftysixth street pier peteys needs were simple wine butts a little food litter baskets were a constant supply of cans and bottles that could be redeemed for the deposits when he was ambitious petey took a squeegee and a bottle of water and stood at the fiftysixth street exit of the west side highway no drivers wanted their car windows smeared by his efforts but most people were afraid to wave him away only last week hed heard an old bat explode to the driver of a mercedes jane why do you allow yourself to be held up like this petey had loved the answer because mother i dont want to have the side of this car scratched if i refuse petey didnt scratch anything when he was rejected he just went on to the next car armed with his squirt bottle a coaxing smile on his face yesterday had been one of the good days just enough snow so that the highway became messy and windshields got sprayed with dirty slush from the tires of cars ahead of them few people had refused peteys ministrations at the exit ramp hed made eighteen bucks enough for a hero sandwich butts and three bottles of dago red last night hed settled inside his tent wrapped in the old army blanket the armenian church on second avenue had given him a ski cap keeping his head warm a tattered greatcoat its motheaten fur collar cozy around his neck hed finished the hero with the first bottle of wine then settled down to puffing and sipping content and warm in an inebriated haze pop taking a dive mom coming back to the apartment on tremont avenue worn out from scrubbing other peoples houses birdie his wife harpie not birdie thats what they shoulda called her petey shook with mirth at the play on words wonder where she was now how about the kid nice kid petey wasnt sure when he heard the car pull up he tried to force himself to wakefulness instinctively wanting to protect his territory it better not be cops trying to knock over his place nah cops didnt bother with this kind of shack in the middle of the night maybe it was a druggie petey gripped the neck of an empty wine bottle better not try to come in here but nobody came after a few minutes he heard the car start up again he peered out cautiously taillights were disappearing onto the deserted west side highway maybe somebody had to take a leak petey decided as he reached for the last bottle it was late afternoon when petey opened his eyes again his head had that empty throbbing feeling his gut burned his mouth felt like the bottom of a birdcage he pulled himself up the three empty bottles offered no consolation he found twenty cents in the pockets of the greatcoat im hungry he whined silently poking his head from behind the piece of tin sheeting that served as door for his shelter he decided that it must be late afternoon there were long shadows on the dock his eyes moved to focus on something that was clearly not a shadow petey squinted muttered a profanity under his breath and dragged himself to his feet his legs were stiff and his gait clumsy as he made his unsteady way to whatever was lying on the pier it was a slim woman young red hair curling around her face petey was sure she was dead a necklace was twisted into her throat she was wearing a blouse and slacks her shoes didnt match the necklace sparkled in the fading light gold real gold petey licked his lips nervously bracing himself for the shock of touching the dead girl he reached around the back of her neck for the clasp of the elaborate necklace his fingers fumbled thick and unsteady they could not get the clasp to release christ she felt cold he didnt want to break anything was the necklace long enough to pull over her head trying to ignore the bruised blueveined throat he tugged at the heavy chain grimy fingerprints streaked erin s face as petey freed the necklace and slipped it in his pocket the earrings they were good too from a distance petey heard the whine of a police siren like a startled rabbit he jumped up forgetting the earrings this was no place for him hed have to take his stuff get himself a new shelter when the body was found just his being around here would be enough for the cops an awareness of his potential danger sobered petey on stumbling feet he rushed back to the shelter everything he owned could be tied in the army blanket his pillow a couple pairs of socks some underwear a flannel shirt a dish and spoon and cup matches butts old newspapers for cold nights fifteen minutes later petey had vanished into the world of the homeless panhandling on seventh avenue netted four dollars and thirtytwo cents he used it to buy wine and a pretzel there was a young fellow on fiftyseventh street who sold hot jewelry he gave petey twentyfive dollars for the necklace this is good man try to get more like this at ten oclock petey was asleep on a subway grating that radiated warm dank air at eleven he was being shaken awake a notunkind voice said come on pal its going to be real cold tonight were going to take you to a place where you can have a decent bed and a good meal at quarter of six on friday evening wanda libbey snugly secure in her new bmw was inching her way along the west side highway complacent in the excellent shopping shed done on fifth avenue wanda was still annoyed at herself that shed gotten such a late start back to tarrytown the friday night rush hour was the worst of the week a time when many quit new york for their country homes shed never want to live in new york again too dirty too dangerous wanda glanced at the valentino purse on the passenger seat when shed parked in the kinney lot this morning shed tucked it firmly under her arm and kept it there all day she wasnt fool enough to have it dangling from her arm where someone might grab it another damn traffic light oh well in a few blocks shed be on the ramp and past this miserable section of socalled highway a tap on the window made wanda look swiftly to the right a bearded face grinned in at her a rag began to make swishing movements on the windshield wandas lips snapped into a rigid line damn she shook her head vigorously no no the man ignored her i am not going to be held up by these people wanda fumed jamming her finger on the button that opened the passenger window i dont want she began to shriek the rag was thrown against the windshield the bottle of fluid pinged off the hood a hand reached into the car she watched her purse disappear a squad car was heading west on fiftyfifth street the driver suddenly straightened up whats that on the approach to the highway he could see traffic stopped people getting out of cars lets go siren blaring lights flashing the squad car lurched forward skillfully weaving through the maze of moving traffic and doubleparked vehicles still screaming with rage and frustration wanda pointed to the pier a block away my purse he ran there lets go the squad car turned left then made a sharp right as they roared onto the pier the cop in the passenger seat turned on the spotlight revealing the shack petey had abandoned ill check inside then he snapped hey over there past the terminal whats that the body of erin kelley glistening with sleet the silvery slipper flashing under the powerful beam from the spotlight had been discovered again darcy left nonas office with vince dambrosio they took a cab to her apartment and she gave him erin s daily reminder and her personalcolumns file vince studied them carefully not much here he commented well find out who placed the ads she circled with any luck charles north is one of them erin isnt the greatest record keeper darcy said i could go back to her apartment and look through her desk again its possible i missed something that could help but dont worry if norths a corporate lawyer from philadelphia itll be easy to trace him vince stood up ill get on this right away and im going back to her apartment now ill leave with you darcy hesitated the light on the answering machine was blinking can you wait just a minute till i check the messages attempting a smile she said theres always the chance erin left one there were two messages both were about personal ads one was genial hi darcy trying you again enjoyed your note hope we can get together sometime im box david weld the other was sharply different hey darcy why do you waste your time answering ads and my time trying to reach you this is the fourth time ive called i dont like to leave messages but heres this one drop dead vince shook his head that guy has a short leash i didnt leave the answering machine on while i was away darcy said i suppose if anyone tried to reach me in response to the few letters i sent myself they probably gave up erin started answering ads in my name about two weeks ago those are the first calls ive gotten gus boxer was surprised and not especially pleased to respond to the buzzer and find the same young woman who had wasted so much of his time yesterday he was prepared to absolutely refuse to allow her to enter erin kelleys apartment again but did not get the chance weve reported erin s disappearance to the fbi darcy told him the agent in charge has asked me to go through her desk the fbi gus felt a nervous tremor go through his body but that was so long ago he had nothing to worry about a couple of people had left their names recently just in case a vacancy came up one good looking gal said it would be worth a thousand bucks under the table if he put her at the top of the list so if kelleys friend was able to find out something happened to her it would mean a nice piece of change in his pocket im just as worried about that girl as you are he whined the unfamiliar sympathetic tone catching in his vocal cords come on up in the apartment darcy immediately turned on all the lights against the impending dusk yesterday the place had seemed cheerful enough today erin s continued absence was leaving its mark a faint edging of soot was visible on the windowsill the long worktable needed dusting the framed posters that always gave brightness and color to the room seemed to mock her the picasso from geneva erin had bought it on her one school trip abroad i love this even though it isnt my favorite theme shed commented it depicted a mother and child there were no further messages on erin s machine a search of the desk revealed nothing significant there was a new cassette for the answering machine in the drawer possibly agent dambrosio would want the old tape the one that contained messages darcy switched the two the nursing home this was around the time erin usually called it darcy looked up the number and dialed the head nurse on billy kelleys floor came to the phone i spoke to erin as usual on tuesday night around five i told her i think her father is quite near the end she said she would spend the weekend in wellesley then she added i understand shes missing were all praying that shes all right theres nothing more i can do here darcy thought and suddenly felt an overwhelming desire to go home it was quarter of six when she got back to her own place a hot shower was called for she decided and a hot toddy at ten past six wrapped in her favorite flannel robe steam rising from the toddy she settled on the couch and pushed the remote control for the television a story was breaking john miller the investigative crime reporter for channel was standing at the entrance to a west side pier behind him in a ropedoff area a dozen policemen were silhouetted against the cold waters of the hudson darcy turned up the volume body of an unidentified young woman was just discovered on this abandoned fiftysixth street pier she appears to have been the victim of strangulation the woman is slim in her midtwenties with auburn hair she is wearing slacks and a multicolored blouse a bizarre twist is that she is wearing mismatched shoes a brown leather ankle boot on her left foot an evening slipper on her right darcy stared at the television auburn hair midtwenties multicolored blouse shed given erin a multicolored blouse for christmas erin had been delighted it has all the colors of josephs coat shed said i love it auburn slim josephs coat the biblical josephs coat had been stained in blood when his treacherous brothers showed it to their father as proof of his death somehow darcy managed to find in her purse the card agent dambrosio had given her vince was just about to leave his office he was meeting his fifteenyearold son hank at madison square garden they were going to have a quick dinner then take in a rangers game as he listened to darcy he realized that he had been expecting this call he just hadnt thought it would come quite this soon it doesnt sound good he told her ill phone the precinct where the body was found sit tight ill get back to you when he hung up he called hudson cable nona was still in her office ill get right over to be with darcy she said shell be asked if she can identify the body vince warned he called the midtown north precinct and was put through to the head of the homicide squad the body had not yet been removed from the crime scene when it reached the morgue theyd send a squad car for miss scott vince explained his interest in the case wed be grateful for your assistance he was told unless this turns out to be an openandshut case wed like to have it run through vicap vince called darcy back told her about the squad car and that nona was on the way she thanked him her tone flat and unemotional chris sheridan left the gallery at ten past five and with long strides walked the fourteen blocks from seventyeighth and madison to sixtyfifth and fifth it had been a busy and highly successful week and he savored the luxurious freedom of knowing that he had the whole weekend to himself not a single plan his tenthfloor apartment faced central park directly across from the zoo as he told his friends eclectic in taste hed mixed antique tables lamps and carpets with long comfortable upholstered couches that hed covered in a heraldic pattern copied from a medieval tapestry the paintings were english landscapes nineteenthcentury hunting prints and a silkonsilk tree of life wall hanging complemented the chippendale table and side chairs in the dining area it was a comfortable inviting room a room which in the past eight years many young women had eyed with hope chris went into the bedroom changed into a longsleeved sport shirt and chinos a very dry martini he decided maybe later hed go out for a plate of pasta drink in hand he switched on the six oclock news and saw the same broadcast darcy was watching his compassion for the dead girl and identification with the grief her family would experience was instantly replaced by horror strangled a dancing shoe on one foot oh god chris said aloud could whoever murdered that girl have been the one who sent the letter to his mother the letter that said a dancing girl who lived in manhattan would die on tuesday night exactly the way nan died tuesday afternoon after his mother called hed contacted glenn moore the police chief of darien moore had gone to see greta had taken the letter reassuring her it was probably from a crank hed then called chris back chris even if its on the level how do you begin to protect all the young women in new york now chris dialed the darien police station again and was put through to the chief moore had not yet heard about the death in new york ill call the fbi he said if that letter is from the killer its physical evidence i have to warn you the fbi will probably want to talk to you and your mother about nan s death im sorry chris i know what that does to her at the entrance to beefsteak charlies restaurant in madison square garden vince threw an arm around his sons shoulders i swear youve grown since last week he and hank were now eye to eye one of these days youll be eating your blue plate off my head what the heck is a blue plate hanks lean face with a sprinkling of freckles across the nose was the one vince remembered seeing in the mirror nearly thirty years ago only the color of his grayblue eyes had come from his mothers genes the waiter beckoned to them when they were seated vince explained a blue plate used to be the special of the evening at a cheap restaurant seventynine cents bought you a hunk of meat a couple of vegetables a potato the plate was sectioned to keep the juices from running together your grandfather loved that kind of bargain they decided on hamburgers with everything piled on french fries salads vince had a beer hank a cola vince forced himself not to think about darcy scott and nona roberts going to the morgue to view the body of the murder victim rough as hell for both of them hank filled him in about his track team were running at randalls island next saturday think you can make it absolutely unless oh sure unlike his mother hank understood the demands of vinces job you working on anything new vince told him about the concern that a serial killer was on the loose about the meeting in nona robertss office about the belief that erin kelley might be the dead woman found on the pier hank listened intently you think you ought to be in on this dad not necessarily this may be a local homicide solely for the nypd but they have requested assistance from the behavioral science unit at quantico and ill help them as much as i can he signaled for the check wed better get started dad im coming in again sunday why dont i go to the game alone you know your gut is telling you to follow up on this case i dont want to pull that on you look the game is sold out ill make a deal with you no scalping but if i sell your ticket for exactly what you paid for it i get to keep the money ive got a date tomorrow night im broke and i cant stand to ask mom for a loan she sends me to that hunk of blubber she married so anxious for us to be buddies vince smiled i swear youve got the makings of a con man see you sunday pal on the way to the morgue darcy and nona clasped hands in the squad car when they arrived they were taken to a room off the lobby theyll come for you when theyre ready the cop who had driven them explained theyre probably taking photographs photographs erin dont worry send your picture if they request it in for a penny in for a pound darcy stared straight ahead barely conscious of the room of nonas arm around her charles north erin had met him at seven oclock on tuesday night a little more than a few short days ago tuesday morning she and erin had joked about that date darcy said aloud and now im sitting in the new york city morgue waiting to look at a dead woman who im sure is going to be erin vaguely she felt nonas arm tighten around her the cop returned an fbi agents on the way wants you to wait for him before you go downstairs vince walked between darcy and nona his hands firmly under their elbows they stopped at the glass window that separated them from the still form on the stretcher at vinces nod the attendant pulled the sheet back from the victims face but darcy already knew a strand of that auburn hair had escaped concealment then she was seeing the familiar profile the wide blue eyes now closed the lashes dark shadows the always smiling lips so still so quiet erin erin eringobragh she thought and felt herself begin to sink into merciful darkness vince and nona grabbed her no no im all right she fought back the waves of dizziness and made herself straighten up she pushed away the supporting arms and stared at erin deliberately studying the chalky whiteness of her skin the bruises on her throat erin she said fiercely i swear to you i will find charles north i give you my word he is going to pay for what he did to you the sound of racking sobs echoed in the stark corridor darcy realized they were coming from her friday had been an extremely successful day for jay stratton in the morning hed stopped at the bertolini office yesterday when he brought in the necklace aldo marco the manager had still been furious at the delay today marco was singing a different tune his client was ecstatic miss kelley had certainly executed the concept they had in mind when theyd decided to have the gems reset they looked forward to continuing to work with her at jays request the twentythousanddollar check was made out to jay as erin kelleys manager from there stratton went to the police station to file a complaint about the missing diamonds the copy of the official report in his hand hed headed for the midtown office of his insurance company the distressed agent told him that lloyds of london had reinsured this packet of gems theyll undoubtedly post a reward she said nervously lloyds is getting terribly upset about the theft of jewelry in new york at four oclock jay had been in the stanhope having drinks with enid armstrong a widow whod answered one of his personal ads hed listened attentively as she told him about her overwhelming loneliness its been a year shed said her eyes glistening you know people are sympathetic and they take you out occasionally but its a fact of life that the world goes twobytwo and an extra woman is a nuisance i went on a caribbean cruise alone last month it was absolutely miserable jay made the appropriate clucking sounds of understanding and reached for her hand armstrong was mildly pretty in her late fifties good clothes but no style hed run into the type often enough married young stayed home raised the kids and joined the country club husband who became successful but mowed his own lawn the kind of guy who made sure his wife was well provided for after he keeled over jay studied armstrongs wedding and engagement rings all the diamonds were top quality the solitaire was a beauty your husband was very generous he commented i got these for our twentyfifth anniversary you should have seen the pinpoint he gave me when we got engaged we were such kids more glistening eyes jay signaled for another glass of champagne by the time he left enid armstrong she was excited about his suggestion that they get together next week shed even agreed to consider having him redesign her rings id like to see you with one important ring that incorporates all these stones the solitaire and baguettes in the center banded on either side by alternating diamonds and emeralds well use the diamonds in your wedding ring and i can get some fine quality emeralds for you at a very reasonable price over a quiet dinner at the water club he pondered the pleasure of substituting a cubic zirconia for the solitaire in armstrongs ring some of them were so good even a jewelers naked eye could be fooled but of course hed have the new ring appraised for her with the solitaire still in place amazing how single women fell for that how thoughtful of you to take care of the appraisal for me ill take it right to my insurance company he lingered at the bar of the water club after dinner good to relax the business of being attentive and charming with these old girls was exhausting even though the results were lucrative it was ninethirty when he walked the few blocks from the restaurant back to his apartment at ten he was wearing pajamas and a robe newly purchased at armanis he settled on the couch with a bourbon on the rocks and turned on the news the glass shook in strattons trembling hands and liquor spilled unheeded on his robe as he stared at the screen and learned of the discovery of the body of erin kelley michael nash wondered ruefully if he should offer free analysis to anne thayer the blonde who so unfortunately had bought the apartment next to his when he left the office at ten of six on friday afternoon she was at the desk in the lobby speaking to the concierge as soon as she saw him she dashed to stand beside him and wait for the elevator on the way up she chatted nonstop as though she was on a countdown to ensnare him before they reached the twentieth floor i went over to zabars today and got the most marvelous salmon fixed a platter of hors doeuvres my girlfriend was supposed to come over but cant make it cant bear to see them go to waste i was wondering nash cut her off zabars salmon is great put it away itll keep for a few days he was aware of the commiserating glance of the elevator operator ramon ill see you in a few minutes im on my way out he said a firm good night to the crestfallen miss thayer and disappeared into his own apartment he was going out but not for an hour or so and if he bumped into her then maybe shed start to get the message to leave him alone dependent personality probably neurotic could get vicious when crossed he said aloud then laughed hey im off work forget it he was spending the weekend in bridgewater there was a dinner party at the balderstons tomorrow night they always had interesting guests more important he intended to use the better part of the next two days working on his book nash acknowledged to himself that hed become so interested in the project that he was becoming impatient with distractions just before he left he tried erin kelleys number he halfsmiled as he heard the message in her lilting voice this is erin sorry to miss your call please leave a message this is michael nash im sorry to miss you too erin tried you the other day guess youre away hope there isnt a problem with your father he left his office and home number again the drive to bridgewater on friday night was as usual a trafficclogged nuisance it was only when he passed paterson on route that it began to let up then with each mile the terrain became more countrylike nash felt himself begin to relax by the time he had driven through the gate of scotshays he had a total sense of wellbeing his father had bought the estate when michael was eleven four hundred acres of gardens woods and fields swimming pool tennis courts stable the house copied from a manor in brittany stone walls redtiled roof green shutters white portico twentytwo rooms in all half of them michael hadnt bothered with in years irma and john hughes the housekeeping couple ran the place for him irma had dinner waiting she served it in the study michael settled in his favorite old leather armchair to study the notes he would use tomorrow when he wrote the next chapter of his book that chapter would concentrate on the psychological problems of people who when they answered personal ads sent in pictures of themselves that had been taken twentyfive years ago he would concentrate on what factors made them try that ploy and how they explained themselves when the date showed up that sort of thing had happened to a number of the girls he had interviewed a couple of them had been indignant some had been downright funny describing the encounter at quarter of ten michael turned the television on in anticipation of the news then went back to his notes the name erin kelley made him look up startled he grabbed the remote control and pressed the volume frantically causing the announcers voice to shout through the room when the segment was finished michael flipped off the set and stared at the dark screen erin he said aloud who could do that to you doug fox stopped for a drink at harrys bar on friday evening before heading home to scarsdale it was a watering hole for the wall street crowd as usual the bar was four deep and the news on the television set was ignored doug did not see the bulletin about the body that had been found on the pier if she was sure he was coming home susan usually fed the kids first then waited to eat with him but tonight when he arrived at eight susan was in the den reading she barely raised her eyes when he came into the room and turned away from the kiss he tried to press on her forehead donny and beth had gone to the movies with the goodwyns she explained trish and the baby were asleep she did not offer to prepare anything for him her eyes went back to her book for a moment doug stood uncertainly over her then turned and went into the kitchen she had to pull this attitude act the one night im hungry he thought bitterly shes just sore because i didnt get home for a couple of nights and was so late last night he opened the door of the refrigerator the one thing susan could do was cook with mounting anger he decided that when he was able to make it home the least she could do was to have something ready for him he yanked out packets of ham and cheese and went to the bread box the weekly community newspaper was on the kitchen table doug made a sandwich poured a beer and began to skim the paper as he ate the sports page caught his eye scarsdale had unexpectedly defeated dobbs ferry in the midschool tournament the suddendeath winning basket had been sunk by secondstringer donald fox donny why didnt anyone tell him doug felt his palms begin to sweat had susan tried to phone him tuesday night donny had been disappointed and sullen when doug told him he couldnt make the game it would be just like susan to suggest they call with the news tuesday night wednesday night the new telephone operator at the hotel she wasnt like the young kids who willingly accepted the hundred bucks he slipped them from time to time remember any calls come in for me when im not here im in a meeting if its real late i left a donotdisturb the new operator looked like she posed for a moral majority ad hed been still trying to figure out how to snow her into lying for him he hadnt worried too much however hed trained susan not to phone him when he stayed in for meetings but she had tried him tuesday night he was sure of it otherwise shed have had donny phone him at the office wednesday afternoon and that dumb operator had probably told her there was no meeting and no one was staying in the company suite doug looked around the kitchen it was surprisingly neat theyd had the whole house renovated when they bought it eight years ago the kitchen was a chefs dream center island with sink and chopping board plenty of counter space latest appliances skylight susans old man had lent them the money for the renovation hed also lent them most of the down payment lent not given if susan got really sore doug tossed the rest of the sandwich in the compactor and brought his beer into the den susan watched him enter the room my handsome husband she thought shed deliberately left the newspaper on the table knowing doug would probably read it now hes sweating bullets he figured i probably called the hotel to let donny give him the news funny when you finally faced reality it was amazing how clearly you could see things doug sat on the couch opposite her hes afraid to give me an opening she decided tucking her book under her arm she got up the kids will be back about half past ten she told him im going to read in bed ill wait for them honey honey he must be worried susan settled in bed with the book then knowing she was not able to focus on the print she laid it down and turned on the television doug came into the bedroom just as the ten oclock news began its too lonesome out there he sat on the bed and reached for her hand hows my girl good question susan said how is she he attempted to pass it off as a joke tilting her chin he said she looks pretty good to me they both turned to watch the screen as the anchorman gave the headline news erin kelley a prizewinning young jewelry designer was found strangled on the west fiftysixth street pier more after this a commercial susan glanced at doug he was staring at the screen his pallor a ghastly white doug what is it he did not seem to have heard her police are searching for petey potters a drifter who was known to have been living in this shack and may have observed the body when it was abandoned on this cold debrisstrewn pier when the segment was completed doug turned to susan as though he had just heard her question he snapped nothings the matter nothing beads of perspiration were forming on his forehead at three in the morning susan was awakened from her own uneasy sleep by doug thrashing beside her he was mumbling something a name no cant the name again susan propped herself up on one arm and listened intently erin that was it the name of the young woman whod been found murdered she was about to shake doug awake when he suddenly quieted with growing horror susan realized why the newscast had so upset him undoubtedly hed linked it to that terrible time in college when he was one of the students questioned about the girl who had been strangled vi saturday february on saturday morning charley read the new york post with intense fascination copycat murder was the bannersized headline the similarity of erin kelleys death to the true crimes program about nan sheridan was the focus of the story on the inside pages someone had tipped an investigative reporter from the post about the letter to nan sheridans mother warning that a young woman from new york would be murdered on tuesday night the reporter quoting an unidentified source wrote that the fbi was on the trail of a possible serial killer in the past two years seven young women from manhattan had disappeared after answering personal ads erin kelley had been answering personal ads the circumstances of nan sheridans death were rehashed in full erin kelleys background interviews with colleagues in the jewelry business their responses identical erin was a warm lovely person immensely talented the picture the post used was the one erin had sent charley that delighted him the network was going to repeat the true crimes episode about nan s death wednesday night that would be so interesting to watch of course hed taped it last month but even so to see it again knowing that hundreds of thousands of people would be playing amateur detective who did it who was smart enough to get away with it charley frowned copycat copycat meant they thought someone else was imitating him anger rushed through him stark raging anger they had no right not to credit him just as nan had had no right not to invite him to her party fifteen years ago hed go back to the secret place in the next few days he needed to be there hed turn on the video and dance in step with astaire it wouldnt be ginger or leslie or ann miller in his arms his heart began beating faster this time it wouldnt even be nan it would be darcy he picked up darcys picture the soft brown hair the slender body the wide inquiring eyes how much lovelier would that body be when he held it rigid and cold in his arms copycat again he frowned the anger was pounding at his temples causing one of the terrible headaches to begin it is i charley alone who has the power of life and death over these women i charley broke through the prison of the other soul and now dominate him at will he would take darcy and crush the life from her as he had crushed it from the others and he would confound the authorities with his genius confuse and bewilder their tiresome minds copycat the people who wrote that should see the shoe boxes in the basement then theyd know those boxes that contained one shoe and one dancing slipper from the foot of each of the dead girls beginning with nan of course there was a way to prove he wasnt a copycat his body shook with silent mirthless laughter oh yes indeed there was a way vii saturday february through tuesday february the next week for darcy passed as though she was a robot who had been wound up and programmed to perform specific tasks accompanied by vince dambrosio and a detective from the local precinct she went to erin s apartment on saturday there were three more calls that had been received after shed been in the apartment on friday morning darcy rewound the answering machine one was from the manager at bertolinis miss kelley we gave your check to your manager mr stratton we cannot tell you how pleased we are with the necklace darcy raised her eyebrows i never heard erin refer to stratton as her manager the second call was from someone who identified himself as box erin its milton we went out last month ive been away id like to see you again my phone number is and listen im sorry if i came on a little too strong last time the third call was from michael nash he left a message the other night darcy said vince copied the names and numbers well leave the tape on for the next few days vince had told darcy that forensics experts from the nypd would arrive shortly to go over erin s apartment for possible evidence she had asked vince if she could come with him and get erin s private papers my name is on her bank account and insurance policies as trustee for her father she told me the papers were in her file under his name erin s instructions were simple and explicit if anything happened to erin as agreed darcy would use her insurance to pay nursing home expenses she had contracted with a funeral director in wellesley that when the time came he would handle her fathers arrangements everything in her apartment all her personal jewelry and clothing were left to darcy scott there was a brief note for darcy darce this is surely a justincase but i know youll keep your promise to look after dad if im not around and if that ever should happen thanks for all the great times we had together and have fun for both of us dryeyed darcy looked at the familiar signature i hope youll follow her advice vince said quietly i will someday darcy told him but not yet would you make a copy for me of that personal ads file i gave you sure vince said but why were going to look up the people who placed the ads she circled but youre not going to date them she answered some ads for both of us maybe ill get calls from people who took her out darcy left as the forensics crew arrived she went directly home and began to make phone calls the funeral director in wellesley sympathy then practicality he would send a hearse to the morgue when erin s body was released what about clothing open casket darcy thought about the bruises on erin s throat undoubtedly thered be media at the funeral parlor closed casket ill bring up clothing for her visitation on monday funeral mass on tuesday at st paul s st paul s when shed stayed with erin and billy she had gone to st paul s with them she went back to erin s apartment vince dambrosio was still there he accompanied her into the bedroom and watched as she opened the closet door erin had so much style darcy said unsteadily as she searched for the dress she had in mind she used to tell me that she felt so out of it when i walked in the room with my folks that first day at college i was wearing a designer suit and italian boots my mother had forced on me i thought she looked smashing in chinos and a sweater and marvelous jewelry even then she was designing her own pieces vince was a good listener abstractly darcy was aware that she was glad he was letting her talk no ones going to see her she said except maybe i will just for a minute but i want to feel that shed be pleased with what i chose for her erin urged me to be more daring about clothes i taught her to trust her own instincts she had impeccable taste she pulled out a twopiece cocktail dress pale pink fitted jacket delicate silver buttons flowing pink and silver chiffon skirt erin just bought this to wear to a benefit a dinner dance she was a wonderful ballroom dancer that was something else we shared nona too we met nona in a ballroom dancing class at our health club vince remembered nona had told him that from what you tell me this dress sounds like something erin would want to wear now he didnt like the fact that darcys pupils were so enlarged he wished he could call nona roberts she had told him she absolutely had to be on a shoot in nanuet today darcy scott ought not to be alone too much darcy realized she could read dambrosios thoughts she also realized there was no use reassuring him the best service she could perform was to get out of here and let the fingerprint experts and god knows who else do their thing she tried to make her voice and manner matteroffact as she asked what are you doing to find the man erin was meeting tuesday night weve found charles north what erin told you checks out it was a lucky break you happened to ask her about him he moved last month from a law firm in philadelphia to one on park avenue he left yesterday for a trip to germany well be waiting for him when he gets back monday detectives from this precinct are going around pubs and bars in the washington square area with erin s picture we want to see if some bartender or waiter can remember seeing her on tuesday evening and possibly can identify north when we get him darcy nodded im going to wellesley ill stay there till after the funeral nona roberts is going to join you there on tuesday morning she cant get up before then darcy tried to smile please dont worry erin had loads of friends ive heard from so many of the mount holyoke grads theyll be there so will a lot of our buddies from new york and she lived in wellesley all her life im staying with the people who used to be her nextdoor neighbors she went home to pack a call came from australia her mother and father darling if only we could be with you you know we thought of erin as our second daughter i know if only we could be with you how many times had she heard that over the years birthdays graduations but there had been lots of times when they were with her any other kid would have been so happy to have the golden couple as parents why had she been a throwback to the cottagewithapicketfence mentality its so good to talk with you hows the play going now they were on safe ground the funeral was a media event photographers and cameras neighbors and friends curiosity seekers vince had told her that hidden cameras would be recording everyone who came to the funeral parlor the church and the interment in case erin s killer was there the whitehaired monsignor who had known erin all her life who can forget the sight of that little girl pushing her fathers wheelchair into this church the soloist all i ask of you is forever to remember me as loving you the interment when every tear shall be wiped away the hours she spent with billy im glad you dont know she thought holding his hand if he understands anything i hope he thinks its erin with him tuesday afternoon the pan am shuttle back to new york nona beside her can you take a couple of days off darce nona asked this has been a pretty awful time for you as soon as i know they have charles north in custody i will go away for a week a couple of my friends have a condo in st thomas they want me to visit nona hesitated thats not the way its going to work darcy vince called me last night they picked up charles north last tuesday evening he was in a board meeting at his law firm with twenty partners whoever met erin was using his name after he saw the broadcast and spoke to chief moore chris decided to go to darien for the weekend he wanted to be around when the fbi talked to his mother he knew greta was planning to attend a blacktie dinner at the club he stopped to eat at nicolas arrived at the house around ten and decided to watch a film a classic movie buff he put on bridge of san luis rey and then wondered at his choice the idea of lives drawn together to one particular moment in time always intrigued him how much was fate how much was happenstance was there some kind of inevitable inexorable plan to it all he heard the whirring of the garage door shortly before midnight and walked to the head of the basement stairs to wait for greta wishing once again that she had livein help he did not like the idea of her coming into this big house alone late at night greta adamantly refused that suggestion dorothy the daily housekeeper of three decades suited her fine that and the weekly cleaning service if she had a dinner party her caterer was excellent and that was that as she approached the stairs he called down hi mother her gasp was audible what oh dear god chris you startled me im a bundle of nerves she looked up trying to smile i was so glad to see your car in the dim light her fineboned face reminded him of nan s delicate features her hair shimmering silver was pulled back in a french knot a sable jacket fell loosely from her shoulders she was wearing a long black velvet sheath greta would be sixty on her next birthday an elegant beautiful woman whose smile never fully removed the sadness from her eyes it suddenly struck chris that his mother always appeared to be poised waiting or listening for something some sort of signal when he was a kid his grandfather had told him a world war i story about a soldier who had lost the message warning of an imminent enemy attack afterward the soldier always blamed himself for the terrible casualties and went through life looking in gutters and under stones for the lost message over a nightcap he told greta about erin kelley and understood why the simile had occurred to him greta always felt that there was something nan had told her before she died that had set off an instinctive alarm last week once again she had received a warning and been powerless to prevent a tragedy the girl they found had a highheeled evening shoe on greta asked like nan the sort of shoe you would dance in that note said a dancing girl would die chris chose his words carefully erin kelley was a jewelry designer from what i understand the feeling is that this is a copycat murder somebody got the idea from watching that true crimes program an fbi agent wants to talk to us about it chief moore phoned on saturday an fbi agent vincent dambrosio would like to drop in on the sheridans on sunday chris was glad that dambrosio emphasized that no one could have acted on the letter greta had received mrs sheridan he told her we get tips much more specific than that one and still cant prevent a tragedy from happening vince asked chris to walk outside with him the darien police have the files on your sisters death he explained theyre going to copy them for me would you mind taking me to the exact place where she was found they walked down the road that led from the sheridan property to the wooded area with the jogging path the trees had grown higher their branches thicker in the fifteen years but otherwise chris commented the place was pretty much the same a bucolic scene in a wealthy town contrasted with an abandoned west side pier nan sheridan had been a nineteenyearold kid a student a jogger erin kelley was a twentyeightyearold career woman nan had come from a welltodo social family erin was on her own the only two similarities were in the manner of death and the footwear they both had been strangled they both had been wearing one fancy shoe vince asked chris if while nan was at school she did any blind dating through personal ads chris smiled believe me nan had enough guys flocking around that she didnt need to answer ads to get a date anyhow there was none of that personalads stuff when we were in college you went to brown nan did i was at williams i assume any special boyfriends were checked out they were walking along the path that threaded through the woods chris stopped this is where i found her he shoved his hands in the pockets of his windbreaker nan thought anyone who got tied up with one guy was crazy she was something of a flirt she liked to have a good time she never willingly missed a party and she danced every dance vince turned to face him this is important youre sure the fancy slipper your sister was wearing when she was found was not one of her own absolutely nan hated spike heels she simply wouldnt have bought that shoe and of course there was no trace of the mate in her closet as he drove back to new york vince continued to weigh the comparisons and differences between nan sheridan and erin kelley its got to be a copycat murder he told himself dancing girl thats what was bugging him the note greta sheridan had received nan sheridan had danced every dance had that come out on the true crimes program erin kelley had met nona roberts in a dancing class was it a coincidence on tuesday afternoon charles north was interrogated for the second time by vincent dambrosio he had been met at kennedy airport on monday evening and his astonishment at being greeted by two fbi agents had been quickly replaced by anger i never heard of erin kelley i never answered a personal ad i think theyre ridiculous i cannot imagine who would use my name it was a simple matter to ascertain that north had been in a board meeting at seven oclock on the previous tuesday evening the hour erin kelley supposedly planned to meet him this time the questioning was in fbi headquarters on federal plaza north was of medium height with a stocky build a slightly florid face suggested a threemartini drinker nevertheless vince decided he had a distinct air of authority and sophistication that probably appealed to women forty years old he had been married twelve years prior to his recent divorce he made it very clear that he deeply resented the request that he drop in at vinces office for a second interview i think you must understand that i have just become a partner in a prestigious law firm it certainly will be a great embarrassment if i am in any way linked to that young womans death an embarrassment for me personally and most certainly for my firm im very sorry to embarrass you mr north vince said coldly i can assure you that at this moment you are not a suspect in erin kelleys death but erin kelley is dead the victim of a brutal homicide it is possible that she is one of a number of young women who have answered personal ads and disappeared someone used your name to place that ad a very clever someone who knew you would have left your philadelphia firm by the time he arranged to meet erin kelley will you please tell me why that would matter to anyone north snapped because some women who answer personal ads are smart enough to check out the man they agree to date suppose erin kelleys killer thought she might be that careful what better name to use than someone who had just left his law firm in philadelphia to relocate in new york suppose erin had looked you up in the pennsylvania bar register and called your old office she would have been told that you just left the firm to relocate in new york she might even have been able to ascertain that youre divorced now she has no qualms about meeting charles north vince leaned forward across his desk like it or not mr north you are a link to erin kelleys death someone who knows your activities used your name were going to be following up a lot of leads were going to contact the people whose ads erin kelley may have answered were going to pump her friends memories to see if she mentioned any names we dont have in each and every case were going to talk to you to see if that person is someone who somehow is connected to you north stood up i see that im being told not asked just one thing has my name been released to the media no it has not then see that it isnt and when you call at the office dont identify yourself as fbi say he smiled mirthlessly say its personal business not personal ad business of course when he left vince leaned back in his chair i dont like wise guys he thought he picked up the intercom betsy i want a complete background check on charles north i mean everything and heres another one gus boxer the superintendent at christopher street thats the apartment building where erin kelley lived his face has been bugging me since saturday weve got a file on him im sure of it vince snapped his fingers wait a minute thats not his name i remember its hoffman he was the super ten years ago in the building where a twentyyearold woman was murdered dr michael nash was not surprised when on his return to manhattan sunday night there was a call on his answering machine asking him to contact fbi agent vincent dambrosio obviously they were following up on the people who had left messages for erin kelley he returned the call on monday morning and arranged for vince to stop by before his first appointment on tuesday vince arrived at nashs office promptly at tuesday morning the receptionist was waiting for him and ushered him in to where nash was already at his desk it was a clubby kind of room vince decided several comfortable chairs walls a sunny yellow curtains that let the daylight in but shielded the occupants from the view of passersby on the sidewalk the traditional couch a leather version of the chaise longue alice had bought years ago was at a right angle to the desk a restful room and the expression in the eyes of the man at the desk was both kind and thoughtful vince thought of saturday afternoons confession bless me father for i have sinned the transgressions evolved from disobeying his parents to recitation of more lusty offenses in teenage years it always bothered him to hear someone say that analysis had replaced confession in confession you blame yourself hed point out in analysis you blame everyone else his own masters degree in psychology had only strengthened that viewpoint he had the feeling nash sensed his gutlevel hostility to most shrinks sensed it and understood it they eyed each other welldressed in an unobtrusive way vince thought vince was aware that he was no good at picking out the right tie for his suit alice used to do that for him not that he cared hed rather wear a brown tie with a blue suit than hear her harping at him all the time why dont you leave the bureau and get a job where you can earn some real money today hed grabbed the nearest tie and pulled it on in the elevator it was brown and green his suit was a blue pinstripe alice was now mrs malcolm drucker malcolm wore herm√®s ties and custommade suits recently hank told vince that malcolm had blown up to size fiftytwo fiftytwo short nash was wearing a gray tweed jacket a red and gray tie nice looking guy vince conceded strong chin deepset eyes skin a touch windburned vince liked a man to look as though he didnt hide indoors in lousy weather he got right to the point dr nash you left two messages for erin kelley they suggest that you knew her had dated her is that the case yes i am in the process of writing a book analyzing the social phenomenon of the personal ad situation kearns and brown is my publisher justin crowell my editor just in case i thought he was really trying to get a date vince thought then warned himself to knock it off how did you come to go out with erin kelley did you answer her ad or did she answer yours she answered mine nash reached in his drawer i was anticipating your question here is the ad she answered here is her letter i met her for a drink on january thirtieth at the pierre she was a lovely young woman i expressed surprise that anyone so attractive would need to seek companionship she quite frankly told me that she was answering ads at the behest of a friend who is doing a documentary i dont usually acknowledge that im doing research on these meetings but i was upfront with her and that was the only time you saw her yes ive been terribly busy im almost at the end of my book and wanted to get it finished id planned to call erin again when i turned it in last week i realized that its going to take another month to complete and rushing it simply didnt work and so you called her yes early in the week then again last thursday no it was friday just before i left for the weekend vince studied the letter erin had written to nash his ad was clipped to it dwm physician attractive successful good sense of humor enjoys skiing riding museums and concerts seeking creative attractive sdwf box erin s typewritten note had said hi box perhaps im all of the above no not quite i do have a good sense of humor im twentyeight pounds and my best friend tells me im very attractive im a jewelry designer on my way to being successful im a good skier can ride if the horse is slow and fat definitely a museumgoer in fact i get a lot of ideas for my jewelry by haunting them and music is a must see you erin kelley you can understand why i called nash said and you never saw her again i never got the chance michael nash stood up im sorry i have to cut this short my first patient is arriving earlier than usual but im here if you want me if theres any way i can help please allow me how do you think you can help doctor vince got to his feet as he asked the question nash shrugged i dont know i suppose its the instinctive desire to want a killer brought to justice erin kelley obviously loved life and had much to offer she was only twentyeight years old he held out his hand you dont think much of us shrinks do you mr dambrosio your version is that neurotic selfcentered people pay good money to come in here and complain let me explain how i view my job my professional life is devoted to trying to help people who for whatever reason are in danger of sinking some cases are easy im like a lifeguard who swims out because he notices that someone is over his head and simply escorts him back in other cases are much tougher its as though im trying to rescue a shipwreck victim during a hurricane it takes a long time to get close to him and tidal waves are forcing me back its pretty satisfying when im able to complete the rescue vince put erin s letter in his briefcase you may be able to help us doctor were going to be tracking down the people erin met through personal ads would you be willing to interview some of them and give your professional opinion of what makes them tick absolutely by any chance are you a member of aapl psychiatrists who belonged to the american association of psychiatry and the law vince knew were particularly skilled in dealing with psychopaths no im not but mr dambrosio my research has shown that the vast majority of people who place or answer these ads do so because of loneliness or boredom others may have more sinister motives vince turned and walked to the door as he twisted the knob he looked back id say that was true in erin kelleys case on tuesday night charley drove to the retreat and went directly to the basement he took down the stack of shoe boxes and laid them on top of the freezer clipped onto each of them was the name of the girl who belonged with them not that he needed reminding of course he remembered every single one in perfect detail besides that except for nan he had a videotape of each of them and he had videotaped the true crimes program about nan s death theyd done a good job of finding a girl who looked like her he opened nan s box the scuffed nike and the black sequined satin slipper the slipper was garish his taste had improved since then should he send nans and erin s things back at the same time carefully he considered the idea it was such an interesting decision no if he did that the police and the media would realize immediately that their theory about a copycat murder was wrong theyd know that one set of hands had snuffed out both lives maybe it would be more fun to toy with them for a while maybe start by returning nan s shoe and the one from the first of the other girls that had been claire two years ago an ashblond musicalcomedy actress from lancaster she could dance so beautifully gifted really gifted her wallet was in the box with her white sandal and the gold slipper surely by now her family had given up her apartment hed send the package to the address in lancaster then every few days hed send another package janine marie sheila leslie annette tina erin hed time it so theyd all be delivered by march thirteenth fifteen days from now on that night no matter how he accomplished it darcy would be here dancing with him charley stared at the freezer darcy was going to be the last one maybe hed keep her with him always when darcy got back to her apartment from the airport tuesday evening there were a dozen messages on the answering machine condolences from old friends seven calls had come in from personal ads erin must have answered for her the pleasantvoiced david weld again this time he left a number so did len parker cal griffin and albert booth a call from gus boxer saying he had a tenant for erin kelleys apartment could miss scott get the place cleared out by the weekend if she did she wouldnt have to pay the march rent darcy rewound the tape wrote down the names and phone numbers of the personal ad callers and changed cassettes vince dambrosio might want to have a record of those voices she heated a can of soup ate it on a tray in bed when she was finished she reached for the phone and the list of men who had called for a date she dialed the first number as it began to ring she slammed the phone back in the cradle tears gushed down her cheeks as she sobbed erin i want to call you viii wednesday february at nine oclock darcy went to the office bev was already there she had coffee brewing and fresh juice and warm bagels a new plant was on the windowsill bev hugged her briefly her extravagantly mascaraed eyes filled with sympathy you can guess everything i want to say yes i can darcy realized the coffee aroma was enticing she reached for a bagel i didnt know i was hungry bev assumed a businesslike attitude we had two calls in yesterday people who saw the magic you did on the ralston arms apartment want you to redo for them also would you take on that residential hotel on thirtieth and ninth new owners claim they have more taste than money before i do anything else i have to clear out erin s apartment darcy took a gulp of coffee and pushed back her hair i dread it it was bev who suggested she simply move all the furniture to the warehouse you told me it was a terrific setup could you use erin s things piece by piece on jobs one of the women who called wants to redo her daughters bedroom in a really special way the kids sixteen and is coming home from the hospital after a long siege shell be laid up for quite a while it was good to think of erin s pewter and brass bed being enjoyed by a girl like that it made it easier id better check that its all right for me to move everything out she called vince dambrosio i know the nypd is finished going over the place he told her bev arranged for the van to go to christopher street the next day ill meet it just show me what you want at noon she went with darcy to erin s apartment boxer let them in sure appreciate you releasing the place he whined nice person taking it i wonder how much you got under the table darcy thought i never want to come here again there were a few blouses and scarves that she decided to keep as mementos the rest of erin s clothes she gave to bev youre erin s size just please dont wear them to the office the jewelry erin had made swiftly she gathered it not wanting to think now about erin s talent what else was bothering her finally she laid all the jewelry on the worktable earrings necklaces pins bracelets gold silver semiprecious stones all imaginative whether formal or fun pieces what was bothering her the new necklace erin had completed with the chunky gold copies of roman coins erin had joked about it itll retail for about three thousand dollars i designed it for a fashion show in april cant afford to keep it for myself but until then im going to wear it a few times where was that necklace had erin been wearing it when she went out that last time that and her initial ring and her watch were they with the clothes shed been wearing when her body was found darcy scooped erin s personal jewelry into a suitcase along with the contents of the safe shed have the loose gems appraised and sold for billys nursing home expenses she did not look back when she closed the door of apartment b for the last time on wednesday afternoon at four oclock a detective from the sixth precinct armed with erin kelleys picture was making the rounds of the pubs in the washington square area so far his search had been fruitless several bartenders freely acknowledged knowing erin shed drop in once in a while sometimes with a date sometimes meeting someone last tuesday no didnt see her at all last week charles norths picture produced no effect at all never saw that one finally at eddies aurora on west fourth street a bartender positively stated yeah that girl was here last tuesday i went to florida wednesday morning just got back thats why im sure about the date i started talking to her told her i was finally getting away for some sun she said she was a typical redhead her skin always burned she was expecting to meet someone and waited around for about forty minutes he never showed up nice girl finally she paid her bill and left the bartender was sure it was tuesday sure erin kelley had come in at seven oclock sure she had been stood up he accurately described the clothes she had been wearing including an unusual necklace that resembled old roman coins necklace was real different looked expensive i told her not to wander around outside without pulling her coat collar over it the detective reported to vince dambrosio from the pay phone in the bar vince immediately phoned darcy who verified that erin had had a gold coin necklace i thought it might have been found on her she told vince that erin s initial ring and watch were also missing she was wearing a watch and earrings when she was found vince said quietly and asked if he could come over sure darcy said ill be working late when vince arrived at the office he was carrying a copy of erin s personal ad file we did an exhaustive examination of all erin s papers in them we found a receipt for one of those private safe deposit boxes that are accessible twentyfour hours a day erin signed up for that only last week she told the manager that she was a jewelry designer and was uncomfortable about the value of some of the stones she was keeping in her apartment darcy listened attentively as vince dambrosio told her that erin had been stood up on tuesday night she left that bar alone at about quarter of eight were leaning to the theory that it was a felony murder she was wearing the necklace tuesday night but not when she was found we dont know about the ring she always wore that ring darcy said vince nodded she may have had the pouch of diamonds in her possession he wondered if he was getting through to darcy scott she was sitting at her desk a pale yellow sweater accentuating the blond highlights in her brown hair her expression totally controlled her eyes more green than hazel today he hated to be giving her copies of kelleys personal ads file he was sure that she was going to start writing to the ones that were circled unconsciously his voice deepened as he stressed darcy i know the sense of rage youre feeling at losing a friend like erin the point is i beg you not to answer these personal ads with some crazy idea that youll find the man who called himself charles north were going to do everything we can to find erin s killer but the fact remains that even though erin may not have been one of his victims there is a serial murderer using these ads to meet young women and i dont want you to be his next date doug fox had not strayed from scarsdale over the weekend hed devoted himself to susan and the children and been pleasantly compensated for his efforts by having susan tell him that shed arranged for a babysitter monday afternoon she wanted to do some shopping and proposed that they meet for dinner in new york that night and ride home together she had not told him that before shopping she had the appointment with an investigative agency doug had taken her to san domenico for dinner and made it his business to be especially charming even telling her that sometimes he forgot how really pretty she was susan had laughed tuesday night doug had arrived home at midnight damn late meetings hed sighed wednesday morning he felt secure enough to tell susan hed be taking clients out to dinner and might as well stay at the gateway he was relieved at how understanding she was a client is a client doug just dont wear yourself out wednesday afternoon when he left the office he went straight to the apartment in london terrace he was meeting a divorced thirtytwoyearold real estate broker in soho for drinks at seventhirty but first he wanted to change into casual clothes and make a phone call he hoped that tonight hed reach darcy scott on wednesday afternoon jay stratton received a call from merrill ashton of winstonsalem north carolina ashton had been thinking long and hard about strattons suggestion that he buy frances an important piece of jewelry for their fortieth wedding anniversary if i discuss it with her shell talk me out of it ashton said a smile in his voice point is i have to be in new york next week on business you got anything to show me i was thinking maybe a diamond bracelet jay assured him that he most certainly did have something to show him i just bought some particularly fine diamonds which are being set in a bracelet right now it would be perfect on your wife id want an appraisal of course you would if you like the bracelet you can take it to a jeweler in winstonsalem whom you trust and if he doesnt agree that the value is there we dont have a deal are you prepared to spend forty thousand dollars one for each year of your marriage he heard the hesitation in ashtons reply well thats a bit steep a truly exquisite bracelet jay assured him something that frances junior will proudly leave to her own daughter they arranged to meet for a drink next monday march fourth was it all going too well stratton wondered as he laid the portable phone on the coffee table the twentythousanddollar check for the bertolini necklace would anyone think to come looking for it the insurance on the pouch of diamonds with erin s body found the chance that she had been robbed could not be disputed hed give ashton the gemstones at a reasonable but not questionable price a jeweler in winstonsalem wasnt going to be looking for stones listed as missing or stolen a wave of pure pleasure swept over him stratton laughed remembering what his uncle had said to him twenty years ago jay ive sent you to an ivy league school youve got the brains to get good marks on your own and you still cheat your father will never be dead while youre around when he told his uncle that hed conned the dean at brown into letting him reapply if he joined the peace corps for two years his uncle had sarcastically snapped be careful theres nothing to steal in the peace corps and you might actually have to do some work not that much work at twenty hed started over at brown as a freshman never get caught his father had warned him and if you do no matter how you fix it make sure you dont have a record hed of course been older than the other students theyd all looked like babyfaced kids even the ones who were obviously rich except for one the phone rang it was enid armstrong enid armstrong of course the tearyeyed widow she sounded excited i talked to my sister about your suggestion of what i should do to my ring and she said enid if that will give you a lift do it you deserve to pamper yourself on the channel six oclock news reporter john miller had an ongoing report about erin kelley it had been learned that a quarter of a million dollars in diamonds was missing from her safe lloyds of london had posted a fiftythousanddollar reward for their return the police still believed that she had been the victim of a copycat murderer who might not have known that she was carrying valuables the report ended with a reminder that the true crimes dramatization of nan sheridans death was being repeated at eight oclock darcy snapped the off button on the remote control it had nothing to do with a robbery she said aloud it had nothing to do with a copycat murder no matter what they say it had everything to do with a personal ad vince dambrosio would undoubtedly learn the identity of some of the people erin had dated but erin had been meeting for the first time the man who called himself charles north and he hadnt shown up suppose hed been just coming into the bar and met her at the door suppose hed been one of the ones to whom shed sent a picture suppose hed said erin kelley im charles north i got stuck in traffic this place looks crowded lets go somewhere else it makes sense darcy thought if there is a serial killer out there and if hes been responsible for other deaths he wont stop now if only she knew which ads erin had actually answered which ads shed answered for both of them it was seven oclock a good time to try returning the calls that had been left on her machine in the next forty minutes she reached three people left messages for the other four now she had a date for drinks with len parker at mcmullens on thursday drinks with david weld at smith and wollenskys grill on friday and brunch with albert booth at the victory caf√© on saturday what about the guys who had left messages on erin s machine a couple of them had given phone numbers that shed taken down maybe shed call them back tell them about erin in case they didnt already know and try to get a date with them if they were meeting a lot of girls they might have heard someone talk about a date who turned out to be weird the first two didnt answer the next one picked up immediately michael nash michael im darcy scott a good friend of erin kelleys i imagine you know what happened to her darcy scott the pleasant voice deepened with concern erin told me about you im so terribly sorry i spoke with an fbi agent yesterday and assured him id like to help in any way i can erin was a lovely girl darcy realized her eyes were filling with tears yes she was obviously he caught the catch in her voice this is terribly rough for you can i take you out for dinner some night soon talking about it may help id like that tomorrow darcy thought swiftly she was meeting len at six if eight oclock is all right with you its fine ill make a reservation at le cirque incidentally how will i know you medium brown hair five eight ill wear a blue wool dress with a white collar ill be the most averagelooking guy in the place ill be waiting at the bar darcy hung up feeling somehow comforted at least ill get some use out of the rodeo drive clothes she thought and realized that instinctively she was making a mental note to call erin and tell her that she got up and massaged the back of her neck a dull headache made her realize she hadnt eaten since noon it was now quarter of eight a quick hot shower she decided then ill heat some soup and watch that program the soup appetizing enough when piping hot slumped into a thick concoction of bits of vegetables swimming in tomato stock as darcy stared at the screen the photograph of the dead nineteenyearold her one foot in a scuffed nike the other in a sequined black satin pump was horrifying was that the way erin had looked when shed been found hands folded on her waist the tips of the mismatched shoes pointing in the air what kind of sick brain could see that picture and want to duplicate it the program closed with a reference to the fact that a copycat murderer might be responsible for the death of erin kelley when it was over she snapped off the set and buried her face in her hands maybe the fbi was right about the copycat murder it could not have been sheer coincidence that a few weeks after that program was shown erin had died in the same way but why erin and did the slipper she was wearing fit if it did how did her killer know her size maybe im crazy she thought maybe i should back off and leave this to people who know what theyre doing the phone rang she was tempted not to answer it suddenly she felt too tired to talk to anyone but it might be news about billy the nursing home had her number to call for emergencies she picked up the receiver darcy scott in person well at last ive been trying you every few days im box doug fields ix thursday february on thursday morning nona working with her assistant producer liz kroll completed the planning of the documentary liz a thinfaced sharpfeatured young woman had interviewed the potential guests culling the duds as she put it weve got a nice mix she assured nona two couples who ended up married the cairones fell in love at first sight and are mushy enough to satisfy the romantic slobs the quinlans answered each others ads and are pretty funny telling how their letters crossed in the mail weve got someone who looks like young abe lincoln confiding how shy he is and that hes still hunting for the perfect girl weve got a gal whose ad mistakenly read that she was a wealthy divorc√©e she got seven hundred answers and has dated fiftytwo of them so far weve got a woman who had dinner with her date and at the end he picked a fight with her stalked off and stuck her with the check the next guy practically attacked her when he drove her home now he hangs around her house she woke up one morning and saw him looking in her bedroom window if your friend erin kelley had actually met her date that night wed have a heck of a terrific wrapup wouldnt we ever nona said quietly and realized that she had never liked liz kroll did not seem to notice that fbi agent vince dambrosio is cute i talked to him yesterday hes going to show pictures of those missing girls on the program and warn people that they all answered personal ads then hell ask if anybody has any information that kind of thing that worries me a little we dont want to sound like true crimes but what can you do she got up to go one more thing you know that barnes woman from lancaster whose daughter claire has been missing for two years i had a brainstorm yesterday what about having her on the show just a brief segment i bumped into hamilton and he thought it was a great idea but said to check with you nobody bumps into austin hamilton nona felt anger cut through the dull lethargy that had been encompassing her with each passing day not for a single minute could she get erin out of her mind that face always ready to break into a smile that slender graceful body like the others in the waltz class where theyd met nona was a pretty good dancer but both erin and darcy were outstanding particularly erin everyone else stopped to watch when she waltzed with the instructor and i got friendly with them and told them about this great idea i had for a personal ad documentary if only vince dambrosio were right he believed erin had been the random victim of a copycat murderer please god let it be that nona prayed let it be that but if erin had died because shed answered personal ads let this program help to save someone else ill call mrs barnes in lancaster she told kroll her tone a clear dismissal darcy sat on the windowsill of the bedroom she was redecorating for the teenager who would soon be coming home from the hospital erin s pewter and brass bed would be perfect the charming turnofthecentury ladys vanity that shed picked up in old tappan last week had deep drawers it really was like a small dresser and wouldnt crowd the room the present double dresser a battered mahogany veneer object was a horror more overhead shelves in the closet would take care of bulky items like sweaters she was aware that the girls mother a weary look on her pleasant face was studying her anxiously lisas been in a dreary room in the hospital for such a long time that i thought having her room done over might give her a lift shes in for so much therapy but shes spunky she told the doctors shell be back in dancing class in another couple of years ever since she could toddle the minute she heard music shed start to dance lisa had been run over by a messenger on a bike whod been cycling at top speed against the traffic on a oneway street hed smashed into her breaking her legs ankles and foot bones she loves to dance her mother added wistfully loves music loves to dance darcy smiled thinking of the framed poster with that title that had been in erin s bedroom erin always said that it was the first thing she saw in the morning and it brightened her day she firmly squelched the instinctive desire to keep it as a memoir i have just the thing for that wall she said and felt the constant pain ease a little it was almost as though erin was nodding in approval the harkness agency on east fortyfifth street was the discreet investigative firm susan fox retained to probe into the nocturnal wanderings of her husband douglas the retainer of fifteen hundred dollars had seemed symbolic to her that was just what she had squirreled away in a personal account saving for dougs august birthday shed smiled sadly as she wrote the check on wednesday she had called carol harkness my husband has one of his famous nonmeetings tonight well have joe pabst one of our best people following him she was assured on thursday pabst jovialfeatured heavyset reported to his boss this guys a piece of work he leaves his office cabs up to london terrace hes got an apartment there been subletting from the owner an engineer named carter fields for two years hes registered as douglas fields pretty neat that way nobody questions an illegal sublet and he dont run into anyone tracking him down at work or at home same initials too thats lucky dont have to worry about his monogrammed cuff links pabst shook his head in reluctant admiration the neighbors think hes an illustrator super tells me hes got a lot of signed penandink stuff framed in the apartment i gave the super the garbage about him being up for a government assignment slipped the usual twenty bucks to keep the mouth shut at thirtyeight carol harkness looked like one of the women executives in the at ampt commercials her wellcut black suit was brightened only by a gold lapel pin her ashblond hair was shoulder length her hazel eyes had a cool impersonal expression the daughter of a new york city detective the love of police work was in her blood did he stay there or go out she asked went out about seven oclock you should have seen the difference in him hair combed so it looked real curly turtleneck sweater jeans leather jacket dont get me wrong not cheaplooking kind of the way the arty types with money dress he met some gal in a bar in soho attractive thirty or so classy i got the table behind them they had a coupla drinks then she said she had to leave anxious to dump him harkness asked quickly no way she had big eyes for him hes a good looking guy and can turn on the charm they have a date friday night theyre going dancing at some nightclub downtown his forehead creased in concentration vince dambrosio studied the autopsy report on erin kelley it stated that she had eaten approximately an hour before she died her body showed no sign of decomposition her clothing had been soaked through these facts were initially attributed to the sleet and cold the day she was found the autopsy revealed that her organs were partially thawed the medical examiner concluded that her body had been frozen immediately after her death frozen why because it was too dangerous for the killer to dispose of the body immediately where had she been kept had she died on tuesday night or was it possible that she had been held captive somewhere and died as late as thursday had she been planning to put the pouch of diamonds in the security vault from all accounts erin kelley was a levelheaded young woman certainly she didnt seem like the kind who would confide to a stranger that she was carrying a fortune in jewels in her purse or would she theyd been running down the identity of the people whod placed some of the ads they believed erin answered so far theyd all been like that lawyer north absolute proof of where theyd been tuesday night some of them picked up their own mail at the magazines or newspapers where theyd run the ads three of the forwarding addresses for the others turned out to be mail drops probably married guys who didnt want to take any chance of their wives opening the mail it was nearly five when vince received a call from darcy scott ive been wanting to talk to you all day but ive been out of the office on jobs she explained best thing for her vince thought he liked darcy scott after kelleys body was found hed asked nona roberts about scotts family and had been astonished to learn that she was the offspring of two superstars nothing hollywood about that girl genuine it was amazing some guy hadnt snapped her up yet he asked her how it was going its going okay darcy said vince tried to analyze what he was hearing in her voice the first time he met her in nonas office her low strained tone suggested acute worry at the morgue until shed broken down shed spoken in the emotionless monotone of a person in shock now there was a certain briskness determination vince knew instantly that darcy scott was still convinced that erin s death was the result of answering personal ads he was about to talk to her about that when she asked vince something has been bothering me did that highheeled shoe erin was wearing fit i mean was it her size it was the same size as her boot seven and a half narrow then how did whoever put it on her happen to have a shoe exactly her size smart girl vince thought carefully he weighed his words miss scott thats something were working on now were trying to trace that shoe through the manufacturer to learn where it was purchased its not cheap in fact the pair probably cost several hundred dollars that narrows considerably the number of outlets in the new york area that might carry it i promise ill keep you posted on developments he hesitated then added i hope youve given up the idea of following up any personal ads erin kelley answered for you as a matter of fact darcy told him i have my first date with one of them in an hour len parker at six they were meeting at mcmullens on seventysixth and third a trendy place darcy thought and certainly safe a favorite with the new york in crowd shed been there on dates a few times and liked the owner jim mcmullen she was only going to have a glass of wine with parker hed told her he was meeting some friends at the athletic club to play basketball she had told michael nash that she would be wearing a blue wool dress with a white collar now that she had it on she felt overdressed erin always teased her about the clothes her mother showered on her when you get around to wearing them you make the rest of us look as though we shop in johns bargain store not true darcy thought as she applied another smidgen of midnightgray eye shadow erin always looked great even in college when she had so little money to buy clothes she decided to wear the silver and azurite pin erin had given her for her birthday funky but fun erin had pronounced it the pin was shaped like a bar of music the notes were lined in azurite exactly the seablue shade of the dress silver bracelets and earrings and narrow suede boots completed the outfit carefully darcy appraised herself in the mirror on the trip to california her mother had bullied her into going to her personal hairdresser hed changed her part cut off a few inches then accentuated the natural blond highlights in her hair she had to admit that she liked the results she shrugged okay i look good enough that len parker probably wont walk out on me when i show up parker was tall bonethin but not unattractive a college teacher he told her he had recently moved to new york from wichita kansas and didnt know many people over a glass of wine he confided that a friend had suggested he place a personal ad theyre really expensive youd be surprised it makes a lot more sense to answer other peoples ads but im sure glad you answered mine his eyes were light brown but large and expressive he stared at darcy i really have to say this youre very pretty thank you why was it that something about him made her uncomfortable was he really a teacher or was he like the one date shed had before she went to california that guy had claimed to be an advertising executive and didnt know the first thing about the agencies she brought up with him parker fidgeted on the bar stool rocking it slightly his voice was low and with the hubbub of conversation from the people nearby darcy had to lean over to hear him very pretty he emphasized you know not all the girls ive met are pretty when you read the letters they send youd think they were miss universe and who shows up olive oyl he signaled for another glass of wine you im fine carefully she chose her words surely all of them werent that bad i bet youve met some really pretty girls he shook his head emphatically not like you no way it was a long hour darcy heard about parkers trouble finding an apartment the prices wow some girls think you should take them out for fancy dinners come on who can keep that up finally darcy was able to get erin s name in i know my friend and i both met some strange people through these ads her name was erin kelley did you meet her by any chance erin kelley parker swallowed convulsively wasnt that the girl who got murdered last week no i never met her and she was your friend gee im sorry thats lousy did they find the killer yet she did not want to discuss erin s death there was no way even if erin met this man once that shed have gone out with him a second time she looked at her watch i have to run and youll be late for your basketball game oh thats all right ill skip it stay for dinner they have good hamburgers here expensive but good i really cant im meeting someone parker frowned tomorrow night i mean i know im not much to look at and teachers are famous for not making much money but id really like to see you again darcy slipped her arms into her coat i really cant thank you parker stood up and punched the bar well you can pay for the drinks you think youre too good for me im too good for you she was relieved to see him stalk out of the restaurant when the bartender came with the check he said miss dont bother with that nut did he pull his collegeprofessor stuff hes on the maintenance staff at nyu he gets more free drinks and meals through those ads he places you got off cheap darcy laughed i think i did too a thought struck her she reached in her purse for erin s picture by any chance did he ever show up with this girl the bartender who looked as though he might be an actor studied the picture carefully then nodded he sure did around two weeks ago she was a knockout she walked out on him at six oclock nona was surprised and pleased to receive a call from vince dambrosio youre obviously another one who doesnt keep regular hours he said id like to talk to you about your program are you free for dinner in about an hour she was okay make a reservation at a good steak place in your neighborhood smiling she hung up dambrosio was clearly a meatandpotatoes man but shed bet her bottom dollar that his cholesterol level was fine she realized that she was unreasonably glad that shed worn her new donna karan jumpsuit today the cranberry shade suited her and the gold belt with the clasped hands accentuated her small waist nona knew that her waistline was her one vanity then she had a flash of overwhelming sadness erin had made that belt for her for christmas shaking her head as though to negate the reality of erin s death she got up and walked around her desk rotating her shoulders shed spent the entire day working on the documentary and felt as though her body was a mass of knots at three oclock gary finch the hudson cable anchorman had reviewed it with her at the end of the session finch a notorious perfectionist smiled and said its going to be great approbation from sir hubert is praise indeed nona stretched and tried to decide whether or not to call emma barnes in lancaster again shed already tried three or four times admittedly liz was smart to suggest having barnes appear on the program to talk about her missing daughter who had answered personal ads liz was bright and imaginative but she was trying to skunk me when she discussed barnes with hamilton nona decided she wants my job let her try she gave one last long stretch sat at her desk and dialed the lancaster number once more the barnes household did not answer vince arrived promptly at seven he was wearing a wellcut gray pinstriped suit accompanied by a brown and beige tie its for sure no woman picks out his ties nona thought remembering how fussy matt had been about what tie went with which shirt and what suit the restaurant was on broadway a few blocks from nonas apartment lets save the serious stuff for dessert vince suggested over salads they briefly sketched their personal lives if you were placing a personal ad what would you say about yourself he asked nona reflected divorced white female age cable television producer he sipped his scotch go on manhattan born and bred think anyone who lives anywhere else is mentally ill he laughed she noticed that caused friendly creases in the corners of his eyes nona sipped her wine this is terrific burgundy she commented i hope youre planning to have some when the steak comes i am finish your ad please barnard graduate i didnt even leave manhattan for college you see i did have a year abroad and i do like to travel as long as im not gone more than three weeks your ads getting expensive ill wind it up clean but not particularly tidy youve noticed my office do not have green thumb good cook but hate fussy food love jazz and oh yes im a good dancer thats how you got friendly with erin kelley and darcy scott in a dance class dambrosio commented and then watched as pain darkened nonas eyes hurriedly he added my ads a little shorter i work for the government divorced white male years old fbi agent brought up in waldwick new jersey graduated from nyu cant dance without tripping over my own feet like to travel as long as it isnt vietnam three years there was enough and last but certainly not least i have a fifteenyearold son hank whos a swell kid as she had promised the steaks were superb over coffee they talked about the program were taping it in two weeks nona said id like to save you for last so people are left with a sobering warning about the potential danger of answering these ads youre going to show the pictures of the missing girls arent you yes theres always the chance a viewer may have information about one of them it was biting cold when they left the restaurant a frosty winter wind made nona gasp vince took her arm as they crossed the street he did not remove it the rest of the way to her apartment he accepted her invitation to come up for a nightcap nona remembered happily that her cleaning lady lola had been in the place would look presentable the sevenroom apartment was in a prewar building she could see dambrosios eyebrows raise as he took in the large foyer the high ceilings the long windows on central park west the paintings in the living room the massive jacobean furniture very nice he commented my folks gave it to me as is when they moved to florida im an only child and this way when they come up to new york my father feels comfortable he hates hotels she went to the bar whatll it be she poured sambuca for both of them then paused its only quarter past nine do you mind if i take a minute to phone someone she reached in her purse as she looked up the barness number she explained why she was calling them this time the phone was picked up immediately nona froze as she realized the sound she was hearing was a woman screaming a mans voice gave a distracted greeting in shocked bewilderment he said whoever this is please get off the phone i must call the police immediately weve been away all day and just opened the mail there was a package addressed to my wife the screams were now a shrieking crescendo nona motioned to vince to pick up the portable telephone on the table beside him our daughter the bewildered voice went on shes been missing for two years that package has one of claires own shoes and a highheeled satin slipper in it he began to shout who sent this why did they send it does this mean claire is dead darcy was handed out of the cab by the doorman entered le cirque and felt herself begin to unwind she had not realized how much energy she had put into the meeting with len parker her head was still buzzing with the realization that he had met erin why had he denied it erin had walked out on him certainly shed never dated him again was it simply that he didnt want to be questioned and have to admit the lies about his background every time her mother and father were in new york they dined at le cirque it was a wonderful restaurant darcy found herself wondering why she didnt come here more often how ever did two such stunning people manage to produce that mousylooking child and how could one sentence remain so imbedded in memory the bar was to the left small and charming it was not a hangout but a place to wait for a guest or a table a young couple was standing near it chatting animatedly a single man was at the end the most ordinarylooking person youll see michael nash had not been kind to himself dark blond hair a face that was saved from being conventionally handsome by a rather sharp chin a long trim body dark blue suit with faint pinstripes silver and blue tie as he looked at her with obvious recognition and pleasure darcy was aware that michael nashs eyes were an unusual shade somewhere between sapphire and midnight blue darcy scott it was a statement not a question he signaled to the ma√Ætre d and put his hand under her elbow they were seated at a prime table in full view of the entrance michael nash must be a frequent and valued customer of le cirque a drink wine white wine please and a glass of water he ordered a bottle of pellegrino with the chardonnay then smiled now that for the moment weve taken care of the necessaries as an old friend puts it darcy its good to meet you for the next half hour she realized that he was deliberately steering the conversation away from erin it was only after she had begun to sip the wine and pick at a roll that he said mission accomplished i think you are finally starting to feel safe darcy stared at him whatever do you mean i mean that i was watching for you i saw the way you hurried in everything about you suggested a high level of tension what happened nothing id really like to talk about erin i would too but darcy he stopped look i cant get out of the business of doing what i do all day im a psychiatrist his smile was apologetic she felt herself at last begin to relax im the one who should apologize youre absolutely right i did feel pretty tense coming here she told him about len parker he listened attentively his head slightly tilted youll of course report this man to the police the fbi actually vincent dambrosio as i told you when you called he came to my office on tuesday unfortunately i could tell him very little i met erin for a drink several weeks ago i had the immediate feeling that a girl like her had no need to answer personal ads i challenged her with that and she told me about the program her friend is putting together she mentioned you said her best friend was answering ads with her darcy nodded hoping that her eyes were not going to fill with tears i dont usually explain that the reason im going this route is because of a book im working on but i did tell erin we exchanged some stories about our various dates ive tried to remember everything she said but she didnt give any names and they were funny stories certainly i had no hint that anyone worried her close encounters of the worst kind she used to call them nash laughed she told me that i asked if we could plan dinner soon and she agreed i was trying to wrap up my book and she was completing a necklace she had designed i said id get back to her when i tried there was no answer from what vincent dambrosio said it was already too late that was the night she thought she was meeting someone named charles north i still think that even though he didnt show up her death has to do with a personal ad she answered thinking that why are you answering personal ads now because im going to find that man he looked troubled but did not comment they studied the menu both selecting the dover sole as they ate nash seemed to be deliberately trying to keep her mind off erin s death he told her about himself my father made his money in plastics literally lived out that famous line from the graduate then bought a rather garishly ornate mansion in bridgewater he was a decent fine man and every time i wonder why three of us needed twentytwo rooms i remember how happy he was showing them off he touched on his divorce i married the week after i graduated from college terrible mistake for both of us it wasnt a financial problem but medical school especially when it involves the continuing study of psychoanalysis is a long hard road we didnt have time for each other by the end of four years shed had enough sheryl lives in chicago now and has three children it was darcys turn carefully she steered around giving the names of her famous parents jumping quickly to leaving the advertising agency and setting up her budget decorating business somebody once told me im a new version of sanford and son and i guess its true but i love it she thought of the room she was decorating for the recuperating sixteenyearold if he noticed gaps in the background he did not comment the salads arrived just as a producer friend of her parents stopped at the table darcy a warm kiss a hug he introduced himself to michael nash harry curtis he turned back to darcy you get prettier every day i hear your parents are touring in australia hows it going they just got there well give them my love another hug and curtis left for his own table nashs eyes did not signal curiosity thats the way it works with shrinks darcy thought they wait for you to tell them she did not offer an explanation of what curtis had said it was a pleasant dinner nash confessed to two passions riding and tennis theyre what keep me in bridgewater over espresso he returned to the subject of erin s death darcy i dont usually offer advice to people even free advice but i wish youd drop the idea of answering these ads that fbi fellow seemed perfectly competent to me and if im any judge hes not going to rest until whoever murdered erin is paying the price he told me that in so many words i guess we all do what we have to do she managed a smile the last time i spoke to erin she said shed met one nice guy and wouldnt you know it he hadnt called back id bet my bottom dollar it was you he took her home in a cab told the driver to wait and walked her to the door the wind was sharp and he turned so that he was protecting her from its full blast as she turned the key may i call you again id like that for a moment she thought he was going to kiss her cheek but he simply pressed her hand and went back to the waiting cab the wind pulled at the door causing it to close slowly as the lock clicked the sound of footsteps made her turn through the glass she could see the figure of a man rushing up the steps an instant sooner and he would have been in the vestibule with her as she stared at him her mouth too dry to scream len parker pounded at the door kicked it then turned and ran down the block x friday march greta sheridan debated between getting up or trying to sleep for another hour a gusty march wind was rattling the windowpanes and she remembered that chris had been after her to have these windows replaced the earlymorning light filtered through the drawn draperies she loved a cold room for sleeping the quilt and blankets were warm and the blue and white moire canopy gave the bed a comforting enclosed feeling she had been dreaming of nan the anniversary of her death march thirteenth was two weeks away nan had turned nineteen the day before this year she would have been celebrating her thirtyfourth birthday would have been impatiently greta tossed back the covers reached for her velour robe and got up pulling on her slippers she went into the hallway and down the winding staircase to the main floor she understood why chris was concerned it was a large house and it was generally known that she lived alone you dont know how easy it is for a professional to disarm a security system he had warned several times i love this house every room held so many happy memories somehow greta felt that to leave this place would be to leave them as well and she thought with an unconscious smile if chris would finally settle down one of these days and give me some grandchildren it will be a wonderful place for them to visit the times was at the side door as the coffee perked greta began to read there was a brief item on an inside page about that girl whod been found dead in new york last week copycat murder what a horrible thought how could there be two such evil people the one who had snuffed out nan s life and the one who had killed erin kelley would erin kelley still be alive if that program had not been aired and what was it that she had been trying to remember when she insisted on watching it nan nan she thought you told me something that i should have realized was important nan chatting about school her classes her friends her dates nan looking forward to the summer program in france nan who loved to dance i could have danced all night the song could have been written for her erin kelley had also been found wearing one highheeled shoe high heel what was it about those two words impatiently greta opened the times to the crossword puzzle the phone rang it was gregory layton shed met him at the club dinner the other night in his early sixties he was a federal judge and lived in kent about forty miles away an attractive widower priscilla clayburn had whispered to her he was attractive and he was asking her to have dinner with him tonight greta accepted and replaced the receiver realizing that she was looking forward to the evening dorothy came in at the stroke of nine hope you dont have to go out this morning mrs sheridan that wind is mean she was carrying the mail including a bulky package under her arm she laid everything on the table and frowned thats a funnylooking thing i mean no return address i hope its not a bomb or something probably more of that awful crank mail damn that program greta started to pull at the string on the package and had a sudden sense of panic it does look funny let me call glenn moore police chief moore had just arrived in his office at headquarters dont touch that package mrs sheridan he told her crisply well be right over he called the state police they promised to rush a portable security surveillance unit to the sheridan household at ten oclock handling the package with infinite caution an officer in the bomb squad positioned it to be xrayed from the living room to which she and dorothy had been banished greta heard the mans relieved laughter dorothy at her heels she hurried back to the kitchen these wont blow up maam she was assured nothing in there except a pair of mismatched shoes greta saw moore s startled expression felt the blood drain from her face as the package was ripped open revealing a shoe box with the sketch of an evening slipper on the cover the lid came off inside nestled together in tissue were a highheeled sequined slipper and a scuffed running shoe oh nan nan greta did not feel moore grab her as she fainted at three oclock on friday morning darcy was yanked from restless sleep by the insistent ringing of the phone reaching for it she saw the time on the clock radio her hello was quick and breathless darcy her name was whispered the voice sounded familiar but she couldnt place it who is this the whisper became a shout dont you ever close the door in my face again hear me hear me len parker she slammed down the phone pulled the covers around her a moment later the phone began to ring again she did not pick it up the ringing continued fifteen sixteen seventeen rings she knew she should take the receiver off the hook but could not bear to touch it knowing that parker was on the other end finally it stopped she yanked the jack from the wall rushed into the living room and put the answering machine on automatic pickup then hurried back to bed slamming the bedroom door behind her had he done this to erin followed her when she walked out on him maybe followed her to the bar where she was supposed to meet someone named charles north maybe forced her into a car shed call vince dambrosio in the morning for the next two hours she lay awake finally falling into a sleep that once again was troubled with vague restless dreams at seventhirty she awakened with an instant sense of fear then remembered the reason for it a long hot shower relieved some of the tension she pulled on jeans a turtleneck sweater her favorite boots the answering machine showed only hangups juice and coffee at the table by the window staring down into the lifeless garden at eight oclock the phone rang not len parker please her hello was guarded darcy i hope its not too early to call i just wanted to tell you how much i enjoyed being with you last night she exhaled a relieved sigh oh michael i cant tell you how much i enjoyed being with you too something happened what was it the concern in his voice was comforting she told him about len parker the episode on the steps the phone call i blame myself that i didnt see you upstairs please dont darcy call that fbi agent and report this parker character and can i implore you to stop answering those ads im afraid not but i will call vince dambrosio right away when she said goodbye she hung up feeling oddly consoled she called vince from the office a wideeyed bev stood by her desk as she spoke to another agent vince had flown to lancaster the other agent took the information were working with the police department well get right onto that character thanks miss nona phoned and told her why vince had gone to lancaster darce this is so scary its one thing if someone saw that true crimes episode and was perverted enough to repeat it but this means someone may have been doing this for a long time claire barnes has been missing for two years she and erin were so alike she was just about to get her first big break in a broadway musical erin had just gotten her first big break with bertolinis her first big break with bertolinis the words rippled through darcys mind as she made and received phone calls went through connecticut and new jersey papers for notices of estate and moving sales made a quick trip to the rental apartment she was furnishing and finally stopped for a sandwich and coffee at a lunch counter that was where she realized what had been bothering her her first big break with bertolinis erin had told her she was to receive twenty thousand dollars for designing and executing the necklace in the rush of events she forgot about the strange message on erin s answering machine shed call them as soon as she got back to the office to confirm aldo marco came to the phone was this a family member making inquiries im executor of erin kelleys estate the words sounded appalling to her ears payment had already been made to miss kelleys manager jay stratton was there a problem im sure there isnt so stratton presumed to act as erin s manager he was not home the message she left was brusque please call her immediately about erin s check jay stratton phoned just before five oclock im sorry of course i should have gotten to you sooner ive been away how shall i make out the check he told darcy that while he was out of town hed thought of nothing but erin that beautiful talented girl i firmly believe that someone knew about that jewelry killed her for it and then tried to make it look like a copycat murder you of all people knew about the jewelry it was an effort to listen to stratton to respond pleasantly to his sympathetic comments he would be out of town again for a few days she agreed to meet him monday evening for minutes after she said goodbye to him darcy stared straight ahead lost in thought then said aloud after all as you say mr stratton two of erin s closest friends really ought to know each other better she sighed shed better get some work done before it was time to dress for her date with box vince flew to lancaster on the earliest flight friday morning he had urged claire barness father not to tell anyone outside the family about the package of shoes but when he arrived at the airport the local paper had the story in headlines he phoned the barness home and learned from the maid that mrs barnes had been rushed to the hospital last night lawrence barnes was a heavyset executive type who vince decided in other circumstances would have a commanding presence seated at the bedside a young woman next to him he was anxiously looking down at his heavily sedated wife vince showed him his card and was followed out into the corridor barnes introduced the young woman as his other daughter karen a reporter happened to be in the emergency room when we got here barnes said tonelessly he heard emma screaming about the package and that claire was dead where are the shoes now at home karen barnes drove him to get them a corporate lawyer in pittsburgh she had never shared her parents hope that one day claire would suddenly show up there was no way if she were alive she would have given up the chance to be in tommy tunes show the barness home was a large colonial in an impressive neighborhood zoning at least an acre vince thought there was a television mobile unit on the street karen drove quickly past it into the driveway and around to the back of the house a policeman prevented the reporter from stopping her the living room was filled with framed family pictures many of them showing karen and claire in their growingup years karen picked one of them off the piano i took this one of claire the last time i saw her we were in central park just a few weeks before she disappeared slender pretty blond midtwenties joyous smile you can pick em buster vince thought bitterly may i take this ill make copies and get the original right back to you the package was on the foyer table ordinary brown wrapper address label you could buy anywhere block printing postmarked new york city the box had no markings except for a delicately drawn sketch of a highheeled slipper on the lid the mismatched shoes one a white bruno magli sandal the other a gold slingback with an open toe and narrow high heel they were the same size six narrow youre sure this sandal is hers yes i have an identical pair we bought them together that last day in new york how long had your sister been responding to personal ads about six months the police checked out anyone whose ad she had answered at least anyone they could find did she ever place any not that i know of where did she live in new york on west street an apartment in a brownstone my father paid the rent for nearly a year after she disappeared then gave it up where did you put her belongings the furniture wasnt worth shipping her clothes and books and whatever are upstairs in her old room id like to see them there was a cardboard file box on a shelf in the closet i packed that karen told him her address book date book stationery some mail that sort of thing when we reported her missing the new york police went through all her personal papers vince lifted down the box and opened it a date book now two years old was on top he skimmed through it from january till august the pages were filled with appointments claire barnes had not been seen after august fourth what makes it hard is that claire had her own kind of shorthand karen barness voice quavered you see where it says jim that meant jim haworths studio where she took dancing lessons see august fifth tommy that meant rehearsal for the tommy tune show grand hotel shed just been hired vince turned the pages back on july fifteenth at five oclock he saw charley charley in a noncommittal tone he pointed to the entry do you know who this one is no although she did mention a charley who took her dancing once i dont believe the police were able to locate him karen barness face paled that slipper its the sort of thing youd wear to a dance exactly miss barnes keep that name between the two of us please by the way how long had your sister lived in her apartment just about a year before that she had a place in the village where christopher street at christopher street at quarter of five darcy handed bev the last of the bills to be paid and on impulse phoned the mother of the recuperating teenager the girl was coming home at the end of next week the painter darcy hired a cheerful moonlighting security guard was already on the job well have the room all set by wednesday darcy assured the woman thank heaven i had the brains to bring some clothes with me this morning she thought as she changed from her sweater and jeans to an ovalnecked longsleeved black silk blouse a calflength italian silk skirt in tones of green and gold a matching stole gold chain a narrow gold bracelet gold earringsthe jewelry all designed by erin in a crazy way she felt as though she was donning erin s coat of arms as she rode into battle she released her hair from the clip and brushed it loose around her face bev came back just as she finished applying eyeshadow you look fabulous darcy bev hesitated i mean it always seemed to me that you kind of tried to play down your looks and now i mean oh god im not saying it right im sorry erin pretty much said the same thing darcy reassured her she was always bullying me to use more makeup or wear some of the fancy duds my mother sends me bev was wearing a skirt and sweater darcy had seen on her frequently by the way how do erin s clothes fit perfect im so glad to get them the tuition just jumped again and i swear with todays prices i was getting ready to do a scarlett ohara and make a dress out of curtains darcy laughed thats still my favorite scene in gone with the wind look i know i asked you to avoid wearing erin s things to the office but shed be the first to say enjoy them so feel free are you sure darcy reached past the faithful leather jacket for her cashmere cape of course im sure she was meeting box number david weld at the grill at smith and wollenskys at fivethirty hed said hed be at the last seat at the bar or standing near it brown hair brown eyes about six feet tall wearing a dark suit it was easy to pick him out a pleasant guy darcy decided fifteen minutes later as they sat across from each other at one of the small tables born and raised in boston worked for holdens the department store chain had been coming back and forth for the last few years as they expanded into the tristate area she judged him to be in his midthirties then wondered if there was something about that age that sent unattached singles scurrying to the personal ads it was easy to direct the conversation hed gone to northeastern his father and grandfather had been executives with holdens hed worked there from the time he was a kid after school saturdays summer vacations never occurred to me to do anything else he confided retailing runs in the family he had never met erin hed read about her death thats what makes you feel funny placing these ads i mean all i want is to meet some nice people pause youre nice thank you id be very pleased to have dinner with you if you can stay he looked hopeful but the request was made with dignity no ego problem here darcy thought i honestly cant but i bet youve met some nice people answering these ads havent you he smiled a couple of very nice ones one of them if you can believe it just started to work for holdens in the paramus new jersey store shes a buyer same kind of job i had before i went into the management end oh what was that i was shoe buyer for our new england stores vince got back to his office at federal plaza at three oclock friday afternoon there was an urgent message for him to call police chief moore in darien from him vince learned about the package that had arrived at the sheridan home youre sure theyre the mates of the ones nan sheridan was wearing weve compared them we have both sets now has the press gotten hold of this not so far were trying to keep it quiet but no guarantees youve met chris sheridan that was his first concern its mine too vince said quickly what we now know is that this killer started fifteen years ago if not sooner he has to have a reason for sending those shoes back at this time i want to talk to one of our psychiatrists to get his opinion but if anyone questioned about nan sheridans death also can be linked to claire barnes weve got something positive to go on how about erin kelley dont you include her im still keeping an open mind her death may have been connected to the missing jewelry and made to look like a copycat murder vince arranged to pick up the shoes the next day and hung up his assistant ernie cizek a new young agent from colorado briefed him on darcys call about len parker this guys a weirdo cizek said works in maintenance at nyu an electrical whiz can fix anything loner paranoid about money but get this the family is loaded parkers got a hefty income a trustee banks an allowance for him he only made one large withdrawal some years ago the trustee thinks he bought property seems to live on his maintenance salary in a cheap walkup on ninth avenue has an old station wagon no garage he parks it on the street police record same sort of thing that the scott girl complained about following girls home shouting at them banging on doors hes a great one for placing personal ads everybody brushes him off so far no physical attacks restraining orders but no convictions bring him in now ive talked to his shrink he says hes harmless sure hes harmless just like peeping toms supposedly never act out their fantasies we both know better dont we susans announcement that she was planning to take the children to visit her father in guilford connecticut for the weekend was received with eager agreement by her husband doug had made the date to go dancing with the divorced real estate broker and was wondering if he should break it he had been late two nights this week and even though susan had seemed to enjoy their new york dinner on monday night there was something about her attitude that he could not put his finger on susans visiting her father with the kids till sunday gave him two nights off he did not offer to go with her it would have been an empty gesture susans father had never liked him always made cracks about how important doug must be that he worked so many nights funny with all that hard work you needed to borrow so much from me to buy the house doug id be glad to go over your budget with you and see where the problem is sure you would have a good time honey doug told susan when he was leaving on friday morning and give my best to your dad that afternoon while the baby slept susan phoned the investigative agency for a report calmly she took down the information they gave her the meeting with the woman in the soho bar the date theyd made to go dancing the apartment in london terrace under the name douglas fields carter fields is his old buddy she told the investigator theyre two of a kind dont bother to follow him again i dont want to hear any more her father lived yearround in the prerevolutionary house that had been their summer home several heart attacks had left him with a permanent pallor that tore at susans heart but there was nothing fragile about his demeanor or voice after dinner beth and donny went next door to visit friends susan put trish and the baby to bed then fixed demitasse and brought it into the library she knew her father was studying her as she prepared his cup with sweetener and a lemon peel exactly when do i hear the reason for this unexpected although most welcome visit susan smiled now i guess im going to divorce doug her father waited promise not to say i told you so susan prayed silently then went on ive had an investigative agency following him he has a sublet in new york under the name douglas fields calls himself a freelance illustrator doug does sketch very well as you know has plenty of dates in the meantime he rants on to me about how hard he works all those night meetings donny can see through his lies and is angry and contemptuous hell be better off to expect nothing from his father than to keep on hoping that it will change would you like to move in here susan theres plenty of room she flashed him a grateful smile youd go crazy in a week no the scarsdale house is too large doug insisted we buy it to impress the people at the club we couldnt afford it then and im beginning to understand why we cant afford it now ill sell it get a smaller place put the baby in a day care center next yeartheres a terrific one in town then ill get a job it wont be easy itll be a lot better than it is now susan im trying not to say i told you so but there it is that fellow is a born womanizer and hes got a vicious streak remember your eighteenth birthday that night he was so drunk when he brought you home that i threw him out the next morning every window in my car was broken you still cant be sure it was doug come on susan if youre going to start facing facts face them all and tell me this werent you covering for him when he was questioned in that girls death nan sheridan of course nan sheridan doug simply isnt capable susan what time did he pick you up the morning she died seven oclock we wanted to get back to brown for a hockey game susan before she died i got the truth out of grandma you were in tears because you thought doug had stood you up again he got to our place after nine at least grant me the satisfaction of telling the truth now the front door banged shut donny and beth came in donnys face looked relaxed and happy it was becoming a carbon copy of dougs face at that age shed had a crush on doug from their sophomore year in high school susan felt a stab of pain ill never get over him completely she acknowledged doug pleading with her susan my car broke down theyre trying to accuse me they want to blame somebody please say i was here at seven donny came over to kiss her she reached back and smoothed his hair then turned to her father dad come on you know how confused grandma was even back then she didnt know one day from another xi saturday march it was am saturday morning when he got to the place by then his need to be there was overwhelming when he was in the place charley could be his own person no more skulking behind the other one able to dance in synch with astaire smiling down at the phantom in his arms crooning in her ear the wonderful solitude of the place the draperies drawn against the unseemly gaze of a casual interloper the bolts securing him from the outside world the limitless sense of self unrestrained by listeners or observers free to roam in the delicious memories nan claire janine marie sheila leslie annette tina erin all of them smiling at him so glad to be with him never getting the chance to turn on him sneer at him look at him with contempt in the end when they understood it had been so wonderfully satisfying he regretted that he hadnt given nan a chance to realize what was happening to beg leslie and annette had pleaded for their lives marie and tina had cried sometimes the girls came back to him one by one other times they appeared together change partners and dance with me by now the first two packages would have arrived oh if only one could be the proverbial fly on the wall watching the moment when they were opened when the puzzled expression changed to comprehension copycat they wouldnt call him that anymore now had janine been next or marie janine september twentieth two years ago hed send her package now he went to the basement the boxes with the shoes were such an amusing sight pulling on the plastic gloves he always used when he handled anything that belonged to the girls he reached for the one behind the place card marked janine hed send it to her family in white plains his eye lingered on the last place card erin he began to giggle why not send hers now that would really put their copycat notion in the gutter shed told him her father was in a nursing home hed send them to her new york address but suppose no one in her apartment building was smart enough to give the package to the police what a waste to have it gathering dust in some storeroom what about sending the shoes care of the morgue after all that was her last address in new york how funny that would be first make sure to wipe the shoes and boxes thoroughly just to make sure there were absolutely no prints on them get out the identification hed plucked their wallets from their purses then buried the purses wrap fresh tissue around the mismatched sets close the lids he admired his sketches he was getting better the one on erin s box was as good as any professional could do brown wrapping paper sealing tape address label any one of them could have been bought anywhere in the united states he addressed janines package first now it was erin s turn the new york telephone book would give the address of the morgue charley frowned suppose some dumb klutz in the mailroom didnt open it just gave it back to the postman nobody with that name works here without a return address the package would go into the deadletter office there was one other possibility would it be a mistake no not really he giggled again this will certainly keep them guessing he began to print the name of the person he had chosen to receive erin s boot and special slipper darcy scott on saturday darcy met box albert booth for brunch at the victory caf√© she judged him to be about forty in their telephone conversation shed managed to learn that his ad claimed he was a computer expert enjoyed reading skiing golfing waltzing leisurely strolls through museums and listening to records he also said he had a good sense of humor that darcy decided after booth asked her if meeting a box number made her feel boxed in stretched truth to the breaking point by the time she had finished her first cup of coffee she also doubted just about everything else hed claimed except computer expert he had a soft couchpotato look that did not hint of a skier golfer waltzer or walker his conversation consisted solely of the past present and future of computers forty years ago a computer took two big rooms of heavy equipment to do what the one on your desk is doing now i finally bought one just last year he looked shocked over eggs benedict he shared his disgust with the way clever students were manipulating school records by breaking into computer systems they should go to jail for five years and pay a big fine too darcy was sure that desecration of the sanctuary or ark of the temple would not have been any more serious to him over the last cup of coffee he finally finished expounding his theory that future wars would be won or lost by experts able to crack enemy computers change all the figures see what i mean you think you have two thousand nuclear warheads in colorado somebody changes it to two hundred you have armies deployed the statistics change wheres the fifth division the seventh you dont know anymore right right booth smiled suddenly youre a good listener darcy not many girls are good listeners it was the opening she needed ive just started to answer personal ads you certainly meet a variety of people what are most of them like most of them are pretty boring albert leaned across the table listen you want to know who i took out just two weeks ago who that girl who was murdered erin kelley darcy hoped she would not overreact what was she like pretty girl nice she was worried about something darcy gripped her coffee cup did she tell you what was worrying her she sure did she told me she was finishing some necklace and it was her first really big job and as soon as she was paid she was going to look for a new apartment any reason she said the superintendent was always brushing against her when she passed him and making excuses to be in her apartment looking for a water leak a heat blockage that kind of thing she said she supposed he was harmless but it was kind of creepy to walk into her bedroom and find him there i guess it had just happened again the day before i met her dont you think you ought to let the police know about this no way i work for ibm they dont want any of their employees ever to be mentioned in the papers unless theyre getting married or buried i tell the police and they start checking on me right but i wonder do you think i ought to drop them an anonymous note the vast resources of the fbi swung into high gear for the search for the retail outlet where the highheeled evening slipper that had been returned to the home of claire barnes and the one found on erin kelleys body had been purchased in the case of nan sheridan fifteen years ago the police had traced the slipper to a shoe outlet on route in connecticut no one then had had any memory of who had bought it the claire barnes slipper was expensive a charles jourdan sold in fine department stores all over the country two thousand pairs to be exact impossible to trace erin kelleys was a salvatore ferragamo a current model agents and nypd detectives began to fan through department stores shoe salons discount outlets len parker was brought in for questioning he began immediately to rant about how rude darcy had been to him i just wanted to apologize i knew id been mean maybe she did have a dinner date i followed her and she wasnt lying i waited outside in the cold while she ate in that fancy restaurant you just stood there yes and then she got right in a cab with some guy i took one too got out down the block the guy walked her to the door and left i ran up after all i went through to apologize she slammed the door in my face how about erin kelley did you follow her why should i she walked out on me maybe that was my fault i was in a bad mood when i saw her i told her all women were rotten gold diggers then why didnt you admit that to darcy scott when she asked you you denied meeting erin because i knew id end up here you live on ninth avenue and fortyeighth street yes your trustee at the bank thinks you have another residence you withdrew a large sum of money five or six years ago it was my money to spend as i please did you buy another residence prove it on saturday afternoon when he was finished with len parker vince dambrosio drove to christopher street and rang the bell gus boxer his face set in surly lines came to the door he was wearing a longsleeved undershirt tattered suspenders held up shapeless trousers he acted unimpressed by the fbi badge im off duty what do ye want i want to talk to you gus your place or headquarters and drop the righteous indignation i have your file on my desk mr hoffman boxers eyes darted nervously come on in and keep your voice down i wasnt aware id raised it boxer led the way to his groundfloor apartment as vince had expected from the way the man dressed the apartment was a further extension of his personality shabby stained upholstery remnants of a oncebeige rug a rickety table piled with porn magazines vince riffled through them quite a collection you have here any law against it vince slapped down the magazines listen hoffman weve never gotten anything on you but your name has an unhealthy way of coming up on the computer ten years ago you were the super of an apartment where a twentyyearold girl was found dead in the basement i had nothing to do with that shed filed a complaint with the management that she found you in her apartment going through her closet i was looking for a water leak there was a waterpipe in the wall behind that closet thats the same story you gave erin kelley two weeks ago isnt it who said that she told someone that she was going to move as soon as possible because shed found you in her bedroom i was looking for a water leak i know now lets talk about claire barnes how many times did you drop in on her unexpectedly when she lived here never when he left boxer vince went directly to his office arriving there just in time to get a call from hank was it okay if he didnt get in until eight or so there was a basketball game at school and some of the gang were going out for pizza afterward a great kid vince told himself again as he assured hank that was fine worth all the years of trying to make a go of his marriage to alice well at least she was happy now the pampered wife of a guy whose wallet was as fat as his waistline and he id like to meet someone vince admitted to himself then realized that nona robertss face was suddenly filling his mind his assistant ernie told him thered been a break a detective from the midtown north precinct had picked up petey potters the derelict who lived on the pier where erin kelleys body was found they were bringing petey into the precinct for questioning vince turned and ran for the elevators petey was having trouble with his vision seeing double that happened sometimes after hed had a coupla bottles of dago red that meant that instead of three cops he was seeing three sets of twin cops nobodys eyes were friendly petey thought about the dead girl how cold shed felt when hed lifted the necklace what was the cop saying petey there are fingerprints on erin kelleys throat were going to compare them with yours through a haze petey thought of one of his friends whod happened to stab a guy he was in prison for five years now and the guy he stabbed had hardly been scratched petey had never been in trouble with the cops never he wouldnt hurt a fly he told them that he could tell they didnt believe him look he volunteered in a burst of confidence i found that girl i didnt have enough money to buy even a cuppa coffee tears formed in his eyes at the memory of how thirsty hed been i could tell the necklace was real gold it had a long chain with lots of fancy coins attached figured if i didnt take it the first guy who found her would including some cops ive heard about he was sorry hed added that whatd you do with the necklace petey sold it for twentyfive bucks to that big dude who works seventh avenue around central park south buyandsell bert one of the cops remarked well pick him up when did you find the body petey vince asked when i woke up late morning petey squinted his eyes took on a crafty expression everything was coming into focus but real early i mean when it was still pitch dark i heard a car drive onto the pier pass my place and stop i figured it might be a drug deal so i stayed inside honest even when you knew it was driving away one of the detectives asked you didnt even peek well when i was sure it was going did you get a look at it petey they believed him he knew it if he could only tell them something else to make them feel like he was trying to cooperate petey forced the alcoholic haze to retreat for a split second from his brain all the days of standing with a bottle of sudsy water and a squeegee at the fiftysixth street exit of the west side highway rushed through his mind hed had plenty of chance to know what the backs of cars looked like again he could see the taillights of the car disappearing off the pier something about the rear window it was a station wagon he said with a triumphant wheeze on birdies grave it was a station wagon as the haze rushed back petey had to force himself not to cackle birdie was probably still alive darcy and nona had planned to have dinner together on saturday night other friends were calling inviting her to join them but darcy was in no mood yet to see anyone they arranged to meet at jimmy nearys restaurant on east fiftyseventh street darcy arrived first jimmy had saved the left back corner table for them a damn shame he said as he greeted darcy erin was one of the prettiest lasses ever to walk through this door god rest her he patted darcys hand you were a grand friend to her and dont think i dont know it sometimes when shed come in for a quick bite id sit with her for the moment i told her to watch her step answering those crazy ads darcy smiled im surprised she told you about them jimmy shed have known you wouldnt approve be sure i didnt she reached in her jacket pocket for a handkerchief last month and pulled out one that shed torn from a magazine it fell to the floor and when i picked it up it caught my eye i said to her erin kelley i hope youre not into that foolishness thats what im afraid of darcy told him erin was a fabulous jewelry designer but not much of a record keeper the fbi is trying to trace anyone erin wrote to or met but im sure the list isnt complete darcy decided against saying that she was also answering personal ads do you remember what that ad said nearys brow furrowed in thought no but i got a fair glance at it and i will something about singing orah itll come look heres nona and she has someone with her vince followed nona to the table im only going to stop by for a minute he told darcy i dont want to interfere with your dinner but i was trying to reach you phoned nona and found out you were here its fine and i wish youd stay darcy noticed that nonas eyes had a brightness she had never seen in them before you got the message about erin s telling one of her dates that shed found the superintendent in her apartment again i saw boxer today vince raised an eyebrow again erin told me he pulled that last year but she always dismissed him as being harmless apparently as of two weeks ago she changed her mind were following up on him as well as other people id like to hear about the guy from last night he was a nice guy liz came to take their orders she gave darcy a quick sympathetic smile she always took such good care of us darcy thought she had told erin that growing up in ireland shed been a redhead too dubonnet for darcy and nona a beer for vince darcy and nona decided on the red snapper nona said crisply to vince youve got to eat sometime he ordered the corned beef and cabbage vince got back to darcys other date i want to know about everybody you met youve already seen two who admitted knowing erin please let me decide on who is or isnt important she told him about david weld hes an executive from boston with the holden chain i gather hes been back and forth to new york for the last few years as they opened new stores she felt as though she could read vince dambrosios mind back and forth to new york for the last two years darcy said the one thing that did strike me is that hes been a shoe buyer shoe buyer whats this guys name vince made a note in his book david weld box believe me well check him out darcy nona told you about the shoes that were returned to the parents of the girl from lancaster yes he hesitated glanced around and saw that the people at the next table were absorbed in their own conversation were trying to keep this one quiet another pair of mismatched shoes were delivered yesterday they were the mates of the ones nan sheridan was found wearing fifteen years ago darcy gripped the table then erin s death may not be a copycat crime we just dont know were digging to see if anyone who knew claire barnes also knew nan sheridan and erin nona asked that would of course clinch the fact we have another ted bundy whos been getting away with serial murders for years vince put down his fork ive got to tell it to you straight a lot of people who answer these ads turn out to be a far different cry from the way they describe themselves all the young women our computer targeted as being possible serialkiller victims are in your age bracket in your intelligence bracket in your looks bracket in other words our killer may date fifty girls and then one turns him on i know i cant dissuade you from answering these ads frankly youve turned up some mighty interesting people for us to investigate nevertheless youre not trained to be a decoy youre a thoroughly nice vulnerable young woman who doesnt have the ability to protect herself if she suddenly finds that shes painted into a corner i dont intend to let myself get painted into a corner vince had a quick coffee and left he explained that his son hank was coming in on a train from long island and he wanted to be in the apartment when he arrived nonas eyes followed him as he stopped to pay the check did you notice his tie she asked today it was a blue and black check with a brown tweed jacket so surely that doesnt bother you no i like it vince dambrosio is so determined to find whoever killed these girls that i swear he blocks out anything unimportant i happened to call the barnes home in lancaster just after they opened the package with the shoes and i tell you hearing them broke my heart today i called nan sheridans brother to ask him to be on the program i could hear that same pain in his voice oh darcy please god be careful xii sunday march on sunday morning at nine oclock michael nash phoned ive been thinking about you even worrying about you hows it going she had slept reasonably well okay i guess up to a drive to bridgewater new jersey and an early dinner he did not wait for her to answer in case you havent looked out the window its a beautiful day really feels like spring my housekeeper is a great cook and has to be treated for frustration if i dont bring company home at least once over the weekend somehow she had dreaded this day if they didnt have other plans she and erin had often met for brunch on sundays and spent the afternoon at lincoln center or in a museum that sounds fine they arranged that hed pick her up at eleventhirty and dont get all gussied up in fact if you like to ride wear a pair of jeans ive got a couple of darn good horses i love to ride his car was a twoseater mercedes very fancy darcy said nash was wearing a turtleneck sport shirt jeans a herringbone jacket the other night at dinner shed had the impression of how kind his eyes were today they were still kind but there was something else maybe she told herself just the look a guy got when he was interested in a woman darcy realized that the thought pleased her the drive was pleasant as they progressed south on route the suburbs disappeared houses that could be glimpsed from the road were now farther and farther apart nash talked with affectionate warmth about his parents to paraphrase that old commercial my father made his money the oldfashioned way he earned it he was just starting to hit it big when i was born for ten years we moved every year one house larger than the other until he bought the present place when i was eleven as i told you my tastes are somewhat simpler but god he was so proud the day we moved in carried my mother over the threshold somehow it was easy to talk with michael nash about her famous parents and the belair mansion i always felt like a changeling there as though the princess daughter of the royal couple must be living in a cottage and i was an impostor in her place however did two such stunning people manage to produce that mousylooking child erin was the only one who knew about that now darcy found herself telling michael nash then she added hey this is sunday youre off duty doctor be careful youve got a way of being too good a listener he glanced at her and when you grew up you never looked in the mirror and realized what an outrageous statement that was should i have i would say so he was steering the car off the highway through the quaint town along a country road the fence starts the property it was a full minute before they turned into the gate my god how many acres do you have four hundred at the le cirque dinner he had said the house was too ornate darcy silently agreed but nevertheless decided that it was an imposing and substantial mansion the trees and plants were still bare of leaves and flowers but the evergreens that edged the long driveway were full and luxuriant if you decide youve enjoyed yourself and come back next month the grounds will be worth the trip nash commented mrs hughes the housekeeper had prepared a light lunch sandwiches quartered with the crusts cut offchicken ham and cheesethen cookies coffee she looked approvingly at darcy severely at michael i hope this is enough miss doctor said that since youll be having an early dinner i mustnt overdo now its perfect darcy told her sincerely they ate in the breakfast room off the kitchen michael then gave her a quick tour of the house interiordecorator picture perfect he said dont you agree antiques that cost a fortune i suspect half of them are fakes someday ill change everything but for now it just isnt worth the effort unless im having guests i live in the study here we are now this is a comfortable room darcy said with real pleasure warm livedin wonderful view good lighting its the kind of look i try to give a place when i refurbish you really havent told me much about your job i want to hear but how about that ride now john has the horses ready darcy had begun riding when she was three it was one of the few activities she had not shared with erin she was afraid of horses darcy told michael as she swung onto the coalblack mare then riding wont be memory lane for you today thats good the air fresh and clean seemed to at last cleanse the scent of funeral flowers from her nostrils they cantered across michaels property slowed the horses to a walk as they went across town joined other riders whom he introduced as his neighbors at six oclock they had dinner in the small dining room the temperature had dropped a fire was blazing the white wine chilling a decanter of red wine on the sideboard john hughes now in uniform served the beautifully prepared meal crabmeat cocktail veal medallions tiny asparagus roast potatoes green salad with pepper cheese sherbet espresso darcy sighed as she sipped the coffee i cant thank you enough if id been home by myself all day it would have been pretty rough if id been here alone all day it would have been pretty boring she could not help overhearing mrs hughes comment to her husband as they were leaving now there is one lovely girl i hope doctor brings her back xiii monday march on monday evening jay stratton met merrill ashton in the oak bar of the plaza the bracelet a band of diamonds in a charming victorian setting won ashtons instant approval frances is just going to love that he enthused im sure glad you convinced me to order it for her i knew youd be pleased your wife is a very pretty woman that bracelet will look lovely on her arm as i told you i want you to have it appraised when you get home if the jeweler tells you its worth one cent less than forty thousand dollars the deal is off in fact hell undoubtedly tell you that you drove a hard bargain but the fact is that im hoping that next christmas youll think of another piece for frances a diamond necklace diamond earrings well see so this is your loss leader for me ashton chuckled as he reached for his checkbook thats good business jay felt the peculiar thrill that came with taking risks any decent jeweler would tell ashton that at fifty thousand the bracelet would still be a bargain tomorrow he had a lunch date with enid armstrong he couldnt wait to get his hands on her ring thank you erin he thought as he accepted the check ashton invited jay to have a quick bite before he left for the airport he was taking a plane home to winstonsalem stratton explained that he was meeting a client at seven he did not add that darcy scott was hardly the kind of client he wanted he had a check in his pocket for seventeen thousand five hundred dollars the twenty thousand from bertolini less his commission effusive goodbyes give my very best to frances i know how happy youll make her stratton did not notice another man quietly leave a nearby table and follow merrill ashton into the lobby if i may have a word with you sir ashton accepted the card that was offered to him nigel bruce lloyds of london i dont understand ashton sputtered sir if mr stratton comes out i dont want to be observed would you mind if we step into the jewelry shop right over there one of our experts will meet us wed like to have a look at the jewelry you just purchased the investigator took pity on ashtons bewildered expression its routine routine are you suggesting that the bracelet i just bought was stolen im not suggesting anything sir the hell youre not well if theres anything funny about this bracelet i want to know right now that check isnt certified i can have payment stopped in the morning the investigative reporter for the new york post had done his job well somehow he managed to learn that a package had been delivered to nan sheridans home and that it contained the mates of the mismatched shoes shed been wearing when her body was found nan sheridans picture erin s picture claire barness picture splashed side by side on the front page serial killer on the loose darcy read the paper in a cab on the way to the plaza here we are miss what oh all right thank you she was glad that she had had walltowall appointments that day once again she had brought clothes to the office this time she changed into the red wool rodeo drive ensemble as she got out of the cab she remembered that shed worn this outfit the last time she spoke to erin if only id seen her just once more she thought it was ten of seven a bit early for her meeting with jay stratton darcy decided to pop into the oak room fred the ma√Ætre d of the restaurant was an old friend ever since she could remember when she and her parents had come to new york they had stayed at the plaza something michael nash had said yesterday was gnawing at her hadnt he been suggesting that she was still harboring a childs resentment at a careless even cruel remark that had no present validity she found herself looking forward to the next time she saw nash i suppose its like getting a free consultation but id like to ask him about it she acknowledged as a beaming fred rushed to greet her promptly at seven she went next door to the bar jay stratton was at a corner table the only other time she had met him had been at erin s apartment her first impression had been distinctly unfavorable hed been angry about the missing bertolini necklace then after it was found switched to a display of anxiety over the missing pouch of diamonds hed been infinitely more concerned about the necklace than about the fact that erin was missing tonight it was like being with a different person he was really trying to turn on the charm somehow she was sure shed seen the real jay stratton the first time she asked him where he had met erin dont laugh she happened to answer a personal ad i placed i knew her casually and called her one of those serendipity things bertolini had asked me about resetting those jewels and when i read erin s letter i remembered that wonderful piece she did that won the nw ayer award and so we got together it was strictly business although she did ask me to escort her to a benefit a client had given her the tickets we danced the night away why had he felt it necessary to add strictly business darcy wondered and would it have been strictly business for erin only six months ago erin had said almost wistfully you know darce im at the point where id really like to meet some nice guy and fall madly in love the jay stratton who was sitting across the table attentive handsome able to understand erin s talent might well have fit the bill what ad of yours did she answer stratton shrugged frankly i place so many of them i forget he smiled you look shocked darcy ill explain to you what i explained to erin i will marry a very rich woman someday i havent met her yet but be assured i will i meet many women through these ads it is not very difficult to persuade older women ever so gently to relieve their loneliness by treating themselves to a particularly beautiful piece of jewelry or by resetting their own rings necklaces or bracelets theyre happy im happy why are you telling me this darcy asked i hope its not your way of letting me down easily i didnt think of tonight as a date for me its strictly business stratton shook his head god forbid i should be so presumptuous im telling you exactly what i told erin after she explained to me her purpose in answering the ads your producer friends documentary isnt it yes what im trying to say and probably not doing it very well is that there was no romantic spark between erin and me the next point id like to make is to profoundly apologize for my behavior the first time we met bertolini is a valued client of mine id never worked with erin before i didnt know her well enough to be totally sure that she wouldnt go away on a whim and forget the deadline for delivery believe me ive had very uncomfortable moments of communing with myself and realizing the impression i must have made on you when you were heartsick with worry about your missing friend and i was talking client deadlines a wonderful speech darcy thought i should warn him ive lived most of my life with two of the best actors in this country she wondered if it would be appropriate to burst into applause instead she said you do have the check for the necklace yes i didnt know how to make it out do you think estate of erin kelley will be appropriate estate of erin kelley all the years erin had cheerfully done without the things that most of their friends considered essential so proud that she could keep her father in a private nursing home just on the threshold of major success swallowing over a lump in her throat darcy said that will do she looked down at the check seventeen thousand five hundred dollars made out to the estate of erin kelley drawn on chase manhattan bank and signed by jay charles stratton xiv tuesday march on tuesday morning when agent dambrosio entered sheridan galleries he took a quick look around before he was ushered upstairs to chris sheridans office the furniture reminded him of the contents of nona robertss living room funny one of the things that had always been on his list was to take courses in art and antique furniture the bureaus art theft program had only whetted his appetite in that area in the meantime vince thought as he followed a secretary down the corridor i live with alice s mistakes at the time of the divorce hed gotten tired of expecting a fair shake from her take what you want if its so important to you hed offered shed certainly taken him at his word sheridan was on the phone he smiled and waved vince to a seat without appearing to be paying attention vince took in the conversation something about a collection being wildly overvalued sheridan was saying tell lord kilman that they may promise him that amount but they cant deliver well be happy to set reasonable opening bids the market isnt as strong as it was a few years ago but is he prepared to wait it out another three to five years otherwise i think if he looks carefully at our estimates hell realize that many of the pieces he acquired fairly recently will still turn him a handsome profit confident knowledgeable innate warmth that was the way vince had sized up chris sheridan last week when hed gone to darien at that time sheridan had been wearing a sports shirt and windbreaker today he was dressed in a charcoal gray suit white shirt red and gray tie very much the executive chris hung up and reached across the desk to shake hands vince apologized for giving him such short notice and got right to the point when i saw you last week i was pretty sure that erin kelleys death was a copycat murder because of the true crimes program about your sister im not sure about that anymore he told him about claire barnes and the package that had been returned to her home chris listened attentively another one it seemed to vince that all the residual pain of his sisters murder was in those two words is there anything i can do to help chris asked i dont know vince said frankly whoever killed your sister must have known her the matching shoe size cant be a coincidence we have three possibilities the same murderer has continued to kill young women all through these years the same murderer stopped killing and started again several years ago the third possibility is that nan s murderer confided his modus operandi to someone else who decided to take over the last one is the least likely then youre going to try to connect someone whom nan knew to someone these other women knew exactly although in erin kelleys case because of the missing diamonds there is still a possibility that we have a different culprit thats why were planning to explore both avenues the reason im here is that im going to try to link one person with nan erin kelley and claire barnes someone who knew my sister fifteen years ago and recently met those girls through personal ads youve got it darcy scott was erin kelleys closest friend theyd been answering the ads only because a television producer friend is doing a documentary and asked them to take part in the research darcy was out of town for a month she gave erin a sample of the letter she was sending and some photographs we know erin answered some of those ads for both of them darcy scott is hoping that whoever killed erin will contact her chris frowned you mean youre allowing another young woman to be set up as a possible victim vince raised his hand as though to wave away the suggestion you dont know darcy scott im not allowing anything its what shes determined to do the one thing i have to grant her is shes already met some pretty interesting characters and come up with information that might be helpful i still think its a lousy idea chris said flatly so do i and now that weve established that heres how i hope you can help the faster we get this guy the less chance darcy scott or some other young woman might get hurt were going to brown to get a roster of everyone who was in the student body or on the faculty when your sister was there well check those names against anyone we know erin met or darcy meets on these dates i also think it would be a good idea if besides the school yearbooks that we can get ourselves you dig out any snapshots albums whatever of your sisters friends or acquaintances youve got to understand that not everybody who answers a personal ad uses his own name i want darcy scott to look over nan s pictures to see if she can spot anyone she meets along the way of course weve got endless snapshots of nan chris said slowly ten years ago after my father died i managed to persuade my mother to pack up most of them and put them in the attic mother admitted that nan s room was getting to be a shrine good for you vince said you must have been pretty persuasive chris smiled quickly i pointed out that it was one of the brightest rooms in the house and would be great for a visiting grandchild someday the problem is as my mother frequently reminds me i havent delivered the smile disappeared i cant get up to connecticut until the weekend ill bring everything down on sunday vince stood up i appreciate this i know how tough this has been on your mother but if it turns out that we find the guy who was responsible for your sisters death believe me in the long run it will give her a lot of peace as he turned to go his beeper sounded do you mind if i call my office sheridan handed him the phone watched as dambrosios forehead furrowed how is darcy chris sheridan felt a cold wave of apprehension he didnt know this girl but experienced a sudden unreasoning fear for her he had never told anyone that when nan went for a jog the morning after their birthday party he had heard her go out still half asleep hed started to get up some instinct was urging him to follow her hed shrugged it off and gone back to sleep vince hung up the phone and turned back to chris is there any way you could possibly get those pictures immediately the white plains police phoned the father of janine wetzl another one of the missing girls just received the sort of package your mother and the barnes family got her own shoe and a highheeled white satin slipper he slapped his hand on the table and while one agent was taking that call darcy scott phoned she had just opened a package that came in the morning mail the mates of the shoes found on erin kelleys body were sent to her chris knew that the frustrated anger he saw on agent dambrosios face mirrored his own expression why the hell is he doing this chris blurted to prove the girls are dead to taunt what makes him tick when i know that ill know who he is vince said quietly and now do you mind if i use your phone again i have to call darcy scott from the moment darcy saw the package shed known the mailman arrived just as she was leaving for work hed handed her the package and the letters and magazines and junk mail afterward darcy remembered that hed looked puzzled when she did not respond to his greeting like an automaton shed walked stiffly upstairs to her apartment and laid the package on the table by the window deliberately keeping her gloves on she opened it unknotting the twine and slitting the sealing tape at the flaps the sketch of the slipper on the lid remove the lid separate the tissue look down at erin s boot and a pink and silver slipper nestled together the slipper is so pretty she thought it would have gone beautifully with the dress erin was buried in she did not have to look up vince dambrosios number her brain produced it effortlessly he was not there but they promised to locate him can you wait for him yes he called a few minutes later was at the apartment within half an hour this is rough for you i touched the heel of the slipper with my glove she confessed i simply had to know if it was erin s size it was vince looked at her compassionately maybe you should take it easy today darcy shook her head that would be the worst thing in the world for me to do she attempted a smile ive got a big project scheduled and then guess what i have a date tonight when vince left with the package darcy went directly to the newly purchased hotel on west twentythird street small a total of thirty guest rooms rundown badly in need of paint it still had tremendous possibilities the owners a couple in their late thirties explained that the cost of basic repairs would leave very little for refurbishing they were delighted with her suggestion that they decorate in the style of an english country inn i can get plenty of sofas and upholstered chairs and lamps and tables in very good condition at private sales shed told them we can give this place a lot of charm look at the algonquin the most intimate bar in manhattan and youd be hard put to find a chair that isnt threadbare she walked through the rooms with them making notes on their various sizes and shapes and marking what furniture was usable the day passed quickly she had intended to go home and change for her date but then decided against it when doug fields called to reconfirm hed told her that he dressed casually slacks and a sweater are pretty much a uniform for me they were meeting at six at the twentythird street bar and grill darcy got there exactly on time doug fields was fifteen minutes late he burst into the bar clearly irritated and filled with apologies i swear ive never seen this block so messed up so many cars youd swear it was an assembly line in detroit im so sorry darcy i never keep people waiting its a thing with me it really doesnt matter hes goodlooking darcy thought attractive why had he found it necessary to immediately insist that he never kept people waiting over a glass of wine she listened to him on two levels he was amusing selfconfident wellspoken extremely likable hed been raised in virginia went to the university there dropped out of law school id have made a lousy lawyer dont have enough of the go for the jugular go for the jugular darcy thought of the bruises on erin s throat switched to art school pointed out to my father that instead of cracking the books i was doing caricatures of the profs it was a good decision i love illustrating and do well at it theres an old saying if you want to be happy for a year win the lottery if you want to be happy for life love what you do darcy hoped she sounded relaxed this was the kind of guy erin would have enjoyed meeting the kind who after a date or two she would have trusted an artist the sketch was everybody suspect the inevitable question came why would a pretty girl like you need to answer personal ads this time the question was easy to parry why would a goodlooking successful guy like you need to place personal ads thats easy he said promptly i was married for eight years and now im not im not interested in getting serious you get introduced to somebody at a friends house take her out a few times and bingo everybodys looking at the two of you waiting for the big announcement this way i meet a lot of nice women lay the cards on the table just like this and see if it clicks tell me how many dates from ads have you had this week youre the first one last week then starting with monday monday i was standing over erin s casket darcy thought tuesday i was watching that casket being lowered wednesday i was home watching the reenactment of nan sheridans murder thursday she had met len parker friday david weld the mildmannered rather shy man who described himself as a department store executive and claimed not to have known erin saturday albert booth a computer analyst who was enthralled with the wonders of desktop publishing and who knew erin was frightened of her superintendent oh come on admit you had dates last week doug urged i called you wednesday and you werent free until tonight startled darcy realized that a number of times recently someone had to repeat a question im sorry yes i did go out a couple of times last week and had fun she thought of len parker pounding on the door you could call it that he laughed that speaks volumes ive met some winners too now youve gotten my life history how about telling me about yourself she gave a carefully edited version doug raised one eyebrow i sense a lot of omissions but maybe when you get to know me a bit better youll fill me in she refused a second glass of wine i really have to be going he did not argue actually i do too when am i going to see you again darcy tomorrow night lets make it dinner i really am busy thursday im working on a job thats going to tie me up will you call in a few days yes and if you keep turning me down i promise i wont persist but i hope you dont he really is nice darcy thought or else hes a heck of a good actor doug put her in a cab then quickly waved one down for himself in the apartment he tore off the sweater and slacks and rushed into the suit hed worn to the office at quarter of eight he was on the train to scarsdale at quarter of nine he was reading a bedtime story to trish while susan broiled a steak for him she certainly understood how maddening these late meetings were you work too hard doug dear she had said soothingly when he stamped into the house ranting about missing the earlier train by a hairbreadth through hours of intense questioning jay stratton remained calm his only explanation for the diamonds in the bracelet that he had sold to merrill ashton was that it must have been a ghastly error erin kelley had been commissioned to create settings for a number of fine diamonds stratton claimed that somehow he had made a mistake and inadvertently substituted other fine stones for some of the ones that were meant to be in the diamond pouch he had given kelley that was not to say that those others were not of equal value take a look at his various insurance policies a search warrant revealed no other missing diamonds in his apartment or in his safety deposit box he was booked on suspicion of receiving stolen goods and bail was set disdainfully he strode from the precinct with his lawyer vince had shared the interrogation with detectives from the sixth precinct they all knew he was guilty but as vince said there goes one of the most convincing con men ive ever come across and believe me ive run into a lot of them the crazy thing vince thought as he left for his office is that darcy scott ends up being a witness for stratton shed opened the safe for him and would swear that the pouch wasnt there and of course the big question was would stratton have had the nerve to claim those diamonds were missing unless he knew that erin kelley would never show up to say what happened to them in the office vince snapped out orders i want to know everything and i mean everything about jay stratton jay charles stratton xv wednesday march chris sheridan studied darcy scott liking what he saw she was wearing a leather jacket belted at the waist tan slacks that disappeared into scuffed but fine leather boots a knotted silk scarf that accentuated the hollow in the nape of her neck her brown hair darted with blond highlights was soft and loose around her face hazel eyes soft brown flecked with green were framed by dark lashes charcoal brows accentuated her porcelain complexion he judged her to be in her late twenties she reminds me of nan the realization shocked him but they dont look alike he thought nan had been the typical nordic beauty with her pink and white skin vivid blue eyes hair the color of daffodils then where was the resemblance it was in the absolute grace with which darcy moved nan had walked like that as though if music began to play she would glide into a dance step darcy was aware of chris sheridans scrutiny she had been making some observations of her own she liked his strong features the slight bump on the bridge of his nose probably the result of a break the width of his shoulders and an overall impression of disciplined fitness suggested athletic prowess a few years ago her mother and father had both had plastic surgery a nip here a tuck there her mother had said laughing dont look so disapproving darling darcy remember our looks are an important part of our stock in trade how totally irrelevant to remember that now darcy thought was she simply trying to escape the delayed shock of opening the package with erin s boot and the dancing slipper shed been composed all day yesterday then woke up this morning at four oclock to find her face and pillow wet with tears she bit her lip at the memory but could not prevent new tears from welling in her eyes im sorry she said quickly and tried to sound brisk it was good of you to go to connecticut for the pictures last night vince dambrosio told me you had to change your plans they werent important chris sensed that darcy scott wanted him to ignore her distress theres an awful lot of stuff he said matteroffactly i have it laid out on a table in the conference room my suggestion is that you take a look at it if you want to bring everything home or to your office i can have it delivered if you want part of it we can arrange that too i know most of the people in the pictures some of course i dont anyhow lets take a look they went downstairs darcy realized that in the fifteen minutes shed been in chris sheridans office the crowd inspecting the items for the next auction had increased substantially she loved auctions growing up she had regularly gone to them with the dealer representing her parents they never could go themselves if either one of them was known to be interested in acquiring a painting or antique the price shot up instantly it was hearing her mother and father recite the history of their acquisitions that made her uncomfortable she was walking next to sheridan toward the rear of the building when she spotted a cylinder writing desk and darted over to it is this really a roentgen chris ran his hand over the mahogany surface yes it is you know your antiques are you in the business darcy thought of the roentgen in the library of the belair house her mother loved to tell the story of how marie antoinette had sent it to vienna as a gift to her mother the empress which was why it had escaped being sold during the french revolution this one had obviously been shipped out of france as well are you in the business chris repeated oh im sorry darcy smiled thinking of the hotel she was refurbishing with garage sale trappings in a way you could say that chris raised his eyebrows but did not ask for an explanation down this way a wide foyer led to a doubledoored room inside a protective cloth covered a georgian banquet table albums yearbooks framed pictures snapshots and carousels of slides were neatly placed rowlike on the table dont forget these were all taken somewhere between fifteen and eighteen years ago sheridan warned i know darcy considered the mass of material how much do you use this room not that often then would it be possible to leave everything here and let me come in and out the thing is when im in the office im always busy my apartment isnt large and anyhow im not there very much chris knew it was none of his business but could not stop himself agent dambrosio told me you were answering personal ads he watched the withdrawal in darcy scotts expression erin didnt want to answer those ads darcy said i persuaded her the only way i can possibly atone for that is to try to help find her killer is it all right if i come back and forth i promise i wont bother you or your staff chris realized what vince dambrosio had meant when he said that darcy scott was going to do what she wanted about the personal ads you wont be any bother one of the secretaries is always here by eight the cleaning staff is around until ten at night ill leave word for them to let you in better yet let me give you a key darcy smiled i promise not to make off with a s√®vres is it okay if i stay for a while now i have a few hours free of course and remember i know many of those people try me if you want a name at threethirty sheridan returned followed by a maid carrying a tea tray i thought you might need a break ill join you if i may that would be fine darcy realized she had a vague headache and remembered she had skipped lunch she accepted a cup of tea poured a few drops of milk from the delicate limoges pitcher and tried not to look too anxious as she reached for a sugar cookie she waited until the maid left then commented i know how hard it must have been for you to put all this together memory lane is pretty shattering my mother did most of it she surprises me she fainted when that package of shoes arrived but now whatever she can do to track down nan s killer and to stop him from harming anyone else is all she cares about and you nan was six minutes older than i she never let me forget it called me little brother she was outgoing i was shy we kind of balanced each other long ago i gave up the hope of seeing her killer in court now that hope is within reach again he looked at the stack of pictures she had separated anyone you know darcy shook her head not so far at quarter of five she poked her head in his office im running along now chris jumped up heres the key i meant to give it to you when i came down darcy pocketed it ill probably come back early in the morning chris could not resist have you got one of those dates now im sorry i have no right to ask im only concerned because i think its so dangerous this time he was glad to see darcy scott did not stiffen she simply said ill be fine and with a halfwave left him he stared after her remembering the one time he had gone hunting the doe had been drinking water from a stream sensing danger it had lifted its head listening poised for flight an instant later it sank to the ground he had not joined in the exultant cheers the others in the party accorded the marksman his instinct had been to shout a warning to the deer that same instinct was crying out to him now hows the program going vince asked nona as he tried to find a comfortable spot on the green love seat in her office it is and it isnt nona sighed wearily she ran a hand through her hair the hardest thing is to find a balance when you wrote and asked me to include a segment about the possible dangers of answering those ads i had no idea what the next week would bring i still think my original concept is right i want to give an overall picture and then end with a warning she smiled at him im glad you called and suggested pasta it had been a long day at fourthirty vince had had a brainstorm hed had a list made of the dates the eight young women had disappeared and ordered researchers to start collecting personal ads from new york area newspapers and magazines that had appeared three months previous to those dates a sense of accomplishment at the new possible lead had made him realize that he was gutlevel tired the thought of going back to the apartment and finding some food in the neglected refrigerator had been depressing instead almost inadvertently hed reached for the phone and dialed nona now it was seven oclock hed just arrived at her office and nona was ready to pack it in the phone rang nona raised her eyes to heaven reached for it and identified herself vince watched as her expression changed youre right matt always a safe bet that youll find me here what can i do for you she listened matt get it straight im not in the market to buy you out not today not tomorrow if youll remember last year when we had a buyer you didnt think it was enough the usual now i can wait you can wait what the heck is the rush does jeanie need braces or something nona laughed as she hung up that was the man i promised to love honor and cherish all the days of my life trouble is he forgot to remember its been known to happen they went to pasta lovers on west fiftyeighth street i duck in here a lot when im by myself nona told him wait till you taste the pasta it would drive anyones blues away a glass of red wine the salad warm bread its the connection vince heard himself saying theres got to be a connection between one man and all those girls i thought you were convinced that except for nan sheridan the connection is the personal ads it is but dont you see he cant just happen to have the rightsized slipper for each one of them granted he could have bought the slippers after he killed the girls but he certainly had the one he left on nan sheridans foot with him when he attacked her this type of killer usually follows a pattern so youre talking about someone who met these girls somehow managed to learn their shoe size without any of them getting bad vibes and then was able to get them in a situation where they disappeared without a trace youve got it over linguine with clam sauce he told her about his plan to analyze personal ads that had been placed in the new york area in the three months before each of the women disappeared to see if the same one showed up and of course that could be another dead end he acknowledged for all we know the same guy is placing a dozen different ads they both ordered decaf cappuccino nona began talking about the documentary i still havent settled on a psychiatrist she said i certainly dont want to get one of those professional showbiz experts who pop up whenever you turn the dial vince told her about michael nash very articulate guy writing a book about personal ads hed met erin darcy told me about him a very good idea agent dambrosio vince took nona home in a cab and had it wait while he saw her inside her building i have a hunch were both pretty beat he said in answer to her suggestion of a nightcap but please give me a raincheck youve got it nona grinned i am tired and anyhow my cleaning woman hasnt been around since last friday i dont think youre ready for the real me it was all vince could do to remember that he was technically on the job that did not stop him from wondering how it would feel to hold nona roberts in his arms back at his apartment there was a message on his answering machine ernie his assistant no emergency but i thought youd be interested in hearing this vince we have the roster of students from brown for the time nan sheridan was there guess who was a returning student and in some of her classes none other than our friend the jeweler jay stratton darcys fivethirty date was to meet box cal griffin in the bar at tavern on the green hes not in his early thirties was her first impression griffin was closer to fifty a beefy man who combed his hair across the top of his head to conceal his bald spot he was expensively and conservatively dressed he was from milwaukee but as he explained got into new york regularly a suggestive wink followed dont get him wrong he was a happily married man but when he came in on business it would sure be good to have a friend another wink believe you me he knew how to treat a woman what show havent you seen he knew how to get house seats whats your favorite restaurant lut√®ce expensive but worth every penny darcy managed to ask him the last time hed been in new york too long last month hed taken the wife and kidsgreat teenagers but you know teenagersskiing in vail they had a house there they were building a bigger place moneys no object anyhow the kids brought their friends and it was bedlam that rock and roll stuff drive you crazy wouldnt it they had a great stereo system in the house darcy had ordered a perrier halfway through it she made a business of glancing at her watch my boss was real mad at me for leaving she said im going to have to cut this short forget him griffin ordered you and i are going to have a nice night they were sitting at a banquette a beefy arm went around her a moist kiss was planted on her ear darcy did not want to make a scene oh my god she said pointing to a nearby table where a man was sitting alone his back to them thats my husband ive got to get out of here the arm disappeared from around her waist griffin looked shaken i dont want trouble ill just slip away darcy whispered on the way home in the cab she tried not to laugh out loud well one things for sureits not that one the phone was ringing as she turned her key in the lock it was doug fields hi darcy why are you so unforgettable i know you said you were busy tonight but my plans changed and i decided to take a chance how about a hamburger at pj clarkes or something darcy realized that she had forgotten to tell vince dambrosio about doug fields a nice guy attractive an illustrator the kind erin might easily have been interested in that sounds great she answered what time how stupid does doug think i am susan wondered as she sat at the kitchen table with donny and went over his geometry homework the guidance counselor had phoned her this afternoon was there a problem at home donny always a good student was slipping in all his subjects he seemed distracted and depressed well thats it she said cheerfully as my geometry teacher used to say it shows what you can do miss frawley when you put your mind to it donny smiled and gathered up his books mom he hesitated donny youve always been able to talk to me what is it he looked around the little kids are in bed beth is taking one of her thirtyminute showers we can talk susan assured him and dad is in one of his meetings donny said bitterly he suspects susan thought there was no use trying to protect him this was as good a time as any to be straight with him donny dad isnt in a meeting you know relief flooded the troubled face yes i do but how did you find out he looked down patrick driscoll one of the guys on the team was in new york friday night when we were visiting grandpa dad was in a restaurant with some woman they were holding hands and kissing patrick said it was gross his mother wants to tell you his dad wont let her donny im planning to divorce your father its not something i want but living like this isnt great for any of us this way we wont always be waiting for him to come home always putting up with his lies i hope he makes it his business to see you kids but i cant guarantee it im sorry im terribly terribly sorry she realized she was crying donny patted her shoulder mom he doesnt deserve you i promise ill help with the other kids i swear ill do a better job than he did with us donny may look like doug but thank god susan thought hes got enough of my genes in him that hell never act like his father she kissed donnys cheek lets keep this between us for now okay susan went to bed at eleven oclock doug was still not home she turned on the late news and watched horrified as the anchorman updated the story of the missing young women and the packages of mismatched shoes that were being returned to their families the announcer was saying although the fbi refuses to comment inside sources tell us that the latest shoes to be returned are the mates of the ones erin kelley was wearing when her body was found if true she is probably linked to the disappearance of two young women originally from lancaster and white plains who had been living in manhattan and the longunsolved murder of nan sheridan nan sheridan erin kelley oh my god susan moaned her hands clenched in fists she stared at the screen pictures of claire barnes erin kelley janine wetzl and nan sheridan were flashed on the screen the announcer was saying the trail of death seems to have begun on that cold march morning fifteen years ago next week when nan sheridan was strangled on the jogging path near her home susan felt her own throat close fifteen years ago she had lied for doug when he was questioned about nan s death if she hadnt would these other young women not have disappeared that night almost two weeks ago when the announcement came about erin kelleys death doug had had a nightmare called out erin in his sleep the fbi is cooperating with the new york police department in an attempt to trace the evening shoes back to the purchaser the file on nan sheridans death has been reopened suppose they questioned doug again suppose they question me susan thought did she have a duty to tell the police she had lied fifteen years ago donny beth trish conner what would their lives be like if they grew up as the children of a serial killer the police commissioner of new york was being interviewed we believe were dealing with a vicious serial killer vicious what shall i do susan whispered to herself her fathers words rang in her ears vicious streak two years ago when she challenged him about his relationship with the au pair his face had contorted with rage the fear she had experienced at that moment swept through her again as the news ended susan finally faced the fact she had never allowed herself to consider i thought he was going to hurt me that night shall we dance shall we dance shall we dance on a bright cloud of music shall we fly shall we still be together with our arms around each other shall we dance shall we dance shall we dance charley laughed aloud at the sheer exultation of the music whirling and stepping in synch with yul brynner he stamped his foot twisted twirled an imaginary darcy in his arms theyd dance to this next week then astaire what joy what joy it was only seven days away nan s fifteenth anniversary on the clear understanding that this kind of thing can happen shall we dance shall we dance shall we dance the music stopped he reached for the remote control and snapped off the video if only he could spend the night but that would be foolish do what he had come to do the basement stairs creaked and he frowned must take care of that annette had fled down these stairs listening to the frantic tapping of the heels on the bare wood had enthralled him if darcy tried to escape him that same way he didnt want a creaking noise to interfere with the sound of her slippers on their futile flight darcy how hard it had been to sit across the table from her he had wanted to say come with me and bring her here like the phantom of the opera inviting his beloved to the netherworld the shoe boxes five of them now marie and sheila and leslie and annette and tina suddenly he realized he wanted to send them all back at once be finished with it and then there would be only one only darcys package would be here next week maybe hed never return it he opened the latch of the freezer lifted the heavy door and stared down into the empty space awaiting a new ice maiden charley thought this one he wouldnt give back xvi thursday march how well did you know nan sheridan vince snapped he and a detective from the midtown north precinct were taking turns questioning jay stratton stratton remained unruffled she was a student at brown when i was there you dropped out of brown and came back the year she was a sophomore thats right i wasnt much of a student my freshman year my uncle who was my guardian thought it would do me a lot of good to mature a bit i went into the peace corps for two years i repeat how well did you know nan sheridan how well indeed stratton thought lovely nan to dance with her was to feel a willothewisp in your arms dambrosios eyes narrowed he had seen something in strattons face you havent answered me stratton shrugged theres no answer to give certainly i remember her i was there when the whole student body was talking endlessly about the tragedy were you invited to her birthday party no i was not nan sheridan and i happened to be in several classes together period lets talk about erin kelley you were in an awfully big hurry to report those missing diamonds to the insurance company as miss scott can certainly verify my first response when i spoke with her was irritation i really didnt know erin well it was her work i knew when she didnt keep the appointment to turn over the necklace to bertolini i convinced myself that she simply lost track of time the moment i met darcy scott i realized how foolish that was her terrible concern made me see the situation clearly do you often mix up valuable gemstones certainly not vince tried another tack you didnt know nan sheridan well but did you know anyone who had a crush on her besides you of course he added deliberately xvii friday march on friday afternoon darcy went to the west side apartment where shed redecorated the room for lisa the recuperating teenager she brought with her plants for the windowsill some throw pillows a porcelain vanity set that shed picked up at a house sale and erin s muchloved poster the large pieces were already in the pewter and brass bed the dresser the night table the rocker the indian rug that had been in erin s living room was perfect in this space candystriped wallpaper gave the room a feeling of movement almost like a carousel darcy thought the tieback curtains and spread were the same candy stripe as the paper a starched white cotton dust ruffle picked up the glistening white of the ceiling and trim carefully darcy positioned the poster it depicted an egret painting one of his early lesser known works a young dancer soaring through the air her arms extended her toes pointed hed called it loves music loves to dance she drove picture hooks into the wall thinking of all the dance classes she and erin had taken why jog in the freezing rain when you can get just as much exercise dancing erin would ask theres an old slogan to put a little fun in your life try dancing darcy stepped back to be sure the poster was hanging straight it was then what was gnawing at her the personal ads but why now shrugging she closed her toolbox she went directly to sheridan galleries so far all the poring over the pictures had proven useless she had come across jay strattons picture but vince dambrosio had already picked his name from the student roster yesterday chris sheridan had pointed out that she probably had a better chance of winning the lottery than of having a familiar face jump out at her shed been afraid that he might have regretted his decision to let her use his conference room but that wasnt the case you look wiped out hed said to her late yesterday afternoon i understand youve been here since eight oclock this morning i was able to rearrange some appointments this seems more important last night had been box owen larkin an internist from new york hospital hed been pretty full of himself trouble with being an unattached doctor is that all the nurses keep offering to have you over for a homecooked meal he was from tulsa and hated new york the minute i finish my residency im on my way back to gods country you can keep these crowded cities casually shed brought up erin s name his tone confidential hed told her i didnt meet her but one of my friends at the hospital who answers these ads did just once hes keeping his fingers crossed that she didnt keep records the last thing he needs is to be questioned in a murder investigation when did he see her early february i wonder if ive ever met him not unless you met him around that time hed broken up with his girlfriend and they got back together whats his name brad whalen say is this some kind of inquisition lets talk about you and me brad whalen another name for vince dambrosio to check out chris was standing at his office window when he saw the cab pull up and darcy get out of it he shoved his hands in his pockets it was windy and he watched as darcy closed the door of the cab and turned to the building she pulled her jacket around her neck and bent forward slightly as she crossed the sidewalk yesterday had been busy he had some important japanese clients examining the silver from the von wallens estate to be auctioned next week hed spent the better part of the afternoon with them mrs vail the housekeeper for the gallery had made sure that morning coffee a light lunch and tea were brought to darcy scott that poor girl is going to ruin her eyes mr sheridan vail had fussed at fourthirty chris had gone to the conference room hed realized what a blunder hed made when he suggested the task was hopeless he hadnt meant it to come out like that it was just that when you analyzed it the chances of darcy scotts meeting someone who had known nan and recognizing him in a picture fifteen years old were to say the least very slim yesterday shed asked him if nan had ever dated anyone named charles north not to his knowledge when he came to darien vince dambrosio had asked him and his mother the same question chris realized that he wanted to go downstairs now and talk to darcy he wondered if she would get the feeling again that he was anxious to be rid of her the phone rang he let his secretary pick it up a moment later she buzzed through its your mother chris greta came directly to the point chris you know that business about someone named charles as long as we had to get all those pictures down i decided to go through the rest of nan s things no use leaving the job to you someday i reread her letters theres one from the september before before we lost her shed just started the fall semester she wrote about dancing with a fellow named charley who teased her about wearing capezios heres exactly the way she put it can you believe that a guy in my generation thinks girls should wear spike heels i was finished with my patients at three oclock and thought it would be a lot easier to come over and talk with you than discuss this on the phone michael nash shifted slightly trying to find a comfortable position on the green love seat in nonas office he could not help analyzing why an obviously bright and outgoing person like nona roberts would submit her visitors to this torturous object doctor im sorry nona yanked files from the one comfortable chair next to her desk please nash moved willingly i really should get rid of that thing nona apologized its just i never get around to it theres always something more interesting to do than fool around with arranging furniture her smile was guilty but for heavens sake dont tell darcy that he returned the smile in my profession im sworn to secrecy now how can i help you a really attractive man nona thought late thirties a maturity that probably comes with the territory of being a psychiatrist darcy had told her about the visit to his place in new jersey dont marry for money as nonas old aunts used to say but its just as easy to love a rich man as a poor one not god knows that darcy needed to marry money her folks had been making millions since before she was born but nona had always sensed a loneliness in darcy a little girl lost without erin that was bound to get worse it would be wonderful if she met the right guy now she realized that dr michael nash was looking at her with an amused expression will i pass he asked absolutely she fished for the documentary file darcy probably told you why she and erin got into answering personal ads nash nodded weve got the program pretty much together but i want to have a psychiatrist do an overall viewpoint about the kind of people who place or answer ads and what motivates them maybe it would be possible to give some hints as to what kind of behavior should raise warning signals am i saying it right youre saying it very explicitly i gather that the fbi agent will concentrate on the serial killer aspect nona felt herself tense yes ms roberts nona if i may i wish you could see the expression on your face right now you and darcy are alike you must stop torturing yourselves you are no more responsible for erin kelleys death than the mother who takes her child for a walk and sees it crushed by an outofcontrol car some things must be considered acts of fate grieve for your friend do anything you can to alert others that there is a madman out there but dont try to play god nona tried to keep her voice steady i wish i could hear that about five times a day if its bad for me its ten times worse for darcy i hope youve told her that michael nashs smile reached his eyes my housekeeper has called three times this week with suggested menus if ill only bring darcy back shes going to drive to wellesley to see erin s father on sunday but she will have dinner with me on saturday good and now how about the program we tape next wednesday it will be aired thursday night i usually shy away from this sort of thing too many of my colleagues rush to be on television panels or in the witness box at criminal trials but maybe i can contribute something here count me in terrific they stood up together nona waved her hand at the desks in the open area outside her office i understand youre writing a book about personal ads if you need any more research most of the uncommitted people out there have been playing the game thanks but my own file is pretty thick ill be turning my book in by the end of the month nona watched nashs long easy stride as he made his way to the elevator she closed the door of her office and dialed darcys apartment when the answering machine came on she said i know youre not home yet but i had to tell you i just met michael nash and hes a doll dougs warning antenna was signaling him when he phoned susan this morning saying he didnt want to wake her up by calling when he knew he couldnt get home last night shed been warm and pleasant that was sweet of you doug i did get to bed early the warning signal had come after hed hung up and realized that she didnt ask him if hed be on time tonight up till a couple of weeks ago shed always pulled that martyred anxious routine doug those people have to realize you have a family its not fair to expect you to stay for meetings night after night shed seemed pretty happy when shed met him for dinner in new york maybe he should call back and suggest she meet him again tonight or maybe hed better get home early make a fuss over the kids they had been away last weekend if susan ever got mad really mad especially with the way the personal ad murders were getting played up and all the interest in nan dougs office was on the fortyfourth floor of the world trade center unseeingly he stared down at lady liberty it was time to play the role of devoted husband and father something else hed better stop using the apartment for a while his clothes his sketches the ads when he got a chance next week hed bring them up to the cottage maybe hed better think about leaving the station wagon there too was it possible darcy blinked and reached for the magnifying glass this fivebyseven snapshot of nan sheridan and her friends on the beach the maintenance man in the background did he look familiar or was she crazy she did not hear chris sheridan come in his quiet greeting i dont want to interrupt you darcy made her jump chris rushed to apologize i knocked you didnt hear me im terribly sorry darcy rubbed her eyes you shouldnt have to knock its your place i guess im getting jumpy he looked at the magnifying glass in her hand do you think youve come across something i cant be sure its just this guy she pointed to the figure behind the cluster of girls looks a little like someone i know do you remember where this picture was taken chris studied it on belle island thats a few miles from darien one of nan s best friends has a summer home there may i take this of course concerned chris watched as darcy slipped the snapshot into her carrying case and began to stack the pictures she had perused into orderly piles her movements were slow almost mechanical as though she were terribly tired darcy do you have one of your dates tonight she nodded drinks dinner i try to keep them to a glass of wine by then i think i can get a handle on whether or not they either met erin or sound funny if they deny knowing her you dont drive off with them or go to their homes lord no thats good you look as though you wouldnt have much strength to fight back if someone made a pass at you chris hesitated believe it or not im not here to ask questions about something that isnt my business i just wanted you to know that my mother came across a letter from nan written six months before she died in it she refers to a charley who thought girls ought to wear spike heels darcy looked up at him have you told vince dambrosio not yet i will of course but im wondering if it would be a good idea for you to talk to my mother it was digging out all these pictures that made her go through nan s letters no one had asked her to do that i just think that if there is anything my mother knows it might come to the surface faster if she talks to another woman who understands the kind of pain shes been living with all these years nan was six minutes older than i she never let me forget it she was outgoing i was shy chris sheridan and his mother had probably come to terms with nan sheridans death darcy thought the true crimes program erin s murder the returned shoes and now me theyve been forced to rip open whatever scars had healed for them as well as me therell be no peace until this is over the distress in chris sheridans face for the moment robbed it of the aura of sophistication and executive confidence that had been so noticeable a few days ago id like to meet your mother darcy said she lives in darien doesnt she yes ill drive you im going up to wellesley early sunday morning to visit erin kelleys father if its all right ill stop late sunday afternoon on my way home sounds like a long day for you tomorrow wouldnt be better darcy thought it was ridiculous at her age to blush i have plans for tomorrow she got up to go robert kruse was meeting her at mickey mantles at fivethirty as of now no one else had called she had run out of personal ad dates next week shed start writing to the ads erin had circled len parker had been angry at work a maintenance man at nyu there was nothing he couldnt fix not that hed studied much it was just the feel of wires in his hands the feel of a lock and key doorjambs switches he was supposed to do only routine maintenance but often when he saw something wrong hed fix it without talking about it it was the one thing that gave him peace but today his thoughts had been confused hed yelled at his trustee for hinting that he might have a house somewhere whose business whose his family what about them his brothers and sisters never even invited him to visit glad to wash their hands of him that girl darcy maybe hed been mean to her but she didnt realize how cold it had been standing waiting outside that fancy restaurant to apologize to her hed told mr doran the trustee about that mr doran said lenny if youd only understand that you have enough money to eat in le cirque or anywhere else every night of your life mr doran just didnt understand lenny could remember his mother yelling at his father all the time youll put your children in the streets with your crazy investments lenny used to cower in bed he hated to think of being out in the cold was that when he started going outside in his pajamas so hed be used to it when it really happened no one knew he did that by the time his father made all that money he was used to being in the cold it was hard to remember he got so confused sometimes he imagined things that didnt happen like erin kelley hed looked up her address shed told him she lived in greenwich village and there she was erin kelley christopher street one night hed followed her hadnt he was he wrong was it just a dream that she went to that bar and he stood outside she sat and had something he didnt know what it was wine club soda what difference hed tried to decide whether or not to go in and join her then shed come out hed been about to go up and talk to her when the station wagon pulled up he couldnt remember if hed gotten a look at the driver sometimes he dreamed about a face erin got in that was the night they say she disappeared the thing was that lenny wasnt sure if hed just dreamed that and if he told that to the cops would they try to say he was crazy and make him go back to the place where they locked him up xviii saturday march at noon on saturday fbi agents vince dambrosio and ernie cizek sat in a darkgray chrysler across the street from the entrance to christopher street there he goes vince said all dressed up for his day off gus boxer was exiting from the building he was wearing a red and black check lumber jacket over loosefitting dark brown polyester pants heavy laced boots a black cap with a rim that halfcovered his face you call that dressed up ernie exclaimed in that getup i thought he was paying off a bet you just never saw him in his underwear and suspenders lets go vince opened the drivers door they had checked with the building managers boxer was off from noon every other saturday till monday morning in his absence a substitute super jos√© rodriguez handled complaints and did minor repairs rodriguez answered their ring a sturdy man in his midthirties with a direct manner vince wondered why the management didnt keep him fulltime he and ernie showed their bureau credentials were going from apartment to apartment questioning the tenants about erin kelley a number of them were not in the last time we went through vince did not add that today he was going to get very specific about what the tenants thought of gus boxer on the fourth floor he hit gold an eightyyearold woman answered the door taking care not to remove the security chain vince showed his badge rodriguez explained its all right miss durkin they just want to ask a few questions ill stay right here where you can see me cant hear the old woman yelled i just want to rodriguez touched dambrosios arm she can hear better than you or me he whispered come on miss durkin you liked erin kelley remember how she always asked you if you needed anything from the store and how shed take you to church sometimes you want the cops to get the guy who did that to her dont you the door opened the length of the chain ask your questions miss durkin looked severely at vince and dont shout it gives me a headache for the next fifteen minutes the two agents got an earful of what a native new york octogenarian thought of how the city was being run ive lived here all my life miss durkin informed them crisply her wavy gray hair bobbing as she spoke we never used to lock our doors why would you whod bother you but now all this crime and no one doing a thing about it disgusting i tell you they should ship all those drug dealers to the ends of the earth and let them sail off i agree with you miss durkin vince said wearily now about erin kelley the old womans face saddened a sweeter girl youd never find id like to get my hands on whoever did that to her now a few years ago i happened to be sitting at the window looking at that apartment building across the street a woman was murdered they came around asking questions but may and ishe lives next doordecided to keep our mouths shut we saw it we know who did it but that woman was no better than she ought to be and there was good reason you witnessed a murder and didnt tell the police ernie asked incredulously she snapped her lips closed if i said that i didnt say it the way i meant what i meant was i have my suspicions and so does may but thats as far as it goes suspicions she saw that murder vince thought he also knew that no one would ever get her or her friend may to testify with an inward sigh he said miss durkin you sit by the window i have a feeling youre a good observer did you see erin kelley leave with anyone that evening no she left alone was she carrying anything only her shoulder bag was it large erin always carried a large shoulder bag she often carried jewelry and didnt want anything that could be yanked from her hand then it was generally known she carried jewelry i guess so everyone knew she was a designer from the street you could see her sitting at her worktable did she date much she dated but i wouldnt say much of course she might have been meeting people outside thats the way young people do it now in my day a young man picked you up at your home or you didnt set foot out the door it was better then im inclined to agree they were still standing in the hall miss durkin i wonder if we might just step inside for a moment i dont want to be overheard your feet arent muddy are they no maam ill wait right here miss durkin rodriguez promised the apartment had the same layout as the one where erin kelley had lived it was meticulously neat overstuffed horsehair furniture protected with antimacassars standing lamps with elaborate silk shades polished end tables framed family pictures of bewhiskered men and severe women vince was carried back to the memory of his grandmothers parlor in jackson heights they were not invited to sit down miss durkin tell me what do you think of gus boxer a ladylike snort that one believe me this is one of the few apartments he doesnt barge into looking for one of his famous water leaks and this is the one that has it i dont like that man i dont know why the management keeps him on goes around in those disgusting clothes surly the only thing i can figure is that they get him cheap just a week before she disappeared i heard erin kelley tell him that if she found him in her apartment again shed call the police erin told him that you bet she did and she was right was gus boxer aware of the amount of jewelry erin kelley handled gus boxer is aware of everything that goes on in this place miss durkin youve been very helpful is there anything else you can think of to tell us she hesitated for a few weeks before erin disappeared from time to time a young fellow used to hang out across the street always when it was getting dark so you couldnt see him clearly now i dont know what he was up to but that tuesday night that erin left here for the last time i could make out that she was alone and carrying that big shoulder bag my glasses had fogged up and im not sure if it was that same fellow across the street but i think it was and when erin started walking down the block he went in the same direction you didnt see him clearly that night but you saw him other times what did he look like miss durkin beanpole collar up hands in his pockets kind of hugging his arms against his body thin face dark messy hair len parker vince thought he glanced at ernie who obviously had the same idea ive been looking forward to this darcy leaned back in the passenger seat of the mercedes and smiled at michael its been quite a week so i gathered he said dryly it was all i could do to catch you in at home or at your office i know im sorry dont be sorry about anything its a great day for a ride isnt it they were on route nearing bridgewater i never knew very much about new jersey darcy commented except comedians jokes everyone judges it by that turnpike strip with all the refineries believe it or not it has a longer coastline than most other states on the eastern seaboard and has among the highest number of horses per capita in the nation so there darcy laughed so there who knows with my missionary zeal maybe ill make you a convert mrs hughes was bathed in smiles oh miss scott ive been planning the nicest dinner since doctor said you were coming how nice of you the guest room at the head of the stairs is all ready you can just freshen up there after your ride great if anything the day was even more perfect than last sunday cool sunny a hint of spring in the air darcy managed to give herself completely to the enjoyment of the canter when they stopped to let the horses rest michael said i dont have to ask if youre having a good time it shows the late afternoon turned sharply cooler a fire had been laid in michaels study the draft from the chimney was brisk causing the flames to leap up michael poured wine for her made an oldfashioned for himself sat beside her on the comfortable leather couch stretched his feet on the coffee table his arm went around the back of the sofa do you know he said ive spent more time this week thinking about what you told me its terrible that a chance remark can hurt a child so much but darcy can you honestly say that sometimes you dont look in the mirror and see the fairest of all i certainly do not darcy hesitated god forbid i should angle for a free consultation but ive been meaning to talk to you about that no never mind his hand ruffled her hair what shoot spit it out she looked directly at him concentrating on the kindness in his eyes michael i get the feeling that you understand how devastating that remark was for me but that you think ive beenhow can i put thissubconsciously blaming my mother and father all these years michael whistled hey youd put me out of business most people take a year of therapy before they come to that kind of conclusion you havent answered me he kissed her cheek and i dont intend to come on i think mrs hughes has the fatted calf on the table they got back to her apartment at ten oclock he parked the car and walked her to the door this time i dont leave until i make sure youre safely inside i wish youd let me drive you to wellesley tomorrow thats a heck of a long roundtrip for one day i dont mind it and i have to make a stop on the way back more garage sales she did not want to talk about the nan sheridan pictures something like that another fishing expedition he put his hands on her shoulders tilted up her face brought his lips down to hers his kiss was warm but brief darcy call me when you get home tomorrow night i just want to be sure youre safe i will thank you she stood inside the door until the car disappeared down the block then humming she ran up the stairs hank coming in early saturday evening we have so little time together vince fretted as he opened the door to his apartment when they were married he and alice had been living in great neck there hadnt been much point in his commuting after they split up so when they sold the house hed taken this apartment at second avenue and nineteenth street the gramercy park area not gramercy park of course not on his salary but he liked his apartment on the ninth floor his windows offered a typical midtown view to the right a peek of the park with its elegant brownstones straight down the murderous traffic on second avenue across the street a blend of residential and office buildings with storefront restaurants delis korean produce markets a video store he had two bedrooms two baths a fairsized living room a dinette a minuscule kitchen the second bedroom was for hank but hed put bookshelves and a desk in it and it also served as a study the living room and dinette were furnished in aliceinmistakeville decor the year before they broke up shed gone pastel modern in the living room pale peach and white sectional pale peach carpet peach and teal noarms easy chair glass tables lamps that looked like bones in a desert shed wished that stuff on him taking all the traditional furniture that he liked one of these days when he got around to it vince was going to get rid of everything and buy good oldfashioned comfortable furniture he was sick of feeling as though hed stumbled into barbies dream house hank hadnt arrived yet vince stripped stood under a hot shower pulled on underwear a sweater chinos and loafers he opened a beer stretched out on the sectional and reviewed the case this was one baffling investigation look under any rock and youll find a new clue boxer erin had threatened to go to the police about him yesterday darcy scott had called saying she thought she had a picture of nan sheridan at belle island with a maintenance man in the background who might have been boxer theyd picked up the picture and were checking it out miss durkin had seen someone who sure as blazes sounded like that looney len parker hanging around christopher street and she thought he had followed erin kelley the night she disappeared there was a direct connection between that con man jay stratton and nan sheridan a direct connection between jay stratton and erin kelley vince heard the turn of a key in the latch hank bounded in hi dad dropped his overnight bag quick hug vince felt the tousled hair brush his cheek he always had to check himself from showing the fierce love he felt for his son the kid would be embarrassed hi pal hows it going great i think i aced the chemistry you studied hard enough hank took off his school jacket flung it into space boy its great to have midterms over he took long steps into the kitchen and opened the refrigerator door dad it looks as though you could use mealsonwheels i know its been quite a week inspiration seized vince i found a terrific new pasta restaurant the other night its on west fiftyeighth street we can take in a movie after great hank stretched oh boy its good to be here mom and blubber are sore at each other its none of my business vince thought but couldnt help himself why she wants a rolex for her birthday a sixteen five rolex sixteen thousand five hundred dollars and i thought she was expensive when i was married to her hank laughed i love mom but you know her she thinks big whats going on with the serial murder case the phone rang vince frowned not again on hanks night he thought observing that hanks reaction was to look interested maybe theres been a break hank said as vince picked up the phone it was nona roberts vince i hate to call you at home but you did give your number i was out on location all day and stopped by the office just now theres a message from dr nash his editor doesnt want him talking about personal ads now when his own book is scheduled for fall publication have you any other ideas about a shrink who might be particularly tuned in to this subject i deal with a few who are members of aapl thats an organization of shrinks who are specialists in psychiatry and law ill try and get one of them for you by monday thanks a lot again forgive me for bothering you im off to pasta lovers for another bowl of that spaghetti if you get there first ask for a table for three hank and i are just leaving vince realized he sounded presumptuous unless of course youre with your own friends or friend he thought im by myself that sounds great see you there the phone clicked in his ear vince looked at hank is that okay with you chief he asked or would you have preferred just the two of us hank reached for the jacket that had landed on the armless easy chair not at all its my duty to check out your dates xix sunday march darcy left for massachusetts at seven oclock sunday morning how many times had she and erin driven up together to see billy she wondered as she steered the car onto the east river drive sharing the driving stopping midway for carryout coffee at mcdonalds always deciding they really ought to get around to buying a thermos like the one they had had in college the last time theyd agreed on that erin had laughed poor billy will be dead and buried before we ever get that thermos now it was erin who was dead and buried darcy drove straight through and got to wellesley at eleventhirty she stopped at st paul s and rang the doorbell of the rectory the monsignor who had celebrated erin s funeral mass was there she had coffee with him i left word at the nursing home she told him but i wanted you to know as well if billy needs anything if he starts sinking or if he becomes conscious and aware please send for me hes not going to become aware anymore the monsignor said quietly i think thats a special mercy for him she attended the noon mass and thought of the eulogy less than two weeks ago who can forget the sight of that little girl pushing her fathers wheelchair into this church she went to the cemetery the ground had not yet settled over erin s grave the dark brown soil was still uneven a glaze of frost over it shimmered in the slanting rays of the weak march sun darcy knelt removed her glove and placed her hand on the grave erin erin from there she went to the nursing home and sat by billys bed for an hour he did not open his eyes but she held his hand and kept up a steady stream of small talk bertolinis is crazy about the necklace erin designed they want her to do a lot more work for them she talked about her own business honestly billy if you saw erin and me rummaging through attics looking for goodies youd think we were crazy she has a great eye and has picked out some furniture that i would have missed as she left she leaned over and kissed his forehead god bless billy there was a faint pressure on her hand he does know im here she thought ill be back soon she promised her car was a buick station wagon with a cellular builtin phone the traffic was slow heading south and at five oclock she called the sheridan home in darien chris answered im running later than i expected she explained i dont want to interfere with your mothers plansor your plans for that matter no plans he assured her just come along she pulled into the sheridan property at quarter of six it was almost dark but outside lights illuminated the handsome tudor mansion the long driveway had a roundabout at the main entrance darcy parked just past the bend it was obvious that chris sheridan had been watching for her the front door opened and he came out to greet her you made good time at that he said its nice to see you darcy he was wearing an oxford cloth shirt corduroy pants and loafers as he extended his hand to assist her from the car she was again aware of the breadth of his shoulders she was also glad to see that he was not in a jacket and tie on the way down it had occurred to her that she was arriving at dinnertime and her own corduroy pants and wool sweater might not be suitable garb the interior of the house had the charming combination of livedin comfort and exquisite taste persian carpets were scattered in the highceilinged foyer a waterford chandelier and matching sconces enhanced the magnificent carving on the curving staircase paintings darcy longed to study covered the stairway wall like most people my mother uses the den more than any other room chris told her through here darcy glanced at the living room as they passed chris noticed and said the whole house is done in american antiques anywhere from early colonial to greek revival my grandmother was hooked on antiques and i guess we learned by osmosis greta sheridan was sitting in a comfortable armchair by the fireplace the new york times was scattered around her the sunday magazine section was open to the puzzle page and she was studying a crossword dictionary she got up gracefully you must be darcy scott she took darcys hand im so sorry about your friend darcy nodded what a beautiful woman she thought many of the film stars who were her mothers intimates would enjoy greta sheridans high cheekbones patrician features slender frame she was wearing pale blue wool slacks a matching cowl neck sweater diamond earrings and a diamond pin in the shape of a horseshoe to the manner born darcy thought chris poured sherry a platter of cheese and crackers was on the coffee table he poked at the fire by the end of the day you know its still march greta sheridan asked about the trip you have more courage than i to go up in the morning to massachusetts and back a few hours later im in the car a lot darcy weve known each other for five days chris commented will you please tell me exactly what you do he turned to greta the first time i took darcy through the main floor of the gallery she spotted the roentgen writing desk out of the corner of her eye then she told me she was sort of in the business darcy laughed you wont believe but here goes greta sheridan was fascinated what a sensational idea if youre interested ill be a scout for you youd be amazed at the wonderful furnishings people discard or sell for next to nothing in this area at sixthirty chris said im the chef i hope youre not a vegetarian darcy were having steaks baked potato salad gourmet delight time im not a vegetarian it sounds wonderful when he had left greta sheridan began to talk about her daughter and the reenactment of her murder on the true crimes television series when i received that letter telling me a dancing girl was going to die in new york in nan s honor i thought i would go mad theres nothing worse than not being able to prevent a tragedy you know is going to happen except to feel you had a hand in causing it darcy said i know that the only way i can make up to erin for urging her to answer those cursed ads is to stop her killer from hurting anyone else you obviously feel the same way i understand how it must be tearing you apart to go through nan s letters and pictures and im grateful ive found some others theyre here greta pointed to a stack of small albums on the raised hearth these were on a high shelf of the library and missed getting put away she reached for the top one darcy pulled up a chair beside her and together they bent over it nan got interested in photography that last year greta said we gave her a canon for christmas so these were all taken between late december and early march the salad days darcy thought she had albums like this of the mount holyoke crowd the only difference was mount holyoke was a womens college in these pictures there were as many guys as coeds they began to go through them chris appeared in the doorway fiveminute warning youre a good cook darcy said approvingly as she ate the last bite of steak they began talking about nan s reference to someone named charley who had liked girls to wear spike heels thats what i was trying to remember greta said on the program and in the newspapers they were talking about highheeled slippers it was the letter from nan about spike heels that was gnawing at me unfortunately it really hasnt helped much has it not yet chris said chris carried a tray with coffee into the study you make a marvelous butler his mother said affectionately since you refuse to have livein help ive had to learn darcy thought of the belair mansion with its permanent staff of three liveins when she finished the coffee she got up to go i hate to break this up but it will be over an hour before i get home and if i relax too much ill end up falling asleep at the wheel she hesitated can i just look at that first book again in that first album on the next to the last page there was a group scene the tall fellow in the school sweater darcy said the one with his face turned from the camera theres something about him she shrugged i just have a feeling i may have met him somewhere greta and chris sheridan studied the picture i can pick out some of the kids greta said but not that one how about you chris no but look janet is in it she was one of nan s big buddies he explained to darcy she lives in westport he turned to his mother she loves to visit you why not ask her to drop in soon shes so busy with the children i could drive down there as darcy said goodbye greta sheridan smiled and said darcy ive been studying you all night except for the color of your hair has anyone ever told you that you have a striking resemblance to barbara thorne never darcy said honestly it was not the moment to say that barbara thorne was her mother she smiled back but i have to tell you mrs sheridan thats a very nice thing to say chris walked her to the car youre not too tired to drive oh no you should see the long treks i take when im out on one of my hunts for furniture we really are in the same business yes but you take the high road will you be coming to the gallery tomorrow ill be there good night chris greta sheridan was waiting at the door shes a lovely girl chris lovely chris shrugged i think so too he remembered how darcy had blushed when hed asked her about coming up yesterday but dont start matchmaking mother ive got a hunch shes taken over the weekend doug had been everything any woman could ask of a devoted husband and father even knowing his behavior was all a sham susan managed to assuage her fear that doug might be a serial killer he went to donnys basketball practice then got together a scrimmage in the outdoor court with the kids who could stay he took everyone out to burger king for lunch nothing like health food hed joked the place was full of young families this is the sort of togetherness weve been lacking susan thought but now its too late she looked across the table at donny who had hardly said a word back home doug played with the baby helping him build a castle of interlocking blocks lets put the little prince inside conner squealed with delight he took trish for a ride on her scooter we can beat anyone on the block cant we toots he had a friendly fatherdaughter conversation with beth my little girl is getting prettier every day im going to have to build a fence around this house to keep away all the boys wholl be coming after you while she was getting dinner he nuzzled susans neck we should go dancing some night honey remember how we used to dance in college like a cold wind that ended the fantasy that maybe she had been ridiculous in suspecting him of anything stronger than womanizing dancing shoes found on dead bodies later in bed doug reached for her susan have i ever told you how much i love you many times but one stands out in my mind when i lied for you after nan sheridan died doug pulled up on one elbow stared down at her in the dark now when was that he asked teasingly dont let him know what youre thinking the day we were married of course she laughed nervously oh doug no please im really tired she could not bear his touch she realized she was afraid of him susan what the hell is the matter with you youre trembling sunday was more of the same family togetherness but susan could spot the wary expression in dougs eyes the lines of worry around his mouth do i have an obligation to report my suspicions to the police and if i admit that i lied for him fifteen years ago could i go to prison too and if that happened what would become of the children and if he suspected i was going to tell the police that i lied for him about the morning nan died how would he try to stop me xx monday march on monday morning vince called nona ive got a shrink for your program dr martin weiss a nice guy sensible a member of aapl and very knowledgeable he says it straight and hes willing to do the show want to take down his number absolutely nona repeated it then added i like hank vince hes terrific he wants to know if youd like to see him pitch when baseball starts ill bring the cracker jacks nona phoned dr weiss he agreed to come to the studio at four oclock on wednesday we tape at five it will be aired thursday night at eight darcy spent a good part of monday in the warehouse tagging furniture for the hotel at four oclock she arrived at sheridan galleries an auction was taking place she saw chris standing on the side of the first row his back to her she slipped down the corridor to the conference room many of the snapshots were dated she wanted to find others in that same time frame maybe shed come across another picture of the student who had seemed vaguely familiar at sixthirty she was still at it chris came in she looked up smiling the bidding out there sounded hot and heavy was it a good day very no one told me you were here i noticed the light was on im glad you did chris does this fellow look like the one i pointed out yesterday he studied it yes it does my mother left a message a few minutes ago she saw janet today that guy was one of the many questioned in nan s death he had a crush on her i gather his name was doug fox at darcys shocked expression he asked you know him then as doug fields through a personal ad honey they called an emergency meeting i cant talk but a company weve recommended to our biggest client is going under somehow susan got through the evening she gave the baby and trish a bath and helped donny and beth with their homework at last she was able to turn out the lights and go to bed for hours she lay sleepless hed managed to stay home for a weekend now he was on the loose again and if he was responsible for the deaths of those girls she was equally guilty it would be so easy if she could only run away bundle the kids in the car and drive as far as they could go but it didnt work like that the next afternoon when shed seen trish off on the school bus and put conner down for his nap susan picked up the phone and asked information for the number of the fbi headquarters in manhattan she dialed and waited a voice said federal bureau of investigation it was not too late to disconnect susan shut her eyes forced her voice above a whisper i want to talk to someone about the dancingshoe murders i may have some information on monday evening darcy met nona for dinner at nearys and filled her in about doug fox vince was out when i tried to reach him she said i left word with his assistant she broke off a piece of roll and lightly buttered it nona doug fox or doug fields as he introduced himself to me is exactly the kind of guy erin would have enjoyed and trusted hes good looking bright artistic and hes got one of those boyish faces that would appeal to a nurturer like erin nona looked grave its pretty scary that he was questioned in nan sheridans death youd better not see him again of course vince did say that a lot of guys dont give their right names when they answer these ads but how many others were questioned in nan sheridans death just dont get your hopes up so far it isnt really more of a lead than the fact that jay stratton also went to brown or that erin s superintendent worked near nan sheridans home fifteen years ago i just want it to be over darcy sighed lets not talk about it anymore youve been eating and breathing it hows work going oh ive been neglecting it of course but i did have a nice call today about a room i did for a sixteenyearold girl who had a terrible accident i used some of erin s things to furnish it the mother wanted me to know that her daughter lisa came home from the hospital saturday and loves the room and you know what the mother said really got lisa excited what remember the poster erin had on the wall opposite her bed the one of the egret painting sure i do loves music loves to dance they hadnt noticed that jimmy neary had come up to their table thats it he said vehemently by heaven thats it thats the way the ad began that fell out of erin s pocket right here on this very spot xxi tuesday march susan hired a babysitter on tuesday and took the train down to new york vince had asked her to come in i can understand how difficult this is for you mrs fox hed said carefully he did not tell her that they already had a connection to her husband well do everything to keep our investigation from the media but the more we know the easier that will be at eleven oclock susan was in fbi headquarters you can contact the harkness agency she told vince theyve been trailing doug i would like to think hes just a philanderer but if its more than that i cant let it go on vince saw the agony in the face of the pretty young woman opposite him no you cant let it go on he said quietly however its a long jump from knowing your husband is playing around to thinking that he might be a serial killer how did you make that jump i was only twenty and i was so in love with him it was as though susan was talking to herself how long ago was that fifteen years vince kept his face impassive what happened at that time mrs fox her eyes fixed somewhere on the wall behind him susan told vince about lying for doug when nan sheridan died and how doug had called out erins name in his sleep the night her body was discovered when she was finished vince said the harkness agency knows where his apartment is yes after she revealed everything she knew or suspected susan felt a vast weariness now all she had to do was live with herself for the rest of her life mrs fox this is one of the hardest things youll ever have to do we need to check with the harkness agency the fact that they were following your husband could be of great value can you act normally with him for the next day or two dont forget our investigation may clear him it isnt hard to keep up appearances with my husband most of the time he doesnt notice me except to complain when she left vince called in ernie we have our first big break and i dont want to blow it this is what well do on tuesday afternoon jay charles stratton was booked for grand theft the nypd detectives in conjunction with the lloyds of london security staff had found the jeweler who fenced some of his stolen diamonds the rest of the gems that were listed as being in the missing pouch were traced to a private safe deposit box rented under the name jay charles it had been a long meeting and the tension in the office all day was brutal how do you explain to your best clients that a companys accountants pulled the wool over your eyes that sort of thing wasnt supposed to happen anymore doug called home several times and was surprised to hear the babysitter pick up the phone something was definitely up hed make it his business to get home tonight it wasnt that hard to straighten susan out his confidence oozed away she wasnt beginning to suspect or was she on tuesday evening darcy went straight home from work all she wanted to do was heat a can of soup and go to bed early the tension of the last two weeks was catching up with her she knew it at eight oclock michael phoned ive heard tired voices but yours just might win first prize im sure it would youve been driving yourself too hard darcy dont worry i intend to come straight home from the office for the rest of the week thats a good idea darcy ill be out of town for a few days but keep saturday for me wont you or sunday or better still both days darcy laughed lets plan on saturday have fun it isnt fun its a psychiatric convention ive been asked to fill in for a friend whos had to cancel you want to know what its like to have four hundred shrinks in one room at the same time i cant imagine xxii wednesday march dday nona thought as she slipped off her cape and tossed it on the love seat it was not quite eight am she was grateful to see that connie was already there and the coffee brewing connie followed her in its going to be a great program nona she was carrying freshly washed mugs i think cecil b demille did one of his epics faster than i handled this one nona said wryly youve been doing all your regular shows while putting this together connie pointed out i suppose lets be sure to reconfirm all the guests by phone you did send them a followup letter of course connie looked astonished that shed ask nona grinned im sorry its just that hamilton has been such a pain about this program and liz is determined to take the credit for whats good in it and leave me holding the bag if there are any snafus i know sometimes i wonder who runs this office connie you or me theres only one area where i wish we werent alike connie waited i wish you talked to plants youre like me you never even see them she pointed to the plant on the windowsill that poor thing is gasping pour something liquid on it will you len parker was tired wednesday morning yesterday he hadnt been able to stop thinking about darcy scott when he left work hed hung around her apartment building and seen her step out of a cab around sixthirty or seven hed waited until ten but she hadnt come out he really wanted to talk to her other times he was mad at her for being so mean to him there was something he had thought about the other day that had been important but now it was gone he wondered if hed remember again he put on his maintenance uniform nice thing about wearing a uniform it didnt cost you anything for work clothes vinces secretary had taken a message from darcy scott before he got to the office on wednesday morning shed be out all day on different jobs but wanted him to know that erin had probably answered an ad that began loves music loves to dance that certainly sounded like the kind of ad those missing girls would have answered too vince thought following up on the personal ads was a grueling job anyone who didnt want his real identity known could fake a few ids open a checking account and rent a private box where magazines and newspapers could forward the responses to the nameless ads no home address to trace the people who ran those private box services were in the business of offering secrecy to their clients it was going to be a long haul but this ad had a ring to it he got on the phone to the researchers they were closing in on doug fox also known as doug fields the harkness agencys file on him was an fbi investigators dream fields had been subletting the apartment for two years starting just about the time claire barnes disappeared joe pabst the harkness man had sat near fox in the soho restaurant it was clear he had met the woman through a personal ad hed made a date to take her dancing he had a station wagon pabst was sure that fox had some sort of hideout hed overheard him telling the real estate broker in soho that he had a retreat hed love to have her visit he was passing himself off as an illustrator the super of the london terrace building had been in and out of fieldss apartment and said that there were sketches lying around that were really good and he had been questioned in nan sheridans death but it was all circumstantial vince reminded himself did fox place ads or answer them or both would it be better to tap his london terrace phone for a while see what that turned up should they bring him in for questioning it was a tough one to call well at least darcy scott was already alerted to the possibility that fox was the one she wouldnt let herself get painted into a corner by him and wouldnt it be a bonus if it turned out that fox had placed the ad they knew erin kelley had been carrying around loves music loves to dance at noon vince got a vicap alert from headquarters in quantico calls had come in from police departments all over the country vermont washington dc ohio georgia california five more packages of mismatched shoes had been returned all of them contained a shoe or boot and a highheeled slipper all of them were sent to families of the young women who had turned up in the vicap file the young women who had lived in new york and been reported missing in the last two years at threethirty vince was ready to leave his office for hudson cable network his secretary stopped him as he passed her desk and handed him the phone mr charles north he says its important vince felt his eyebrows go up dont tell me that stuffy ambulance chaser is starting to cooperate he thought dambrosio he said crisply mr dambrosio i have been doing a great deal of thinking vince waited there is only one possible explanation i can come up with to account for how my plans may have fallen on the wrong ears vince felt a stir of interest when i came to new york in early february to make final living arrangements i attended a benefit at the plaza as the guest of my senior partner the century playwrights festival benefit it was quite a glittery crowd helen hayes tony randall martin charnin lee grant lucille lortel i was introduced to a great many people during the cocktail hour the senior partner at my firm was anxious that i become known i spoke to a group of four or five people right before dinner was announced one of them asked me for my card but i cant think of his name what did he look like youre speaking to someone with a very poormemory for both faces and names which i am sure must be puzzling to someone in your profession im vague about him about six feet late thirties or early forties late thirties i would think wellspoken do you think that if we got a roster of the people who attended that benefit it might stir your memory i dont know it might okay mr north im grateful for this well get the list and perhaps you can ask your senior partner if he recognizes the names of any of the people you spent time with north sounded alarmed and how would i explain the need for that information the faint stirring of gratitude that vince had felt for the mans attempt to be helpful disappeared mr north he snapped youre a lawyer you should be used to getting information without giving it he hung up and yelled for ernie i need the guest list for the century playwrights benefit at the plaza in early february he said shouldnt be hard to get you know where ill be it was march thirteenth nan s anniversary yesterday had been their thirtyfourth birthday long ago chris had started to celebrate his on the twentyfourth gretas birthday it was easier for both of them his mother had phoned yesterday before he left for work chris i thank my stars every day that i have you happy birthday dear this morning hed phoned her the tough day mother i guess it always will be are you sure you want to be on that program want to no but i think if it does anything to help solve this case its worth it maybe someone watching it will remember something about nan i hope so greta sighed her tone changed hows darcy chris she is so dear i think this whole business is wearing her down will she be on the program as well no and she doesnt want to watch it being taped it was a quiet day at the gallery chris had a chance to catch up on paperwork hed left instructions that if darcy came in he was to be notified but there was no sign of her maybe she wasnt well at two he phoned her office her secretary said she was working on some outside job all day and then planned to go directly home at threethirty chris was hailing a cab to go to hudson cable lets get this over with he thought grimly the guests for the program gathered in the greenroom nona introduced them the corras a couple in their midforties theyd separated each had placed a personal ad theyd answered each others ad that had been the catalyst that brought them back together the daleys a seriouslooking couple in their fifties neither had ever married theyd both been embarrassed about placing and answering ads theyd met three years ago it was good from the very beginning mrs daley said ive always been much too reticent i was able to put on paper what i couldnt say to anyone she was a research scientist he was a college professor adrian greenfield the vivacious divorc√©e in her late forties im having more fun she told the others actually they made a printing error they were supposed to say that i was wellliked instead they put down that i was wealthy i swear you need a uhaul for the mail ive gotten wayne harsh the shy president of a toy manufacturing company in his late twenties every mothers dream of the kind of guy her daughter will bring home vince decided harsh was enjoying his dates in his ad hed written that it frustrated him to see the toys he manufactured being enjoyed by kids all over the world while he is childless anxious to meet sweet bright woman in her twenties who wants a nice guy wholl be home on time and wont drop his laundry on the floor the lovebirds the cairones they fell in love on their first personal ad date at the end of the evening he had gone over to the piano at the bar where they met and played get me to the church on time they were married a month later until they came along i was worried that we didnt have any young couples nona had confided to vince when he arrived those two make you believe in romance vince saw the psychiatrist dr martin weiss come in and got up to greet him weiss was a man in his late sixties with a strong face a good head of silver hair penetrating blue eyes they went over to the coffeepot thank you for doing this on short notice doctor vince said hello vince vince turned as chris came up to them he remembered that this was the anniversary of nan sheridans death not the best day for you he said at quarter of five darcy leaned back in the cab her eyes closed at least today shed made up for lost time the painters would start next monday at the hotel this morning shed brought down a brochure from the pelham hotel in london this is an absolutely elegant and intimate hotel its like your place in the sense that the rooms arent large the reception area is small the parlor off it is perfect for receiving visitors notice the little bar in the corner you can have the same thing and study the rooms were not going to be nearly that grand of course but we can give it the effect it was obvious they were delighted now darcy thought ive got to get in touch with the window designer at wilstons shed been shocked to realize that when a window display was taken down the fabrics were often sold for peanuts yards and yards of topquality goods she shook her head trying to dislodge a nagging headache i dont know whether im getting a bug or if i just ache but its another early night for me the cab was pulling up to her building in the apartment her answering machine was blinking bev had left a message darcy you got the craziest call about twenty minutes ago call me right away quickly darcy dialed her office bev whats the message it was some woman spoke real low i could hardly hear her she wanted to know where she could get in touch with you i didnt want to give your home number so i said id give you a message she said she was in the bar the night erin disappeared afraid to admit it because her date wasnt her husband she saw erin meet someone who was coming in just as erin was leaving they walked away together she got a good look at him how can i get back to her you cant she wouldnt leave her name she wants you to meet her at that bar its eddies aurora on west fourth street off washington square she said to come alone and sit at the bar shell be there by six unless she cant get away dont wait any longer than that shell call tomorrow if you dont get together tonight thanks bev listen darcy im going to stay late i have an exam to study for and theres no peace and quiet in my apartment with my roommates friends always hanging around call me back wont you id just like to know that youre okay ill be fine but yes ill call you back darcy forgot that she was tired it was five of five she had just time to freshen her face brush her hair and change from her dusty jeans to a skirt and sweater oh erin she thought maybe its ending nona watched the credits roll as the guests chatted quietly still oncamera but offmike amen she said as the screen went dark she jumped up and ran down the steps to the set you were wonderful she said every one of you i cant thank you enough a relaxed smile from some of the participants chris vince and dr weiss got up together im glad its over chris said understandable martin weiss said from what ive heard today both you and your mother have shown remarkable strength through all this you do what you have to do doctor nona came up to them the others are leaving but i wish you people would come back to my office for a cocktail youve certainly earned it oh i dont think weiss shook his head then hesitated i must check in with my office if i can do it from there of course chris debated he realized how low he was feeling darcys secretary had said she was going straight home he wondered if he could talk her into a quick dinner can i get on line for the phone too dial away the beeper went off on vinces belt i hope you have a lot of phones around here nona vince dialed from the secretarys desk and received a message to call ernie at the century playwrights festival office when he reached him ernie was brimming with news ive got the guest list guess who was there that night who erin kelley and jay stratton holy smoke he thought of the description north had given him of the man who had taken his card tall late thirties or early forties wellspoken but erin kelley that afternoon in kelleys apartment darcy had selected a pink and silver dress for erin to be buried in darcy had told him erin bought it to wear to a benefit then when hed picked up the package of shoes that had been mailed to darcys apartment shed said that the evening slipper in the package went better with erins pink and silver dress than the ones erin had bought herself he suddenly knew why the shoes went so well with it her killer had been at the benefit and seen her wearing that dress meet me in nona robertss office he told ernie we might as well go downtown together in the office dr weiss seemed more relaxed no problems i was concerned that one patient might need to see me tonight ms roberts im going to take advantage of your kindness my youngest son is a communications major and will be graduating from college in june how does he get a foothold in this business chris sheridan had moved the phone from nonas desk to the windowsill absently he fingered the dusty plant darcy wasnt home when hed called her office her secretary had been evasive something about expecting to hear from her later a very important meeting had come up his intuition was pounding at him something was wrong he knew it darcy wasnt supposed to wait any longer than six oclock she stayed until sixthirty then decided to give up for tonight obviously the woman who called hadnt been able to meet her she paid for the perrier and left she stepped out onto the street the wind had stirred up again and seemed to cut through her body i hope i can get a cab she said to herself darcy im so glad i caught you your secretary said youd be here hop in oh youre a lifesaver what luck len parker huddled in a doorway across the street and watched the vanishing taillights it was just like last time when erin kelley came out and someone called her from that station wagon suppose this was the same person who had killed erin kelley should he call that fbi agent his name was dambrosio len had his card would they think he was crazy erin kelley had walked out on him and darcy scott had refused to have dinner with him but hed been mean to them maybe he should call hed spent a lot of money on cabs following darcy scott these last couple of days and the phone call would only cost a quarter chris turned from the window he had to ask vince dambrosio had just come back into the room do you know if darcy is answering another one of those damn ads tonight he demanded vince saw the concern on sheridan s face and ignored the belligerent tone he knew it was not directed at him i understood from nona that darcy was planning an early night she was the smile vanished from nonas face when i called her office her secretary said she was going straight home from that hotel shes redoing well something changed her mind chris retorted her secretary sounds very mysterious whats her office number vince grabbed the phone when bev answered he identified himself im concerned about miss scotts plans if you know what they are i want to hear them id really rather let her get back to you bev began but was interrupted listen miss i have no intention of interfering with her private life but if this has to do with a personal ad i want to know were getting very close to solving this case but no one is in custody well promise not to interfere where is darcy scott bev told him vince gave her nonas number ask miss scott to call me immediately when you hear from her he hung up shes meeting a woman who claims she saw erin kelley leave eddies aurora in the village the night she disappeared and can describe the man she met outside this woman hasnt come forward because she was with a guy who wasnt her husband do you believe it nona asked i dont like the sound of it but if darcy meets her in that bar it should be okay what time is it sixthirty dr weiss said then darcy should be phoning her office any minute she was only supposed to wait until six for that caller to show up didnt the same thing happen to erin kelley chris demanded as i understand it she went to eddies aurora was stood up left and disappeared vince felt the skin on the back of his neck start to crawl ill phone there when he reached the bar he fired rapid questions listened then slammed down the receiver the bartender says a young woman answering darcys description walked out a few minutes ago nobody showed up to meet her chris swore under his breath the moment when hed found nan s body fifteen years ago today filled his mind with sickening clarity an escort from reception tapped on the halfopen door mr cizek from the fbi says youre expecting him she told nona nona nodded show him in cizek was pulling the thick guest list for the playwrights gala from a bulging manila envelope as he came through the door it was stuck when he tried to yank it out the clip fell off and the pages scattered nona and dr weiss helped to retrieve them chris was clenching and unclenching his fists vince noticed we have two strong suspects he told chris and we have a tail on both of them dr weiss was examining one of the pages he picked up as though he was thinking aloud he commented id have thought he was too busy with his personal ads to go to parties vince looked up quickly who are you talking about weiss seemed embarrassed dr michael nash forgive me that was an unprofessional comment nothing is unprofessional at this point vince said sharply it could be very important that dr nash was at the benefit you sound as if you dont like him why all eyes were on martin weiss he seemed to be debating with himself then said slowly this must go no farther than this room one of nashs former patients who now consults with me noticed him in a restaurant with a young woman she knew the next time she saw that young woman she teased her about it vince felt his nerves tingling the way they always did when he sensed a break in the case go on doctor weiss looked uncomfortable my patients young friend said that she had met the man when she answered his personal ad and wasnt surprised to learn that he had lied about his name and background she felt distinctly uneasy with him vince sensed that dr weiss was deliberately choosing his words doctor he said you know what were up against youve got to level with me what is your candid opinion of dr michael nash i consider it unethical for him to do research for a professional book under false pretenses weiss said cautiously youre hedging vince told him if you were on the witness stand how would you describe him weiss looked away loner he said flatly repressed pleasant on the surface but basically antisocial probably has deeprooted problems that began to manifest themselves in childhood however hes a natural dissembler and could fool most professionals chris felt blood pounding in his temples has darcy been seeing this guy yes nona whispered doctor vince continued rapidly i want to get in touch with that young woman immediately and find out what ad he placed my patient brought it in to show me weiss said i have it in my office would you remember if it began loves music loves to dance vince asked as weiss said why yes thats right vinces beeper went off he grabbed the phone dialed and barked his name nona chris dr weiss and ernie waited in absolute silence as they saw the lines on vince dambrosios forehead deepen still holding the receiver he told them that len parker looney just phoned in he was following darcy she came out of that bar and got into the same station wagon erin kelley drove off in the night she disappeared he paused then said tersely its a black mercedes registered to dr michael nash of bridgewater new jersey you have a different car i mostly use this one in the country you got back early from the convention the speaker i was to replace felt well enough to come after all i see michael youre sweet but i think id just as soon go home tonight whatd you have for dinner last night darcy smiled a can of soup you lean your head back and rest sleep if you can mrs hughes is going to have a fire blazing a terrific dinner and then you can sleep all the way home he reached over and gently stroked her hair doctors orders darcy you know i like taking care of you its nice to be taken care of oh she reached for the car phone is it all right if i call my secretary i promised to check in with her he placed his hand over hers and squeezed it im afraid it will have to wait until we get to the house the phone is broken now you just relax darcy knew bev would be there at least a few more hours she closed her eyes and began to drift off she was asleep by the time they went through the lincoln tunnel well have nashs apartment checked vince said but hed never take her there or to his office the doorman would see them darcy told me his place in bridgewater is a fourhundredacre estate shes been there a couple of times nona was gripping the sides of the desk to steady herself then if he suggested going there with him tonight she wouldnt be suspicious vince felt growing anger at himself ernie returned from the next office ive checked surveillance doug fox is home in scarsdale jay stratton is at the park lane with some old broad that lets them out it makes sense vince thought furiously nash left word on erin s answering machine to call him at his apartment the night he drove off with her i never thought to check that out he leaves a phony message with darcys secretary and probably acts as though the secretary told him where to find darcy we know darcy trusts him sure she gets into his car and if that weirdo parker hadnt been trailing her shed have vanished into thin air too how are we going to find darcy chris asked desperately agonizing fear that made it hard to breathe was crushing his chest he knew that sometime in this past week he had fallen hard for darcy scott vince was on the line snapping orders to headquarters alert the bridgewater police he was saying have them meet us there be careful vince ernie warned we have absolutely no proof of anything and the only witness is certifiably nuts chris spun on him you be careful he felt weiss grip his arm get directions to nashs place vince was saying and have a chopper at the thirtieth street pad in ten minutes five minutes later they were in a patrol car lights flashing sirens screaming racing down ninth avenue vince was in the front seat with the driver nona chris and ernie cizek in the back chris had flatly declared that he was going with vince nona had looked at vince her eyes begging vince did not share the chilling information received from the bridgewater police nashs estate had a number of outer buildings scattered over the four hundred acres including some in wooded areas a search could take a long time and every minute we lose the clock is running out for darcy he thought were here sweetheart darcy stirred i did fall asleep didnt i she yawned forgive me for being such boring company i was glad you were sleeping rest heals the spirit as well as the body darcy looked out where are we only ten miles from the house i have a little retreat where i get my writing done and i forgot my manuscript the other day you dont mind if we stop for it as a matter of fact we can have a glass of sherry here as long as we dont stay too long i do want to get home early michael you will i promise come on in sorry its so dark his hand was under her arm how did you ever find this place darcy asked as he opened the door pure luck i know it doesnt look like much outside but the interior is quite nice he pushed the door open and reached for the light switch beneath it darcy noticed a button marked panic she looked around the large room oh this is handsome she said taking in the seating area by the fireplace the open kitchen the polished floors then she noticed the bigscreen television and elaborate stereo speakers thats magnificent equipment isnt it wasted in a writing retreat no it isnt he was removing her coat darcy shivered even though the room was comfortably warm there was a bottle of wine in a silver holder on the coffee table by the sofa does mrs hughes take care of this place no she doesnt know it exists he walked the length of the room and switched on the stereo the opening bars of till there was you sounded from the wall speakers come here darcy he poured sherry into a glass and handed it to her on a cold night this tastes wonderful doesnt it he was smiling at her affectionately then what was wrong why did she suddenly sense something different his voice seemed slightly blurred almost as though hed been drinking his eyes that was it there was something about his eyes her instinct was to run for the door but that was ridiculous she searched frantically for something to say her eyes rested on the staircase how many rooms do you have upstairs to her own ears the question sounded abrupt he didnt seem to notice just a smallish bedroom and bath this is one of those really oldfashioned cottages the smile was still there but his eyes were changing the pupils widening where were his computer and printer and books and all the usual trappings of a writer darcy felt perspiration form on her forehead what was the matter with her was she going crazy suspecting what it was just nerves this was michael holding his sherry he settled in the large chair opposite the sofa and stretched out his legs his eyes never left her face let me look around she walked aimlessly through the room pausing as though to examine one of the few pieces of bricabrac running her hand over the countertop that separated the kitchen area from the rest of the room what beautiful cabinets i had them made but i installed them myself you did his voice was genial but a hard edge came into it i told you my father was a selfmade man he wanted me to be able to turn my hand to anything he did a good job teaching you there was no way she could stand here any longer she turned walked toward the sofa and stepped on something solid that was almost covered by the fringe of the rug in the seating area ignoring it darcy sat down quickly her knees were shaking so much she felt as though they would buckle under her what was the matter why was she so afraid this was michael kind considerate michael she did not want to think about erin now but erin s face was looming in her mind she took a quick sip of sherry to relieve the dryness in her mouth the music stopped michael looked annoyed got up and went to the stereo from the shelf above it he took a pile of cassettes and began to examine them i didnt realize that tape was so close to the end it was as though he was talking to himself darcy gripped the stem of the glass now her hands were trembling a few drops of sherry spilled on the floor she grabbed the cocktail napkin and bent to pat it dry as she began to straighten up she noticed that something was actually caught in the fringe of the rug something that glinted in the light from the lamp beside the sofa thats what she must have stepped on it was probably a button she reached for it the tips of her thumb and index finger slipped into hollow space and met it wasnt a button it was a ring darcy picked it up and stared unbelieving a gold e on an onyx background in an oval setting erin s ring erin had been in this house erin had answered michael nashs personal ad sheer horror washed over darcy michael had lied when he claimed hed only met erin once for a drink at the pierre the stereo suddenly started to blare sorry michael said his back was still to her change partners and dance he was humming the opening bars with the orchestra as he lowered the volume and turned to her help me darcy prayed help me he must not see the ring he was staring at her she clasped her hands together managed to slip the ring on her finger as michael came to her his arms outstretched weve never danced together darcy im good and i know you are erin s body had been found with a dancing slipper on her foot had she danced with him here in this room had she died in this room darcy leaned back on the sofa i didnt think you cared about dancing michael when i talked about the classes nona and erin and i took together i didnt think you were very interested he dropped his arms reached for his glass of sherry he perched on the chair this time so much on the edge that it seemed as though his legs planted on the floor were preventing him from falling almost as though any moment he might spring at her i love dancing he said i didnt think it would be healthy for you to be thinking about the fun you had taking those classes with erin darcy tilted her head as though considering his answer you dont stop riding in cars because someone you cared about was in an automobile accident do you she did not wait for a response but tried to change the subject she examined the stem of the glass lovely glassware she commented i bought a set of these in vienna he said i swear they make the sherry taste even better she smiled with him now he sounded like the michael she knew the strange look in his eye vanished for an instant keep him like that her intuition warned talk to him make him talk to you michael she made her voice hesitant confidential can i ask you something of course he looked interested the other day i think you were suggesting that ive been making my parents pay for that remark that hurt me so much when i was a kid can i possibly be that selfish during the twentyminute helicopter ride no one spoke his mind racing vince had gone over every detail of the investigation michael nash i sat in his office thinking he sounded like one of the few shrinks who make sense was this a wildgoose chase what was to say that someone with nashs money hadnt some sort of retreat in connecticut or upstate new york maybe he did but with all his property the odds were that he would bring his victims here over the whir of the propeller vince could hear in his head the names of serial killers who buried their victims in the attics or basements of their own homes the chopper circled over the country road there vince pointed to the right where twin high beams were gleaming upward making paths through the darkness the bridgewater police said theyd park right outside nashs place put it down the mansion was outwardly tranquil there were lights shining from several windows on the main floor vince insisted that nona stay outside with the pilot ernie and chris at his heels he ran from the side lawn up the long driveway and rang the bell leave the talking to me a woman answered using the intercom who is it vince clenched his teeth if nash was in there they were giving him plenty of warning fbi agent vincent dambrosio maam i must speak to dr nash a moment later the door opened slightly the security chain was still in place may i see your identification sir the courteous tone of a trained servant this time a man vince passed it through hurry them chris urged the security chain was released the door opened housekeeping couple vince thought they had that look he asked them to identify themselves were john and irma hughes we work for dr nash is he here yes he is mrs hughes answered hes been in all evening hes completing his book and doesnt wish to be disturbed darcy you really have great introspection michael said i told you that last week youre feeling a little guilty about your attitude toward your parents arent you i think i am darcy could see that his pupils were closer to normal size the bluegray color was visible in his eyes the next song on the tape began to play red roses for a blue lady michaels right foot began to move in synch with the music should i feel guilty she asked quickly where is dr nashs room vince demanded ill take responsibility for disturbing him he always locks the door when he wants privacy and wont answer hes very firm about not being interrupted when hes in his room we havent even seen him since we got home from shopping late this afternoon but his car is in the driveway chris had had enough hes not upstairs hes driving around in a station wagon doing god knows what chris started for the staircase where the hell is his room mrs hughes looked pleadingly at her husband then led them up the stairs her repeated knocking brought no response have you a key vince demanded doctor has forbidden me to use it when he leaves his door locked get it as vince had expected the massive bedroom was empty mrs hughes we have a witness who saw darcy scott get into the doctors station wagon tonight we believe she is in imminent danger does dr nash have a studio or a cottage on this property or some other place he might have taken her you must be mistaken the woman protested hes brought miss scott here twice theyre great friends mrs hughes you havent answered my question on this estate there are barns and a stable and some storage facilities theres no other building where hed bring a young lady he also has an apartment and office in new york her husband was nodding in agreement vince could see they were telling the truth sir mrs hughes said timidly weve worked for dr nash for fourteen years if miss scott is with him i can assure you you have nothing to worry about dr nash wouldnt hurt a fly how long had they been talking darcy didnt know the music was soft in the background begin the beguine was playing how often had she seen her mother and father dance to this music mother and daddy were the ones who really taught me to dance she told nash sometimes theyd just put on records and foxtrot or waltz theyre really good his eyes were still kind they were the eyes shed seen the other times shed been with him as long as he didnt suspect that she knew about him maybe he would leave with her take her to the house for dinner ive got to make him want to keep talking to me mother had always said darcy you have a real talent for acting why do you keep resisting it if i have it let me prove it now she prayed all her life shed heard her mother and father discussing how a scene should be played she must have learned something i cant let him see how scared i am darcy thought channel my nervousness into the performance how would her mother play this scene a woman trapped in the home of a serial killer mother would stop thinking about erin s ring on her finger and do exactly what darcy was trying to pull off shed play it as though michael nash was a psychiatrist and she was a patient confiding in him what was michael saying have you noticed darcy that when you let yourself talk about your parents you become animated i think you enjoyed your childhood much more than you realized people always clustered around them remember the time the crowd was so great that she lost her mothers hand tell me darcy what are you thinking say it let it out i was so frightened i couldnt see them i knew that moment that i hated what did you hate the crowds being torn from them it wasnt their fault if they werent so famous youve resented that fame no it was working his voice was his own i dont want to talk about this she thought but i must ive got to be honest with him its my only chance mother daddy help me be here for me theyre so far away she didnt know shed said it aloud who are my mother and father you mean now yes theyre touring in australia with their play you sound so forlorn frightened even are you frightened darcy dont let him think that no im just sorry that i wont see them for six months do you think the time you were separated from them that day was the first time you felt abandoned she wanted to shout i feel abandoned now instead she turned her mind to the past yes you hesitated why there was another time when i was six i was in the hospital and they didnt think i was going to live she tried not to look at him she was so afraid the eyes would become empty and dark again she was reminded of the character in one thousand and one nights who had told stories to stay alive chris was engulfed with a sense of helplessness darcy had been in this house a few days ago with the man who had killed nan and erin kelley and all those other girls and she was going to be his next victim they were in the kitchen where vince had an open line on one phone to the bureau a second one to the state police more copters were on the way nona was standing near vince looking as though she was about to pass out the hugheses their expressions bewildered and frightened were sitting shoulders touching at the long refectory table a local cop was talking to them questioning them about nashs activities ernie cizek was in the chopper which was flying low over the grounds chris could hear the sound of the engine through the closed window they were looking for michael nashs black mercedes station wagon local squad cars were fanning out across the property checking the outer buildings grimly chris remembered how lucky hed been when he bought a mercedes station wagon last year the salesman had talked him into having the lojack system installed its built right into the wiring hed explained if your car is ever stolen it can be located within minutes you phone in your lojack code number to the police its fed into a computer and a transmitter activates the system in your vehicle many police cars are equipped to follow the signal chris had owned the station wagon only one week before it was stolen outside the gallery with a one hundred thousand dollar painting in the back hed dashed back inside his office for his briefcase and when he came out the car was gone hed phoned to report the theft and within fifteen minutes the station wagon had been traced and recovered if only nash had picked up darcy in a stolen car that could be traced oh my god chris ran across the room and grabbed mrs hughess arm does nash keep his personal files here or in new york she looked startled here in a room off the library i want to see them vince said hold it into the phone what have you got chris chris didnt answer how long has the doctor owned the station wagon about six months john hughes replied he trades in regularly then ill bet he has it the files were contained in a row of handsome mahogany cabinets mrs hughes knew where the key was hidden the mercedes file was easy to find chris grabbed it his exultant cry brought the others running from the folder he pulled the lojack pamphlet the code number for nashs black mercedes was listed the bridgewater cop realized what chris had found give me that he said ill phone it in our squad cars have the system you were in the hospital darcy michaels voice was calm her mouth was so dry she wanted a glass of water but she didnt dare distract him yes i had spinal meningitis i remember feeling so sick i thought i was going to die my parents were at the bedside i heard the doctor say he didnt think id make it how did your mother and father react they were hugging each other my father said barbara we have each other and that hurt you didnt it i knew they didnt need me she whispered oh darcy dont you know that when you think youre going to lose someone you love the instinctive reaction is to look for someone or something to hang on to they were trying to cope or more accurately preparing to cope believe it or not thats healthy and ever since then youve been trying to shut them out havent you had she always resisting the clothes her mother bought for her the gifts they showered on her scorning their lifestyle something theyd worked all their lives to achieve even her job was that oneupmanship to prove something no it isnt what isnt my job i really do love what i do love what i do michael repeated the words slowly in cadence a new song had begun on the tape save the last dance for me he stood up and i love to dance now darcy but first i have a present for you horrified she watched as he got up and reached behind the chair he turned to her a shoe box in his hand i bought you pretty slippers to dance in darcy he knelt in front of the sofa and pulled off her boots every instinct warned darcy not to protest she dug her nails into her palms to keep from screaming erin s ring had turned and she could feel the impression of the raised e against her skin michael was opening the shoe box and parting the tissue he took one shoe out and held it up for her to admire it was an opentoed highheeled satin slipper gossamer ankle straps were almost transparent bands of gold and silver michael took darcys right foot in his hand and eased it into the shoe doubleknotting the long straps he reached into the box removed the other slipper and caressed her ankle as he guided her foot along the insole when she had both shoes on he looked up and smiled do you feel like cinderella he asked she could not answer the radar indicates the wagon is parked about ten miles away in a northwest direction the bridgewater cop said tersely as the squad car raced down the country road vince chris and nona were with him the signals getting stronger he said a few minutes later were getting closer until were there were not close enough chris exploded cant you go faster they rounded a curve the driver slammed on the brakes the squad car skidded then straightened oh hell whats the matter vince snapped theyre digging up the road down here we cant get through and the damn detour will waste time music filled the room but could not drown out his maniacal laugh darcys footsteps were flying in synch with his i dont often do a viennese waltz he shouted but tonight it was what i planned for you twirling bobbing turning darcys hair flew around her face she was gasping but he seemed not to notice the waltz ended he did not remove his arms from around her his eyes were glittering dark empty holes again cant get started with you easily he slipped into a graceful foxtrot effortlessly she followed him he was holding her tightly crushing her she couldnt breathe is this what he did to the others got them to trust him brought them to this desolate house where were their bodies buried around here somewhere what chance did she have to get away from him hed catch her before she could get to the door when they came in shed noticed the panic button was it hooked up to a security system knowing that someone was on the way he might not kill her now there was a growing urgency about michael his arm was like steel as he glided and stepped in perfect time to the music do you want to know my secret he whispered this isnt my house its charleys house charley backstep glide turn yes thats my real name edward and janice nash were my aunt and uncle they adopted me when i was a year old and changed my name from charley to michael he was staring down at her darcy could not bear to look into those eyes backstep sidestep glide what happened to your real parents my father killed my mother they electrocuted him whenever my uncle was mad at me he said i was getting just like him my aunt was nice to me when i was little but then she stopped loving me she said theyd been crazy to adopt me she said bad blood shows a new song frank sinatra crooning hey there cutes put on your dancing boots and come dance with me step step glide im glad youre telling me this michael it helps to talk doesnt it i want you to call me charley all right she tried not to sound tentative he mustnt see her fear dont you want to know what happened to my mother and father i mean the people who raised me yes i do darcy thought of how tired her legs were she was not used to the spike heels she felt as though the tight ankle straps were cutting off her circulation sidestep turn sinatra urged romance with me on a crowded floor when i was twentyone they were in a boating accident the boat blew up im sorry im not i rigged the boat i am just like my real father youre getting tired darcy no no im fine i enjoy dancing with you stay calm stay calm you can rest soon were you surprised when you got erin s shoes back yes very surprised she was so pretty she liked me on our date i told her about my book and she talked about the program and about how you and she were answering personal ads that was really funny id already decided youd be next after her next after her why did you choose us and while the rhythm pings what coocoo things ill be saying sinatra sang you both answered the special ad all the girls i brought here did but erin wrote to one of my other ads too the one i showed the fbi agent youre very clever charley do you like the spike heels i bought for erin they match her dress i know they do i was at the playwrights benefit too i recognized erin from the picture she sent me and i looked up her name on the seating list to make sure i was right she was sitting four tables away it was fate that i already had a date to meet her the very next night step step glide turn how did you know erin s shoe size my size it was so easy i bought erin s shoes in different sizes i wanted just that pair for her remember last week when you had a pebble in your boot and i helped you take it out i saw your size then and the others girls like to be flattered id say you have such pretty feet what size are you sometimes i bought shoes specially other times id take them from the ones i already had the real charles north didnt place any personal ads did he no i met him at that benefit too he kept talking about himself and i asked him for his business card i never use my own name when i call people who answer the special ad you made it easy you called me yes she had called him you say erin liked you when you met her the first time werent you afraid shed recognize your voice when you called and said you were charles north i phoned from penn station where theres a lot of noise i told her i was running to catch a train to philadelphia i lowered my voice and spoke faster than usual just like this afternoon when i talked to your secretary the timbre of his voice changed became highpitched dont i sound like a woman now suppose i hadnt been able to go to that bar tonight what would you have done you told me you didnt have any plans for this evening i knew youd do anything to find the man erin met the night she disappeared and i was right yes charley you were right he nuzzled her neck step step glide im so glad you both answered my special ad you know what it is dont you it begins loves music loves to dance because what is dancing but making love set to music playing sinatra continued thats one of my favorite songs michael whispered he twirled her never relaxing his grip on her hand when he drew her back in his tone became confidential even regretful it was nan s fault that i started killing girls nan sheridan chris sheridans face filled darcys mind the sadness in his eyes when he talked about his sister the authority and presence he had in the gallery the way his staff obviously loved him his mother the easy relationship between them she could hear him saying i hope youre not a vegetarian darcy gourmet delight time his concern that she was answering these ads how right hed been i wish id had a chance to get to know you chris i wish id had a chance to tell my mother and father i loved them yes nan sheridan after i graduated from stanford i spent a year in boston before i started med school i used to drive down to brown a lot thats where i met nan she was a wonderful dancer youre good but she was wonderful the familiar opening bars of good night sweetheart no darcy thought no backstep sidestep glide michael something else i meant to ask you about my mother she began he pushed her head down on his shoulder i told you to call me charley dont talk anymore he said firmly well just dance time will heal your sorrow floated through the room darcy didnt recognize the singers voice good night sweetheart good night the last notes faded into the air michael dropped his arms and smiled at darcy its time he said in a friendly voice although his expression was blankly terrifying ill give you to the count of ten to try to get away isnt that fair they were back on the road the signal is coming from the left wait a minute were going too far the bridgewater cop said there must be a side road here somewhere the wheels screeched as they made a uturn the sense of impending disaster had grown in chris to the explosive point he opened the car window there for gods sake theres a driveway the squad car ground to a halt backed up turned sharply right raced along the rutted ground darcy slipped and slid on the polished floor the highheeled slippers were her enemies as she ran for the door she took a precious instant to stop and try to yank the shoes off but she couldnt the double knots on the straps were too tight one charley called from behind her she reached the door and tugged at the bolt it did not release she twisted the knob it did not turn two three four five six im counting darcy the panic button she jammed her finger against it hahahahahahaha a hollow mocking laugh echoed through the room hahahaha the sound was coming from the panic button with a shriek darcy jumped back now charley was laughing too seven eight nine she turned saw the stairway began to run to it ten charley was rushing toward her his hands outstretched his fingers bent his thumbs rigid no no darcy tried to reach the staircase skidded her ankle turned sharp stabbing pain moaning she hobbled onto the first step and felt herself pulled back she didnt know she was screaming theres the mercedes vince cried the squad car slammed to a stop behind it he sprang out of the car chris and the cop with him stay back vince shouted to nona listen chris held up his hand someones screaming its darcy he and vince threw themselves against the thick oak door it didnt budge the cop pulled out his gun and pumped six bullets into the lock this time when chris and vince attacked the door it opened darcy tried to kick charley with the sharp stiletto heels he spun her around seeming not to feel the heels stabbing at his legs his hands were around her neck she tried to claw them away erin erin is this the way it was for you she couldnt scream anymore she opened her mouth frantic to gulp in air and could find none were those moans coming from her she tried to keep fighting but couldnt raise her arms again vaguely she heard loud staccato sounds was someone trying to help her its too late she thought as she felt herself fall into darkness chris got through the doorway first darcy was dangling like a rag doll her arms drooping at her sides her legs buckled under her long powerful fingers were squeezing her throat her screams had stopped with a cry of rage chris flew across the room and tackled nash who sagged and fell pulling darcy with him his hands convulsed then tightened their grip around her neck vince threw himself next to nash snapped his arm around nashs neck forcing his head back the bridgewater cop grabbed nashs thrashing feet charleys hands seemed to have a life of their own chris could not pry his fingers loose from darcys throat nash seemed to be possessed of superhuman strength and impervious to pain desperately chris sank his teeth into the right hand of the man who was snuffing out darcys life with a howl of pain charley yanked back his right hand and relaxed the left one vince and the cop twisted his arms behind him and snapped handcuffs on his wrists as chris grabbed darcy nona had been watching from the doorway now she rushed into the house and dropped to her knees at darcys feet darcys eyes were not focusing there were ugly red bruises on her slender throat chris covered darcys mouth with his own pinched her nostrils closed forced breath into her lungs vince looked at darcys staring eyes and began to pound her chest the bridgewater cop was guarding michael nash who was handcuffed to the banister nash began to recite in a singsong voice eeney meeney miney mo catch a dancer by the toe shes not responding nona thought frantically she grasped darcys ankles and for the first time realized darcy was wearing dancing slippers i cant stand it nona thought i cant stand it almost unaware of what she was doing nona began to struggle with the knots on the ankle straps one little piggy went to market one little piggy stayed home sing it again mama i have ten piggy toes we may be too late vince thought furiously as he searched for some response from darcy but if we are you lousy bastard youd better not think that spouting nursery rhymes now will help you prove insanity chris raised his head as he gulped in air and for a split second stared at darcys face the same look as nan when he found her that morning the bruised throat the bluewhite tone to her skin no i wont let it happen darcy breathe nona weeping now had finally untied one of the ankle straps she pushed it back and began to pull the highheeled slipper from darcys foot she felt something was she wrong no her foot is moving she cried shes trying to get it out of the shoe at the same instant vince saw a pulse begin to beat in darcys throat and chris heard a long drawnout sigh come from her lips xxiii thursday march the next morning vince phoned susan mrs fox your husband may be a philanderer but hes not a criminal we have the serial killer in custody and we have absolute proof that he is solely responsible for the dancingshoe deaths starting with nan sheridan thank you i guess you can understand what this means to me who was that doug had stayed home from work he felt lousy not sick just lousy susan told him he stared at her you mean you told the fbi you thought i was a murderer you actually thought i killed nan sheridan and all those other women his face darkened in incredulous rage susan stared back at him i thought that was a possibility and that by lying for you fifteen years ago i might also be responsible for those other deaths i swore to you that i never went near nan the morning she died obviously you didnt then where were you doug at least level with me now the anger faded from his face he looked away then turned back with a cajoling smile susan i told you then i repeat it the car broke down that morning i want the truth you owe it to me doug hesitated then said slowly i was with penny knowles susan im sorry i didnt want you to know because i was afraid of losing you you mean penny knowles was about to get engaged to bob carver and didnt want to take a chance on losing out on the carver money shed have let you be accused of murder before shed speak up for you susan i know i
