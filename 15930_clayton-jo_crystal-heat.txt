jo clayton crystal heat prologue rumblings before the game begins a conversation by letter or how to keep your thoughts away from a ubiquitous and apparently omniscient employer so thats over i really didnt want to send the disruptor back to sunflower labs but it was digbys call so back it went i believe he managed to duplicate it first and his techs are market cream so could be hell have a defense out before that thing becomes too much of a problem ive been called in tomorrow it seems that theres another investigation that can use my talents im beginning to have second thoughts about this job lee and just maybe about digby himself which is why im writing this not just giving you a call anyway ill see how this one goes any hunts on the horizon lilai should be old enough by now for you to leave her without worrying too much selfishly i rather hope youll be home when this new business is finished i need somebody to talk things over with without prying little electronic ears straining to hear what im saying aleytys dropped the letter on the table beside the drone capsule where it coiled up into the tight cylinder itd been when she took it out of the capsule she poked it with her finger watched it rock back and forth till it settled to stability again was it worth the expense aleytys lifted her head grey stood in the doorway looking tired and cranky she suppressed a sigh she didnt want to deal with his crotchets but shed asked him to come just a note from shadow shes got a new investigation i want a hunt grey i dont care what it is so thats what this is about every time that woman shoves her nose in here you get all stirred up no this is me talking its been two years grey its time i was out again theres nothing suitable i told you when something comes in thats right for you ill call you is there anything else no without trying to protest further she watched him turn and leave it was only after she heard the whine of the lifting flier that she dropped her head in her hands shadow on the job i refuse to be intimidated by a spook shadith folded her hands in her lap and smiled politely at digbys simulacrum hed been fiddling with it again it was solid now with the weighty feel of real flesh though it was nothing more than colored light she could walk through if the thought didnt revolt her he sat at a real desk a broad battered stretch of dark wood in a real chairan antique leather thing that swiveled and had micromotors installed to make it creak and tilt as if it moved to the shifting of his body the instrumentation though was simulation he had no need for exterior connections to the kephalos buried deep beneath the building the kephalos which created the simulacrum and controlled all functions in here in a sense he was the kephalos today he was being the academic in conference with the wayward student he wasnt wearing the fez with the gilded tassel that he affected sometimes but had gifted himself with silvergray hair flowing in thick waves from a noble brow and a severe expression that went well with that beak of a nose odd how recognizable he was in all his incarnations hm incarnation was not precisely the right word since whatever flesh hed once worn must have long ago rotted back to the earth it was born from the simulacrum looked up no digby looked up laughter in his eyes a sly selfmocking twinkle he always puts a twist on things she thought he knows just how much this isnt impressing me hm the voice he was using was a rough tenor your little ghost yseyl is profoundly insane in terms of her culture quite at home in ours though perhaps more than you are with a twitch of nonlips into an ironic smile he lifted a simulated sheet off a nonexistent pile pretended to read it then looked up the disruptor is on its way back to sunflower the rep was delighted with the swiftness of the retrieval and most impressed he turned another page i begin to think ginny seyirshi was right when he called you a catalyst by the time you were through with them the ptak world was thoroughly chewed up their commerce disrupted one war winding itself down through attrition and a new one fruiting the place is probably going to be chaotic for years he dropped that last sheet fitted his hands palm against palm and contemplated her you managed with admirable discretion to keep any mention ofexcavations ltd from notice however in other areas discretion was hmmm noticeably lacking the peripheral effects of your activities are hm disconcerting added to your tumultuous romp through the assorted worldsduring the dyslaera affair theres a pattern that hm shall we say limits your usefulness so im fired shadith slid forward in the chair irritated prepared to get to her feet she was getting rritated and saw no need to listen to a bunch of painted light scolding her jump jump hat stop acting like a startled flea shadow no of course youre not fired it just means i have to be careful to use you in places that i wouldnt mind seeing trashed in your inimitable fashion as long of course as we are not visibly engaged in that trashing the areas in which i can use you are limited but they do continue to exist he leaned back laced his nonfingers across his nonbelly she watched his careful mimicry of the gestures of the flesh and wondered about it a little is he trying to be sure that he doesnt lose that self which comes so pungently through his poses odd how that chimedwith what shed written to aleytys maybe its because he is like me like swardheld and harskari that i dont trust him immortal and immaterial in that his essence lived in a matrix of forces with even less to hold his self intact than shed had at least she and the others from the diadem had the body of the wearer to remind them what they were and the limits of the field that preservedthem digby was in a sense scattered across half a hundred worldsmaybe morewith no limits nothing but his will to avoid dissolution whats he up to i see this manifestation of him but how much of that is construct how much is meant to reassure me and his clients she pulled her attention back and saw digby waiting with exaggerated patience so she said why am i here the kliu berej have hired excavations ltd theyve lost a taalav gestalt array from pillory the prison planet they run hm not a prisoner a lifeform native to the world one of the weirdest ive ever come across an assemblage the various parts reproduce and grow to adulthood as separate forms then in the last change grow into each other to create the gestalt which means to breed and grow a taalav you need an assortment of smaller parts which is why they call it an array ive put the information the kliu provided in your packet you can read the details later always remembering that clients have been known to lie their brains out so dont trust it too much they want the array returned sounds complicated no they want to know where it is so they can destroy it the taalav extrude a crystalline substance and shape it into complex forms the kliu have a monopoly on those crystals and mean to keep it they wanted the thief too but werent willing to pay double to include him in the deal so all i contracted to do was locate the array and to keep the search quiet you can see why once something like that happens every jack and smuggler with delusions of grandeur will be out trying to find it himself do they know who the thief is or are we supposed to discover that also they know he was one of the xenobiologists studying the taalav making sure they stay healthy and producing crystal not a kliu a prisoner a cousin working in an exoskeleton because of pillorys gravity dont know why he was sent there they wont release his files or tell me anything about him not even his name and description i suppose they might have to refund some of their fee if his planet of conviction discovers hes gone missing just how much cooperation are we going to get as little as they feel they can get away with we cant trust the kliu shadow ive had clients like them before letter of the contract and thats it keep that in mind and theres thisthe theft was almost a year ago theyve been using available resources to search for the array but theyre a cautious species and have decided on backup just in case their hands slip thats us you if they spot you as my agent theyll put a trace on you and as soon as you look to be getting somewhere theyll zip round you and scoop the pot under our noses then they come round saying sorry we found the smuggler ourselves you get your onepercent killfee no more thats extrapolation but you can be sure the conclusion is solid if you need cover and cant arrange it call me i expect you to use your ingenuity though that is one thing you have plenty of i think id better see an array in place flakes dont do it and i want to question the people who knew the thief spla if i dont know his history how am i supposed to find the smuggler who took him offworld i presume that was how it was done digby nodded a lock of shining gray hair dropping into his eyes he brushed it back with a flick of his hand thought you might so ive arranged for you to go to pillory theres a light exo ready for you in the equipment room its been tarted up with a few extras including a visor which you are to keep in place as much as possible if anyone tries to take a template what theyll get is hash how much they know about my prime agents i couldnt tell you there might be descriptions circulating already how much good these precautions will do is not something id like to guess about nevertheless get that fitting done as soon as you leave here and pick up your trick kit have the techs run through it with you thereve been additions since the last time you went out just one thing pillorys security is fierce shadow dont try anything with their kephalos they have redundancies on that system that would frustrate a ghost speaking of ghosts no yseyl isnt ready yet and this is too complicated after the fitting go to briefing room three ive set up a feed that will give you all we know about pillory eyes only no duping hm doesnt go beyond these walls except in your head discretion is us to hear is to obey hmp watch your back shadow youre a careful soul digby you better believe it i always get full measure keep that in mind danger run for home lylunda elang rode the shuttle along the linktube that led to marrats agency node contriving to look bored and mildly stupid as if she were a lowlevel worker in an office like the one she was planning to visit she was short and broad across the shoulders and to her sorrow across the hips as well with a round guileless face that had proved its worth more than once the neat small waist she was proud of shed concealed under a loose tunic that hung in soft gray folds from the elaborate tucks of the smocking the looseness concealing the taalav crystal taped beneath her left breast shed brushed in temporary coloring to hide the white streaks at her temples pulled her coarse springy hair into a tight bun that tugged up her eyebrows and gave her a look of continual astonishment so far she hadnt seen any faces she knew and she was happy about that she didnt want anyone recognizing her before she reached the brokers office and shed the crystal she stared out the window by her seat past the ghost images of the other riders reflected in the glass watching the pewter glitter of the translucent tube walls slip quickly by though you could see nothing worth looking at she was glad of the windows being uncomfortable hurtling along in a capsule she didnt control without access to the outside however illusory such access might be after a short while though she used the mirroring effect to study the other riders innocuous as they looked this was marrats market and any of them could be predators or scam artists the shuttle had twenty rows of seats four seats in each row with a narrow central aisle passing between the middle pair she was sitting on the left side in the first row and there was no one in the seat beside her the rest of the capsule was about half full the others riding with her seemed to be shift workers heading for their jobs some sleepy dozing in their seats some staring at nothing a few busy with notepads they were mostly an assortment from the cousin worlds though there was also a pair of tocher femmes chattering in tochri gutturals and a lanky lommertoerkan male immersed in whatever it was he was reading off his sheet screen a small wiry man sputtered awake met her eyes in the window mirror before she had time to blank her gaze he took this for an invitation grinned at her and moved up to the seat beside her havent seen you before me im exi exinta i work at the nut tree its a food place over on the barter strip lots of people who work the agentnode eat there be seeing you she gave him a bovine look blinking slowly as if she had to take time to process the words all rightshe said finally then she turned away to stare out the window again exi exinta shiftednervously in his seat after another stretch of silence he got up and went back to where hed been sitting before lylunda kept the apathetic look but she wondered about him his had been a very nice performance but alarms were going off inside her it wasnt the first time shed trotted out this persona and she knew well enough what reactions it got moving in on her showed a kind of blindness on his part as if he thought that shed be so flattered by the attention she wouldnt question the reasons behind it she was annoyed because it meant she had to drop deep into the role she was playing if you were supposed to be dull and selfabsorbed you couldnt let an experienced op catch you peeking there was something else to worry about this could be a double up mr exthe gall of the man playing that kind of names gamemr exi exinta might be the throwaway the one she was supposed to watch while his partner got inside her boundaries and dropped the sack over her head which brought up another problem she must have tripped an alarm that her ships sensors missed because the kliu tagged dragoi just before she splitted with prangarris and his catch probably got enough for an id were these two or maybe three working a standard scam or were they setting her up for a snatch marrats oversec ran a tight pit stomping hard on industrial spying and any physical violence beyond the drunk fight and the oneonone duel but they werent set up to guard against the oneoff the quick snatch and scamper when the shuttle sighed to a stop and the exit slid open she walked out moving with a heavy stolidity meant to underline her lack of curiosity about the world around her she climbed aboard a chainchair tapped in her destination and went clanking off tensely aware that exinta was behind her and that she still hadnt identified his partner if he had a partner the chairs back curved up round her shoulders and head a not so subtle reminder of the possibilities of backshooting the composite wouldnt stop a cutter beam but cutters would bring peacer bots swarming and trigger a shutoff of the node gates didnt do much good if the shooter was a berserker intent on suicide but it tended to discourage the less committed itd been a while since shed been along here there were some changes new signs on the restaurants and the other small shops on the lower floors of the buildings but the broad squat structures with their complex of offices were much the same as always there wasnt a lot you could do with prefab office stock except stack it and paint it and maybe squirt a few curlicues about if that was your taste im dithering she thought jaink get your mind back on the job lylunda my girl almost there moving between the chain and the door thats going to be the tricky time lets see how do we handle this the chair string clicked to a halt outside jingko ikans building she stepped down moved at a heavy jog across the walkway and reached the deeply inset door without any trouble something that bothered her rather a lot she wasnt mistaken about exinta she was sure of that but lylunda elang she told the small blurdslang when he opened the shutter and blinked at her by appointment with desp jingko ikan one of the blurdslangs large watery eyes slid to the left then he thrust a hairthin fingertip into a receptacle and the door slid open lylunda glanced over her shoulder as she moved inside but what she could see of the street was empty she shrugged walked at a brisk clip toward the lift tube glad to shuck that bovine covet im carrying she said block jingko ikan sat mantis still his eyes expressionless as obsidian marbles but the two short feathery antennae that served as eyebrows twitched into a nervous dance he tapped a sensor with the tip of a polished claw and a shimmercone sprang into being over the desk area you said its good taalav crystal she reached up under the smock and jerked the packet loose brought it out and laid it on the desk a grubby wad of tape and blancafilm the size of her fist she took a pin from the hem of her sleeve pricked her finger and dripped some blood on the it shriveled and the packet began opening itself until it lay flat on the desk exposing the thing it had contained the crystal was an intricate lacery of the clear resin secreted and shaped by a taalav gestalt as it woke from its shielded sleep it began a series of faint but exquisite chimes in response to the whispers of air that passed through its interstices pulses of pale light flowed through the twists and turns of the shimmering threads jingko ikan leaned closer blew gently at it as the crystal changed its song to something that was his alone his dust lids slid over his eyes and his monkey face went momentarily slack after a moment though he leaned back in his chair sat rubbing the callus patches on his wrists together using the skrikking sound to counter the spell of the crystal wrap it again he said i can do without that enchantment dulling my sense of what thing is worth how hot is it she refolded the film around the crystal tucking the ends under without sealing them cold as winter on wolff its unregistered you got through kliu security lets just say i had help and its not something i can repeat this is part of my share of the deal ive got another stowed away a bigger weave i thought one at a time would get a better price he rubbed the calluses together once again the skrikking this time filled with satisfaction that is truth for sure for sure you do bring me such interesting items lylunda elang hm to get the most out of this little item will take some time are you pressed for coin im well enough desp jingko take what time you need she reached under the smock again brought out a much smaller packet unfolded it and pushed the onetime flake it held across the desk the blind drop on helvetia transfer the credit when you get it less your commission and five perc over for expenses the expenses might be rather large security costs you and i both know what the total take is likely to be with five perc of that you could buy your own army well see yes we will he lifted the packet with finicky care rose from his chair and moved two steps back a curtain of darkness cut suddenly across the room hiding him and the crystal lylunda rubbed at the underside of her breast where the film and the tape had irritated the skin she hadnt told jingko the exact truth she had two more crystals not one they were tucked away in a lock box on helvetia the safest place she could think to leave them it was a problem when to get rid of them she didnt want to overload the market but there could be a limit to the time in which she could get the best price prangarris expected to have his taalav array established and producing within five years if he succeeded the rarity factor would be lost people would still pay a good price for them given their beauty and their charm but not the worlds ransom they paid now the black curtain vanished and jingko ikan settled into his chair again one other um difficulty i had an intrusion that tells me the kliu know about this about you ah his antennae twitched through a slow dance as he stared past her at the door yes he said finally i was approached asked if you were one of my clients most annoying they have no tact at all and no common sense if youre worried about me to turn a client would destroy my reputation and my earnings would stop no mention was made of your having the taalav crystals if were worried i wouldnt be here desp jingko they will have approached others i have informed oversec that attempts on a client of the market might be made they also are annoyed but it would be better not to have to call on them hm im going to be at the marratorium for a few days better to find out here whats coming at me easier to watch my back she got to her feet take care desp hair flying feet kicking through the intricate patterns of the voor tikeri lylunda sucked on the pelar pipe and danced to and away from qatifa the caan shed run across watching the knife cotillion at the pertarn darah arena shed shucked the necktoankle cover of her disguise and wore her play clothes a blackwashedtogray tshirt sliced to ragged fringe for the bottom six inches some ancient cutoffs that shehadnt bothered to hem plus a pair of supple footgloves with roughened soles to give traction for the dancing the pelar bowl was tucked into the tshirts pocket and bounced with her breasts so she had to keep her teeth clamped on the stem or shed lose it now and then she grinned at qatifa and blew a cloud of dreamsmoke in her face qatifas plush fur was a dark chocolate brown with russet and occasionally gold glimmers when the light hit it in just the right way it smelled faintly like cinnamon was impossibly soft and was matchless as a teaser against bare skin at least in lylundas view of such things the caans eyes were narrowed to slits against a puff of smoke the light catching glimmers of gold in the darkness of her round blunt face when the music stopped they elbowed back to the chip of a table theyd claimed settled into the instruments of pain the tangul cafй had attached to the tables mislabeling them as chairs qatifa rolled her tongue and cut through the noise with a whistle that brought the tiny jaje waiter scrambling over to them double shot of nibern for me mineral water for that dancing fool across from me she waved away lylundas motion to pay and dropped a credit chip in the jajes palm how you can drink that syrup lylunda shuddered how you can smoke that crap qatifa chuckled a rumble deep in her chest i like sweets you should know gulami one splendid thing about skin people you can smear them with all sorts of lovely goo and lick it off without getting fur in your teeth an ear twitched the sale came through just before you called luna im out of here before the next pay cycle at the tiedown which means a couple hours and seeya lylunda grimaced before she could respond the waiter was back with their order she took the flask of bubbling water and gloomed at it its been fun she said finally maybe we could do it again sometime thats what you said the last time you should work on your valedictions a bit gulami qatifas grin faded she gulped down a mouthful of the nibern sat chewing on the fruit luna my friend ive heard a rumor or two why dont you tandem your ship onmine and come fool around a while with me on acaanal lylunda smiled however much she liked qatifa shed be jumping out of her skin by her second week of undiluted caan company thanks qat ive got commitments elsewhere but i appreciate the thought qatifa looked at the glass wrinkled her blunt nose id better go pee f i dont want to disgrace myself next time we hit the floor besides the hornman promised me a slow dance and its about time he came through on that alternating sips of the water with draws on the pipe lylunda watched the tall femme undulate through the closely packed tables using the tips of her claws on hopeful hands trying to cop a feel of caan fur for a moment she was tempted to change her mind and go with qatifa but common sense returned when the sleekly graceful form vanished behind a bead curtain she felt something brush against her neck and turned to see the back of a man moving away from her a stranger as far as she could tell when nothing else happened she forgot about him and let the pelar float her off to a place where she wasnt worried about anything the man calling himself exi exinta came out of the drifts of smoke and stood beside her come with me he said larr off ziz she thought then was startled as her body rose and walked after him what the zombi that snake shot me up with zombi juice she drew in a breath to yell but exinta heard and turned be quiet he said her throat closed and the words died there as she shuffled after him the pelar countering the zjuice enough to let her drag her feet she contrived to bump heavily into tables to slam into people to swing her arms so she knocked over drinks creating a commotion that set exinta cursing under his breath as he grabbed her arm and tried to hustle her along faster lylunda fixed her eyes on the door sweat coiling down her face fear and rage knotting her insides it drew closer and closer she tried to pull loose but the hold of the drug was too strong even with all the pelar in her system her tongue was locked she couldnt even form words let alone say them oy luna where you going huh qatifas voice filled with anger and alarm exinta yanked on her arm they were almost to the door she managed to turn her head to open her mouth she couldnt speak not a word not a word golden eyes widened as qatifa understood what was happening zombi she roared her voice cutting through the noise of instruments tuning and the undertone of conversation shocking the place to silence she came plunging through the tahles claws out mouth stretched in a threat snarl teeth glistening in the light from the pseudo torches exinta ran for his life diving under the arm of a peacer bot that came clanking into the cafй most of the crowd in the tangul faded as the bot hummed over to lylunda and clamped his cuff claw around her wrist qatifa patted her cheek gulami dont take this wrong but i cant afford to get hung up then she faded with the rest lylunda elang sat on a couch in the armored peaceplex cursing exinta and trying not to think about the headache that was sitting behind her eyes ready to sink its claws she rubbed absently at the itchy place on her wrist where they took blood to make sure what shed been given jaink ill be glad when im finally flushed clean of that stuff i want a full spectrum clear who knows what that ziz blew into me not from this lot either i wouldnt trust them with a cotton swab whats holding things up i want to get out of here the door slid open and a nutrient dish with an immature blurdslang hummed in des ela lylunda got carefully to her feet trying not to jar the lurking headache awake i can go i you ollow me she sighed and moved after him the elder blurdslang contemplated her for several moments then played his fingerlings over the speaker cube the directors are considerably disturbed by the use of a will suppressant i am sure you can understand the reasoning behind that smuggler so i will not elaborate the user has been located and probed there was a confederate a brother but he left before we could lay hands on him by the end of the dium the user will be wiped and sold to a contract labor firm the kliu will be informed that they are not welcome here we have discussed what to do about you lylunda elang there was a suggestion that since you drew those men here you should share their fate the broker jingko ikan spoke for you and convinced the majority that you are a valued client and will continue to be one too angry and alarmed to speak lylunda pressed her lips together and tried to ignore the throbbing in her left temple the will suppressant was a bootleg version of c z juice as it is called in the vernacular overage with a number of impurities that could cause you some difficulty the medtechs suggest you prepare yourself for several days bed rest and a bland diet eschewing all caffeine and other drugs the directors suggest you do it on board your ship bound elsewhere all right can i go now in a moment the directors of marrats market are not banning you they simply suggest that you clear up this difficulty before you attempt to return have you any questions no your gear has been collected from your room in the ottotel and will be waiting in a transfer pod a peacer bot will escort you to the pod i am told to inform you this is a courtesy not a constraint migraine auras invading her eyes like flags of crumpled cellophane shivering in a high wind lylunda brought her ship to what counted as a stop at the limit drifting into a slow orbit about marrats sun while the ottodoc grumbled at her blood and she ran a disinfect over the outer surface of the ship the crawler dislodged three tags one obvious and meant to be found one subtle and one she didnt understand at all that she found only by chance a shift in the solar wind that jogged the crawler in just the right way by the time the does notifier pinged she was blind in large areas of her vision field and her head hurt so much that she couldnt bear to move she turned and almost drowned in the vomit that caught her by surprise as she groped for the slot she slid her arm in and waited for the shot she hoped would give her some relief she felt the sting against her wrist a moment later the burn of stomach acid in her throat a shiver in her knees she just had time to withdraw her arm before she collapsed in a heap on the floor when she woke she knew there was only once place where she could feel safe for the next year she had to go home worms view your jodidda juice dint work they got xman stinking slinkies almost got me but i slid the ears on the kliu image curled tight and the eating mouth opened to show the tearing teeth the speaking mouth rippled as if the old male wanted to chew the words but when the sounds came through the twit cones they were mild enough the woman remains at the market the smuggler when slinkies let her go she took off i got an idea where but i dont say no jodidda thing and i dont go nowhere till you pry xman loose that requires consultation i will get back to you for several minutes worm stared at the glassy blankness of the screen fingers of one hand plucking at the plas cover on the chair ann he moved his shoulders finally straightened his back and reached for the flake case da xman got snicked by the slinkies the old man glared at him from the snakes tangle of wires and tubes of the sustainer how come you clean way we planned it i zombi the femme and get out he fetches her i hit for the ship and get ready to go when that dont come off he hits out for me anyway but he dont make it i see peacer bots globe him and they got one jodiddan huge shaker with em wouldda dusted me good if id tried snatching im i cut out but stay in system get through to sniff herk and he tells me that the slinkies they read xmans head blew it clean and laid a contract on him and they got a pickup for me so i cant go back i get on to the scivs tell ol jodface he gonna buy xman out or i dont go nowhere they dont come through you better send dogboy and trish to see if they can lever him out you shoot y mouth too fast boy you gonna have some backin down to do if scivs set their claws and wont move they still got mort so they got us by the cojos you gotta get that femme so we hold value for the trade when they lookin at her meat n all they know they gotta do a deal sorry da i was so burned they give xman junk juice i dint think da call lights on i gotta go since our investigations indicated that it was indeed a failure of the drug that led to the capture we will extract your brother from his current situation we will place him with your other brother to wait a successful outcome of this business the screen blanked worm swore and reestablished the link with his father to let him know about this turn in their collective fate pillory is not a nice place when the pillory shuttle landed shadith stood the servomotors of the exo doing most of the work and the muscle braces shifting to optimize their restraints she sagged everywherewhich was disconcerting because she had thought she was in fairly good shape and digby was right about the kliu trying to template her she could feel the exos defenses powering up as probes licked at them the interference waves gave her a lowlevel headache that was like an itch inside her skull the shuttle was the one the kliu used to transport prisoners the seats were fitted with massive restraints there were ominous apertures with metal snouts in them the unpainted walls were scratched and dull marked with stains she didnt want to think about she tapped alive the robot mule clicked along behind it to the exit and stood waiting for the lock to cycle open wondering as she waited if transporting her in this thing was a deliberate insult it seemed likely well shadow take it as a warning and let autumn rose be your model cool is it losing your temper isnt an option she wrinkled her nose as the slide chunked back exposing a battered wooden ramp shoved up against the shuttle the air smelled like the backside of all the star streets shed ever walked through she let the mule haul her gear outside then followed it down the ramp happier with the exo as it settled into the performance mode it was made for a juvenile kliu was waiting at the foot of the ramp a crocodilian centaur his six stubby legs stirring up the noisome dust of the enclosure the lips of his eating mouth clicking together with disgust and disgruntlement his ears were rolled tightwhich was another sign of discourtesy if thediplo guide digby had secured for her was accurate he was signaling that nothing she said hadenough worth for him to bother giving her more than the most marginal attention he swung his body around and marched away as soon as she reached the end of the ramp his clawed feet going stomp stomp crunch crunch creak creak the thick arms swinging hands closed into fists digby said they squealed as if he were chewing on their soft parts when he insisted his agent look over the scene herself he had to threaten to give back the advance three times before they capitulated it was obvious they grudged every second of her presence on planet their suspicions werent all that unjustified either considering digbys instructions about remembering and reporting everything she saw with the mule humming beside her and the exo doing its job cradling and supporting her and powering her walk she followed her escort through a series of dingy badly lit corridors empty corridors servant stairs so i wont offend their delicate eyes with my alien verminhood muttering in his guttural kliubre the guide plunged ahead turning corners until shadith was dizzy with the circles she was being led in finally though he slowed slapped at something on the broad belt where his horny torso joined the horizontal portion of his body the thing let out a blat like a hungry tantser calf and repeated the blat at fifteensecond intervals as he went stumping down a broader corridor shadith followed her annoyance increasing she didnt think much of being treated like the carrier of multiple plagues her guide waved at a door shut off the blatter and settled into the kliu equivalent of parade rest she exoed past him the metal sponge pads of her soles clinking and scraping against the metacrete floor the hot mule humming beside her the kliu subadministrator inspected her in heavy silence his speaking mouth made a few preliminary twitches the sound that came out was a musical tenor that made her want to giggle at the absurd contrast with that mass of muscle and armored skin we have few facilities for srin in the island chains srin she thought small itchy pests that infest the anal glands thats not what the book says but its what you mean i can see you sniggering with your peers at how youve got over on those stinking aliens the prisoners we get here are a dangerous desperate lot he said lifers all of them many of them are political with very little concern for the lives of those who do not share their particular beliefs or belong to their genetic group takes one to know one you must understand we do not guard the prisoners we guard the world those who refuse the work we offer are provided with materials and tools so they can build their own shelters and with adapted seedstock so they can raise their own food we have a series of satellites watching them to stop any activities we consider dangerous to us and we do occasional ground checks for various reasons otherwise we leave them alone it will be difficult if not impossible to protect you in these circumstances bite your tongue shadow you don t want to tell ol crocface he lies in his fangs thats not tactful come now exalted cheba im sure you dont mean that the island where you harvest the crystals is unguarded his ears crumpled the edges rolling inward and a film dulled his large black eyes nocturnal eyes unused to strong sunlight that is another difficulty desp searcher the exact location of the island and the taalav beasts is a security matter youre a pilot a view of the night sky even a strange sky would yield sufficient data for you to work out the islands location shadith blinked at him she found that degree of idiocy in a subadministrator rather hard to swallow it may have been a secret before now she said as mildly as she could but it has certainly lost that status with the departure of the thief right in any case i need to study everything the thief left behind and of course the physical requirements of a taalav array that last will set important parameters to the search for the world where they were taken im sure you understand that youll need living quarters that will take time to arrange i assume you have a new xenobiologist in place by now is that person kliu the kliu do not concern themselves with such matters why was so sure what your answer would be halt another prisoner or have you gone outside this time it is not necessary for you to know that in any case you will have set up accommodations for this person and his aides it should not be difficult to find a spare room for me in that facility especially since youve known i was coming for over a month standard and that i was femaleif that is to be your next objection she read his burst of anger with no difficulty the overtones of petulance and distaste her exoed hands clasped in her lap she waited with stiff patience for him to realize that stalling to the point of forcing her to walk out on him would win him nothing but a reprimand from his superiors he ignored her last response as if she hadnt spoken tapped a sensor with the longest of his eight fingers when her erstwhile guide shuffled in he flung a spate of kliubre at him in the expectation that shadith wouldnt understand what he was saying she listened carefully a lot of cursing and nasty epithets but basically he was doing what should have already been done ordering a flier and pilot to take her to glin paran which was apparently the name of the island in question the dot in a semicolon of islands trailing across one of pillorys southern seas glin paran was a wheel with a lake at the hub and a high jagged rim around the periphery it was a big island almost a subcontinent shadith suppressed a sigh as the flier dipped from thescatter of clouds and fought the choppy winds the trip had been as rough as the kliu pilot could make it and pillory cooperated with his malice by throwing storm after storm at them despite the support of the exo she was battered and exhausted some of her bruises felt as if they went to the bone the kliu slammed the flier down waited only long enough for shadith the bot mule and her sullen guard to disembark then he shot away vanishing into those clouds theyd left such a short time before shadith glanced at the guard but he had his eyes nearly shut against what was for him the glare of the sun though the reddish light was more like a cloudy twilight to her he was radiating stubbornness and revulsion and his speaking mouth was pressed shut with such determination that she didnt bother saying anything to him she looked around they were standing on a gritty landing pad wind whipping debris against their legs and into their faces on every side there were tangles of squat trees several stands of reeds taller than the trees grew out of the water a cross between rules and bamboo with short stubby leaves like knife blades tough enough to stab with each reed was different from its neighbor in color and configuration a red like dried blood a green so dark it was almost black fire orange a deep sapphire blue plus blends and shades of all these colors mottling and stripes a few had feathery sprays of seed pods bursting from their tops in the open spaces between the tree clumps there were patches of low brush with brown deadlooking leaves clinging to branches that were as crooked and knotty as arthritic fingers the xeno settlement was sited a short distance into the lake with only a spidery catwalk joining it to the bank the buildings were constructed from those reeds and took some getting used to because whoever supervised the construction seemed to have been colorblind apart from that though they were simple boxes with peaked roofs made from the leaves of the reed overlapping like shingles the area where the catwalk reached the bank had been cleared though she could see new sprouts just breaking the surface of the water apparently the reeds had to be cut back again and again she wondered about the catwalk and why the kliu had gone to so much inconvenience with their building it seemed to suggest that the taalav arrays were hostile and dangerous if not them then some other predator flourished here which made the guard rather more useful than shed supposed or maybe it was simply because they didnt want to harm the juvenile body parts of the taalav reasoning without data was a singularly futile process so she gave it up and followed the guard toward the settlement a man in an exo stood on the platform at the end of the catwalk he had a shaggy black beard and heavy eyebrows so his face seemed mostly hair despite that there was something familiar about that face she didnt know him but shed seen his phot recently ambela university she tapped the mule with her toe sent it humming onto the narrow walk followed it halfway across she remembered when and where shed seen him and nearly misstepped off the edge it was a big scandal around the middle of her first year at university his picture was everywhere saklavaya that was his name hed been skimniing and selling exotics from expedition stockswhich would have been bad enough but he had the misfortune to be caught pinching off genetic material from the rarer of the alien sentients he had access to and selling these interesting bits to one of the gray market meatfarms the uproar when this was discovered nearly destroyed the xeno school the regents board fined him all his voting stock and convinced helvetia to freeze his accounts then they barred him from ever returning to university or using university services if he was here as a result of some further predations and not just hired she suspected the kliu had better keep a close eye on their crystals shed gotten to watch his hearing her friend aslan was a member of the xeno department and went every day to glare her fury at this man whod polluted everything she believed in shadith wasnt afraid hed recognize her she was in the music school and the various departments of university were self contained units she stopped in front of him you are vannar i run this place whatn pyag you think youre going to learn here the last xenobi is long gone and ive got his rooms theres nothing there desp vannar if youll show me where ill stay while im making my investigation i can get on with it and out of your hair thats all she looked at the small stack of printed readouts i asked for every offworld contact for the past three years i was very careful to specify that proprietary data could be privacy blanked but i wanted the contacts and context vannar shrugged dont ask me none of my doing i passed on the request as you framed it you should have taken care of that while you were still at base if you dont mind i have work i need to do he sauntered out of the room shadith wrinkled her nose one of the drawbacks at having a touch of empathic intake you had to endure silent snickers like that one she had to concede though that saklavayavannar was right there wasnt much here it was as if they fumigated the place once the former xenobi took off with the array as she leafed through the skimpy pile of printouts she grinned at the thought of a gigantic vacuum hose chasing down fugitive glyphs and sucking them up she noted the business entities addressed but didnt expect them to lead anywhere digbys right she thought were strictly backup and will only get leftovers and things the kliu consider last hopers she leaned back when she was finished and stared at the wall all the aides had been changed there was not a single individual left whod worked with the old xenobi he must have had some rep outside pillory if they were that reluctant even to name the man shed requested interviews with the prisoners involved but was told they were not available dead or gaga she thought probed to their backteeth and not daintily hmp smells like this is a lost cause gambit im on my own digby said thought it was a compliment then right now suspect what that mainly means is you dont get no support no way shadow ah spla hate letting these fugheads win well theres no point in putting this off one more step then i pack it in we go out and take a look at an array on site tomorrow no more stalling out of ol saklavaya if i have to call the boss and put a rocket under his tail she giggled at the thought of the subadministrators double gape at fireworks popping in his anal orifice give him a new appreciation of srin the creepler was an todd vehicle with six articulated legs on each side each leg moving independently lifting and setting a broad foot down with slow care guided by a thick array of visual sensors so it wouldnt step on any of the juvenile forms it followed a preprogrammed path with all the alacrity of an arthritic land tortoise the kliu guard propped himself into the arrangement that kliu used as chairs a complicated mix of bellybands and stout rods shadith rode in the reed chair that had belonged to the former xenobi an unpadded contraption that ground against her exo straps the area near the lakeshore was fairly deserted but after the creepier picked its way through a stand of low broad trees climbed up a hill covered with grass tall enough to brush its frame grass that looked capable of stabbing through solid wood she saw a grove of taller trees widely scattered with clumps of vines growing about dryland reeds under those trees a score of odd creatures moved in a loose herd red riding hood she said aloud remembering a childs tale from a world she visited in her first incarnation the bodies of adult gestalts looked approximately like mottled green and black grasshoppers the size of a large dog long insectile legs bending through a sharp angle six knees raised above the carapace a flexible nose tube brushed along the ground sucking up bits and pieces of plant stuff there were two eyepits on the subsidiary head at the base of the nose tube but these had either grown over or like a vipers pits collected heat rather than light above the first set of shoulders the chitinous material that covered the body turned a bright cherry red and rose into a sort of hood with the main head of the gestalt tucked into the hollow of the open front this head was round and soft with huge dark green eyes a doughy greenish tint to the skin it had a button nose and a handsome mobile mouth there was a fringe of tentacles around the body head their skin sharing its consistency and color these tentacles were in constant movement like a nest of snakes she watched their movements for a short while decided that they might be sense organs as well as graspers under the feet of the adults in this array dozens of tiny body replicas were skittering around whistling and making small chuckling sounds chasing each other playing with a cheerful intensity that brought a smile to shadiths face tiny blobs pulled themselves along by nests of tentacles growing beneath their rudimentary chins these were the infant heads there were fugitive movements in the litter of grass and old leaves but she never got a good look at any of these bits of the array the adults were hosing up seeds and insects from the ground nuzzling at the trees and poking among the leaves of the vines she watched one of them fooling about a bush for several minutes the neck tentacles busy about something it was only when the taalav moved on that she saw it had been tying stray canes to smaller reeds it had thrust into the ground all this while the adults were silent going about their activities as if they were alone though they sneaked glances at the creepier as they moved about the largest taalav moved closer scuttling sideways on those long bent tippytoe legs it stopped a body length away and stared at her ignoring the kliu almost as if it considered the guard a part of the machine it started making noises excited noises exchanging noises with the other taalavs as they gathered around noises that blending into song complex and lovely music sudden pain jagged behind her eyes intensified by the itch from the distorters in the exo shadith clutched at the chair as she sought to make sense of what was happening the translator didnt work on animal sounds only on organized speech and that meant the taalav were not animals they were sentient beings the more they chattered the worse her head felt this langue had to be a mass of peculiarities because shed never felt the translator labor so hard ive got to get out of here now she slapped at the controller got the creepier moving once more on its programmed path this time turning round to head back to the lake as soon as the machine began moving the taalavsbacked cautiously away then stood watching as the creepier picked its careful way up the slope and into the trees she lay in semidarkness a damp compress spread across her eyes and dripping into her pillow despite the exos support the days shed spent on this world kept layering exhaustion on exhaustion so even in the best of circumstances thinking would have been difficult now she had a moral dilemma to complicate matters if the nu didnt know the taalav gestalts wereintelligent beings rather than beasts they had to suspect it so if she piped up like a good little phenom with her discovery the least she could expect was a sudden accident that would leave her a grease spot on some mountain between here and base no wonder they wanted to erase all instances of the taalav outside their control discovery of the gestalts intelligence would complicate their lives enormously and it wouldnt help the taalav all that much either instinct said this is slavery and it has to stop instinct was an ass even if she managed to get them taken from the kliu how long would they last without an equally powerful protector protector call it what it was exploiter once theyre discovered theyre going to be exploited the only big weapon that small people have is helvetias adamant stance against slavery getting that evoked would take a whole lot of proof not just her word there were a few comforting things shed noticed they seemed healthy enough and the abundance of the tiny body forms meant that reproduction was continuing shed felt no rage or fear or frustration from that lot and loathsome exploiters as the kliu were they were also protection as long as the taalav kept producing their crystals well digby i think ive just quit cant do this but i cant not do it either cant take your pay and work against you cant let the taalav array be murdered because thats what it would be how do i i hmmm im going to keep working to find that smuggler and hope i get to him before the kliu wouldnt put it past them to use a planet cracker on the place just to make sure they eradicated the array cant leave them with that thief either hes no better than the kliu get them away take them somewhere theyll need looking after for a while sar what do i do with them i have to think hunk maybe id just better ask them what they want if my head ever settles down the decision made tension drained from her her breathing slowed and she slept she sat in the chair on the creepier listening to the taalav chatter their symphonies and growing fonder of the odd ugly creatures as the hours slipped past they were as playful as otters and they punned relentlessly in a langue that was a gift to witsnappers and persifleurs she nearly fell out of the chair in her efforts to stifle laughter when they threw quips back and forth describing the kliu guard especially when they were speculating about his sexual involvement with the creepier she sobered rapidly as the implications of that came clear this new xenobi might be studying the taalav but the gestalts were studying them back with an equal intensity and making some amazingly accurate deductions despite their isolation here they were more serious about her it took a while gathering hints from the flow of their speech to understand why their eyes were very good they saw finer detail in the reddish twilight that was pillorys high noon than a hawk hunting in the brilliant light of a yellower sun and they were clever at patterns not just with words they noted the basic similarities between her and someone else they wondered if shadith and this other woman were a separate species from the men in the lake place they didnt say men and women of course but talked about the diamondshaped ones with the doublelumped high front and the wedgeshaped ones with the single smaller lump at the crotch they grumbled at her wanting her to stand up so they could get a further comparison of heights they speculated on the reason for the different skin colors of these twobump people she glanced at the guard he wasnt technically sleeping on the job but hed let his body slump down on his support limbs and his secondary lids had slid across his eyes she felt at him and came up with a sense of relaxation so deep he couldnt be aware of much going on around him still listening to him she got carefully to her feet and walked to the lowering platform of the creepler they were excited about that a little wary but still not afraid even when the descent of the platform was finished and she stepped off of it she walked toward them stopping when their nervousness increased sharply then stood where she was and used the motors to help her stretch her arms out straight from her shoulders when she didnt move they edged closer the biggest one taking the lead it lifted its nose tube hesitated then brought it closer and closer to her until it was finally nuzzling at her clothing and the metal skeleton of the exo gentle touches tickling her getting very personal at times she twitched away giggledwhich they found fascinating so they repeated the touches she lowered her arms slowly so she wouldnt frighten them moved the nose tubes away then licked her lips and attempted a crude version of their langue a kind of pidgin whistle talk greet you tied to the land i singer noharm offered wanted this one who stands here they were enormously excited by this it was the first time anyone had ever attempted to talk to them they hurled a whole symphony of questions at her not giving her a seconds opening to respond until the biggest one swung its armored tail about and made some peremptory clicking sounds when there was silence it eased its head from under the hood raised it on a thin muscular neck until the round naked head was almost level with hers it stared at her for several moments then it spoke slowly but did not try to mitigate the complexity of what it said weaving the tones and undertones into a song though what shadith heard the taalav saying was simple enough when stripped of the qualifications and multiple meanings it was also a great beauty that pierced her through and through the taalav said where do stilter creep our how do the being that walk the you are clumsily what are stranger invade this space and hear us topological landscape and bespeak us stoneplantwe life and know what others do not included in the question were asides that mentioned her coloring her size and shape the features that were like the taalav and those that were radically different the features fewer that she shared with the kliu her smell her strange attempts at truespeak and other things that were too subtle even for that most subtle of instruments the translator shed inherited from aleytys as she contemplated her answer knowing it would be so crude that shed better not try anything but the simplest response she glanced at the guard and was startled to see two of the smaller taalav standing close to him making soft steady humming sounds then one of them flipped its long tail forward and inserted the thorny tip between two folds of the klius skin amazing theyd somehow understood that she didnt want the kliu aware of what was happening she sangwhistled this person i am that you are touching need curiosity maker of songs called shadow am i being here liking you the gestalts chattered among themselves sorting out to their satisfaction exactly what she meant by each nuance of sound some of their conclusions making her grin though she didnt try to correct them there was a tickling around her ankles she looked down several of the tiny body forms were starting to climb up her legs she didnt try form a request just whistled and pointed a few slaps of the nose tube by the largest taalav and the curious infants scuttled away to hover under the legs of other adults and stared at her with tiny pinpoint eyes until she wanted to giggle again the taalav fixed its eyes on her when it spoke it had carefully stripped away the harmonics and all it asked was why she drew in a breath sangwhistled to them a part of you adult forms taken away family juvenile forms the onebump stilter plantslandbugs eggs the twobump stilter her face twisted in a fury of concentration she told them of her need to find the missing array stressing that she wished no harm either to them or to the others she tried to impress on them that the others would be in great danger if she did not find them before those like himshe pointed at the dreaming kliucame across the absent and destroyed them this one before you politely with no call on you asks to save the absent but a desire to help you urgently so i ask you to tell me as much as you can about the twobump person female smuggler she thought just knowing that is a step up what its colors are how high it is do they know about names she asked the translator ah yes i see they do names as descriptions so intricately nuanced they can only belong to one gestalt among the many did you hear the name she gave herself the sound of it listening with such concentration her head started hurting again she picked out of the weave of sound they gave back to her an astonishing amount of data there were too many sounds exchanged between the twobump and the onebump who studied them and whom they studied in their turn too many to remember and they had no way of deciding what was name and what was just talk the twobump was wider than shadith the bumps were rounder and bigger and it showed brighter colors than shadith though it had a carapace very like hers the growth on its head was longer and thicker than shadiths and a different color it was a shiny black and hung all the way to the bending part of its body there were two white streaks in the black very shiny too it came on a flying thing broad and flat like the creepier but far more silent and more subtle it argued with the onebump stilter the argument made lots of noise but the other stilters didnt come out to see what was happening the speaker the onebump fed untranslatable and untranscribable noise to the others this noise was the poison the taalav collect in their stingsacs the onebump had taken sacs from taalav in earlier days it took the onebump most of four days to collect two full arrays and shift them on the transport in all this time none of the six legs or the other stilters appeared by the time this was done shadith was shaking with fatigue sodden with sweat rolling down inside the exo soaking the spongy cushions supposed to protect her body from the abrasion of the metal supports she took a step toward the creepler then turned again she thought a moment shaped a question sangwhistled it to the taalav when i find your others shall i bring them home to you she expected another cascading consultation but the large one answered immediately maker of songs if they thrive let them be shadow plant the spiritessence in another place twobump friend let them shape another home after she rode the platform up and settled herself in the reed chair shadith watched the taalav arrays go spreading out beneath the trees taking up the lives theyd put down to talk to her she heard the kliu guards breathing start to change and knew he was about to come awake she touched the sensor and set the creepier going on the trek back to the lake a little tact and some patience and im off this stinking world she smiled at the burp from the klius eating mouth sounds like crocface there odd on noise may his gut rebel and his head feel worse than mine a drone from digby was waiting for her when she reached the ship but she didnt access the data inside until she was well away from pillory and splitting for spotchalls digby was sitting behind the desk again wearing the face shed seen when he set her to work a bit of information has come into my hands shadow which you might find interesting and perhaps even useful word has come from marrats market that the broker jingko ikan has on offer a taalav crystal guaranteed genuine and not stolen seems clear to me this is the smugglers payoff and hes getting his money out of it as fast as possible i want to remind you of the strictures of this search youre to be invisible to the kliu i leave it to you to figure out how shadith watched the image dissolve as the message erased itself from the ships memory complications so im supposed to get past oversec without letting anyone know im looking for that smuggler cover spla cant sneak in and disguise wont do it oversec took that template of me when i went into sunflower labs said it would be erased not likely cover cover a job thatll be plausible and get me in without airing the kliu connection lee no if she were hunting something shed do it herself swarda would do but he and his crew are on a run out to the hevardee aslans mama yes she owes me doesnt like me all that much but she likes feeling obligated even less i need to talk to her first though droom thats another month of traveling while the trail freezes on me but with digbys strictures shayss sighing she called up the destination code of the hegger combine and fed them into the router then dealt with the disorientation as the ship phased into the new course and splitted for droom i forgot what home was like lylunda crawled from the sludge of the ocean called the haundi zetin wriggled through the tangle of baifruit vines and into the clump of tall thin rynzues with their woody braided stems and the dusky black heatcollector nodules on the spray of branches at the top half an hour ago shed brought her ship down through a foaming red light ekilores sullen fire filtered through an abundance of cloud fleece as the sun rose above the horizon they were dry clouds because the rainy season was still two months off shed settled it in the tangled mass of vines and trees on the largest island in a spray of islands that ran parallel to the coast covered it with camou cloth and left it with a lowlevel shield in place a smugglers special on her feet again she looked back at nameless island only one end of it visible past the tangle of vines and the droop of the rynzu branches they were all nameless islands behilarr notionwhy bother identifying something so useless the zeal was a soup of poisons infested with eels that were mostly mouth and vast schools of small black swimmers that could strip flesh from bone in seconds all of these died when they ate behilarr flesh but the behilarr died as well ending as vomited chunks on the ocean floor she was only half behilarr she grinned at the thought maybe shed only halfpoison the fish no one went boating for pleasure in the waters round here and swimming was a skill only the very rich with their pools of filtered water could afford to learn her ship would be safe out there until she came back for it though she didnt look forward to the long dangerous swim to reach it in the strengthening light of the steamy dawn she slipped off the impeller harness and laid it on the ground unclipped her dita sac took out the can of cleanser and the packet of blancafilm and began the long process of cleaning and stowing her aegis suit and all the appurtenances that let her come safely through the hazards of the zeon by the time she reached the coast road most of the morning was gone and she wasnt quite so pleased with herself for finding a perfect place to stow her ship the burlap sack shed used to conceal her offworld gear was a hot wet spot on her back the rough weave rubbing a rash through her blouse and tshirt smuggler on the brain she thought i probably could have parked the ship in the tiedown at the transfer station and come in legit and saved myself a lot of trouble she started walking along the edge of the unpaved road a line of dirt beaten hard by the hooves of cattle driven from the nearby arranxes the estates of the highborn behilarr to the feed lots and slaughtering houses outside haundi zurgile zurg where she was born hutsarte had only been colonized a little more than a hundred years ago and behilarr were slow to spend money on things like roads even though floats did need fairly level ground to operate efficiently dream on luna if you came in legit your name would be on the list how long would it take a hired snoop to find you then her ankle turned as her foot slipped into a rut arms waving she found her balance again but winced as she took the next step jaink i think i sprained the thing she settled herself on a clump of irratzy the curly leaves and rubbery stems of the fern grass poking at her through the cloth of the long skirt shed pulled over the underpants shed worn beneath the aegis suit the road curved here and a stand of prickle pipes with their twining side growths and spongy foliage blocked the wind and the fine white dust that wind blew like heat clouds along the ruts for several moments she just sat pulling her knees up folding her arms on them resting her head on her arms while she wondered if this homecoming business was worth the pain it was going to bring her then she sighed turned back the hem of her skirt and prodded at the ankle she was wearing lowheeled boots she didnt want to take off because shed never get them back on again with stingworms pincer mites and the other small biters that hutsarte grew in the millions walking barefoot wasnt a good idea barefoot every summer when she was a subteen shed spent a lot of time in a local clinic waiting for a purge to expel one parasite or another from her system jaink only knew what passengers she was picking up right now just by sitting on this patch of fern grass she pulled the skirt down and tucked her feet under her when she heard the hum of a float the first in several hours it was a hiccuping hum as if the lifters were ready to scatter their parts to the four winds when it came round the stand of prickle pipes she saw a small battered vehicle that looked old enough to be one of the firstdowns the driver matched it his face a mask of wrinkles his clan sign so faded she couldnt read it he was one of those rambling peddlers who moved from arranx to arranx selling items and occasionally buying handwork to resell in zurg he saw her and brought the juddering float to a gentle stop twisted his body around and called back shouldna sit there neska some mean biters wud soon be chewing your sweet little poto whats wrong you not feeling good give my ankle a turn jun you aiming for zurg hoy twanghead question that where else would you be going want a ride he grinned at her showing a good set of yellow fangs got all my teeth still but i dont bite she pushed onto her feet winced at the twinge in her ankle bent and picked up the gunny sack preciate it jun she said and limped around to the riders side you make it all right give me a minute she tossed the sack into the cargo bin pulled herself up and settled onto the grubby seat drop me at the izar gate if you dont mind the old man tapped and pushed and jiggled the controls and after a while the float coughed and lifted onto its airpad he started it wheezing forward then leaned back one hand on the joystick you a working girl izar i mean thats why i ask nah just visiting kin she drew her sleeve across her face grimacing at the smear of mud on the cloth been gone a while anything i should look out for thought i hadnt seen you round you wanna keep your head down the ezkop is on a purification rage hes got mazkum and jazkum in high zurg wearing out their knees and burning their silks hes threatening to harrow the izar next in the name of jaink and virtue ever been through one of those the float whined and labored as it began climbing the long slope to the top of the gorge where the river jostun ran down to join the sea lylunda shivered when i was little my mother was scourged how likely are duk and dukerri to allow that the ezkop garap has the ear of the dukina and the mazkum ladies they dont like it when the jazkum go slipping round to izar to sample the housewares but they cant say it now they got a chance to use their claws if i had kin in the izar id slip them away somewhere till the rain sends the maz and jaz out to the hills ill think about it thanks she wiped her face again then sat forward tensely as he took the last bend around the huge clump of ancient rynzues that marked the end of the bridge over the jostun after fifteen years away this would be her first sight of haundi zurgile the city was on the far side of the gorge where the jostun ran rising up the slopes of a dead volcano whose dark gray summit she could see beyond the rynzues the higher you lived in zurg the classier you were the more money and power you controlled the izar was on the flat land around the base of the mountain the folk there breathing in the air of the feedlots and slaughterhouses as well as the factories and the hot air wafted over from the landing field a few kilometers off as the float hummed and choked up the approach to the wide bridge she could see the red tile roofs of the tenements poking over the whitewashed walls that shut the izar away from the rest of the city beyond them the painted crete of the low city like the colored filling between the layers of a torte and above all these the black and gold citadels of the jazkum who ruled the place her father lived up there still a jaz of the jazkum with a maz wife and a high family all of whom refused to know about her and her mother the whore her mother died before she reached her fortieth year brought down by a fever that a graymarket antibiotic couldnt cope with the old anger came back as the float hummed and coughed across the bridge a fury not diminished by the fifteen years that had passed since the day she found her mother cold and still her bed stained by her body fluids to get access to good medicine and good care youhad to be sealed to one of the seven clans brought in by birth adoption or purchase your name writ in the temple register your body marked as jainks own by the clan sign tattooed in the center of your brow most of the people in the izar hadnt a hope of any of these things lekatthat was what the behilarr called them mongrels a collective name for a heterogeneous swarm of entertainers exiles and halfbreeds a mix of cousins from a hundred worlds thieves fugitives from contract labor gangs smugglers and arms dealers whod made elsewhere too hot for them crewmen and women so drunk or drugged their ships went on without them embezzlers dethroned dictators fleeing war crime tribunals lost souls yearning for something they couldnt name who ran out of money before they found whatever it was and others who had reason to cut loose from their former lives misfits of every kind there was they were free to come and squat in the izar they were free to do those jobs the behilarr considered beneath them they were also free to starve to harbor such diseases as they brought with them free to pass them around as far as they would go among the others in the izar free to steal from each other rape plunder and kill each other free as long as they didnt discommode the marked pure among the behilarr except when the ezkop the high priest of the temple or the sorginz the priestess of groves and peaks except when that holy pair fell into one of their frenzies of purification except for those harrowing times the behilarr tolerated the lekat and by their very contempt protected them as theyd protect her now once she was lost in the izar the old man stopped before an open arch in the high white wall black behilarr glyphs painted above it spelled out tzar im not asking questions he said but dont forget what i told you she summoned a grin leaned over and kissed his leathery cheek and best you disremember me my friend jaink smile on your and yours as she limped along a narrow cobbled street the weight of the sack disturbing her balance making it difficult to keep weight off her ankle she looked around with a sense that shed stepped back in time shed been gone fifteen years but the graffiti on the walls looked much the same the names might be different but she couldnt remember the old ones anyway there was a new cook shop on the second cornernew to her at leastused to be a dressmaker there eskoziaka that was her name she made costumes for dancers and working lingerie for the housegirls she hobbled on noting other changes halak the spice man was gone the windows were whitewashed so she couldnt see in and some stars and crescent moons were painted on them lester the knife man was still there with halfman ike in his wheelbox by the door looking older than time and stony as the mountain his sharp black eyes missing nothing that went on in the street he was the first to recognize her bo da if isnt meeryas girl what you doing back ska should we expect a plague of space marines any day now and a good morning to you ike auntee zaintze still with the living he blinked at her a moment considering the bulging gunny sack and the shabby skirt and blouse if she hadnt been who she was hed have lied flat out in the flesh yawp you wanting something outta her i owe her a greeting old times you know and i want to catch up on whats what she tapped her nose offering a snippet of her own news met a peddler outside the city give me a ride he said the ezkop and the sorginz theyre working up to a harrowing peddler eh just yammer or did he look like he knew what he was talking about old git you know what it takes to last that long fiddling the arranxes mid city canto clan you know zitz alley back end by wall go up stairs to first landing bang loud she dont hear so good sometimes owe you one ike with a flip of her hand she moved on after a few paces she looked back saw him talking earnestly to a skinny dirtyface boy what a hoot me bringing news to halfman ike after all these years me zitz alley was the noisome deadend offshoot she remembered all too well rats feeding on garbage not bothering to run when they saw her stench of urine strong enough to rival poison gas scraps of this and that rotting into slime after sitting there through four five six rainy seasons a narrow path swept relatively clean led back to a framework of rusting metal that was only a sketch of a stairway lylunda climbed the ladder trying not to touch the worn oily rail going up wasnt that bad but she did her best not to think of coming down again the door had a coat of shiny black enamel that had been washed or repainted recently an iron knocker was bolted beneath a shuttered slit too narrow for even a childs hand to pass through when she banged the knocker hard against the door the resulting boom sent her brows up toward her hairline steel looks like dear auntee has prospered since i left she knocked again the shutter slid open whos that lylundaelang auntee zaintze want to talk to you luna quick glitter of an eye at the slit ahh it is you just a minute this takes some doing you know the slide snapped shut lylunda heard scribblescrabble noises muffled through the steel and stepped back when the heavy slab began swinging open hurry child jaink knows whos watching out there the hallway inside the door was short narrow and lined with metal plates there were a pair of dim presslamps stuck up on the plates casting just enough light to let her see the tiny bent figure scuttling along ahead of her she turned a corner went through another door into a small bright jewel of a room clean and filled with light from a line of small windows up near the ceiling and mirrors everywhere that caught the light and passed it about i was just about to make some tea you used to like auntee zizis tea ive got some of those macaroons baked fresh today from olcin the baker you remember him hes been doing well enough hes thinking of sponsoring his youngest daughter the pretty one into canto clan shes classic behilarr even more than you luv got white wings in her hair and a profile pure as a coin hes got some families interested and therere those in the izar whod be willing to add to the dower just put that urn sack down anywhere ive got a tiny little fresher if youd like to wash off the dust lylunda bit into the crispy macaroon and sighed with pleasure when her mouth was clear she said no one in twenty star systems bakes like okin zaintze smiled and refilled the two delicate china cups which brings up a point luna you got out whyd you come back you in trouble lets just say i annoyed some folk and i need some time to cool off law trouble no warrants out auntee zi hired noses doing the looking private thing going to follow you here depends i dont do a lot of about where i come from but there are sniffers who might figure it out was what you did worth it oh yes im not hurting for the coin auntee zi i just needed a place where i could watch my back good id hate to see meeryas daughter hopping from fire to fire for nothing talking about watch your back she broke off frowned at lylunda yah i figured ways havent changed all that much since i left who do i see for protection and how much will it cost you remember grinder jiraba big kid a year older than me had girls for every day of the month and two for jainkeve she didnt say that shed been one of those girls using sex with grinder to keep the others off her though she suspected zaintze knew it well enough and he was a lot smarter than most ripandrunners thats him hasnt changed his ways either when it comes to women so if you dont want to play let him know up front what it is about five years ago he went headtohead with pouska i know you remember him they say pouskas poisoning haundi zetins fish these days no one knows anything for sure except hes not around any more and grinders running the she slipped a slice of ranja fruit onto lylundas plate and set another macaroon beside it protection wont be cheap but its good and itll cover star street fifty zilars a week she made a deprecating gesture with one thin bony hand you count as an outsider luna cant do anything about that hundred zilars bonus pay if he has to off a nose that gets too pushy and wont take no fifty zilars bonus for a discourager youre right its expensive could be worse i suppose he have a credit comm what do you think i think he does good to see you havent lost your edge account on helvetia eh not just brag then trapped account with a dead drop auntee zi you and mum taught me to keep my cash away from sticky fingers gratifying to see something we skid finally sank in zaintze grinned and tapped the back of lylundas hand another lesson wed best find you some work dont want the blood lice thinking youre a lady of leisure i dont know how long im going to be here more than a month yah maybe as much as a year depends on if things start hotting up a year ooee child that is some mad you conjured lylunda shrugged hm you went for to be a pilot make it yah why was grinder might eat theprotection fee for a favor or two i wont work on my back not now not ever not that kind of favor grinders been bringing in stuff tapping into the star street kephalos to slide the goods past behilarr eyes but the keyboarder was a graghead and oded last month weapons were not that stupid luna tronics and medicas we lylunda thought i begin to see the backbehind of all these pretties ive done this before and no brag just truth im rather good at it set up the meet and well see how it goes but hed better find someone for me to train make it real clear auntee zi this isnt a permanent thing im outta here soon as i think its safe grinders second son his names herred they call him bug hes near as much a whiz as you were luna but he wont be going anywhere some sickness that come off a tradeship when he was just four killed his mam and a lot of others and gave him brittle bones has to wear an exo all the time which is why he got the name bug but bright yah hes bright plays with numbers like some boys play with knives hes holding shop working the lines lerdo the graghead set up but hes not ready to make new though he thinks he is better if you handle the tap a while and teach him enough to make sure he doesnt slip and blow the whole operation fun lylunda thought bug huh like me if id had to deal with me that age id have strangled me ba da what i have to can do itll save a lot of potheration having grinders shadow on me i need a room somewhere i wont be hassled i know just the place the room was small but solidgrills on the windows a door with a barlock and a sheet of plasteel laminated to the inside up on the third floor of a fivekey building it had a tiny alcove with a hotplate and a miniature oven set into the wall and the bed was a narrow cot hard enough to pound yarns on there was a coinbath down the hall and a small greengrocers on the ground floor where vegetables and eggs were expensive but available without having to face the dangers of the street especially after dark on her first day in the new place lylunda soaked the ankle and wrapped itin a pneumabrace shot it with pain suppressant and gave herself a full spectrum kataph to flush out the parasites shed picked up on her way into the city she dozed for a longtime to let the drugs work then spent the evening planning and revising plans until she was tired of tramping along the same ruts it was full dark out when she woke to a chime that left her confused until she remembered what the concierge had said about the mail warn it was a note from zaintze giving the details of her appointment tomorrow with grinder jirabaand along with the note a parcel with clothing the old woman had bought for her plus a hefty bill for that clothing she looked it over and grinned cunning old lukie wonder how much she padded this there were two plain black skirts with narrow bands of embroidery about hems that would hit her around the ankles two plain white blouses with high necks and long sleeves and two hemmed lengths of black silk for folding about her head she wrinkled her nose at the thought of wearing long sleeves and a demiturban in the steamy heat that belonged with this time of the year but auntee zi was right this was righteous garb announcing dont mess with me there were also half a dozen pairs of silk underpants and three sleeveless undershirts and zaintzed got the size right old lukie indeed she fixed an omelet and sat on the bed to eat it her injured ankle propped on one of the straightback chairs when she finished she set the plate on the bed beside her propped the second foot beside the first and watched the sky turn improbable colors through the bars of the window how very strange she hadnt thought about it until now until she saw the calendar in the greengrocers you dont think about planetary dates much when youre splitting here and splitting there it doesnt seem worth the bother all those different ways of reckoning ships kephalos stayed on universal time thats all you needed shed looked at the calendar because of the picture a phot of hutsarte from the transfer station with the interesting pale fan of the river jostuns outflow then she read the month begiberru the month of buds the days were numbered in their forty small squares and twentyfive had been crossed off with a red crayon twentysixth of begiberru fifteen years ago to the day her mother died three months later she had her place as trainee and shed left so filled with anger it was not possible to grieve the layered colors of the sunset blurred as she finally wept for meerya and her useless death on her second day in the izar lylunda dressed in the new clothing tucked zaintzes note with its instructions into a wristpouch next to a small stunrod and left the rooming house with her keys on a chain round her waist dropped inside her skirt where theyd be less vulnerable to a snatchandgrab grinders place was on the far side of the izar a huge old warehouse tucked between a slaughterhouse and a flash freeze plant its back butted against the wall from its flat roof you could look down into star street or watch the shuttles from the transfer station and the freeships landing most hours of the day and night the sour stench from star street mixed with the sweetish aroma of old blood to thicken the air until you almost had to chew it before you could breathe it shed forgotten that stench and had trouble keeping her lunch down as she turned a corner and the full glory of it hit her in the face she thought about it and decided that she appreciated grinders subtlety those who lived here got used to the smell intruders tended to betray themselves as they leaned against the nearest wall and vomited the warehouse was a busy place sleds moving in and out crates and barrels crowded into every inch of space drunks and other sentient debris of various shapes and species sprawled beside the walls in the meager shade provided by shallow niches in the alley between the warehouse and the flash freeze plant a standup whore with dead eyes endured the grunting efforts of one of the derelicts whod panhandled some coin and spent it on her instead of his usual brand of selfdestruction lylunda stepped over a sprawled drunk ignoring his mumbled comments that she couldnt understand anyway waited for a sled to whine out then moved quickly through the opening into the vast dim interior several men moved to meet her the leader a tall thin man with a face she almost remembered i youre lost woman this isnt star street as soon as he spoke she knew who he was he had a high whiny voice that hadnt changed at all you forgot me already krink ive an appointment with grinder tell him lunas here walking with your head up huh amu go see if the jun jiraba wants to see this urd grinder jiraba leaned back in his chair and rubbed a broad hand across his chin hed lived hard since last shed last seen him and had lost bits of himself in the process two of the fingers were nubs a scar just missed the tip of his right eye and slashed a ravine across his check his coarse black hair was still thick but peppered with white and gray he wore it clipped almost to his skull barely a centimeter long all over his shoulders were meaty and his once slim body had acquired a thin padding of fat that did little to conceal the hard muscles beneath while the weight gave him a force he hadnt had when he was thin and beautiful sony to see you back here he said when you have to go to ground best do it where you know the traps you think you know them better than some its been a while and things change but not that much from what ive seen you arent on any passenger lists sure of that what about a freeship or a false name i know everyone who goes in and out of star street its my business to know and my business to know whos chasing you dont play the fool i remember you too well for that ive been smuggling this and that since i got my ticket smuggled myself down didnt want my name on lists jaink knows who gets a look at you didnt answer the question lylunda elang whos chasing you she hesitated but shed been over this before over and over it till she was sick of it it was a danger to tell him but if he picked up someone coming after her hed squeeze it out of him anyway besides he was right it was his business to know what was going on in his patch the kliu berej theyve set a bringalive price on my head itll probably take them a while to track me here but there are noses around able to follow a grain of salt the length of a star arm hm you snatched some taalav crystals im a smuggler not a thief say someone did and they want him and they think i can tell them where he is easy money for you grinder all you have to do is go over the wall and walk down star street she waited for his response more tense than shed expected to be watching his eyes seeing the heat of crystal fever wake in them she thought shed judged grinder and the circumstances that bound him well enough but you never really knew how people would jump when pressure was on them she knew the moment he made up his mind he wouldnt sell her not yet anyway not till he lost hope of squeezing crystals out of her i wouldnt hand those borts on star street a used turd he said and pushed his chair back well go to my house want to show you what youve got to deal with he stood came round the desk zaintze said she told you about my second herred hes not an easy boy other kids called him bug because of the exo he picked it up and thats all he lets anyone call him now kids you cant beat that sort of kak out of them bugs mad all the time at me because i didnt try it hes too young yet to understand that itd just get worse if i did bea favor if you got him to see that but i wont be holding my breath she put a hand on his arm stopped him before he opened the door speaking about holding your breath what about krink you trust him the length of a micron if hes wearing handcuffs and leg irons he does work i dont want to do myself efficiency luna remember ol efficiency gidur she chuckled chanted the right tool for the right job sobering she tapped her fingers on the hard muscies watch out this one doesnt turn in your hand hes ambitious i could smell it on him ba da hes already tried it and got kicked in the butt for being an idiot better the flaws you know hes a little worm thinks little and couldnt plan his way out of a paper bag he doesnt know it though and thats one of the things that makes him dangerous he opened the door stood aside to let her pass luna arguing life with you is one of the things i missed most after you took off as they walked down the stairs together she murmured i never understood why you stayed you were smart enough to get out he didnt answer till they reached the main floor this is my place i wouldnt feel right anywhere else im not like you you cut your ties so easy you were gone even before you left i never had ties grinder not then not now lylunda stood on the balcony outside grinders company parlor his house was on the high side of the izar tall enough to catch breezes over the wall breezes not tainted by ship exhaust and slaughterhouses it was a big place built in a square about a large central court with a fountain and trees and flower beds and children everywhere kak grinder they all yours he grinned thats what their mothers tell me actually no couple of the youngest are my grandkids would you believe it luna me a grandpa she watched him beaming down on the busy scene and felt a coldness start to gather under her ribs there was something so proprietorial and oh lethal about him this is my place he said my place my house my children my women if he starts thinking about me like that youd best let me have a look at lerdos documentation i have to know what im talking about when i meet your son worming into haundi zurgile worm slipped the kinu kanti into hutsartes atmosphere above the major continent of the wild half the hemisphere the behilarr hadnt bothered to settle yet he went warily at first then relaxed as the readouts told him that what hed picked up about the place was true not enough security to keep out a tesh fly when he was at a level to go on visual screens he looked at the tangle of unsavory vegetation sliding beneath him and decided the behilarr didnt have to worry about anyone coveting this place he shifted direction went circumpolar and began a metal scan of the coastline that belonged to the settled continent keeping the visuals on to give him a look at what was being probed low and slow ate power but he was operating on the klius credit chip so hed topped up at the transfer station and was feeling comfortably prodigal at the moment he slowed further when he began picking up a signal as a string of islands came into the screen metallic smear size uncertain shape uncertainhe was nearly on top of it before he could nail which island it was on there was a hollow in the vegetation with withered edges enough to suggest a ship had put down here and the very faint traces he was picking up had to mean it was a smugglers ship equipped to escape most detection he chortled as he changed direction again and started back across the ocean lylunda elang gotcha he set the kinu kanti down in a small stony canyon in the coast range of a continent in the wild half and started cycling through the shutdownconceal procedures brooding all the while over the last thing his father had told him keep those scivs sweet worm theyve got your brothers two of them now because you dint bother using that useless lump a gristle atop your neck you shouldda known we couldda fetched xman out of contract easy enough i tell you to your face we gotta get mort loose hes the only one of the lot of you whos got the guts to run this place snake over t next rift he been shooting eyes this way so you keep em happy till we get that girl and make the trade worm shivered when he thought of his older brother and some of the things that mort had done to give him the rep that kept snake and herbie and the other riftmen backed off if mort hadnt been his brother and blood was sacred after all hed have been just as happy to leave him scrabbling about pillory scurfing off other gits as murderous as him time to do the sweetening to let the kliu know he was on the job and making time he worked over the message for several minutes then played it back am down on hutsarte behilarr colony have got suggestive though inconclusive evidence the smuggler is here will be going undercover for closeup observation will keep under advisement the listed possible agents of excavations ltd and report if any such are spotted clandestine conditions of investigation require limiting exposure to detection so contact will be sporadic for the next few weeks it seemed adequate saying as little as possible while giving the impression he was being forthcoming as good as anything xman could write xman was the talker of the family the tongue that was quicker even than morts knifes worm sighed missing his brother a lot as he coded and compressed the message squirted it on its way choke on that stinking scivs he waited a while longer watching the readouts to be sure the squirt hadnt pinned him then he extracted the ships flikit and once again started across the ocean after he hid the flikit worm spent the rest of the night trudging across prickly wasteland he detested walking he hated all this ugly nothing full of dust and stinks and malevolent thorns doing their best to rip his flesh but he wanted to be sure the flikit would be where he put it when he needed it again soithad to be in a place no sane man would bother looking at he reached the landing field in the gray dawn light brushed himself off and caught a jit heading for haundi zurgiles star street he found what he was looking for at the end of a narrow side alley a holeinthewall called the rainy season the name didnt matter it was the smell he recognized xman said it was cheap drink cheaper brainrot mixed with the stink of maybes never gonna happen and the lowgrade fever of hatefear sure enough whenever he smelled it worm knew he was in a place he understood and with people he knew even if hed never seen them before he dumped his gearsac on the floor between the stool and the bar then slid onto the stool so the sac lay between his feet the barscort was an old sad lommertoerkan his facial folds so deep and packed so tightly together he looked like someone had shoved his skin through a pleater ya any cohanq five minims a shot the lommertoerkans voice was high and sweet if worm closed his eyes it could have been a woman talking see the coin before i pour worm set a brass gelder on the wood local exchange will do me gonna be here a while he sipped at the cohanq expecting the hard bite of barrel squeeze and was surprised to find it sliding down without ripping the lining off his throat good stuff he said and couldve kicked himself when he heard the surprise in the words the pleats on the lommertoerkans face spread slightly around what could have been a smile then he said in his soft sweet voice trades brisk should you pick up something good i can find it a home luck up and bit me in the ass or id do a deal he drained the last drops of the cohanq and inspected the pile of local gelt turning each plaque over scowling at the holoed face and the enigmatic inscriptions they were all alike fifteen of them twenty to a brass unless the toerk was cheating him he pushed five of them back again when the barscort slid his glass back to him worm took another swallow and felt a warm buzz forming in his head he enjoyed it for a moment then blinked at the toerk be here a while so you said worm moved the plaques with his finger all outgo n no in dont play labor exchange over by the tinkermans lot ask anyone theyll point you right could do uhhuh could drop by here again maybe youd know someone could use a good lock man drop a name references as it were texugarra gran jalla pit ah sweet lady that she is worm snorted texugarra would drop his beard should he hear that and what a beard it is heh every hair white as menaviddan monofil and twice as tough let us say you come along here round midafternoon tomorrow youve found a place to stay just got off the jit the lommertoerkan found a stylo and a bit of paper scrawled a few words on it empling has a room or two i put down where to find him if you dont take to that place look round there plenty of others he dropped the paper in front of worm swept the rest of the plaques into a side pocket of his tunic and went to serve another patron worm finished the drink sipping slowly savoring the sweet fire of the cohanq in a little while hed have to go to work again but for the moment he was just worm and nothing more no worries to twist his gut and give him nightmares where he relived things he hated having seen the first time the night was hot and sticky a cloud layer blocking moon and starlight and pressing on the air until it was so thick it was more like breathing water worm ignored the sweat rolling down his back and inside his barrier gloves and huddled in the deepest shadow he could find while keyket went through the id dance with the guard inside the man had taken the bribe all right but he was making sure he opened to the right thieves worm didnt blame him knowing how pissed a type like grinder got when someone swooped in and snatched his prize he just wished the git would hurry and make up his mind and he wished it would rain and wash the crud from the air he was working up a real hate for this stinking world the sooner he got off it the better hed like it but it was going to be tougher than he thought glomming that femme she was here all right hed seen her ambulating around with grinders crippled kid hadnt figured shed have that kind of connections meant he had to be jodaddin sure he had it right cause he wouldnt get a second chance a siss from keyket brought him out of shadow the door opened and they hurried inside bug has the sec sys tamed the guard was whispering the sweat on ins face from more than the heat says you got a clear hour before the bypass starts to strain keyket nodded gotcha where i better show you this setups so messed only the keph can keep straight whats where bugs got dollies already there the first lock took the longest time almost twenty minutes of their hour it was a tricky bit of tronics with layered freeze triggers and a mutating key but hed done tougher and he knew better than to lose hold on his patience hed just got the lock to signal open when a brief waggle on the readout warned him there was another trick in the shippers bag he swore under his breath andran the palmscanner around the crack where the lid fitted onto the base just a pressure spot simple but wicked if you missed it he pressed his thumb onto the spot the lock hummed and the lid to the container cracked open he left the loading to keyket and the guard and moved on to the next container the pattern was the same so he went through that one fast as kobber beer through a gut by the time he finished the third theyd lifted the packets they wanted from the first and transferred them to grinders box he shifted over there closed the lid reset the count and the pressure spot engaged the lock then stood waiting while keyket finished pulling what he wanted from the second container twenty minutes more and they were out of there the warehouse sealed up again no evidence anything had happenedexcept for some stuff gone missing off invoice and who could say where that went down it hadnt surprised worm that grinder knew exactly what was in each of those boices or that he wasnt simply cleaning them out hed worked for smart and hed worked for dumb and from what hed seen here grinder was on the high side of smart reminded him a lot of mort which made him shiver when he thought of what would happen if he missed the snatch and blew his cover a few steps before they hit the main street keyket gave his shoulder a friendly punch never seen slicker worm grinder likes gits who know how to do the job you better go shuck y tools ill meet you at the tank for the payout worm followed keyket into the small back office and stood by the door his shoulders hunched his eyes fixed on the legs of the blocky desk his hands in the pockets of his jacket once they knew what he could do with locks lowlevel managers like tank got real nervous if they thought he was looking around too much they never realized it wasnt what he saw that mattered so much but whether he was carrying and he was carrying getting into tanks office wasnt a chance he could pass by the sensacube in his pocket turned warm against his thumb giving him a clear to start the tabs and tictacs sewn onto the jacket pulling in images and tracing energy flow tank counted out the plaques into two piles one larger than the other his hands were quick and accurate small hands for such a block of a man worm watched them and thought gambler whatever he is now he got his stake gambling when the counting was finished and the plaques in canvas bags keyket stuffed his down the front of his shirt and went out flashing a grin at worm as he went when worm came to get his bag tank cleared his throat grinder was real happy with keykets report he wants you over for dinner tomorrow worm which means you mind your manners and dress nice hell send a jit to pick you up at six hour sharp outside harrons greenshop down to north end of star street thats right next to the ring road if he likes you hell probably give you a place its a good deal and he wont be happy if you give him any shuffle about it you know and i know we dont want grinder not happy worm stood holding the sack yah he said after a moment maybe it wont happen say it does ill be real enthused tank blew out the breath hed been holding and the hard line of his shoulders eased off good one last thing if you stay the night could be one of the women living in the house will come by grinder likes to keep them happy after hes moved on so you dont need to worry about that just make sure she goes away feeling good and keep your mouth shut after you hear no lie no lie hes a generous man to folk who dont cross him gotcha urn there a laundry around been washing my own but he shrugged transy herms over by the rainy season tell er how come and shell jump you up the line thanks when he got back to his room worm swept it for ears but found none apparently grinder wasnt that interested in him yet he was exhausted and needed to sleep but he stripped his jacket first setting the tabs and tictacs in their slots in the decoder plugging in the sensacube to download its more general data set nervous and unhappy worm followed the humming serviteur into the dining room and nearly lost what calm he had left when he saw lylunda elang sitting next to the empty chair that was waiting for him he relaxed when she nodded absently at him smiled then went back to talking to the woman on her other side hunting cover the hegger combine was a small dominion at the tip of the ular spur four star systems with a fifth at the center all of them within three days split travel from each other the combine itself on a major trade route the inhabited worlds of these systems were prosperous peaceful and controlled with access to the surface severely restricted an outsider had to have a sponsor and wear a locator tag at all times shadith left her ship in the tiedown at the transfer station in orbit about the hub world ghysto all commerce in the combine funneled through this place and the station was immense almost as largeif not as massiveas the world it floated above having to be vetted like this was annoying and ate up time but an untagged ship approaching any of the systems in the combine would be blown to dust the minute it showed on a screen digbys shriek got her through checkin without trouble she rented a guide rod and slip plate and went skimming along the thruways hunting for adelaris supply systems the polished pale young man gave her a good view of his perfect teeth as he rose from his desklet and smiled at her how may i help you desp irritated by the eyes watching her while the suspicion and control that was tangible enough to smell made her feel that her skin had shrunk until it didnt fit over her bones any more shadith decided she was tired of all this she put on her most formal face and said with icy precision i need to speak to adelaar aici arash would you arrange the call please may i ask why i dont mean to be intrusive but ill have to give a reason to the prossiggal you may not mean to intrude but you do tell your prossiggal this shadith whom aici arash met on telffer and university wishes to speak to her concerning a matter which is to be kept private between them and which does not concern any others but the two of us if that proves insufficient then so be it may i see your identification that is not necessary he let his smile fade if you were a friend you would have the private number i think i must insist that im here without objection from the combine is sufficient anything more is unseemly curiosity on your part make the call for a moment she thought he was going to summon security and have her removed then he brought up the privacy shield tapped on the corn and began talking after the first few words his neatly brushed eyebrows rose and a few faint wrinkles appeared in his marble brow shadith waited impatience like burrs in her blood a moment later he rose gracefully to his feet and stepped away from the desk aici arash wishes to speak to you desp shadith he waited until she was seated then stepped outside the door so it would be obvious he wasnt listening so it is you well what is it i need to talk to you facetoface you know where im working now yes it has to do with that indirectly not aslan didnt your pretty assistant tell you there was no one else involved spla adelaar chuckled he is very decorative isnt he and intelligentin his limited way which is quite suitable for the job hes got her pale blue eye went distant thinking it over shadith told herself asking herself what price she can extract for her cooperation she might owe me her life but thats debased currency in these realms i should have known that his names brad adelaar said call him back and ill have him set things up you have your own ship company ship company registery give him the shriek string hell need that for the tag youll have a threeday split from ghysto ill be waiting for your calldown then when the shuttle from drooms transfer station landed at the visitors field a girl was waiting for her in the small holding room a lanky oddlooking almost child my names talit the patron sent me to give you the pass and bring you to adelaris patron talit blushed its what we call her the other girls and me adelaar she said the name in a rush as if it were too precious to be in her mouth at all if youll hold out your arm desp shadith ill set the pass bracelet for you once thats done you wont have to fool with those idiot clerks do you have luggage ill take care of that too theres nothing to take care of since im not going to be here long you and the other girls there is that comfortable good if youll just follow me desp shadith we can cut through here and reach the jit line without much walking talit opened a door halfconcealed by an excessively clean plant that looked as if its leaves were washed every day they emerged from the building into a brilliant morning drooms sun was a greenishyellow disk about twothirds of the way to zenith as talit programmed the jits destination module shadith looked around the autumn day was brisk and cool with the occasional brown leaf breaking loose and blowing free across aggressively neat yards and sidewalks mop the leaves and sweep the grass id go crazy fast if i had to live here she leaned back in the seat brushing hair out of her face no sign of a star street well there wouldnt be with the visitor restrictions in the combine the road was a neat black line between the trees and the warehouse walls beyond them with the jitrail gleaming down the center there werent many people around a few in the distance walking away from the landing fields admin center and an old man with a leash draped over his arm standing under a tree a short distance off while a small beast in a figure eight harness chased after leaves not a beast shed seen before it looked like a rat crossed with a monkey what people keep for pets spla ah she glanced a last time at the ratmonkey smiled as it leaped at a tree and went scurrying up while the bird it was after perched calmly on a denuded branch with a smile on its beak she said aloud desp shadith never mind im just a little tired thats all she settled onto the back seat and watched with amusement as talit got her legs tangled when she tried to get in how long will this take talit brushed limp brown hair out of her eyes stabbed her thumb at the activator and turned to face shadow as the jit started smoothly off the patron thought about sending a flier but she said its a nice morning and youd enjoy the ride um im getting things backward again sorry a little over twenty minutes and you asked me about me and the others and i forgot to answer sorry um were the patrons apprentices she does that you know of course you didnt or you wouldnt ask she has lines out all over the place foundling homes call her when they have a girl whos good at her maths and likes to make things but they cant find a place for were apprentices like i said then we take jobs in the company and the ones whore really really good she sends to university for a while she blinked as the bird shadith had been watching gave a loud caw and went swooping past above the jit its ever so much better with the patron than the home it wasnt a bad place but you get lost in the crowd there unless youre really pretty or can do something special the patron makes us feel special because she chose us you see she gave her quick little smile then turned away with practiced tact to give her passenger time to pull herself together before she had to lace adelaar shadith was surprised at what talit had told her then ruefully ashamed of that surprise it was a side of adelaar she didnt know existed but it made sense when she thought about it adelaar might have pride in and a fierce love for her daughter but aslan had gone a different road and there was no chance shed come home to take over the business that her mother had struggled so hard to build these young apprentices were an interesting way adelaar had found to look for someone to share her interests and have the drive to take over adelads when she was past it and maybe she missed aslan more than she wanted to admit loneliness i feel it sometimes but theres nothing i can do about it my people are dead even if i got pregnant itd be this bodys child not mine no weavers of shayalin left anywhere in the universe after talit left her shadith looked about the room and found another surprise not anything shed expected from what she knew of adelaar it was not an office but a comfortable parlor it might have been a place where people lived rather than worked padded chairs a scatter of small elbow tables whose thick tops suggested that access ports might be concealed beneath the polished wood a fireplace with a fire crackling merrily behind glass doors shadith grimaced and settled herself in the chair talit had waved at she felt out of place out of step an office would have been more comfortable for her she missed autumn rose it would have been good to have that steely intellect to act as front and deflect attention from her she heard the click of a door and looked around adelaar walked briskly into the room her best business face on she settled herself in another chair and tapped the top of a table which opened displaying a terminal she ran a sequence on the sensor squares moved the table to one side and nodded to shadith privacy shield up recorder going so what is this about to do a job for one of digbys clients i need to get into marrats market digby has reasons for not wanting his connection with this client even hinted at they know me there they know i work for digby so slip and slide isnt going to work you know marrats yes shadith waited a moment but adelaar said nothing more right well if i show up there without a reason i get escorted to the tiedown put in my ship and told not to come back would you be willing to let me use adelaris as cover you could have made a splitcom call why come here comcalls are not always as private as one thinks one of digbys selling points is discretion and if i asked you who these clients are do you yes turn the recorder off thank you the icliu berej a taalav array has been removed from pillory then we can expect taalav crystals on the gray market soon or is it already soon would be more accurate i believe in three or four years maybe if the array survives and produces hm adelaar let her head fall against the chairs cushioned back and closed her eyes in the silence that followed the fire crackled behind the glass doors and shadiths breathing got louder and more uneven as she waited for the answer aslan says youre an extraordinary musician adelaar turned her head reached over to the table and ran another pattern on the touch squares if i remember correctly you like shara tea and lemon wafers good it seems odd youve left university to unravel knots for digby i havent the necessary passion to chase bookings and bend my life to serve my art too much of a solitary i suspect perhaps in another fifty or sixty years ill change my mind theres no hurry i see why you and aslan are friends its a way of thinking i cant understand adelaar went silent again as a serviteur hummed in to lay out the tea service and the platter of wafers when it was gone she closed the privacy shield and leaned forward to pour the tea ill do a deal shadow in return for the use of adelaris name you work on a small problem for me a bit of serendipity here some connections of mine tell me that my problem at the moment is actually in residence at marrats mh id like discretion on this embarrassing possibly damaging to adelaris reputation a scamjack managed to jump the line to hegger minitools and got downside here on droom among his other activities he romanced one of my older apprentices a girl named mirik a young fulladerin from saber minor she sighed they think because theyve had a hard beginning theyre street smart enough not to be fooled its an illusion he got away with a rather nice variation for the programming of guard buts that my development staff had not quite tamed enough to bring to market the silly child ran with him no doubt shes had a rude awakening by now i believe he left quite a string of shattered hearts and careers behind him male and female both a versatile man as it were i was rather annoyed when i discovered all this hm the sources that told me hes at marrats also mentioned that mink is still with him the program variation is gone im not worried about that weve cut our losses if i ever get my hands on him hes going to be walking around minus some essential parts but im not asking you to do anything about him either well one thing flake him if hes still there and collect as much information about him as you can without spooking him if hes gone by the time you reach the market no problem its the girl im really interested in i want to know if she was a dupe or in on the scam from the beginning if shes a dupe and hes dropped her what do you want me to do if shes clean and unless im very much mistaken she is i want her back remind me before you leave to give you a credit flake in case you need to buy her out of something shes a bright child with a remarkable questing mind but little experience talk to her tell her shes got a place here if she comes and claims it tell her shes had a useful lesson but she shouldnt let it ruin her life adelaar set her cup down smiling at something she alone saw shell find some other way to mess up i know that youve never seen such a klutz she can trash a room just walking through it nearly burned the dorm down when she came up with an answer to a problem wed been having on a program and let a tea kettle melt to slag if she was fooled shell be miserable now she gets that way could be close to suicide hm probably best if she doesnt come back here till things have quieted down a bit the authorities might make difficulties for her and us tell her ill finance a stay on university for a year then she can come back clean my word on it she knows what that means how much of this do i tell oversec when they ask that ive sent you to search for the girl and provide return fare if she wants to come back its not the kind of thing digby usually does but since youre aslans friend you can say youre just doing a favor for her mother its a deal then shadith got to her feet if youd call a flier id like to get back to the field as soon as possible thanks adelaar stood smiled and thanks to you shadow useful information to know that the price of taalav crystals might slide in a few years should i wish you good hunting or not i wonder wait here a moment till i grave that flake for you travel times being what they were when shadith slid into the tiedown at marrats it was almost a year standard since the last time shed visited the market but the directors hadnt forgotten her and were decidedly not happy to see her back there about thirty seconds after the tug bots drifted the ship up to the hitch and locked it down her shortrange corn chimed a blurdslang face appeared and she was ordered to report to the oversec complex immediately she sat in a small glassedin alcove the people passing by glancing incuriously at her none of them coming in she sat and sat and waited this was deliberate the directors wouldnt want to get digby annoyed at them but they didnt like at all having one of his ops show up without his informing them that she was coming and they were showing their displeasure shed set herself a limit of three hours if they didnt see her before then and let her soothe their little minds she was leaving digby could stir his photons and see if he could identify the smuggler from the description shed gotten from the taalav and then shed have to decide once more how she wanted to play this the image of the kliu berej slaughtering the odd little creatures haunted her somehow she had to find the arrays and get them away hide them in a place the kliu couldnt reach couldnt reach why didnt i think of it before vrithian no not vrithian the next world out storsten its a heavy world like pillory vrithians sister world people have been looking for that system for centuries without getting a smell of it and lee only found it because her mum came and got her harskari maybe she can help she likes gardening i need to talk to lee but i have to find the smuggler first have to get her to tell me where they are she sighed digbys going to have kittens and i have to find something else to do with my life after about an hour and a half of the observers watching her doze a juvenile blurdslang drove his nutrient bowl into the room and clicked it in behind the desk he activated the voice cube and fixedwatery eyes on her what is digbys interest in the market and why didnt he inform us of his intentions im on leave at the moment thats why you werent informed im doing a favor for the mother of a friend adelaar aici arash of adelaris security systems what favor im to find and interview a young woman who left her employ under clouded circumstances if the interview is satisfactory i am to arrange passage for her to university its a very simple business a call to adelaris will verify this the young womans name she may not be using it at the moment but the name i was given is mink ac vissyn a young fulladerin from saber minor she slipped a cased flake from her pouch seta it on the desk her bio datas here if youd like to take a copy after a moments laborious cogitation he tapped off the voice cube and shrilled a spate of blurdsla into the corn counting as usual on the fact that few people beyond his species could understand his speech shadith kept her face still she couldnt get everything some of the sounds were outside her hearing range but she could pick up a lot of what was being said it was hardlyworth the effort because he was announcing theyd all wasted their time stewing in their dishes over nothing and what was he supposed to do with the flake she was waving at him he listened tapping irritably with the tips of the thready fingers at the end of a tentacle when the burst of speech from the com was finished he reactivated the voice cube you will remember that any action against a firm established in any node of the market will be dealt with severely the list of market laws and the penalties for violations of them are waiting for you in the mimarose ottotel review them before you begin your search you may leave now take your flake with you we are not interested the node diurn was nearing its end as shadith left the oversec complex the bubble darkening ripples of vermilion and saffron shimmering behind the flat roofs of the other buildings in the security complex she was feeling quite pleased with herself and had to work to keep from grinning we are not interested she murmured and if you believe that see this phial im holding those few golden drops are the vryhh formula for immortality i swear its true tsa the street was empty except for a few peacer bots returning for an info dump and recharging this wasnt a place where people strolled for pleasure she marched to the chair pen and thumbed on a chainchair climbed into it and let it click her toward the lock and the pneumo line that would get her into the ottotel node a rain was scheduled in that node nice clean the air and wash everything down then i start hunting chatting up everyone i can get to talk to me holoas swirled under the velvet black of the node shell in its night phase reflected in the wet pavements and the glass of the show windows lost in the mix of crew off the visiting ships labor from the factories offduty guards merchants gamblers thieves smugglers gun runners druggies and dniggers cousins and noncousins of every shape color and attribute some raucous some musical some silent shadith drifted along the marrata circle looking for the places she and her hired man had visited the one night shed spent here last year shed thought about seeing whether he was still around but decided against it he was altogether too observant and no doubt had rather close ties to oversec if she were just playing she wouldnt care but working this doubletrace was complicated enough without that sort of close observation music drifted into the street when doors swung open sliding into her blood changing the way she walked the set of her head the swing of her shoulders she rethembered the hushed elegance of the hegger transfer station and laughed aloud reveling in the difference she knew where shed start her trace and how she was going to do it it was music it was always music she laughed aloud the key to the universe she sang shadows songs in the next three hours she went in and out of the smaller clubs listening to the music looking at the custom sampling what was sold there moving on again when the mix wasnt quite right zigging from side to side around the circle sliding into all the dark holes where the crews blew their pay shadith wriggled to a table the size of a washcloth pushed up against the wall and continually threatened by the swing gate as the serving girls coming from a back room pushed past her their trays loaded with everything from pelar pipes to jugs of obat raw enough that a sip would pickle the lining of the drinkers throat just the smell was enough to pucker her mouth the gloom was sporadically and inadequately lit by drifting spheres of psuedofoxfire faces moved in and out of darkness as they were touched by the cold green light mostly they were the usual cousinly variety though a group of lorrunertoerkans hunched over a table near the door the deep creases in their faces puddling shadow as if they were filled with ink and a few male caan eyes flashed to silver then dark as the foxfire drifted near then away the stage was empty at the moment the players finished a set as she came in and moved into the back where no doubt they were communing with their souls via whatever substance they found handy they were the group she remembered it was toward the end of her night out when she was feeling no pain and an urge to sing though she knew well enough what working musicians thought of pushy amateurs in the grip of wish fulfillment she teased them into letting her join them and the snatches of memory that were all she retained the next morning werent that embarrassingat least not the ones that dealt with her singing though other images the pile near nights end sari the table beeped to remind her she hadnt ordered the rent drink yet she ran through the menu chose a white syntha wine that shouldnt be too poisonous and started to chuck a handful of marratorium tokens in the slot uh what she looked up into a mans grinning face the swinging door had shoved him against her but he hadnt resisted it all that much and he didnt move away when the server dashed past and let the door whoosh shut whynt you let me buy that chichi then you wont have to look anymore will you zaz off grot if i was looking and im not it wouldnt be for you he ruffled her short curly mop with a big hand leaned down till she was nearly choking from the haze of obat thick as smog around his mouth your loss hunbun he said you sure his voice was amiable and lazy as the yawn of a wellfed tiger in a patch of summer sun yeah genman just want to hear the music he shrugged and wandered off she waved at the stink he left behind shifted in her chair as sounds of movement on the stage trickled through the noise flute in one hand the other shading his eyes a tall thin man with a bald head and skin that glistened like wellrubbed mahogany ambled along the edge of the stage peering into the crowd chali she thought he came round to her side of the stage grinned dropped to a squat e shadow bisa said she saw you come in yoh s me since i was here a while thought id come give you a listen we using some of the stuff from last time he grinned broad square teeth flashing white against the dark brown of his lips any more you want to gift us with dont want much do you she chuckled and got to her feet wriggled past the table a single step took her to the stage and she held up her hands give me a lift she sang with them several times that night chali bisa herm and the max flute viola keyboard and bass at first her hands itched for her harp then she noticed a change in her singing she was beginning to develop echoes in the audience almost weaving dreams again as she had when kikun was there to give them form it wasnt quite right not yet but it was coming and it was real the ache in her head told her that she ended the night with just chali playing and the song shed written and sung on ambela not so long ago i am fathoms deep she sang and felt those listening come into the circle of her arms felt them seeing she didnt know what except it was a dark and melancholy vision as hers had been when she wrote the words i am fathoms deep in love with dark i fill my mouth with night and drink the absence of the light dense and stark i think i will not endure the pure white silence of the day i will sleep the bright away and rise with the moon to reprise the melodies of night stark black and white her sisters danced for her the veils they wore swirling about their angular forms their eyes were wide and dark with sorrow and farewell as if they knew they would not come again for her no matter how strong her gift might grow they would be wholly dead at last dead as shayalin burnt to a cinder eons ago long before her second life in the diadem and her third life in this body dead and gone when she finished the room was silent for several minutes then the hum of speech rose again and the rapid tinkle of the drink orders and the clunk of the market tokens in the slots she watched the misty outlines of naya zayalla annethi itsaya tallitt and sullan fade and vanish even with drugs and dreams she couldnt call them back the knowledge chilled her to the marrow of her bones never again never never never again she let chali and bisa lead her away in a little while she was going to tease from them all they knew about the kliu while she asked them to help find adelaars protegee in a little while when she could get her head working again hoo chals im wiped shadith moved her shoulders then patted a yawn the rooms single window was bright with the striated colors of the diurn dawn been dogging on my job long enough bisa grimaced worked her mouth something died on my tongue job shadow looking for someone what i should be doing you all feel like having a peer at a phot why shadith ignored the sudden wariness in herms voice im hunting for this girl a rescue of sorts no prosecution she got conned by a scamjack and went off with him because she was too scared to stay behind poor kid her boss said shes near genius with tech stuff and a real klutz with everything else boss wants her back on the job the jacks probably long gone but the girls supposed to be floating around the market somewhere bisa held out her hand and scowled when the max caught her by the wrist the two of you can take a long walk out a short lock any dirtkickin kid that hits the market without a clue or connections is in bad trouble and you know it she took the flake viewer clicked it on and swore you didnt say how young she was shadow shes around twenty standard but a babe when it comes to knowing whats what she came out of a foundling home and lived in a dorm when the client took her on as an apprentice chali took the viewer from bisa glanced at the image and passed it to herm mind telling us who the client is ill tell you this much ive know her for a number of years now shes the mother of a friend of mine and weve done a bit of business together that worked out real well for me shes prickly and hardnosed and i dont much like her but when she says shell do something she does it she plays fair and doesnt hold grudges if any of you happen to know the girl talk to her first see what she says she yawned again sar im tired she took the viewer from the max think about it im hiving in mimarose if you decide to give me a call as a favor not before node noon shadith drifted out of sleep shifting off her stomach onto her side it didnt help she didnt want to wake but her bladder gave her no choice grumbling under her breath she rolled off the bed and stumbled to the fresher when she came back she saw the message light blinking she rubbed at her eyes tried to wake herself enough to cope with whoever was calling read message the words unreeled in a minatory tone as the marratorium governors wanted to make sure she knew she couldnt receive pay for singing unless she had a cabaret license and was she planning to apply any time soon she groaned abort that any more messages one message received and read the hum ended and the light clicked off ah spla i was afraid of that ah well i did my best now its back to slogging along the hard way one by one she hit the smaller places along the circle showing the viewer asking her questions have you seen this girl shes a lamb ripe for shearing and i want to send her home do you know anyone who might know where she is she chatted with waiters and barmen waitresses and barmaids the occasional fulltime drunk or dreamer cousin and non even a meditating sikkul paem with ves budlets sitting in pools of focvoda doing ves drinking for ve passing the vibes along the rootlets that connected them to their parent sometimes she traded stories with all of them about what could happen to girls trying to get by without connections sometimes she simply gossiped about this and that her ears primed to pick up any information she could about female smugglers footsore and hoarse from talking so much for such little result awash from the drinks shed had to buy she reached the tangul cafй toward the end of the node afternoon the shell was beginning to darken and it was the slow time too late for the working crowd and too early from the night owls the place was almost empty she dropped into a chair at one of the tables near the bar sighed with the pleasure of getting off her feet then sat slumped with her head against the wall her eyes closed after a moment she pried them open and inspected the menu written in liquid crystal above the bar mirror a jaje waitress came trotting over her dusky fur absorbing light so efficiently she was little more than a blotch of darkness with a pair of shining gold eyes hard day her voice was as soft and muted as her fur oh yes i think a cup of teas all i can manage she glanced at the menu again uplands red ah one of my own favorites they do it right here two pots and water on the edge of boiling well would your bosses infarct if you sat a moment and had a cup yourself spring for it she chuckled as the gold eyes narrowed and the small round ears flattened against the jajes skull only renting a moment of your time you can always walk away why not the jaje waved a threefingered hand its not as if were rushed off our feet right now a breathy sucking sound jaje laughter if you come up with a tip the time might be more fruitful she went gliding off shadith took a sip of the tea and smiled with pleasure youre right ah thats good she slipped the flake viewer from her belt pouch and set it on the table close to the edge where the tiny jaje could reach it im a bitty shovel in digbys excavations she went through the patter shed repeated so many times already no friends no connections likely shes not enjoying herself much these days the jaje tapped on the viewer examined the image with care then shook her head sorry havent seen her and shes unusual enough id probably have noticed too bad femmes on their own even when they know whats what they can get in a mess of trouble at least we jajes have our bond and the home tree sometimes though zjuice i hate that stuff they got my bonds and me that way weve a long line to swing before we get home again you offering a reward i can go high as fifty gelders higher id have to check with the client i know what you mean had my own problems that way im a lot older than i look and a few years back i was so dewy i might have been just hatched ran into a guard on a transfer station who liked em young and scared tried to use zombi on me ah spla what happened he ended in the garbage chute as molecular dust not my doing long story and complicated anyway thats when i met digby the first time the jaje shivered we had someone try it here a couple months ago on this smuggler at least thats what the talk was i suppose she got off with something the kliu wanted thats who they said hired the ghoul oversec got real hot the ghouls brainstripped now and doing a term under contract cheered my bond and me up no end when we heard that wonder if she was someone i know ive got several friends who fly the egg route caan nah that was her friend cousin lylundayeah thats it lylunda elang nah her i dont know take another look at the viewer if you see someone like that who does things like spill her drinks in her own lap give me a call im at the mimarose poor tissala think you could make some dupes of this my bonds are working several other nodes we could ask around not a bad idea all right if i drop them by later tonight my shift is over an hour after node midnight thatd be the best time ill see you then she finished the tea nice break but id better shift my feet some more the privacy cell in digbys ship was a little bigger than a ciciset but not much with the instrumentation completely insulated from outside contact shadith disliked the place intensely but she had no illusions about oversecs intrusion into the outer areas of the ship luck had kissed her today and she wasnt about to waste time accepting its gift she keyed the scramble beginning the recording with an explanation of the cover shed arranged for the investigation imgoing to have to stay until i finish this though it shouldnt take that much longer in the meantime i found a name for our smuggler and a reason for the klius being locked out of the market lylunda elang smuggler apparently rather well known though i havent come across her before find out all you can about her especially about her homeworld the kliu tried to zombi her and missed i suspect she headed for the deepest cover she could find probably that homeworld after i locate adelaars apprentice ill be taking the girl to university ill check in with you there to see what youve come up with she ejected the flake sealed it into a drone and started the canister on its way to its target over to you digby now i go back to talking my way round the nodes keeping the cover tight shadith shuffled into her room at mimarose dropped into her chair and tugged her boots off she stretched out wriggling her toes and groaning with the pleasure of letting her body relax romance is dead she said aloud and giggled triddas never mention how boring this is and what your feet feel like at the end of the day she yawned unclipped the notepad from her belt and began scrolling through the list shed bought from the hub there were two no three small crewbangers that she hadnt hit yet on the circle only by courtesy she tapped a fingernail on the pads screen frowning at the entries do them first then try the contractors or leave them till the labor halls had refused to talk to her they had that habit she clicked over to the other list three contract labor companies each with its own niche factory and lab lineworkers techs unskilled for the lowend work where convict labor was cheaper than bots and easier to replace if it broke if i were doing this by the numbers i should have hit them first gahh the almost year shed spent under contract was not one of her happier memories and facing down junior execs determined not to talk was a job shed rather postpone forever time is shadow my girl tomorrow morning well at least i can have myself a nice drench in the fresher and a good long sleep she pushed herself onto her feet and reached for the closure on her tunic the corn bonged working at the closure with one hand she tapped on the speaker the screen was blank shadith here whos this shadow you know my voice bisa as close to whispering as she could get not that oversec would let that stop them if they wanted to know who she was want to talk now yes outside where i work shadith rubbed at her eyes all right give me time to get there dont drag it twenty minutes and im gone the shell was nightblack and mostly invisible behind the gathering clouds rain was scheduled for the next hour so most of the circle was empty the usual strollers either back in their ottotels or in their hutches or inside the shops waiting for the next flux of customers the holoas flickering across the facades had gone dark the only lights left were the pole lamps marching along beside the chainchair line shadith stopped the chair short of the tav crossed to the sidewalk and started along it over here she followed the voice into a narrow alley her reach identifying the woman and establishing that she was alone bisa was standing in a shallow doorway tell me the name of the client she whispered i have to be sure all right shadith leaned closer murmured in the womans ear adelaris thats the right one come on she wants to see you bisa moved from the doorway and started off along the alley heading away from the circle into grubby shell slums where the argrav diminished rapidly enough to make walking difficult the nodes were after all just large irregular chunks of rock mauled a bit here and there shaved and prettied up where the customers were the back blocks that only workers saw were a lot less appealing and the farther away from the business center the worse conditions got mirik was waiting by a rookery with a grubby pothouse tucked into one corner she led them inside knocked on a hatch it opened to show the corroded face of an ancient bawd who tapped a bony finger on the ledge pay her mink said two minims shadith dropped the token on the ledge took the key the old woman pushed at her so we go upstairs now weve just bought an hour in one of the kips just a moment dont say anything yet mirik moved to the table beside the bed reached inside her blouse and pulled out a gadget that looked as if shed crumpled together an assortment of miniature sensor boards and plugged in chips at random she spread it on the table touched it on shadith felt the vibration at the edge of her senses that told her they were under a privacy cone she raised her brows decided adelaar was probably right about wanting the girl back why all the caution she said you didnt read your rules did you mirik sounded amused conspiring to divert the services of a laborer under contract is a large nono i see however as long as compensation is paid its one of those things urn shadith is it illegal till the offer is actually on the table adelaar was afraid youd be depressed enough to contemplate suicide mirik sighed i was close to that some four months ago when i woke up and found that miserable gila had hopped it and left me broke and alone i felt such a damn fool you wont believe this she sighed but i didnt know what he was doing till i was with him on his ship and we were splitting for here all he wanted was a bedwarmer and an ear for his brags if i hadnt been so wiped from his thumping me about id have walked out the lock it was when the governors sold me into contract with kapal banish as unskilled labor that i got mad that pulled me out of the glooms turn your head a moment ah yes youre a friend of aslan arent you i had that mark of yours described to me does the patron really want me back yes she thought a year on university would be a good idea then you return to adelaris and work off the debt another sort of contract labor i suppose at least its my choice this time all right what do we do now how much do you owe almost as much debt as that gila left me with and kapal banish is pulling everything it can get to extend the contract they know about adelaris and my training and theyre putting on a lot of pressure to get me to violate copyright in the meantime i do security maintenance and programming at unskilled pay what with kapals interest charges and the cost of my food and the air i breathe and the hole i sleep in i manage to clear something like a minim every two weeks since theyre guaranteed a twenty percent profit on the money they put out to pay my debts i should be clear sometime around my hundred and fourth birthday as of this morning profit included my contracts worth two thousand gelders youd better include around a hundred more to meet other claims they might dream up since im officially labeled unskilled theres one trick they cant pull they cant up the prices for losing my services itd mean a hefty head tax and a fine for misrepresentation two thousand thats all its plenty when youre flat with no hope in sight ah yes are there any buyouts you know about around two weeks ago there was this brainwipe case a broker handled it took him outmarket know the brokers name i was thinking it might be better to go that route rather than fooling around on my own youre probably right actually she handled both of the buyouts i dont think shes really female but shes certainly not male so its easiest to say she elegant creature not a cousin some species no one seems to know her names ruxalin and she has an office on the barter strip in the agentnode urn ive got to get back mind waiting here till im well away no problem dont forget your privacy projector i imagine there are some open slots you should refill mirik grinned youre so right i dont want more expense on my poor little head shadith strolled beside bisa her mind busy with miriks bit of information about the brainwipe felon as they moved through the rough narrow streets walking carefully to avoid losing their footing so it works out nicely bisa patted a yawn threading her fingers through her hair herm didnt want me to have anything to do with this he likes your singing and your songs but you scare him shadow he has his little nest here and he feels safe in it you bring in echoes of the outside you all right with it chali can cool him down why are you doing this kind of work with your gift put it down to perversity bisa or just wanting some adventure while im still young digby offers that i can write and sing anywhere any time bisas yawn triggered a yawn in her at this moment though what i want to do is get some sleep my fee is five hundred minims an hour all time spent dealing with admin will be charged to you at actual rate which includes one full hour of waiting time i eat anything over that acceptable at a short distance ruxalin looked like a thin and rather beautiful woman but up close the resemblance was gone she was an ice goddess eerie because she so closely resembled what she so clearly was not her skin was white and translucent as milkglass and delicately scaled her hair spun glass her nose a knife blade slightly turned up at the nostrils her small mouth a pale bluish pink and she was neuter completely and utterly neuter shadith leaned forward and put the holder with adelaars credit chip on the desk i want to redeem a woman under contract at kapal barush ive been informed that the liability in question is approximately two thousand gelders anything greatly more than that will be kapal trying it on theyll be reluctant to part with her but vulnerable because the woman is registered as unskilled and theyre paying her as such but shes programming for them and supervising security urn once shes redeemed ill be responsible for any debts between the time of redemption and our departure you seem to have covered the matter rather thoroughly do you have a phot of the woman yes shadith set the flake viewer beside the credit chip her name is mirik ac vissyn as i said kapal banish holds her contract the name of the individual or company providing the credit adelaar aici arash of adelaris security systems she requests confidentiality its none of kapals business who pays as long as they are paid thats quite in order is there any prospective prosecution involved no have you examined the contract and informed admin of your intent no because of my connection with digby of excavations ltd oversec was informed of my reason for being here at the market otherwise ive had no contact with them ah digbys interested in the woman no adelaar is the mother of a friend of mine im doing a favor on the side digby of course knows about this but im on my own time at the momenti see any other complications beyond kapal knowing theyve got a good thing and wanting to keep it i dont think so ive dealt with kapal before this they know me and will give in with a minimum of foot dragging may i check this she reached for the credit flake but didnt touch it yes as to dealing with kapal thats why i came to you ruxalin dropped the flake into a verifier made a soft popping sound as she scanned the readout aici arash seems to trust you quite a lot we are well acquainted ill require a five hour nonrefundable retainer agreed if you give me the flake and your cordak ill transfer the funds it took ruxalin three hours to pry mirik loose another hour to clear with admin while shadith took a side jaunt to oversec to inform them she was leaving her favor completed once the contract was voiced she took mirik to the tangul cafe to introduce her to the jaje waitress then to the tav to meet bisa chali and the others an hour later shadith eased away from the tieup and headed for the limit after she set the delouser to checking the ship she swung around quite a change i imagine yes miriks eyes went dark how im ever going to repay you or the patron shadith glanced at the readouts then smiled at mirik me its easy just tell me everything you can scrape up about the brainwiped man rumors gossip everything plus anything about the kliu berej even the smallest most insignificant details lessons in why i left home the first time a short scowling boy crouched before a screen and an extrawide sensor board the exo straps gleaming dully in the greenish light his hands were like his fathers broad in the palm with long fingers but they were paler and softer the nails ragged bruise blotches stippling them red and yellow or black and purple depending on the degree of healing he was watching inventory flow marking the items he meant to reroute without otherwise disturbing the file lylunda pulled up a chair and watched quietly at dinner last night herred had had his company mask firmly in place though he was still child enough to keep glancing at his father to make sure the game was going the right way she didnt want that kind of cooperation if he continued hostile there were too many ways he could sabotage her which was why shed told grinder to keep out of this and let her deal with the boy in her own way as she watched the list scroll past she was at first surprised by the amount and variety of goods that passed through the star street warehouses it didnt take long though before she understood what was happening and was angry with herself for not realizing long ago that the behilarr had made hutsartл a port of convenience for any shippers who had reasons to conceal the origins of their cargos ba da when i took up smuggling looks like i was just going into the family business as it were on the retail side puny operation compared to what daddy dear and his cohorts are running she took a wry satisfaction in knowing she was going to be used to siphon off some highborn jazs profit the boy was trying to ignore her he liked this work that was obvious hm maybe thats his problem he thinks im going to take it away from him grinder said hes fourteen a hard age to be he looks older grinders second herred bug the crip the gimp the weird one who likes book stuff she could hear the taunts like the ones thrown at her bastard mongrel whores git high nose because she was smart because she wouldnt put out like other girls her age except for grinder but then he didnt bother asking because she was determined to get away from this swamp zaintze said bugs mum died before he was a year old so he wouldnt remember her this would probably be the first time he was valued for anything but being grinders son and that only because grinder never let loose of anything he thought belonged to him except me and that was because he didnt have the power he does now warning luna you dont watch it hes going to start thinking youre his property again she waited until the final entries trailed off the screen herred did grinder tell you why im here not here in this room but here on hutsarte no look i got to pull and wipe before keph gets nervous his high tenor was deliberately roughened he was trying for strength and malenessor what he thought they were no you dont what you did was passive and local keph wont feel it till you begin the pulls couple of things you need to know before we get started on this business first im not going to put up with any kakazhar from you either you listen and learn or i get grinder to pull your access because you just might be crazy enough to rojo the tap and kick the whole mess down round our ears shut your mouth i dont want to hear from you yet second if youve got the brains jaink gave a cockroach youd see im back here because i need a place to cool off and once the flying weathers right again ill be gone so fast ill leave scorch marks in the air unless you plan to be real stupid your job is safe now you can talk why should i believe you and dont call me herred my names bug all right bug im a smuggler and a jojing good one with a nice rep good enough to buy a ship and fly it on my own why in jainks seven hells would i want to hang round here think im after your father not hardly im not going to say more about that because its none of your business bo da so whatd you do you had to run back to tit his voice was easier now hed let it go high light and what his peers would no doubt consider girlish she didnt smile very carefully she didnt smile this was his way of showing capitulation without actually admitting hed accepted what shed said some people want to know where my last cargo went and theyre the types to ask the hard way id rather not thank you very much he brushed his hand across the board tapped a sensor and the chair hummed around would you tell me about some of the things youve seen i dont think grinder would like that she grinned at him sure bug i cant leave here cant take the pressure shifts he doesnt want me to even think about it bo da i know and youd better shut down the shield itll make him real nervous if he doesnt know whats happening you didnt see me you couldnt ve you were really smooth bug but we both know hes watching and we both know you wouldnt talk like this if he could hear it so put us back on show and lets get started going over lerdos lines when lylunda left the warehouses cellar the sun was down and the sky a sullen black with clouds blocking light from the moon and stars though there was no smell of rain in the air as if those clouds were waiting for the month to turn before they let down the water they carried she was tired but pleased at the way things had worked out once his resistance was gone bug had turned heartbreakingly eager for her approval and ravenous for the things she could teach him as if he wanted to swallow them all in one day krink walked beside her escorting her to the apartment house on saltoki street his presence setting grinders mark on her she glanced at him and swallowed a smile he hated this hed loathed her since the time hed tried to corner her down by milk alley and she got him a good one in the family jewels it was an accident she was flailing all over the place trying to fight him off but he always thought shed done it deliberately she knew better but she was smart enough to stay out of his way until she got off hutsarte she wondered why it was krink that grinder had chosen for this escort surely there were others hm things under the surface between those two men and she was being shoved in the middle she didnt like that people in the middle got tromped by both sides when they turned the corner into saltoki street krink swore grabbed her shoulder and stopped her i dont like this the street was empty none of the usual shoppers out even halfinan ike was gone from in front of lesters cutlery a short distance beyond okin the bakers shop a line of dark figures in robes that swept the ground walked in silence unlit torches in their hands aptzers temple enforcers i think you should go to grinders he said and started to turn her around this isnt the first sermoi theyve held along here theyll start emptying the houses soon for the confessio maybe this time maybe next she pulled free i know the drill krink its not something you forget ill take my chances tonight grinder wont like it hell just have to live with it im too tired to make nice i want my bath and some sleep and im going to get them she heard chimes as she keyed open the door to her room the first thing she saw when she stepped inside and turned on the lights was the comset installed by the window she tugged the door shut and sighed so much for locks she said just as well i get this into my head right now where grinder wants to go he goes she crossed to the corn tapped it on acid in her voice she said greetings oh mighty grinderjun and how may i serve you grinder scowled at her that mouth of yours will get you skinned one of these days luna could be the scowl lightened just wanted to say you did good today bugs happier than ive seen him in a long time want you to come to dinner tomorrow night meet my other kids it was phrased as a request but she knew her options well enough there werent any thank you grinder what time krink will be over to pick you up round six itll still be light then give you some time to walk round the garden um grinder if its all right with you could you send someone else no no dont get yourself revved up he did his job just fine no problems the thing is i dont like being around him and he loathes me you push him too hard you might lose a handy tool the eyes that had gone flinty for a moment softened and he smiled always thinking maybe i want to push him uhhuh ba da youll do what you want you sure havent changed in that im just asking find some other poor fool to do your levering huh a right ill do it this once dodoll bring you youn bug break off early you hear get your hair done wear something nice after his image faded she touched off the com and then dropped into the chair shaking and nauseated sweat popping out on her face running down her back she started to swear then snapped her mouth shut that was grinders corn everything she said here maybe even everything she did would be picked up and recorded what shed said to bug applied to her too grinder might pretend a sentimental attachment to her and say all the right words but he wasnt about to trust her im a fool she thought i shouldnt have come back i thought i knew how things worked here but id forgotten a lot of it and i didnt know about grinder jaink a loud cry from outside broke into her thoughts she tapped off the light moved to the window and looked out the hooded aptzers were standing in a circle in the center of the street their torches were lit now and cast red shadows on the walls and the pale crete pavement one of the aptzers lifted his voice hi the call he had a powerful tenor trained to cover distance beloved he sang surrender your wills to the tenderness of jaink search your hearts and know that you have sinned a second aptzer took up the call when the first was done beloved he sang how easily you forget that which jaink requires of you search your hearts and know that you have failed him when the third sang the beloved lylunda sighed and moved away from the window at least she could manage a bath though it seemed sleep was going to be more elusive they were going to keep that up till dawn the only good sign was that they hadnt brought the drums so the harrowing itself would happen another time the scourging and purging the bonfire of vanities and the public confessions the lekats of the izar would come out though there were few who paid more than lip service to the behilarr god they would play the aptzers games invent confessions lay their clothes and ornaments on the burning piles let themselves be cuffed to the whipping posts do anything they had to in order to survive theyd learned long ago the costs of rebellion the behilarr controlled the water and the food if they shut off the mains and closed the gates the izar died dont know if you remember me lylunda amalia eskurat forget the prettiest girl on babalos street lylunda bowed touching her fingers to lips and heart her face carefully blank jaink shes younger than me but she looks a hundred years old and all of them hard thats kind of you perhaps it was true once you look tired has grinder been working you too hard lylunda grimaced how i look comes from beloveds chanted the whole night under my window i maybe managed three hours sleep im giving serious consideration to moving into the keph vaults overnighter amalia nodded not a bad idea come walk with me ill show you around she moved slowly along the flags of the walk in the arcade that ran round the outside of the court see the names on the doors theres mine grinders generous when one of his women gets pregnant he moves her in here and the apartment is hers for the rest of her life some of the others have gotten married and brought their husbands here he doesnt mind youll meet most of them at dinner its like in a palace you see everyone comes to dinner when grinder says he wants it formal when they reached the back of the garden amalia opened a door and gestured lylunda through she stepped into a smaller garden with graceful darkleaved minikuna trees their long withes blowing like hair in the evening breeze by each tree there was a small grassy mount with a flat stone on top each stone held a small urn amalia walked to one stood looking at it my daughter she said she killed herself when she was seven i dont know why she was always a sad child lylunda shivered at the flatness of the womans voice a gray hopelessness shed never felt no matter how tight things got im sorry she said no matter its been five years now life keeps on in spite of everything i come here so i can tuck her away for the night not really of course i know that but her voice trailed off wed better get back now shes the only child here you know the rest were mothers once you give grinder a child you belong to him even after youre dead there was no change at all in her voice the same soft sad murmur but lylunda knew she was being warned to walk very carefully or shed find herself trapped the way all these women were as she moved through the door she set her hand on amalias shoulder and gave it a gentle squeeze to let the woman know shed gotten the message the days that followed slid past with little to divide one from the next even the harrowing of the izar she missed most of the harrowing having moved into the overnighter a room opening off the kephalos terminal chamber no bigger than a closet with a basin and a toilet and a narrow lumpy cot that made sleeping an endurance sport except for meals she spent her time with bug and did her best to avoid grinder and his men though he insisted she dine at his house at least twice a week after three weeks the aptzers retired to the temple satisfied with the havoc theyd wreaked on the guilty the izar came to life slowly warily like a wounded animal checking itself for more hurts lylunda moved back to her room on saltoki street she was getting restless no one had come after her not that shed noticed and grinder would probably have mentioned it if someone on star street started making snuffling noises pointed in her direction maybe the kliu hadnt got onto her world of origin she didnt talk about it much in the pits only in a blue mood when she was high on pelar jingko ikan knew where to find her but he was no chatterer itd take more than a dollop of kliu gold or a threat or three to pry his mouth open maybe shed broken her back trail effectively when she came here you be coming to dinner tonight dont think so bug everything i own is starting to smell so ive got to do a wash and my hairs so gungy if i leave it much longer its going to rot and fall off dont you like us its not that truly bug i just need some time to catch up on all the stuff i couldnt do because of the harrowing she made a face looked around the long narrow room and sighed button things up for me hm ive got to get some air she laughed at the face he made gently tapped his cheek as she turned to leave theres another problem she thought as she climbed up the stairs to the double doors that locked the vault away from the main part of the warehouse she tapped the code into the keyplate and waited for the door to slide open i think hes getting the notion of pimping for his father away to keep me here ba da cant even trust bug she glanced up at the landing m front of grinders office he was leaning on the stair rail watching her with the weight of his regard heavy on her shoulders she left the warehouse and walked briskly along the street stepping over the drunks and ignoring the beggars at least half of them were watchmen anyway with panicbuttons in their pockets to warn of security raids or challengers to grinders rule or even the chance stray from straighter regions of the izar grinders notionsba da they scare me so far ive managed not to see what hes getting at and jaink be blessed he hasnt pushed me on it but with bug starting up i think its about time i went somewhere else or ill end up in an urn in that poor sad garden when she reached her home street she stopped at okin the bakers shop for a fresh loaf of bread traded sass with his oldest daughter a fine freckled girl with a plain face but lively eyes and a livelier mouth got a ready cooked bird a cup of noodle soup and a dollop of tuber salad from sutegas take out next door declined halfman ikes offer to sing her a song if she showed him her legs and went laughing to her doorway feeling better about things a man stepped from the street as lylunda fitted a key into a lock she swung round to face him when his shadow fell on the door her hand going to the belt where the stunrod couched elangmun lylunda he wore a black leather vest with brass buttons and a round badge pinned high on his shoulder the sigil of the courier service drawn with blackened silver wire set into the white ceramic surface courier whose the anaitar of the erzain hizuffijaz gautaxo he bowed touched his fingers to his brow and mouth and you are elangmun lylunda her father not only her father but the top cop of the behilarr secret police shed known his name but not what he did he knows about you meerya said the words almost lost in her struggle for breath hes very important so he cant acknowledge you but he asks about you all the time it was him paid for your schooling he did love me you know and he held you when you were a little thing but she didnt tell me who he was or what he did anaitar of the erzain expeditor of the question lylundas face went tight she took the key from the door held it in her hand as she moved away he stepped aside as she got close to him followed her from the recessed doorway and into the street where his guards were waiting a short distance off halfman ike had parked his wheeled box against a light pole and was juggling two of his knives and she recognized one of the layabouts from near the warehouse she turned to face the courier and the two guards who stood a short distance off no one from the high city ventured into the izar alone yes so he bowed again handed her a paper folded three times and sealed she broke the seal and read what was written one finds it necessary to summon you and speak with you the courier will bring you to the erzainzala where speech is possible without ears to hear there is no question of arrest or detention you will be returned to your residence when the interview is complete she tore the note in half tore it again and again until it was reduced to small fragments hold out your hand youd best see he gets these back im to come with you if you will elangmun i need to put my purchases away we will wait elangmun though it would be best not to linger yes i can see that in the office wing of the erzainzala lylunda sat with her head against the cushions of the comfortable chair her eyes closed as she listed to the horrible bland noise no one with ears could call music in this small waiting room there was nothing else to do she tried not to think of the look on grinders face when she called him to let him know what was happening he smoothed it out and said with a genial smile that he knew she wouldnt buy herself loose with his business and he wanted to hear what this was about as soon as she got back come over to the house he said and tell me exactly how it went she was sweating she pushed back the hair that was sticking to her face if i go in grinders house chances are i wont come out again joj the house if go back through the izars gate i wont see free air elangmun who else taik she got to her feet followed the young woman down a short corridor and into the side door of a large corner office the man had the broad body and big head of a highbred jaz with dark hair still and the perfect silver streaks above his ears that marked his caste she stared at him and knew her mother hadnt lied this was her father neither of them could mistake that her face was a female image of his he glanced at her then looked at the pile of fac sheets on the desk in front of him he took up the first lifted his head again you are lylunda hang daughter of meerya elang yes read this i acquired it it was not sent to me she took the sheet glanced down it her name her description description of her ship a short summary of her activities for the past five years jaink be blessed theyd missed a few things that would make her unwelcome in just about any stratified culture let alone here a request from the kliu berej to the dukkerri of hutsarte that she be sought for and if found turned over to the kliu for unspecified crimes against the economy she returned the paper to the desk and waited youre cautious he said good he tapped a sensor dropped the sheet into a sudden hole in the top of the desk and watched it reduced to its constituent atoms to this point special notice has not been taken of that request the minimum was done as a courtesy government to government official records were searched without result and the kliu so informed if they are persistent and reach the right official there might be difficulties should an order come from the duks desk i could not ignore it he hesitated i find you interesting he said finally if the world and life were different id like to spend a while talking with you as it is he tapped the sensor board alert eketari he said then turned back to lylunda your connection with grinder jiraba makes it imperative that you get away immediately i will see to that i expect you will if youre finished with me she stood id like a courier to escort me back to my apartment i have things there that ill need well deal with that in a moment walk to the clan shield on the side wall then back to your chair why because ill have you whipped if you dont walk he kept her walking about the room for several minutes about midpoint in her peregrinations while her back was turned to the door a woman came in you can sit now lylunda answer eketaris questions what is your name the womans voice was soft barely audible lylunda looked at her father his face was unreadable not a muscle twitching she drew in a breath let it out as she turned to face the woman lylunda elang lylunda elang say again lylunda elang tell me what your friends call you greet me luna as you would a friend kex zu eka that what you want say again kex zu eka kex zu luna the womans voice was changing becoming more and more like lylundas it had happened so gradually she hadnt thought about what it meant but understanding came like a slap in the face she swung round to confront her father shes supposed to take my place isnt she to fool grinder into thinking im tucked in and waiting for him well it pleases me that youre intelligent lylunda though you do talk too much i brought you here because i wanted to see you thats the truth and because it became clear to me that youll probably get ground up and thrown away if you stay here and because i dont wish to face the choices youre forcing on me ekaterimun do you have sufficient material i think so anaitarjaz excellent jaink bless you daughter may you fare well lylunda saw the stunrod started to protest before she got any words out her father shot her worm at work worm leaned closer to the mirror drew his fingers along his face his skin was getting the orange peel texture it always did when the beardinhibitor was nearing the weak end of its life span sama sama the cloud cover and makeup should do the trick they say rainy seasons about due wish it would rain clear some of this crap out of the air he worked over his face until he had the look he wanted an ivory white mask with a small curvy mouth painted pink a pink flower stenciled onto his right cheek another above his left eye he eased the pewter wig onto his head and combed it out until it flowed in deep waves about his face and down his back he took the dark blue robe with the silver embroidery from its wall hook slipped his arms into the sleeves and stood for a moment simply enjoying the cool sensuous feel as the draft from the window blew the heavy silk against him his father and his brothers didnt understand how it made him feel and hed never dare tell them but they were happy enough to use his talent for impersonation in their schemes he sighed finished dressing and went out the apartments front door and the one that led into the weedy untended back yard were both plasteel with a thin veneer of local wood the wood cracking and shrinking away from the hard gray core despite their appearance they were solid and sturdy as were the frames into which they fitted and the locks were better than the usual junk that builders put on rentals they wouldnt keep worm out for more than a minute or two but once hed worked them over theyd do the furniture sagged the carpet was a dust trap and had long ago lost any pattern it might have started out with the facilities in the fresher and the kitchen were hardly adequate but there was a storage shed in the yard that he could rent along with me rooms it was large enough to house the flikit and sturdy enough to discourage idle curiosity and the back end of the yard was the izar wall so he was close to where he needed to be the place would do he counted out the first months rentfor the rooms and the shed his hands in dainty white leather gloves that the landlord eyed with a covetous leer thenhe added two more plaques i am not to be disturbed he murmured in the high light voice he affected when in this role i desire peace and solitude for my meditations of course the landlords voice was so carefully free of innuendo that he might as well have shouted his thoughts i will be bringing my possessions tomorrow in the evening late i think would you be wanting a serviteuri have a couple i rent now and then or i could point you to the tot shop down the street there is no need possessions bind the soul so i travel with few right then ill leave you to it the keypacs are on the table there anything you need you know where i live give a bang on my door i thank you for your courtesy on the next night worm opened locks for grinder then hurried home packed his surveillance equipment and transferred it to the newly hired rooms he rode a jit out to the landing field tramped across the wasteland to the place where hed left the flikit brought it to the yard and maneuvered it into the shed after he set the new lock on the sheds door he dragged himself over to his official residence and collapsed on the bed as the sun came up red and furious half lost in barren clouds worm sat naked in a chair hed covered with a sheet because he didnt want to think of the diseases that might live in its cracks and crannies the eyescreen hummed subliminally on the table before him the room was hot and steamy because he needed an open window so he couldnt run the conditioner he wiped his hand on a towel slipped it into the control glove and began moving the eye in small backforth updown movements to bring back the skill that lay dormant in his nerve paths when he was ready he sent the eye zipping out the window over the izar wall then took it through thestreets gliding along in the shadow of the eaves where its faint shimmer was no longer visible his father would skin him by inches if he let anything happen to that eye it was a bit of spoil from one of morts first jobs and his father was sentimental about it besides military eyes with widespectrum viewers and builtin ice needlers whose poison was capable of dropping a kirrgen giant were expensive and not all that available even at the darkest end of the gray market he spent almost an hour crossing and recrossing the izar making sure the preacher types had really cleared out he was sick of listening to complaints about them got so it was all keyket would talk about besides having them about meant that the woman bedded down atthe warehouse and there was no possibility of getting at her while she stayed holed up like that he stopped the eye under a window ledge of the building across from the warehouse and waited for lylunda elang to emerge the sun was oozing through banks of heat clouds half of it already behind the horizon and the light over the izar was the bloody red of burner elements the street was nearly empty even the whores had gone inside to eat and talk and wait for dark when it would be cool enough to bring the customers back when lylunda stepped into the street worm sent the eye after herand quickly discovered that he wasnt the only watcher one of krinks thugs a local called baliagerr strolled along beside her making no attempt to hide what he was doing although he kept far enough away so that she didnt see him when she stopped in the entry of a rooming house to key herself in worm debated sending the eye in with her by the time she got the door open hed decided that was a bad idea and set it hovering beside a dormer window on the house across the street a short time later he saw her standing in a window watching the sunset her room was third floor corner right now lets have a look at the neighborhood he sent the eye exploring the area around the rooming house paying close attention to possible places of concealment and the foot traffic flaking the data transmitted so he could study it later when his eyes blurred from fatigue and his glove hand started to shake he pulled the eye back to base and went home to see if grinders exec had left him a call as rain roared down outside worm ambled through the basement of the warehouse it was the first night this week he hadnt had a job for grinder and he was wondering if he should set a sonopickup somewhere in here so he could keep better track of lylunda as shewent in and out of the keph vault the more data he had about her movements the easier it would be to plan the kind of snatch that would spring him clear with the woman without getting him killed hed been watching her every night for a week now so far shed left the warehouse at the same time taken exactly the same route until she reached her home area sometimes she bought supplies for the fresher or the kitchen sometimes she stopped to talk to people along the street mostly though she just went into her room and stayed there whenever she left the warehouse she had a guard there were four of them rotating the assignment between them baliagerr arkel rodzin the shrink and vlees grinders men all of them could be shes hired her some protection after the miss at marrats could be grinders putting his mark on her maybe both grah hope not that would mess things up so bad it was maybe a good thing xman wasnt here he got impatient sometimes and rushed the job like he rushed it at the market feeling disloyal worm stopped thinking that way he heard a scrape on the stairs and looked up atcha bug whats doing bug negotiated the last stair before he looked up his exo humming and clicking his face intent as he watched where he planted his feet hoy worm nothing on tonight what they say too much rain you use a hand there yoh if youll just hold the door back till im through he palmed the lock then moved aside to let worm pull the heavy plug door out of its hole you a lock man do you know about kephs thisn that hadnt had formal schooling at it but i prenticed to someone who knew m bettern most how come you ever play tac games some when i could get away to a pit my fa he put my brothers and me to working soons we could walk almost gets boring playing the keph all the time if i dont dumb him down he whacks me if i do whats the good of that its not like i was really beating him whynt you come on down we have a game or two daddo says things are going to be quiet a while now so you got time bug dont know if grinderd like that me being new and an outsider and all no big deal man wed be using the dedicated terminals he got me and keph keeps the record of what you do in that room so daddo can see its all right he managed a shrug expression wiped from his face if you dont wanna though hey i just dont wanna look up and see krink and his crew coming round to stomp me he pulled a clown face then looked fearfully over his shoulder bug giggled come on daddo got me a new un it was in that box that youn keyket fiddled last night so you and me we can start off same level huh why not worm slouched in the chair as he watched the boy loading the game into the machine he was nervous about the keph picking up on some of the dainties he had scattered about his person but only a little because he could always explain them as being part of his tools hed brought along in case a job turned up after all he had no intention of trying to plant anything in here that would be just plain stupid he was tired from working nights for grinder and days on his own business snatching at sleep when he could find an hour or two free sleep that often wouldnt come because of the heat and the nearly intolerable humidity maybe with the rains itd be better but the season was too new for him to judge this room was cool the air clean with the comforting familiar metallic smells that reminded him of his ship for a moment he wanted desperately for the snatch to be done wanted to be off this stinking miserable mud heap and back in the clean clarity of the insplit he winced away from the thdught of his kinu kanti and the filth shed be collecting in that canyon where he left her the terminal pinged and he sat up gathering himself so he could get through the game without turning bug off him the boy had access to his fathers plans and some of his thoughts and hed be a good source if hewere handled right lylunda down on the floor of the warehouse worm glanced up from the game of hezurhairi he was playing with three of krinks men grinder was leaning on the landing rail outside his office worm saw lylundas shoulders tighten she palmed the latch locking the plug door then she turned slowly a smile pasted onto her face yes grinder labaki needs to see you about the nameday feast come to dinner tonight you can talk to her afterward all right i have to go home first get cleaned up and clear away some stuff that needs doing dinner around eight he scowled at her but itd been his choice to make this public and her response had been clever enough to maintain the distance between them eight he said and went back inside as worm gathered in the hairu he thought i was right he going to put the move on her any day now and she knows it doesnt like it much either any bets she isnt thinking of blowing off this whole business and hitting for the split which reminds me something i shouldda done a while ago got to get outta here he shook the hairu cast them into the and swore as the numbers cleaned four of his five stakes off the board my lucks took a walk maq any reason i got to hang round here letting you lot walk off with my coin cursing the horde of sticky crawling insects and the corrosive sap of the vines that oozed out at the lightest touch ate at his wholesuit and etched the clear plastic of the goggles worm wriggled through the fecund growth on the island and managed to crawl beneath the camoucloth without touching it the darkness meant he had to use the helmet light to find his way to the ship which brought more hordes of fliers crashing into him the wholesuit was sealed and he couldnt smell the stench he knew had to be out there but the thought of it was enough to start his stoniach churning he forced himself not to hurry but it seemed forever before he found the markings on the maintenance hatch he took the rod of memory plas from his pouch twisted it and waited until it finished extending to its full length and extruding rungs like thorns from the sides the hatchlock was simple but once he had it solved he didnt try opening the slide until hed sprayed the area to clear it of spores and other contaminants and tempbonded the sticktight to the hull he spread a sheet of waldoplas over the clean spot sealed it in place then pushed the door back working through the plas he broke the tempbond stripped the shrinkwrap off the sticktight reached inside and pressed the flat patch against the wall until he felt the brief heat as it glued itself in place and took on the coloring of its surroundings it wouldnt activate its beacon until the ship had dropped into the insplit until then it was just a bump on the wall and as near undetectable as anything hed worked withand it would go back to being a lump the moment the ship surfaced into realspace getting out was faster than getting in an hour later the flikit was back in the shed hed shucked the wholesuit and run at through the sterilizer and was in the fresher of the safehouse playing the handheld needle spray over his body washing away even the memory of all that creeping crawling life bug glanced slyly at worm who was frowning over the situation his players were in and trying to decide how to extract them what you getting daddo for his nameday feast worm blinked huh im supposed to get him something you dont hafta but he likes it if you do ha fas like that too but hes never satisfied whatever you get what would your daddo think was the right kind of present times up my turn doesnt have to be anything special just show you took time to think about him he likes knives if you could find one that looked a little bit different worm contemplated developments on the screen you are seriously evil bug how am i going to get my men out of that bind he going to be expecting everyone over to his house that day in and out some stay for dinner some just come in and give the gift bug frowned at the screen with worms hands hidden behind the workshield around the sensorboard he couldnt watch the setup he had to catch the small changes as they showed up on the mosaic so he could get ready to counter worms move late at night in the safehouse worm bent over the board trying out the steps of his plan running it over and over so he could locate possible trip spots it was a simple plan whether it was raining or clear lylunda always went home the same time and the same way her second turn took her through a short alley between two small manufactories no windows no foot traffic lots of debris up against the walls he could do the watcher there roll the corpse into the debris catch up with the woman shoot a dose of zombi into her good stuff this time walk her through the wall and around to the safehouse put her in the flikit and take off for his ship he considered the four who guarded her all other things equal itd be best to choose one of baliagerrs shifts he was big but he was also lazy and rather stupid worm tapped on the second screen and began replaying the flakes that had baliagerr on them watching how he moved where his eyes went when he was satisfied that hed worked things out as much as he could he began thinking about the date he erased the recording from the second screen called up the duty roster and picked out the days between now and grinders nameday when baliagerr would be on duty when to do it not too close to the nameday according to bug grinder was putting pressure on lylunda to move into his house bug thought it was a greatidea he liked her and bragged to worm about how he was getting that idea across to her if it was going to happen itd be a on the nameday that was as sure as anything worm knew she was getting really fidgety she didnt show it much but he could tell the snatch probably should be a night in that last week though bug said the warehouse all but shut down then meant fewer people hanging about one of the baliagerr dates was five days before the feast that felt about right id better fix a backup date though vlees is on the day before no hes too spooky hed never let me get close enough to do him not without more noise thans safe day before that rodzin hes bored with this guard business not paying much attention good enough so nine days from now max seven min then its done and im out of here he leaned back rubbed burning eyes bokh imtired no call tomorrow night thats good better go see tank about the he should know where theres something good and let grinder know im shopping keep him happy head thick with too much sleeping worm came yawning into the tank he collected beer and crackles at the bar and went to a table in a back corner with them to sit in the shadows crunching and sipping and trying to wake up enough to keep up his front with tank the sound of plucked strings drew him from his mind haze he looked up dark and undefined hecause the lumins hadnt been turned on yet a figure sat on the stage at the end of the bar tuning a small harp thats something new wonder what happened to musha and his lot the lumins brightened slowly catching glimmers from the sequins on the womans dress she stopped tuning and started playing a simple melody that grew more complicated under her fingers as her form grew more and more defined warm brown skin and glittering white dress opals in her ears her nails painted to match time is a wheel she sang her voice a rich fluid contralto he shivered with pleasure pushed the glass aside and leaned forward his eyes fixed on her time is a wheel that steals our loves away lost and gone in yesterday time is the necromancers terrain from the black plain of vanished years he summons the pale dancer she sways in swirls of moire silk his tears are opals in her ears the pyrelights of dead suns burn in the hollows of her eyes turn by turn he treads with her a languid pavan dead and gone dead and gone time is a while a whorl a wheel it steals our loves away buries them in yesterday as she sang her words came alive for him he was the dead dancer called from his rest star sprays shining in the empty eyes of his skull his feet treading suns to oblivion the image was so powerful that for a moment the room the table even his body vanished nothing existed except the dancer when the song changed to a wordless croon weaving around the harps mellow notes he dropped into himself with a jolt and a shapeless grief from something without a name that had been lost she played with the melody a moment longer then slid into a new tune a rapid bubbly thing as if the harp were laughing howl said the honeybear she sang nose in the honeyjar tail in the air she leaned into the harp rocking back and forth with the lilt of the songand for the first time worm saw the other side of her face saw the drawing of a hawk etched in dark brown lines on the light brown skin the description from the kliu list flashed into his mind the brand on her face and that gift for song digbys agent how long has she been here has she spotted the target and whats she doing to do about it what am i going to do about her when the set was finished and the singer had retreated to the back rooms worm gulped down the rest of his beer and sat a moment longer at the table between recognizing the agent and the effect her song had on him he wasnt sure of anything any moreexcept that hed better think real hard about moving up the snatch to this week and consign the old plan to the harmans deepest hell new singer known about her id a been back sooner how long you had her three days now off the worldship she was traveling standbyandworkit got bumped heard its bug keeping you busy these days worm shrugged likes my name what it is make sense so what you want bug was saying i need to get a nameday present i figure hes got the dump on that but i dont wanna step on toes if you know what i mean hunh you been this way before been and done and learned the hard way about overplaying it bug says a knife i figure not fancy but nice whos got go see old henry he has a shop in the izar down by the gate anything else yeah the singer she do moren sing tank let out a roar of laughter slapped his hand on the desk gonna have to lay down razor wire about that stage if this keeps on he coughed into his hand gulped water from the jug on the shelf by his head no she dont do with the talent shes got she dont have to anything other than that nah guess thats it worm left the tank and walked back to his official residence new plans whirling in his head a day late and a synapse short shadith strolled along hutsartes star street past doss houses and taverns beggars and street performers in a thousand shapes and colors with varying degrees of skill in whatever it was they did the street was wide one of the aspects of being on a newish colony world with plenty of room to spread the center strip given to loaders trundling lumpishly along heavy with cargo containers the air was steamy sweat beading on her arms and never drying just getting stickier and it stank she breathed in the sickly sweet aroma of rotting meat rotting vegetation the sour effluvia of inadequate plumbing over it all the iodine bite of the wind from the sea even though the water was several miles off and at least a mile lower in elevation amazing she thought live for a few months in ships and transfer stations and you forget how saturated in bodily sensation a world can be hm maybe a song in that playing with rhymes and images threading automatically through a crowd of hawkers players and crewfolk of the sort who milled about every star street shed seen she nearly crashed into a man who stepped from an alley in front of her hey watch where you going sorry she started to circle round him but his hand clamped on her wrist and stopped her i wouldnt do that she said mildly as she turned to face him he dropped her arm as if it were hot i know you he said what shadows your name isnt it i heard you sing nightfair bogmak maahhhh nanna how you do that she backed off a step his words werent slurred and he stood straight enough but the liquid gleam of his greenish eyes most likely came out of a bottle and he carried the stink from the contents of that bottle in a fine mist around him the singing was me the rest was someone else we broke up a while back huhn too bad yah hai come along and have a drink on me why not might as well use this one to start spreading her cover story where i just got here and dont know places yet you know my name whats yours meddlyr trych cargo master on the free trader timik just got here you said off the worldship that left yesterday i was riding standby and working my keep singing this n that they unstood me some muck from the high city up there wanted space for his bodyservant still singing then what i do he walked beside her without talking for several steps she glanced at him again but she was sure she didnt know him he was just one of the crowd at the nightfair and anyway that was over five years ago he was an inch or two taller than she was a compact man not lean but no excess fat on him his head was shaved and densely tattooed in patterns she recognized as luck signs blue lines on the bright amber of his skin the framework filled in with crimson emerald and gold there were intricate fate knots between the middle two knuckles of his fingers and no doubt more needle paintings were covered by his shipsuit his ears were pointed and flicked nervously as he walked and the pupils of his eyes were almond shaped rather than round meddlyr trych a cousin she thought wonder what part of the diaspora produced his branch he pushed open a door and stood aside to let her precede him through it into the lit room beyond then escorted her to a table by the wall and what would you be having shadow this trip im trying out a brandy they distill from some kind of local fruit i dont know what its called its smooth and tasty and warms you up lovely sounds good ill go for that he brought back two bell glasses with half an inch of a dark reddishgold fluid puddled in the bottom she took a small sip rolled it on her tongue and smiled i like it me too so you lookin or movin on looking till i build up my stash a bit and can talk my way onto a ship heading the direction i want to go he tilted the glass watched the brandy slide then slip back leaving a faint film on the curve of the bell i always wanted to tell you what it meant that time you played your harp and wove dreams for me well you and your partner didnt have time then dont have words now except there was a hole in my heart and after you sang it was gone id say you werent so bad with the words ah you should hear my cousin now theres a man who can string word with word to make the stones themselves weep with the glory of it mayhap ill come by his way some time if you dont mind telling me what world it is ah parcoshry is the name of that poor place and it is out beyond the saber worlds a long and lonely way from here she lifted the glass to traveling meddlyr trych to finding what lies beyond the next star to home shadow singer wherever that may be though she only sipped at the brandy he drained his glass his eyes went blank for a moment then he was grinning at her ol tank he stopped stared past her as he ran his tongue around his teeth ol tank he went on speaking with slow care he owns this place the tank he calls it he is not a man of words he fired the last act they were good but two of them were dusters and sometimes they just did not show even if you cant do the dreams any more you sing good i come here a lot i could tell him you sing good if you want why not got to work somewhere for the next two nights shadith sang in the tank for tips then tank added a base fee he was pleased by the custom she attracted more cautiously than she had at marrats market she began building a web of acquaintances the question she asked confined to the ins and outs of surviving here meddlyr trych came round to listen to her for the first three days bringing his mates with him then they were gone the timik heading for its next landfall but that chattering man had given her a solid background so she marked down in her mind that she owed him a favor if ever she came across him again at the time trych left shed absorbed a lot of information about the place but had picked up no trace of lylunda elang she wasnt too disturbed about that all shed learned in the millennia of her peculiar existence told her that this wasnt a place to ask blatant questions perhaps not to ask questions at all and how shed get around that she wasnt quite sure so much simpler just to march up to the hall of records or whatever they called the thing round here and start a name search working through the files or find some local sources and buy the information from them except digby had ordered her to keep her head down and do this on the sly that suited her just fine she did not want to lead the kliu to the arrays no indeed still it certainly made life harder shadith patted a yawn folded her arms on the counter at the cook shop and gave the woman who ran it a sleepy smile stiff enough to climb out of the cup she said i will not not not drink any more rikoka brandy ha thats what you said yesterday shadow curses on ol meddlyrs head he chattered round to everyone and told them all thats what i liked so now thats all the clotheads buy for me she took the cup and sipped cautiously at the scalding liquid and its such a horrible duty eh sing me another shadow maybe ill believe it and whatll you be having to sop up that kaff what else cara egg easy some of your tatta hash and a nice bloody hunk of meat what is it to be young cara chuckled and went to cook the breakfast shadith chewed on her thumb and tried to work out a plan for what was left of the day shed managed to see most of star street shed been out to the landing field with meddlyr trych and used digbys spyshot to flake the images of the ships parked there lylundas was not among them nor was it anywhere in the tiedown up by the transfer station if she was here she must have cached the ship somewhere presumably close enough forher to walk into haundi zurgile hm might be worth looking at those islands north of here if i were stashing a ship thats where id park it i pulled the boat trick on ambela maybe i should start nostalgic reminiscences of dear old daddy and his fishboat all that metal should show up on digbys patented prospectors detec if it does i pretty well know she got here if it doesnt cant prove a negative maybe she parked the ship on the wild half and cut across the ocean in her lander when shed finished breakfast and complimented cara on her way of searing cow she strolled out and stood looking up at the clouds thickening overhead the wind that plucked at her hair was heavy with the smell of brine lookin for rain shadow she turned oh good morning getto no just smelling the sea on the wind anybody got boats around here he tugged at the flesh loop that had been an earlobe before he had it stretched to hold his darimirror the mirror pulsed there when he played his drums at his pitch on an alley corner near the tank no fishing here no reason to spend tokens on boats the bellies go where the tokens heap highest tsa my da ran a fishboat and when i light on a world with salt water i always go for a sail and here im got some free time and i was thinking id like to get out on the water a while kemros the tinkerman he rents out your open top flier you could take one of those down low nough to skim the waves suck some skempt and dream a day sailer huh thats a good idea thanks getto owe you one easy nough to get straight fetch you harp to m pitch when you get back and we play duo an hour come two a right why not she smiled with affection as she watched hiin ambling away stopping every few steps to speak to a shopkeeper or a street player or just someone whiling away a moment or two staring at bugs on the pavement then she shook her head at her own obtuseness and went to find kemros the tinkerman stupid not to grasp what an ocean full of poison water and poison fish would mean to the economy of a recently colonized world and she knew about it too it was one of the warnings she had to thumbprint in the declaration of intent for temporary residence i understand that all waterlife and a high percentage of the vegetation on hutsarte is poisonous to air breathers with hemobased blood and that any attempt to live off the native products of hutsarte could result in in my death or disability no fishing industry the colonists concentrated into one city and scattered ranches not much heavy industry the other landmasses of the world left untouched so there was no commuting to and from what they called the wild half result no boats i wonder what else im missing focus shadow focus talking to yourself singer berm leaned from the door of meertis dosser his voice purring his eyebrows humping up and down as if they had a life of their own you can come talk to me anytime my daddy always said you want to talk to somebody smart talk to yourself no thanks berm she moved hastily on before he worked that one out the berms of the universe were one of the reasons shed passed on making music a career she sighed so how is that different from what im doing now hm no managers i suppose hah shadow how its different is you can get killed in this job killed on purpose i mean five hours left before im due at the tank should be plenty of time to get in a cruise and do my set with getto move those feet shadow youve wasted enough time setting up your cover ahead of her teri the switch came from rats alley patted a yawn and leaned against a wall wafting for her next client shed gotten too old and too intermittently crazy for even the sleaziest houses but she was cheerful despite what seemed a miserable life and on those days when she was tracking designed and sewed costumes that were artforms in themselves absurd and enchanting tank paid her to make three changes for shadith he got two of them and seemed to be content with that he was fond of her he was not a sentimental man so that surprised shadith but during the fittings she began to understand the womans daft charm that there was no way anyone could really make life easier for her was a part of it frustrating but a liberation in a shaming sort of way it let you enjoy her nonsense and share in the impossible pleasure she got out of being alive without your being pushed to do anythitig for her teri im going for a sea cruise you want to come along teri smiled she always smiled when people spoke to her but her eyes were empty it was one of her bad days ah well see you around shadith hesitated a moment made a note to tell tank when she got back and walked past the woman more disturbed than before when teri looked through her as if she didnt exist when she reached the next alley she turned and looked back squinting against the dazzle as the sun moved suddenlyfrom behind a cloud a man was standing beside teri to her shadith sighed and moved on she thought again about tank but what could he do the question niggled at her until she reached kemros flier park and started negotiating for a half days rent shadith took the open flit low swooping just above the wave peaks the air was brisk and briny the sea out beyond the clouds a brilliant turquoise several degrees brighter than the sky she played with the flit for a while swinging it back and forth as if she were tacking against the wind then went nosing along the offshore islands racing in and out between and around them as if she played a game with herself using them as markers at the same time she kept an eye on one of digbys specials an asteroid miners detec that hed had titivated by someone until it could smell out a ship even at the bottom of an ocean of sludge or so he swore to her whether that was true or not the watchlight turned green when she swung around the fourth and largest of the islands she sighed no proof it was lylunda elangs ship but she didnt really need proof she went scooting out to sea after that chasing cloud shadows and spent the next hour whipping back and forth along the coast at the end of that time she set the flit on hover stretched out and just enjoyed the feel ofthe wind and the smell of the ocean layering impressions in her mind about the song she wanted to write shadith nodded to getto played a phrase or two of the song tolet him get a feel for it this ones for you gee since you gave me the idea its a song still working on though i have enough for now the mirrors on gettos drums shivered in the sunlight as he drew a whispering undersong from them the mirror on his ear was a small sun itself briny winds she sang briny winds blow clouds away the sharded sea skips to their song i slide from peak to peak on sapphire waves looking for answers in the sun nothing but shadows in the shine sad shadows of friends that i left behind briny winds blow clouds away spit fillips of foam into my face gust through the ghosts within my mind till even the dance of memorys gone briny winds blow clouds away at the last word she segued into sweeping arpeggios meant to suggest sea winds then took the sound back to let getto reprise the verse with his drums he could go wild on those drums get your blood pounding till your feet moved on their own but at times like these he had a precise yet lyrical touch that could make them sing until you could almost hear the words at the end of the set when she brought the collecting bowl back to him it was heavy with local credit tokens and coins from a dozen worlds he wanted her to take half but she wouldnt i enjoyed myself out there and ill probably go back she said and i got a song or at least the start of a song might notve thought of that myself so i owe you she stooped to slide her harp into its case straightened when shed snapped the clips she thought i can trust him not to talk about me he hears things what if i asked him about lylunda elang he might even know she watched him taking apart the drums folding them down and down so he could carry them back to his place wherever that was but she saw a distant sheen in his eyes that reminded her of teri and she remembered how eagerly he tried to please the people he liked if he didnt know hed ask around and that might mean more trouble than she wanted to cope with see you she said hefted the case and slipped her arm through the strap that night as she sang in the tank wearing the silver fantasy teri had crafted her she looked out over the patrons and wondered if the klius other agent was among them and if there was anyone at those tables whod have access to the warrens on the far side of the wall it didnt seem likely they were mostly traders and crew transients who might pass through here several times a year for a while and then move on to another round oh we shall go awandering along the secret ways she sang and put a throb in her voice the sense she had of this crowd was a lightly drunken sentimentality get them weeping in their beer and feeling vaguely heroic ah the lazy stars the crazy stars they whisper in your bones she sang and let her voice lose itself in the song of the strings i have to make a move she thought shes here not on star street up the hill somewhere in the izar likely digby says thats where she came from heading for home with weasels on her tail home ground how do i get over the wall and make it look natural rest a while love a while till the calls too strong she sang chase the singing stars and leave the ground behind she played with the last word a while letting it trail to a whisper then finished the song and stilled the strings of the harp bowed to the whistles and snapping fingers that was the last song of the set she bowed again announced shed be back in half an hour then took herself and the harp off the small stage tank was waiting for her in the green room he was a short broad man with a brush of hair around a shiny bald dome and arms like tree trunks his hands were so small they looked mismated to his body as if hed stolen them from another man he brushed at his mouth whered you say you saw teri she was working rats alley i thought about going back but shed hooked a client and i didnt want to mess that up why cant find her anywhere alive nor dead you remember what the man looked like his back was to me and the sun popped out just then couldnt see much through the dazzle cousin she closed her eyes tried to bring back that fleeting memory was leaning against the wall but he mightve been maybe a head taller than her ummm not fat not skinny wearing a onepiece something gray and shiny might have been a shipsuit maybe a work overall ive seen both along the street maybe shes gone to ground somewhere the time she was doing the fittings she told me she did that when things went whirly on her he brushed that aside with an impatient sweep of his arm i know her places anyone out front who might be that client splav half of them at least or half the locals do the muscle work out at the field you think it could have been a local any reason why not the locals here dont much play outside their own pens hm could be one of them had a mind for cheap thrills you get so used to them you dont even see them less you jump the wall he stared thoughtfully past her his eyes narrowed the creases deepening in his narrow brow tank you know someone with connections over there why friend of mine well friend of a friend who did me a favor a while back gave me a message to pass on if i saw the chance a certain dancing caan should anyone want to know the wherefrom the whereto is a woman of the caans profession by name lylunda elang word was the elang was hot and going home a while and home is here i wouldnt want to shout the name around could be touchy but i figure you know how to talk soft when you need to you want me to ask about this elang she felt him go cold on her he recognized the name not so good that someone else asking questions maybe the kliu agent or is it local trouble ease back shadow better make it clear youre not on the hunt no i dont think that would be a good idea dont ask just put out a whisper about the message and where its from she wants to come she can she doesnt no harm done so whats the message he was still tense though he was relaxed and his eyes twinkled at her he does good face our tank she clicked her tongue shook her head at him huh you know better than that ill say this it was an off chance my friend took when she knew i was heading this way the sun wont nova if it doesnt get passed on but its something the woman ought to hear by the time she finished the edge had gone off his alertness good thing dit was me you talked to shadow ill see what i can do but dont say that name to anyone else she raised her brows putting out that much heat huh right i keep my mouth shut owe you one tank that i do more than you know he hesitated a moment but didnt say what was hanging on his tongue just shrugged and left hm wonder what that last was about hope its not something thats going to jump up and bite me she sighed and went on into the dressing room to splash some water on her face and sit with her feet up until it was time for the next set tank was in the green room when she came back when you get changed he said come over to the office he left before she could ask him why he nodded at a chair poured a sop of rikoka brandy into two bell glasses and brought one of them to her the bottle was dark and squat dust and cobwebs carefully preserved on its bulge to testify to the age and value of the liquid inside when he was behind his desk again he lifted his glass got teri back he said she all right alive the cul that got her was a freak cut het some and broke some bones she wont remember once shes healed up she never does least theres that she was over the wall yeh he scowled dont know if i did you a favor or not shadow passed your whisper to my touch over there i dont like how nervous he was when he heard the womans name he took a mouthful of the brandy worked his cheeks as if he sloshed it about in his mouth even after he swallowed he said nothing just sat looking down into the glass she waited sipping at the brandy saying nothing letting him take his time shes under heavy protection words been out for a couple months you talk about the woman you end up poisoning fish same thing if you ask too many questions about her official protection depends on what you call official mm hm gotcha i gave the touch the whole deal hope i got through that youre not nosing round but you never can tell with those types so slap a seal on your mouth and watch your back dont trust anyone not me not anyone he got to his feet thats what i wanted to tell you and why i wanted it private he opened the door for her waited as she hoisted the harp and slipped the strap over her shoulder as soon as she was in the hall he repeated not me not anyone it was raining when she stepped into the street aslow steady downfall that soaked her within a minute after she left the shelter of the doorway ah spla and me with no umbrella she trudged along thinking over what tank had told her heavy protection probably bought it when she came scuttling home like her tail was on fire maybe with proceeds from a crystal she got for smuggling the array off pillory be a hoot if i tolled her out when i was just trying to find out where she she woke confused her head throbbing she was sitting in a chair something pressed against her legs she tried to move her arms and she couldnt she was tied strapped when she looked down she saw that the pressure on her legs was her harpcase she stared at it then lifted her head and looked around her she was in a sketch of a room dark and shadowy the door was steel with a small grill about eye level the walls were packed dirt and irregular bits of sheetrock interrupted by vertical two by fours the floor was large square tiles the color of dried blood the ceiling was fiberglass insulation faced with brown paper torn filthy brown paper a cellar of some kind she swore under her breath tank you set me up you zalup id like to a clank from the door interrupted her thoughts she considered pretending she was still unconscious discarded that idea straightened her shoulders and lifted her head itll probably be some kind of babble she told herself this is where you find out how good your timing is shadow and get the ol mindmove ready to jump a short life but a merry one she said as the door swung open and she laughed aloud at the figures who came through itthree men wearing heavy black robes and headsmans cowls that hid all but their eyes what are you black monks in some tridda farce one was tall and broad menacing as a meat ax and about as subtle one was tall and thin with a cold snaky feel the third was short and tubby from him she sensed inquisitiveness of the peephole sort the kind that made you feel dirty thinking about it the short one came toward her when she saw the blowgun in his hand she concentrated used her small talent to set a catchfield round her carotid neck i think yes hell go for the neck as if he obeyed her thought he shoved the business end of the blower under her jaw and tapped the sensor she slapped the field round the drug and caught most of it before it got loose ran the encapsulated dollops of blood and babble through her system and peed it out on her underpants despite her efforts she absorbed enough to turn her silly though she was still in control of her mind talent pays pays pays no im wrong pees not pays giggles bubbled in her throat but she kept them down stupid zalups pinch brain ground hobs not enough sense in the three of you to keep an ant walking straight amateurs silly silly zots i foolin you to the max no monitor you uziks uzik ziks zikky ziklings she caught what was happening and throttled that burbling fast get to feeling too superior and shed start explaining in detail why they were so stupid the short man whod blown the babble into her pulled a chair over and sat in it facing her his hands on his knees the other two were silent shadows behind him whats your name shadow a snort escaped from her turned into a giggle your real name she considered that real name whose real name the bodys real name yes the bodys real name oh hawk bird rider of the centai zel but i dont call the body that any more that was before now it is shadith i am shadith shadow shadowsong who pays you tank pays me i sing in his place who do you work for i work for tank who else do you work for i work for shadith shadow shadowsong did someone send you to hutsarte i sent me i go nowhere at any ones order why did you ask about lylunda elang i have a message for her tell us the message i dont want to im not supposed to tell anyone but her tell us the message qatifa says theres a rumor round the market that the kliu have hired excavations ltd to dig her out and if its true she should get as much cover as she can fmd who is qatifa shes a caan smuggler why should she bother you dont know why should she bother lylunda likes furries she and qatifa were belly friends for a while were you a belly friend to either no do you know lylunda elang at all no why carry a message then favor for favor i pay my debts why did you wait till now to try finding lylunda elang i was busy and i kinda forgot till tank talked about asking over the wall when teri turned up missing do you know what lylunda elang looks like only what qatifa said have you seen anyone like that in the past five days no have you seen anyone that since you landed on hutsartd no he got to his feet crossed the short distance to the other two when he spoke he was muttering but loud enough that shadith could catch what he was saying shell be under for about five more minutes then shell start coming out of it anything more you need to know the bigger mans voice was a low rumble and harder to make out she thought she caught a question about a phot but she wasnt sure until the short man came back holding a jewelcase in his hand he held the phot up so she could see the tridda image inside a young woman with a pretty round face long black hair and white streaks like wings over her ears wide shoulders wide hips a narrow waist shadith almost burst out giggling even digby hadnt come up with a phot and here her captors were showing her just what she needed to know have you seen this woman at any time no look closely at the phot look at her face look at her ears at her left hand see the crooked little finger think carefully have you seen anyone who looks like this woman no he lowered the phot i a hand closed on his shoulder the big man bent whispered in his ear he nodded shadow if we let you go what will you do go back to the tank sing there till i can earn enough to buy a low passage on a worldship and go on till i feel like stopping the big man whispered again longer this time shadith decided it was time to start acting edgy she tugged at the straps on her arms put on a puzzled frown wha why she tugged harder started moving her head about where whats happening nothing you need worry about were not going to hurt you unless you make us whimpering panting shadith ignored him and started fighting the straps throwing herself about making the chair rock putting on as reasonable a show as she could manage without falling over and cracking her head on the tiles the snake man moved for the first time he came over to her slapped her hard then stood beside her with his hand closed on her shoulder his fingers digging into her flesh he still said nothing but she decided that she could get his point and stop her struggles the big man moved to the door gantz clean her up flush her out bring her upstairs krink get over here you stay outside the door on watch ive got a thought about using her and i dont want you messing it up you hear me i hear shadiths stomach knotted at the concentrated venom in those two words and found herself happy that krink the snake was too afraid of boss to go for him she watched gantz warily as the door shut he saw that dont worry woman grinder would have my guts for fishpoison if i laid a finger on you you better remember that and do what he wants without smart talk or slacking he isnt called grinder for sweetness of temper and gentility of manner he brought the blowgun from a pocket in his robe worked over it for a few minutes youll be feeling limp as overcooked noodles right now what im going to give you will perk you right up blow the fog out of your head no m all ri don do poppers you dont really have a choice love him he wants you alert and ready to listen and thats what hes going to get lylunda elang belongs to me grinder said shadith forced herself to sit still though shed done the catchment trick again with the popper the residue had her so wired she felt as if her eyes were ready to explode out of her head and every sound was a scrape along her nerves maybe she doesnt know it yet but shes mine shed seen eyes like his beforeafter a moment it came to her where lutes eyes ginny seyirshis pet killer that time she got snatched into one of the deathmakers scenarios she swallowed several times and didnt have to pretend to be frightened shes gone missing six days ago maybe on her own maybe digbys agent got her yeh i know about digby who doesnt maybe the kliu bought her father and got her that way i can handle things this side of the wall youre going to sift star street for me four days would you believe the target disappears four

diligent youve convinced me my health depends on that good and my diligence starts now i need to know the circumstances of her disappearance and id like a copy of that phot why not the phot ill see

was working for me you dont need to know about that so dont ask she left the job went home to her rooming house she was picked up there by one of hizurrijaz gautaxos couriers hes the head of the duks secret police and he also happens to be lylundas father shes the bastard he got when her mother was his hot little izar piece so theres no telling just what he wanted with her she stayed there for a little over two hours courier brought her back through the izar gate walked her to the front door of her rooming house left her while she was using her keys to open the vestibule door she was seen by at least five different people who knew her well enough to be sure it was her that was the last time anyone saw her late after dark yes and an overcast night i thought about that they recognized the clothes more than that they recognized the way she moved still a good actress the right size and shape yes i thought about that i dont know did she have a credit chip she hired you to watch her back didnt she to warn her if the kliu got too close like me i was supposed to warn her about digby yes everything she brought with her was cleaned out of her room what ive heard about the behilarr jazzies theyve all got fiefdoms out in the backcountry maybe he sent her out there no ive had that looked into you told me youd know if i tried to hop a ship i expect youd know it if she did i would if she tried it after i found out she was gone before then theres a sevenhour window when she might have made it thats what you want me to check isnt it part of it can you get me a printout of all shuttle and ship departures in those seven hours yes hm if you can get it you might add to that a list of departures from the transfer station i know enough abotit whos traveling around out there that it might tell me something it wouldnt tell you ill get it she sighed rubbed at her eyes with all the stuff your bootlicker pumped into me im about wiped can i go home now get some sleep you understand what i want yes you made it quite cleat and i want results fast yes then you go like you came shadith came out of stunner shock with a throbbing head and body that felt as if shed been beaten with a rubber hose the curtains to her single window had been drawn and the morning sun was streaming in she looked down at herself and breathed a sigh of relief when she saw she was still wearing the damp dirty clothes from last night she remembered her harp and sat up too fast yelping with pain as her head threatened to explode her stomach to erupt and all she could see was a rainy silver aura with black spots in it that wobbled and darted like tadpoles when she pried her eyes open again to her considerable relief she saw the harpcase leaning against the wall beside the door she eased her legs over the edge of the bed and contemplated getting up the thought of food revolted her but she needed the energy lot of work to get through this day and the next tank looked at shadith sighed and shook his head i have to live here he said i warned you didnt i yeah that you did she finished clearing off the table in the dressing room snapped her bag shut you know what hes got me doing ill be too busy to sing as well as disinclined see you she swept past him still angry at him reporting her activities she could accept as part of the game setting her up for a snatch was something else when she unlocked the door to the room shed rented and stepped inside she caught a whiff of jorrat and went very still a quick probe with her reach though told her the place was empty a cardboard folder lay in the middle of the rumpled bedspread no one here now but there had been someone with a jorrat pipe whod left the stink of his habit behind makes you feel really secure the way that lot waltzes in without breaking a sweat and i suppose those are the printouts grinder works fast or he already had them and now i get to wear out my eyes on ship data tsah she went out leaned over the railing orrialdy she yelled you around her landlady came into the hall on the floor below a big woman with an abundance of hair wisps escaping the knot she kept it in to wave around her plush pink face shadow so think you could bring me up a pot of your tea that i could right now if you will doorll be unlocked after orrialdy left shadith filled her mug with hot tea and opened the folder her brows rose as she realized just how much data grinder had included in the report not only the names and descriptions of the ships which left in that sevenhour window but a history of their appearances here on hutsartк going back at least ten years along with short descriptions of owners and crew there were only three of them but still she set that aside and took up the second set of printouts shuttle flights five four were cargo lifts with stasis crates meat wagons it might be possible to shove the woman in with the crates assuming daddy was behind the disappearance which seemed likely since hed cared enough about lylunda to see that she was educated and given a chance to get away from here and considering he was head of government security he could do things like that but it would also leave him open to blackmail or betrayal hm she looked down the lists of the crews no disappearances or fatal accidents and none of them had looked up grinder with news for sale not a sure thing but close enoughto cross this one off one of the shuttles was a passenger lift hm eleven riding it passengers and crew all male only place to stow her was the baggage compartment and yes crew still in business and no comment by grinder so set this one aside too which means the ships in thetiedowns at the transfer station are probably nogoes she glanced over that list found nothing that interested her and set it aside which left the three onground ships the kjatt a converted sting ship owner lomkael jurd dealing in hides and horn she looked at his history he was in and out all the time every few weeks must stay in the pseudo cluster and do all his trading here he hasnt got time to get anywhere else not in that little ship she wrinkled her nose at the thought of what that hold must smell like then noticed the last date hes back here now spla cross him off thank whatever i doubt daddy would deal with someone in his face all the time the second was a jilitera trader the jherada owner listed as the jilitera trust hm she took a sip of the tea and grimaced because it was barely lukewarm she poured more from the pot and went back to contemplating the readout dealing in local plants the poisonous ones of course heres a notetheyd asked about the fish but no one was interested in supplying those which reminds me that ship the elang wouldnt have anything in there about where she dropped the array smuggler shell be cautious about whats private and part of her assets if digby got his hands on that kephalos though he could go snooping through its innards rumor is he can scrute the inscrutable and twist the tail on any enigma ever born but do i want him to do that he talks good flesh but how much do i trust him on something like this answer to that is not at all but can use that ship to get out of here without grinder going nervous on me he gets nervous and i get dead set aside for now jilitera ship history set down here seven years ago then three years then this last one i dont know much about them does anyone jilitera homeworld unknown maybe they dont have one ship born ship bound langue unknown all contacts made with interlingue trade in plants and plant derivatives whatever known as poisoners trade a lot with university yes i remember that time when aslan wanted to interview some of them hmp no outsiders on the ship no crew even talking to outsiders not likely daddy chose that one for his little girl hm if the third ship blows out on me maybe id better reconsider those shuttles ship the vouist interesting theres a noteconverted trooper rummul empire like swardas slancy orza though id wager she doesnt have anything like orzas drives she shook her head youd think id keep my mind on business stop rambling shadow rummul empire trooper ownerpitroc another note cover name real name harmon sar first sapato now harmon arms dealers i have known hm he dropped a cargo in one of the warehouses it was picked up three days later by a chandava merchanter definitely old home week note doesnt say what the cargo was but are we really baffled and the answer is no i think this is it shadow old girl arms dealers have tight mouths and like to do favors for people in power head of security here he has to know whats shifting through those warehouses and harmon looks such a twerp daddy would think his kid would be safe and maybe hed be right i havent a clue about harmons little pleasures she sat tapping the fingers of her right hand on the stack of papers sipping at the tea and staring at the three locks on her doorlocks about as useful as a piece of string if the right people wanted to go through them after a minute of that she got to her feet and started pacing about the room seemed likely the jorrat freak left more than the printouts she could hunt for the pickups get the room sweep from the trick kit which shed stashed up in the attic gods be blessed that would have blown her cover for sure hah talk about blowing cover kit aside just doing a sweep and cleaning out the bugs figure out a way to use them everything i do everything i say here will be picked up by some watcher clothes no problem shed bought them for the role the medkit have to take that too much of me in it the harp no way im leaving that behind have to figure something digbys toolkit have to collect that stinking grinder but at least hes not official hm daddy dear the muck policeman does he have his thumb planted on tank too gods that would be a mess for sure ol tank cringing to all comers ah spla ive definitely got to get out of here use the bugs well have ourselves a little drama here act i scene the spy is working hard but frustrated because she isnt getting anywhere she stops her pacing sits at the table shadith pulled the chair out settled herself and once again began leafing through the printouts frowning at them looking up at intervals to scowl at the door she used the time to think over her conclusions and ended more convinced than ever that lylunda elang had left hutsarte on harmons ship hope thats long enough to bore the hair off whoevers watching act i scene the spy vents her frustration on the folder announces shes bored with this and is going to take a break she slapped the folder shut tossed it onto the bed rubbed her eyes tilted the pot over the mug for the last bitter drops of roomtemperature tea sar enough for today bring i think ill rent me one of the tinkermans flits and go write me another song unless its raining she pushed away from the table and went to the window the clouds were high and scattered it might rain after dark but probably not until then time i had some luck harp wheres my harp ah there my bag spla my hands are mucky better wash first hm change my clothes its cooler out on the water twenty minutes later she stuffed the folder into her ybag and reached for the door latch act i scene exit one spy eh shadow you look like the world treating you good where you off to eh getto taking a flit out for a sail want to come different strokes shadow me i get seasick if i even look at water gonna make another song want to might they come when they come you know she fluttered her fingers at him and went on her way act ii scene the spy walks down the street greeting everyone she knows and spreading her story about hoping shes soothing the jitters of the little worm whos tailing her she stopped in at caras cook shop two of your meat pies hm cara my love wrap them up tight and throw in a couple of napkins im going for a sail in a flit and the tinkerman gets snarky about stains the older woman shook her head youve blown a circuit shadow anyone whod go voluntarily out over that stinking soupmix she clicked her tongue then went to work wrapping up the pies act iii scene shadith chanted to the wind as she took the flit in a sweeping curve across the water the spy has fooled them all and says an unfond farewell to haundi zurgile the chief city of the colony world hutsarte and grinder jiraba can go suck eggs as she tonic the flit low and finished the curve she saw that shed celebrated a bit too soon there was a dark speck over near the horizon almost out of sight stinking grinder doesnt trust anyone lets see might as well open up my pies and have my meal while im thinking this over hm wonder if i can get him so bored watching me play around doing nothing i can catch him on the hop when i take off she chuckled act iii scene the spy has her dinner and leads the tail round in circles when she finished eating she sent the flit skimming across the whitetops the lift effect churning the water into cream beneath her it was dangerous and she was riding her luck hard but it kept the watcher dithering in the distance especially since she was careful to keep circling back toward the shore so he wouldnt have to worry that she was stupid enough to try escaping to the wild half and while she played out that scene she programmed a course into the autopilot getting ready for the time when she had to ditch the flit after half an hour of skittering about like a waterbug with the fidgets she went up to a safer height set the autop on hoverdrift and let the wind blow her toward the string of islands she put her feet up stretched out and began to sing fragments phrases repeating them over and over with enough changes to suggest she was trying to weave them into a song should the watcher have a sound pickup aimed at her when she reached the first island a rocky dot that barely broke the surface she sat up and began dancing the flit around and between the islands half the time the tail was out of sight completely to her intense satisfaction he didnt seem to mind and didnt try to get closer she flew faster swinging up into sight dipping low again she circled the big island then took the flit skimming low over the place where the metal mass had registered on digbys detec lylunda had set a camou cloth over her ship and the vegetation had helped her conceal it a tangle of vines crawling across the porous cloth the broken trees and withered foliage swallowed in the damp fecundity of these latitudes without the evidence from a powerful detec no one would know that anything nested there she turned the flit in a tight circle brought it down and set it on hoverpause the programmed course to kick in after seven minutes she lowered the harp and digbys trick kit then dropped overside herself using the cutting rod from the kit she sliced through the camou cloth and let herself down beside the shrouded ship wrapping herself in a mind spray of donttouchme to keep the bugs off while she worked her way along the ships side until she reached the area below the lock she crouched beside the ship sheltering under the curve of the hull when she heard the ascending whine as the flit revved up and took off act iii scene the spy tries the old decoy trick gods i hope this works i need time to pry open this can act iv scene shadith chanted as the lock slid open digby does it again the spy enters the smugglers ship huh enough of that its getting stupid now she moved cautiously inside and started for the bridge i do hope you were counting on concealment and your folks loathing for these waters and planning for a hot jump if the kliu were chasing you after what happened at the market were i you thats how id leave things mmmm she settled herself in the pilots chair and inspected the controls well youre old but she keeps you up well new kephalos i see out of the hegger combine looks like ah yes i know your kind lets see what the sequencer gives us she whistled breathily through her teeth as she peeled the interface and clicked home the jacks youre a clever child lylunda but rather conventional i think this shouldnt take long meantime im going to have a look through your ship dont expect youll be leaving notes to yourself in your writing desk like that idiot jockpilot autumn rose told me about but maybe theres something you forgot it was a compact little ship swelling around the belly like a proper smuggler should plenty of hold space with cells for handling tricky items and a mazy confusion of interior walls which was probably meant to conceal abditories used for really hot cargo nothing there that she could see only the ghosts of old scents the single cabin was tidy and tucked up clothing stowed in a narrow closet and a few shallow drawers the foldaway cot made up with clean sheets the only extravagance was a flake player with hundreds of selections ready to go at a touch when she glanced through the index shadith was astonished and flattered to find her own recording there something shed made as the final exam for one of her courses itd gone into universitys library collection and had brought her a few small but much appreciated royalty payments well now if i needed an incentive she laughed anyone with such excellent taste should never be thrown to the execrable kliu still chuckling she went back to the bridge to find that the sequencer had done its job brought the controls alive and gotten the kephalos ready for work she buttoned up the interface and settled into the pilots chair read new id code she watched the string flash across the screen smooth coming through clear and intact read status of code good show me control configurations and heres where it starts to be work ive got to know your jigs and jags before i dare take you splitting which reminds me i dont know your name yet well that little frill comes later focus shadow focus you need to know this stuff the sea was buzzing with flits when she took lylundas dragoi up through the camou cloth and went running for the line where the atmosphere officially ended the point where dirt law supposedly ceased to rule of course all that generally meant was that whoever was chasing you was free to nail you without going through the timewasting formality of a trial someone in the flits had acquired launchers and the missiles that fed them but one of dragois neater tricks was an ability to shield herself while projecting an image off to one side so the shooter blew a hole in the air but did the ship no damage at all and by the time he discovered this shadith was long gone bound on bol mutair lylunda blinked the sudden brightness made her eyes wafer she closed them againand grew aware of the nearly intangible vibration humming through her bones cabin ship in the insplit going who knew where for a moment she didnt question this then the oddity of it struck her and she jerked upright on the cot swiveling around as she came up her legs sliding over the edge she knew it was a mistake before her feet hit the floor she lunged across the narrow cabin slapped blindly at the sensor node and got her head into the fresher just in time to heave up a bitter yellow liquid which was all she had in her stomach after wiping her face with a damp towelette she stumbled back to the cot and sat with her eyes closed trying to think around the knives that ground into her temples she hadnt expected her father to use a stunner on her shed thought vaguely about confinement maybe hed send her off to one of his arranxes in the back country and it wasnt just a stun ive been out too long dear dear daddy i wonder what he used on me she tried to convince herself that her father had meant it when he said that he wanted to take care of her keep her safe but she had a sick feeling that he was just flushing a problem down the drain that she was a scandal he couldnt afford when the ezkop garap was hunting sinners to fine and chastise and even the duk would have to face symbolic whip cuts for the edification of the lesser behilarr he was right about one thing though him being who he was it wouldnt have been safe for her to go back to the warren grinderd play with me a while then dump me in the jotun to poison the fish i shouldnt have gone back to hutsarte home what was i thinking of i could wait to get away the first time and im never going near the place again her eyes burned wet oozed from under her eyelids she tried to swallow but a lump closed up her throat i wont she said aloud she didnt care who heard her i wont the word ended on a sob and she was crying as she had not cried when her mothers body trundled into the crematorium before there was the chance that her father would be proud of her and claim her not much of a chance but not impossible before there was home as a refuge she could always return to if things go too complicated in the larger world she lived in now and before there was always the dream of making it so big she could go home in a sunclass yacht dressed in diamonds with a train of servants so long the line would wrap round the outside of the izar wall and the high would court her even the duk and the dukana and she would snub them and hand out largess to folk like halfman ike and melia the standup whore a silly childs dreams but shed never quite let go of them she tasted the salt of her tears as they slid past her smile into her mouthand with that the crying fit was over she coughed to clear her throat wiped her eyes i stink she said to the ambient air then drop those rags youre wearing into the disposal and take a bath if youll check the stowage youll find weve put more suitable clothing in there for you the voice came from the announcer grill an inconspicuous circle of roughness above the door a womans voice speaking interlingue with an odd swing to the words lylunda couldnt place and when youre ready the voice continued come to the bridge the doors not locked youre free to move about as you want the ship was larger than hers and newer i forgot about my ship she thought looks like will be going back after all she smiled at a sudden picture in her mind swooping low over the dukeri house and the high city and giving the bons there the scare of their stinking lives grow up woman she told herself but she was still grinning as she stepped onto the bridge a man sat in the pilots seat not a woman age hung like an aura about him and looked out of eyes like winter ice though his ananiles were still holding so there was little gray in the thick braid that came over his shoulder and was long enough to brush at his belt the lines in his face were shallow and fine as if someone had pasted a spiders web across it two young women sat in the other chairs his daughters or granddaughters if appearance meant anything so she said i been sold to contract when he spoke his voice was rough but not unpleasant and there was that same swing to his interlingue that shed heard in the womans voice we would not consider such a thing lylunda elang it is a simpler task we have and a pleasurable pile of gelders from the doing you will be tucked away safely in a calm and quiet place and when i say tucked away it means that however cleverly you scheme there you will be until the patron comes to take you home again and fetch you home he will he sends to you his sworn word on this he put stress on the last words but his eyes slipped away from hers kak ah yes you will be knowing him better than we our ship is yours to wander as you will but lest you harbor wishful thoughts of taking it from us you should know we are jilitera all things on board shut down after a time unless we whisper to them in the secret tongue which is more than words consider what it means to drift in darkness for eternity i have heard that she said tell me the name of my prison bol mutiar only the jilitera trade there these days because it is death to outsiders who do not understand its ways we will tell you how to go and we will put our blessing on you unless you are irredeemably moronic you will have a pleasant life ahead of you you will eat some tung akar every day she read and sighed as she looked at the knobby dark yellow tuber with its beard of fine white rootlets you look about as appetizing as a dog turd maybe if i think its like taking vitamin supplements you will bless and treat with courtesy the children of tung akar sounds reasonable bless hope they give me the local version of that ive run into a few occasions when my idea of a friendly greeting nearly got me handed my head the blessing is smarada diam love and peace it works best if you evoke some shadow of these things within yourself this is for formal occasions when meeting and greeting folk you have not met before a simple diam is sufficient with those you have met more than once do not concern yourself overmuch with pronunciation exactitude is not required lylunda settled back in her chair and watched the figures moving through assorted greeting scenarios she didnt understand the words yet hadnt gone under the crown to get the pandai poured into her head but it seemed a simple and mellifluous langue one that rolled easily off the tongue she examined the figures of the locals with considerably more interest than she took in the greetings they were a smooth brown people built low to the ground broad in shoulder and hip eee ill fit right in she wriggled in the chair sighed except for the hair if that sample isnt skewed its mostly light brown with a redhead in the mix now and again the figures marched off and a new maxim slid onto the screen never take a plant or another living thing for your food or for any other purpose without asking its permission and thanking it afterward like the greeting this is a part of necessary courtesy ignoring these strictures will not get you slapped it will get you dead lylunda made a face at the images that followed bloated rotblackened corpses this was the third time theyd run the lesson flake for her and those corpses appeared after every four maxims along with the stats now scrolling down half the screen telling her who the dead had been and how theyd gotten that way it was meant to impress on the viewer how seriously she should take those maxims but even a litany of the horribly dead could get boring if you heard it too often when the lesson reached its end this time the screen went black and beradeas voice broke into the silence come to the comroom lylunda njai its time you learned the pandai langue the jilitera locked lylunda in her cabin before they left the insplit and left her there until the ship was in a stable orbit the journey to bol mutiar had been shorter than shed expected though shed been unconscious for part of it it couldnt have been much more than eight days splitting which meant they were still within the pseudo cluster just a hop from hutsarte and perhaps even closer to the nameless heavy world where shed landed prangarris and his stolen arrays which was a rather unfunny joke on her when she thought about it there was another word that haunted her why so many whys why were the jilitera treating her so well why were they teaching her all this she knew free traders and how fiercely they protected their markets shed heard stories about the jilitera who were the most secretive of them all what she was learning was inside information something traders never sold or told daddy dear she thought no doubt he paid them well hes not stupid but he has to have some hold on them he has to know something so bad theyll do anything rather than let it come out jaink its only a guess but what else explains this lylunda njai will you come to the bridge please it is time that we blessed you the smoke that hung thick and greasy in the unmoving air caught her in the throat and she coughed as she stepped through the door there was a wide shallow brdzier in the center of the floor wood reduced to coals filling it the red of the coals muted under gray ash a layer of resin crystals was spread over them these were subliming into the air spreading a heavy sweet perfume beradea and merekea knelt beside the brazier stripped to the skin their bodies covered with lines and whorls of thick paint black and white mostly but with dots of crimson and amber ordonai the pilotowner stood on the far side of the brazier stripped also painted white from hairline to heels with fmgerdrawn designs laid on the white in a glistening wet black that kept its sheen after it dried he beckoned her forward then flicked his hand up palm out to stop her when shed come far enough eschewat ched doo ayal he chanted desu telab desu telab she stood erect and very still fascinated because she knew she was hearing the secret tongue of the jilitera at least that part which she could perceive and frightened because she shouldnt be seeing this or hearing that not that she could understand a word of what was being said dabuxoo devoo he chanted and held out a hand beredea put a shallow bowl in it a bowl filled with a viscid golden fluid lylundas eyes blurred and she started getting dizzy she concentrated on keeping her eyes open and her body still disrupting this ceremony didnt seem like a very good idea degoo watuhbey he held out his other hand merekea dribbled a coarse meal into it until the curve of his palm was filled da oocid al di sec he brought his hands around in front of them held them into the incense rising from the brazier then let the meal trickle into the fluid lerxuadid he mixed them together with his forefinger ki ti ada merekea and beradea rose with a disturbing sinuous grace for an instant lylunda saw them as twin serpents the paint marks converted to scales they each took one of her arms and led her around the brazier until she was standing before ordonai he chanted something else but this time she couldnt separate the sounds from the pounding in her ears at the same time he dipped his fingers into the bowl scooping up a mixture of liquid and meal still chanting he smeared the thick sticky mess across her brow down her cheeks then thrust his finger into her mouth and put another dollop on her tongue she concentrated grimly on keeping the contents of her stomach where they belonged the womens hands tightened on her arms and ordonai slapped her lightly on the right ear then the left then shouted a great word at her it was as if he blew out the lights when his breath touched her face when she woke she was stretched out on a patch of grass staring into a clear blue sky huh she got to her feet and touched her face someone had washed her clean the honey mixture was gone the memory of ordonais finger in her mouth hovered queasily for a moment then she pushed it aside and looked around on her right the land sloped steeply down to a narrow white sand beach and beyond the beach blue sea glittered unhindered to the horizon a short distance off to her left she saw a wide path paved with white shells that glittered in the brilliant yellow sunlight she looked down she was wearing a clean shipsuit and at her feet was a wellstuffed backpack and a small square envelope was pinned to the pack when she opened it she snorted a message from her father lylunda elang i wont ask for your forgiveness only your understanding i could not protect you here i will have trouble in these next weeks protecting myself from those who would be delighted to use you to get at me i have spent on you what i kept for my own safety i have never forgotten your mother nor how it felt when she put you in my arms if hutsartg were a different place or i were a different man a zuz theres no point in that whatever happens to me have made arrangements to free you from your exile if at the end of four years you still wish to leave you will find all your gear in the pack including your credit chip dont try bribing a free trader to take you offworld the only traders who land there are the jilitera and they would be more likely to kill you than offer you any help be patient daughter and stay alive she turned the letter over but there was no signature nothing to point to him and the glyphs were carefully drawn all character erased from them youre a cautious man father she said and began tearing the paper into small pieces listening to the ripping sounds with a fierce satisfaction when she was finished though she remembered the strictures and stuffed the peasized bits into a pocket of the backpack then checked the ground to make sure none of them had blown away no point in standing around here any longer she lifted the backpack got her arms through the shoulder straps settled it in place then crossed the strip of grass and started walking along the path the shells crunching under her boot soles lylunda elang who was once a happily busy smuggler with her own ship free to go wherever she took a notion and who is now a beachcomber exile on a backwater world sits in her handcarved chair at her handmade table and prepares to eat her daily ration of tung akar lylunda wrinkled her nose at the thin yellow slices of tuber laid out on the shell someone was using as a plate which begging your pardon mighty tung tastes like mildewed cardboard the pandai in the village had cleared out this house for her and furnished it with bits and pieces from all their houses she didnt ask to whom it had belonged before or what had happened to them and the villagers didnt say the adults brought her fruits and berries and fish theyd cooked for her and the children took turns teaching her how to survive here and provide for herself friendly people the pandai she ate one of the slices swallowed hastily and dipped up water from the bowl in the center of the table to wash the taste from her mouth seruchel says in a few days ill like the taste dont know if i believe her dont know if i want to believe her thats what someone told me about pelar and i suppose i was close to getting addicted to the stuff she ate another slice and reached for the gourd dipper water wasnt a problem here there was an artesian spring on the side of the mountain that rose like an enlarged pimple in the center of this island the pandai had built a system of covered flumes that carried water to the cisterns in all the houses the overflow dumping into a pond in the round open space at the center of the villagethe belau they called it the navel of the worldwhere the locals kept pet goldfish five of them each one longer than her forearm and supposedly as old as the island itself shed been introduced to them siochel blibur chadil lodes and nagarak rough translation precious goldie seaflower coin and halfmoon with the pandai watching all smiles and expectation she put her hand into the water and one by one they came rubbing their mouth barbels against her palm tickling her then they circled round her arm brushing against it as if they were some form of aquatic cats rather pleased with the memory she washed down the third slice ba da if something lifted these pandai from here and dumped them in the izar theyd get eaten alive when she was nearly finished with her breakfast eating the bowl of berries savoring their dark tart sweet flavor she heard the finkfink as someone shook the shell string on the front door who she called seruchel you ready diam sera come back to the kitchen im just finishing up seruchel was a light brown child with a dusting of darker brown dots across the top of her cheeks and a wide mouth that was always twitching into happy grins when she came into the kitchen she had a length of cloth draped across her arm a green and brown batik print a pattern of leaves and vines diam luna mam said you shouldnt be wearing out your mekull clothes and besides they look so uncomfortable and so hot she said i should show you how to do the twist at the top and pin it tight if you want fitting the mezus see she dropped the cloth over the back of the chair and twirled in a quick circle to show lylunda how the cloth was wound around her body covering her from just under the armpits to her knees the top tucked over and pinned in place with a pair of shiny threeinch thorns omel oma ill try it you wait here and ill see how well i manage and by the way tell your mam thanks i appreciate this though at first lylunda felt as if the mezu would unwind and drop off every time she took a breath she found it comfortable and cool with a little care she could bend in it kneel get to her feet without offering more of herself to passing eyes than shed feel comfortable showing there luna you see that greel hole there which one i see lots of holes but theyre all different cant you tell seruchel took a step to one side used her big toe to point out the hole she was talking about its not round like most of the others and the long side goes with the waterline not against it the eccentricity wasnt great but obvious enough once it was pointed out and the long side was indeed parallel to the foam line of the outgoing tide i think i see its like that one about a step farther along isnt it uhhuh thats another greel hole all right so watch me seruchel drove the point of her digging stick into the sand smarada diam greel this is a lessoning well not be taking you today she gave the stick a twist then shoved the end down with considerable force the sand flew and a dark scuttly thing with far too many legs went hurrying off thats a greel you usually have a scoop to catch him with and a basket to carry him cause you dont want to touch him till hes boiled in kebui water hes got this goo on him thatll take your skin off but mmmmmm hes good when hes cooked right shadith watched the scuttler vanish in a spray of sand and water the last bit of it visible was a long narrow chela tamping the sand into the elongated breathing hole she decided shed rather not know what her food looked like when it was running about some of the things shed eaten in cafйs at pit stops she shuddered as she trudged after seruchel seruchel waded into the water beside a tumble of rocks squatted and felt about among the sea grass that grew like hair in sheltered areas like this luna come see what is it sem a nice new clump of tiauch the ones closest to shore are too young still for taking but they dont have the sharp edges either she parted the grass and used her body to create a patch of stillness so lylunda could look through the water at some purseshaped grayish lumps that seemed to grow from the stone when you gather tiauch you push a flat lever against the muscle down at the base and work it under until the tiauch comes free then you drop it in a jug of seawater to keep it fresh the older ones taste the best and sometimes they have pearls in them we use them to trade one old tiauch i saw when i was a kid had five pearls of course it was black and ugly and almost dead she waved the grass back around the tiauch bed jumped to her feet waited impatiently for lylunda to stand then went trotting on down the beach pointing out things that a newcomer should know about oooh you bringing luck luna the girl ran a few steps then squatted beside a patch of sand slightly darker than the rest if you looked at it right there was a faint iridescent shimmer to the grains telilu im sure of it luna i dont want to lose the place would you wait here and dont move ive got to go get mam lylunda watched seruchel go running off along the beach then she frowned down at that irregular stain or whatever it was why do you rev up so much excitement hm the patch remained enigmatic so she looked out across the ocean this world was like something youd see in a happy dream a blue blue sapphire blue sky with a few shreds of cloud near the horizon an intensely blue ocean shading to emerald as it neared the shore small choppy waves with caps of white foam wind clean and crisp against her skin filled with sea smells and just cool enough to feel pleasant as the morning heated up a white sand beach curved away on both sides interrupted by black outcrops of obsidian or red brown boulders clumps of tall trees with curved trunks flexed to the push of the wind the fronds that grew thickly at the apex of each curve rustling loudly as if they spoke to each other you are beautiful she said and it seemed to her the trees bowed to her and whispered their thanks yai whiny in the head already she was getting very bored with the scene by the time seruchel came running back the girl stopped beside her glanced down at the discolored patch and let out her breath with a popping sound um luna do you mind mam says just smelling telilu might be dangerous seeing youre not part of the tung bond yet so she says you better go back to the house she looked unhappy and tonight you better not come into chiouti with everyone cause telpoisoning is something we cant fix and we dont want you hurt tell your mam no problem lylunda tapped the child on the cheek and left her standing by the patch still looking miserable on the way back to her house she saw seruchels mam outocha along with a number of the village men hurrying toward the beach she waved at them called out the ritual diam and strolled on by heading for the house that night she heard a rhythmic beating and shouts that almost might have been song from the village some party i wish well never mind luna dont go where youre not wanted when she went into chiouti the next morning there was a faint bite to the air it felt like sunburn when it brushed against her skin and it made her stomach cramp people were usually out talking and doing thedays chores by this time but she saw only a few villagers about a woman slouched in a doorway head down hair falling across her face her mezu was pulled about her not twisted and pinned in place and she looked like a bad end to a hard night a naked man was curled up snoring in the shadowed alley between two houses as she walked past him nausea caught her in the throat and the cramps in her stomach turned to stabbing pains she wheeled and ran fromthe village kept running until she splashed into the ocean she swam a while then waded back onshore feeling considerably better and blessing the thoughtfulness of seruchels mam by the end of her first month on bol mutiar lylunda knew how to choose her own tung akarthat when the tubers were too young they gave her the runs and a low fever when they were too old the smell got so bad she couldnt put them in her mouth you could tell the age by the leaves seruchel recited a rhyme for so she could remember what the shapes meant long and narrow stomach harrow five holes too old three in sight just right she didnt have to look far to find the tung as with every other house in the village the western wall of her house the one that was away from the shore had no windows just a thick covering of vines some with flowers some with seed pods that exploded at a touch when they were ripe the harvest area was a semicircular patch that grew at the base of the wall her days were filled with little things digging shellfish for her meals collecting fruits and berries from the common land walking around exploring the island to see what was on the other side and going with the children into the jungle that grew on the sides of the mountain and cutting vines for the retting pond or beating the rotted veins to separate out the fibers rinsing the fibers and spreading them over the mats in the drying sheds on the shore side of the belau the pandai demanded nothing from her but they asked her if shed help and it was something to do to fill the long hours of the day besides she felt better when she was paying her way not depending on the charity of others and they all knew why she was here patting her on the shoulder shaking their heads telling her what a good father shed got wanting to make her safe they were cheerful about it too expecting her to settle in like they had some of us and all of our ancestors come from somewhere else for all sorts of reasons its better here each of the adults made a point of telling her that it takes a while to relax they told her but in a little youll feel the tensions and the armor you ware from the old time peeling away like a snake sheds its skins and is beautiful in its bright new colors they meant well but she didnt want to shed her old habits she wanted to get back to a place where she could practice themespecially her preferred sort of pleasures when it came to getting high or having sex from everything shed seen so far she wasnt going to find many beautiful fur persons to belly dance with her celibacy and sobriety for four stinking years did not appeal there was another thing that did not appeal the lung akar was starting to taste good to her she found herself wanting it at other meals somehow everything tasted better after shed crunched down a few slices of the tuber if she ate too much if she became a part of the tung bond would she be stuck here for the rest of her life she had nightmares about roots corning up out of the floor and wrapping round her growing over her face and into the openings of her body grinder lylunda brought the beating stick down hard on the soggy heap of rotted torech ignoring the spatters it sprayed over her father another blow another spray of stinking green fluid from the vine pile ma another she laughed and straightened using her body like that felt good and shouting the names seemed to blow away some of the anger that simmered in the pit of her stomach behind her she heard an odd creaking then a crash she swung around in time to see a spray of fronds quivering on the ground a short distance up the slope from the beating ground she dropped the stick on the vines and made her way through snaky twists of vines and small brushy trees to the fronds followed the trunk along to the men who were glugging down gourdfuls of biang beer to celebrate the success of their efforts there was a twohanded saw on the ground by their feet and a pair of axes the first metal tools shed seen since the jilitera had landed her here meki gebar whats this huh wood for fires luna in a couple months its going to be rainy season so we need to get green wood dried by then gets coldern you think it would some of those nights and if we want hot meals we get the wood for cooking now even if you think youve seen rain you dont know what real rain is ah she frowned at the fat bottom of the tree an idea churning at the back of her head you think you could cut me a round off that say about as long as my forearm sure why not were going to be cutting it up anyway when she finished beating out and washing the torech fibers she carried them into chiouti spread them out on the drying mats then went back for her chunk of wood it was light wood with a papery texture as she rolled it down the mountain and around to her house she told herself it was still green and would harden up as it dried she set the chunk of tree on her kitchen table and gazed at it while she ate the supper one of the women had made for her there was no music on this world at least not on this island shed seen birdlike things flying about but shed never heard them make a sound when seruchel taught her the leaf rhyme she didnt sing it didnt even chant it nobody whistled here none of the pandai sang while they worked they were cheerful friendly people they worked though not hard enough to keep themselves in comfort they carved every surface they could set a knife to they made bright colored dyes for the cloth they wove but shed never seen them dance and shed never heard them sing the food was dust on her tongue and the craving for tong akar was like a fire in her but she fought it off and continued to stare at the trunk smarada diam log youll be a drum some day when im finished with you and someday ill dance to your sound for the next month she labored over the piece of stump hollowing it out chip by chip she had to be very careful because the grain was so straight the texture so soft she could break the round she was trying to create with the slightest extra pressure or a careless cut with the knife a chisel or a gouge would have been better but the knife was the only tool she owned her father had carefully removed her weapons before he returned her belongings perhaps he was afraid shed commit suicide with them but knew shed need the knife or maybe it was the jilitera whod purged her pack it didnt really matter as the hole through the middle grew larger and larger she had to work to restrain her impatience she wanted to dance she needed to dance even more than she was coming to need the tung akar since she was born shed been immersed in music of one sort or another her mother was a singer and had clapped hands for her when she was a baby and sung songs for her to dance to when she was older on her ship she had a library of recordings she played constantly so she lived in sound like a fish in water only marginally aware of it most of the time yet needing it for her souls health seruchel climbed onto the black lava outcropping where lylunda was sitting and crouched beside her watching her hands as she chipped away at the interior of the log section diam luna what you making diam seru im hoping itll be a drum lylunda brushed chips of wood from her mezu watched them splash into the sea water lapping gently at the base of the rock oh i know drums we dont make them but the berotong pandai have some berotong pandai mmhm canoe people they come by two three times a year seruchel wrinkled her nose weird folk they make me feel itchy when i think about them theyre pandai like us but theyre unh different how different she turned the log a few degrees and began working on a new section tucking away the shudder in seruchels voice to think about later omel oma seruchel tapped a short stubby finger against her knee as if she were counting the ways of weird they live on those berontas all the time theyre biiiig like theyre two sometimes three boats with a floor built across them and house on that floor they brag they go all the way round the world each trip ive never seen the same ones twice so maybe thats true we trade stuff with them like for axes and knives and needles and stuff like that they get them from the starmen they say and maybe thats true also because pandaidont work metal and they have drums they beat on them to let us know theyre coming so we can bring out our trade do they chorous whats chorous lylunda stilled her hands and stared at the girl startled the language didnt have a word for dance shed used the interlingue without thinking about it she must have been doing that all along when she thought about the drum and dancing moving to mousika ah you dont have a word for that either ill show you lylunda carried the knife and the log to the end of the outcropping set them down out of the reach of the wind and jumped to the sand stay up there and watch seru and listen she moved a few steps until she was standing on sand that was damp enough not to drag at her feet for a moment she stood with eyes closed clapping her hands to catch the rhythm she wanted then she began one of the stamping swaying dances shed learned from the tiker worlds a childs version of the voor tikeri she wasnt a good whistler but she did manage to improvise a few trills to the clicking of her thumbs and fingers when her mouth went dry she stopped and walked back to the lava outcrop thats chorous and a bad attempt at mousika ser she broke off the girls eyes were glazed and she was staring out across the water it was obviousand disturbingthat she hadnt seen or heard any of lylundas performance never mind she said best i suppose that we just forget it come on teach me how to find more tiauch ive got a want in my mouth for tiauch stew when lylunda had the inside and outside of the wooden ring rubbed smooth she passed her hands over it smiling with pleasure in her work then she set it aside and went looking for waxberries and chedik vines the pandai used the berries to make candles for their scraped shell lamps and mixed with chemidik they made good polish for furniture and the inside walls of their houses since that mix kept insects away from the wood chemidik came from sap milked from chedik vines and cooked over a slow fire for several days lylunda was getting more than a little tired of things like that every time you wanted something it took days maybe even months and lots of planning if you wanted a new mezu you had to go cut enough pieces of torech vine to fill up the retting pond and wait till the fibers rotted clear of the rest then you had to beat the fibers get them spun into thread then the length of cloth woven on a loom then you had to dye the cloth either a solid color or spend yet more time with the tedious process of batiking to get a pattern dyed into the cloth to set the colors so they wouldnt wash out or fade you had to steep the cloth in mix of cold water and oma which you made by macerating a fungus that grew from the roots of lalou trees everything was like that the pandai shared the jobs but they were always working with an eye on the months ahead getting things ready so they would be there when they were needed to get other things ready it wasnt hard work or even unpleasant it was just so damn constant when she first walked up that white sand path that ran along the beach she thought with despair how am i ever going to get through the days what will i do she shook her head idiot thats what i was the more she had to do for herself the more she wanted additional hours in the day to give her time to get it done lylunda stroked her fingertips down the smooth wood after the waxing it had a lovely golden brown glow i need something for a drum head which could be a problem they dont do leather and the cloth they weave is too coarse too soft no snap to it maybe i should wait until the barotongs come drifting by she shivered and maybe not if i cut up the gearsac its got some bounce anyway borrow a needle from outocha and hem it so the cord doesnt pull through im not going anywhere i wish i knew what i was doing the drum looked good when she was finished with its matte black heads its greenish cord and the golden wood she reached toward it drew her hand back not yet it has to be special moonlight yes ill take it to the beach ill play my drum in the moonlight the sky was clear of clouds filled with the brilliant glitter of the closely packed stars of pseudo cluster enough light to turn the beach into an abstract painting in black and white the two moons were already high the outer one a hairline crescent the nearer several hours behind it in its gibbous phase she stood her feet cold on the damp sand but not so cold as she was inside as she realized just how long shed spent working on the drum days had sneaked away on her weeks no more at least a month and a half what else had she lost she climbed onto the lava outcrop and walked slowly to the pillow humps at its tip working her tongue in her mouth seeking to taste how much tung akar shed eaten without being aware of what she was doing she couldnt of course and it was a silly thing to try but she had to do something to push back the billows of panic that kept trying to drown her she settled herself on the cold stone with the drum between her knees closed her eyes and tried to call up music she knew let it flow through her body it was hard as if she were being pushed away when she could finally feel a simple beat she set her fingers on the drum head and began to tap it out the sound was thin dull there was no resonance it wasnt music it wasnt even noise she could barely hear the sound above the siss siss of the waves maybe its me she thought i dont know how to make it talk to me she closed her eyes and struggled to remember what shed seen drummers do but the memories were faint as faded watercolors and they kept slipping away for her aahhhhh she screamed and flung the drum away from her then sat with her head resting on her crossed arms her body heaving as she sobbed out her frustration fear and grief lylunda lifted her head as the shell string by the front door clattered and clanked she sighed and snuggled into her covers closed her eyes and tried to drift back into the dream shed been having it wasnt a pleasant dream but it was better than being awake a hand closed on her shoulder someone shook her she pried her eyes open seruchel bending over her the smiles fled from her mouth luna luna get up please dim seru she mumbled go way seruchel shook her some more but lylunda closed her eyes tightly and ignored the child until seru gave up and left then her mind started going round and round about her father his promise to come get her how much she didnt believe that the addiction to the tung akar her horrified suspicion that if she completed the tung bond and he did come she couldnt leave without the tung killing her she tried not to think of that but the notion sat like a dark fungus in her mind jojing doors without locks everybody and his dog can walk in muttering obscenities under her breath she crawled out of bed and stumbled into the kitchen vomited into the sink an acrid yellow fluid that she washed away before it made her sick again she splashed water onto her face stood leaning against the counter her body shaking her knees threatening to fold under her whats happening to me im acting like i was three years old and sulking because ma took my candy away im not like this no youre not diam luna lylunda eased herself around scowled at outocha seru ran to get you didnt she so i dont want to be here we know sometimes luna when you fight what is you only hurt yourself if you could just accept us youd have a good life here turn pandai lylunda pushed away from the sink made it to the table and lowered herself into one of the chairs sit if you will outocha thank you the pandai woman arranged herself in the chair across the table from lylunda reached out and touched her wrist lightly then drew her hand back yes as our elders did is our life so bad luna its a good life for those who like it but for me itd be like cutting off an arm and a leg id have to be someone else not me and id lose my mousika she watched outochas eyes go blank you dont have a word for it you cant even think about it i want my life back outocha you wont have any kind of life if you keep on the way youve been the older woman reached out again wrapped her hands around lylundas wrists her thumbs pressed on the big veins there was electricity in her touch then a sense of drawing out as if she pulled strength from lylunda to augment her own she closed her eyes the vertical line deepening between her sunbleached brows when her voice came it had a distant hollow sound it is difficult sometimes to remember my mother told me of of a way to slow the closing of the bondshe got the last words out in a rush squeezed her eyes more tightly shut a tea yes an infusion of ahhhh of cherar leaves there was a long pause when outocha spoke again lylunda had to strain to hear the faint whisper it is dangerous if you get the wrong leaves gather them at the wrong time try to store them cherar will kill you you must pick the pale green leaves without the red veins theyre the youngest and the only ones its safe to use and you have to gather them when its light enough to see but before the sun has cleared the worlds edge no more than twelve leaves you must take a bowl with you and a pestle and mash the leaves into a paste as soon as youve gathered the twelve you bring the paste home soak it in cold water not hot water never hot water when the water turns a dark bluegreen you strain it through cloth into a bottle with a wax stopper you drink two fingers of the liquid a day until it is gone then you gather more her eyes went blank again her hands left lylundas wrists to rest on the table wholly relaxed with the fingers lightly curled lylunda leaned forward tensely will you show me where to find cherar and what it looks like what life came back to outochas face she frowned why for an instant lylunda was as astonished as shed been when seruchel wasnt allowed to be aware of music this was the aspect of the tung bond that terrified her most whatever acted to diminish that bond was counted as enemy and as much as possible not permitted to happen the kindness of the pandai woman could for a moment override this but not for long and thats the joy of the telilu she thought suddenly it lets them remember what the bond has forced them to forget no wonder i thought i heard something like singing oy jaink help me have to get away from this world somehow aloud she said its part of my lessoning isnt it to learn all the plants of the island i mean the bad as well as the good are you feeling well enough to walk a while slow and easy if you dont mind but itll be good for me to get out youre right i cant sleep my days away without getting really sick hope she thought better than a hit of pelar if only she shows me the right plant with the bond pulling her about who knows when she took my hand she could override that maybe thatll work she points out the plant i take her hand and ask if shes sure jojing tung lylunda tilted the cup then straightened it and watched the murky liquid oil back down the sides even after the straining it looked like cheap ink that was beginning to separate its solids from the liquid base two fingers a day i dont know closing her eyes she downed the mess then groped for the water gourd so she could wash the taste from her mouth taste as if something had solidified the stench off a slaughterhouse on a hot steamy summer day her stomach cramped she staggered to the table caughthold of the edge and crabbed around it until she reached one of the chairs she lowered herself onto the sea then she hunched over hugging herself rocking from buttock to buttock the cramps only lasted a few minutes then the churning in her stomach and the pressure against her sphincters gave her just enough warning to let her reach the fresher and get herself seated before everything let go she spent the afternoon swimming in the sunwarmed seawater of the small inlet north of chiouti the sea cradled her and fed energy into her when she reluctantly dragged herself from the water wrapped a spare mezu around her shoulders and started walking back to her house she felt more like herself than she had in weeks she walked through the village greeting folk involved in the continual work of supplying themselves with the necessities of life they smiled and nodded and answered her greetings but it seemed to her that once again they were on the far side of a glass pane and not quite real as ancient museum dioramas were never quite real no matter how much art was expended in their making in an odd sort of way it was comforting a sign that her mornings ordeal was not worthless when she showed up later in the afternoon to do her share of the work in the combing and spinning sheds the women there seemed to have trouble remembering that she was among them though there was the usual laughter and jokes as they passed the hanks of dried fiber about or wound the spun thread onto cones for the looms they werent trying to be unfriendly but the startled looks when they noticed her and their shaky smiles made her uneasy she left the sheds after half an hour and went to sit on the lava pile staring out across the blinding blue of the sea she tossed a fragment of black rock into the water hissing about the foot of the pile i went too far she said purged too much i have to find a balance something that will let me be here but keep my roots shallow enough so i can tear loose without bleeding to death after a while she heard a clunking sound got to her feet and looked down the drum shed spent so much futile effort on was bobbing in the water and bumping against the rocks driftwood of a different sort she lay on her stomach caught hold of the cord that laced the heads on and pulled it up the chemidik wax on the wood had kept water out and the working of the sun and the sea had tightened the heads water had gotten inside but only a little just enough to slosh about when she shook it she settled back on the rock and tapped the head the sound had changed or was it that shed changed it still wasnt loud or like any drum she remembered but it sang to her she closed her eyes and called up the music she and qatifa had danced to it seemed a century ago tump tump ti tump ti tah tump ti tump she played till her fingers were raw and the day darkened toward sunset and the evening breeze came cold off the sea in the days that followed she experimented with the cherar infusion and the slices of tung akar at first alternating them eating the tung one day drinking the infusion the next day then changing the number of the slices and the amount of the liquid until she finally found a balance where the pandai were easy around her but she could still hear the music in the drum the rains came and brought wild storms with them but the bulk of the mountain protected chiouti from the worst of the winds and the only problem the pandai had was bringing in enough food to supplement the dried fish that everyone but lylunda kept in storage jars they passed her around like a party favor each night an invitation to share the evening meal came from another family a call to join in the gossip and play games with thechildren while the adults were absorbed in one of the intricate games they were addicted to small distorted figures pushed about on a painted board at the whims of thin intricately carved sticks cast from a tall cup klekool they called it seruchel had tried to teach her the game but lylunda found it impossible she told herself it was probably something you had to be in the bond to understand the craving for the tung akar came back and she couldnt get up the mountain to fetch more cherar leavesrain rain more rain mud slides trees and thornvines blowing dangerously about broken fronds limbs wheeling on winds that came howling round the mountain she berated herself for not thinking of something so simple as uprooting one of the plants and transplanting it into a pot of some kind one she could keep inside the house but food was around every day and she hadnt given a thought to what day after day of slashing rain might mean when can get up there she thought the moment i can get up there im bringing a plant down maybe itll die on me maybe i cant keep it growing enough to make the new leaves i need but i have to try she fought to limit what she grubbed from the tuber patch but in the intervals when the rain lessened to a heavy mist the smell of the tung blossoms crawled through the windows and tickled at her and shed find herself out there mattock in hand digging tubers the drum sat in a corner of the kitchen collecting cobwebs and dust in the second month of the rains she played her first game of klekool and almost understood the nuances of the moves she was the bangg at the end bangg being a bright colored fish of extraordinary stupidity and ugliness the only reason the species survived is that no onebeast fish bird or pandaiwho ate one bangg ever ate a second the taste of bangg was awful beyond the capacity of human description the family teased her and laughed at her and she plodded home through the rain feeling vaguely pleased with herself by the end of that month the heaviest of the downpour was finished there was still a thundershower almost every day sometimes between noon and midafternoonbut it was possible to go up the mountain again to gather fresh food and cut trees for fuel bringing the chunks to the drying sheds where the fibers had been before lylunda went to gather waxberries for candles she had only one left of those shed made and she needed to begin the long process of giving back all the care that had been taken of her during the rains as she gathered the berries she saw a patch of cherar nestling deep beneath the brambles she felt a sudden strong revulsion as if shed seen a viper in spite of that she stared and stared at the dark succulent leaves with the brilliant red veins she wanted to vomit she was terrified but she remembered why she knew the cherar and she understood that all shed gained before the rains shed lost shed have to start all over again finding a new balance fighting nausea and the runs again fighting the pull of the tung akar the next morning she overslept woke with the sun streaming through the cracks in the shutter onto her face she fought the craving ate a single slice of tung akar and took the basket of berries into the village so she could use the single big boiling pot the village had to boil them and skim the wax then pour it into molds with the wicks shed gotten for her help with the fibers working was hard and hot she had to stir the berries constantly so they wouldnt stick to the bottom and burn but the work helped her forget the clamoring of her body as it demanded more tung akar the big green berries had a sharp pleasant scent and the wax she skimmed was a pale green with a muted version of that scent burning the candles perfumed the house and they also kept away the small bloodsucking insects that were hatching now from every pool where rainwater was sheltered enough to turn stagnant by the end of the day she had two dozen candles she left six for the use of the kettle ladled the basket full of the pulp and took it uphill to spread it on her tung patch it was useful mulch gave nutrients to the soil and it kept saw flies away from the vines all that night she sat at herkitchen table beating on it with a pair of spoons she got no feeling from that sound there was no rhythm beating in her blood but it kept her awake when dawn came she took the bowl and pestle left the house and went up the mountainside when she pushed the waxberry vines aside she could only find seven cherar leaves without the red veins she plucked them carefully mashed them then carried them back down the mountain walking slowly warily the tung was everywhere it knew what she was doing vines reached out to trip her a flitterbat dived at her nearly knocked the bowl from her hand a frond from one of the trees cracked loose and almost crashed down on top of her but she threaded her way through these attacks or what she thought of as attacks her mind and body in a dark knot of suspicion and rage though the infusion was weaker the racking her body went through this time was considerably worse the next morning when she woke the food basket was empty and no one rattled the shell chain by the door she was cut off again isolated when she went out to get fresh tung for her breakfast dose the smell of the flowers nauseated her so much she could barely endure the time it took to dig up a small tuber the smell and taste of the tuber when she got it washed off and sliced was so bad she had to chop it into small bits with her knife because she couldnt force herself to chew it she got it down and spent the next ten minutes hunched over in the chair trying not to vomit when her stomach settled a little she managed to swallow a few berries left over from yesterdays breakfast then she took the drum and went down to the beach to sit on the lava and talk out her problem herself talking to herself because until she was stabilized again no one from the village would see her and they wouldnt understand anyway what she was fussing about she settled with the drum and began tapping out a rhythm relaxing into a fullbody smile as she felt the beat and responded to it a tune came to her and she whistled a snatch of it and it was like cool water across her ears and along her nerves ignoring the short burst of rain that beat on her back and head she drummed until her hands grew tired then leaned on the drum and stared out across the water the rains come twice a year they say and even if i believed that lying letter even if he does send for me itll be four years four years i cant go through this again and again and again each time worse than the last four years no way i dont know maybe i should just give up no itd be like killing myself maybe i should do that and cut out the middle man dead is dead no problems left no i wont give up im not going to let him win or let the stinking kliu off me because thats what itd be them pulling my strings ive got to get away from this world somehow only one way to do that find a free trader and use his splitcom and call someone qatifa maybe all right thats it now the only problem is how she brooded over that for several hours then trudged up the beach and over to her house she left the drum there went to gather food for her supper and breakfast shed be on her own for the next several days until shed gotten the mix right and the pandai would notice her again lylunda drew the pole knife across the torech vine stepped back to let the sticky white sap drip from the cut then finished slicing through the vine and used the hook set into the back of the blade to pull the vine away from the tree trunk twisting it to break loose the tendrils that had knotted themselves into the fibrous bark she grimaced as the black flies that shed dislodged with the vine swarmed about her face and shoulders shed rubbed herself with juice from waxberry leaves but the effect was starting to wear off and the flies were landing and biting the vine rustled away as seruchel and beroos tugged it free of the tangle the two girls would strip off the tendrils and the leaies and wind the length into a coil for emiud to pick up when he came by and carry over to the retting ponds before she started work on the next section of vine lylunda crossed to the water jug and poured herself a cup of water then stood sipping at it and watching as the girls worked with their tiny crescentshaped knives nip nip scrape tug another section in front of them she pushed the hair back from her face the berotong pandai seru should we expect them soon mm hm they usually come around when the time of the big storms is past youve got those pearls you found you should be thinking about trading for a pot me she giggled and poked her elbow into beroos arm im going for stuff i need for my gonnabe family you know needles and a knife and maybe some beads just for me mam says its time to start thinking about gonna bes she says probably next year im a woman and the year after that maybe theres a chebech feast and i go move in with she giggled again blushed a little what you thinking about trading for berry i think those red dyes like aleko got last year i like red and its so hard to get a good bright color red chebech color seruchel dropped her knives and clapped her hands who you gonna go with berry tommas i saw youn him the other night silly serry tisnt just for chebech mezus your own mam puts red in her batiks anyway nothings settled yet lylunda looked at the smiling pink face of the girl shook her head and took up the pole knife again she couldnt be more than fourteen not that ive anything to brag about where i come from what do you call a teenage femme in the izar mother thats what which brings up another thought ive got my implants but who knows what the tung is doing to those anyone around here want to wager that the lung akar doesnt like antifertility drugs she separated out a second vine of the proper diameter cut one end free as high as she could reach and hooked the vine away from the tree pulling with the hook and prying with the blade she unraveled it as far as she could from the rope of smaller vines that looped from tree to tree then cut that section loose when she finished she looked back seruchel and beroos were working over the vines again the knives flying as they cleaned the stem but theyd looped it around so their heads were close together and they were whispering and giggling together a pang of longing and loneliness surprised her she wanted that intimacy again but not here never here back to dangerous hauls and high times in the pits belly dancing with qatifa or another of the partners shed found in the past five years she wanted that so terribly that for a moment her eyes blurred then she shook off the malaise and went back to work cutting the aries and trying to plan her escape from all this the bemtong the canoe pandai they traded with the jilitera maybe with other ships ordonai said only jilitera came here but maybe that was hope more than truth maybe this place is spooky enough to scare off some of the free traders i know but not all of them if theres a reason to be here therell be others maybe the canoe pandai dont tell the jilitera everything maybe odds are good on that if theyre anything like the chioutis if i can convince them to take me along how i have to talk with outocha shes the only one whos tried to help maybe she sighed and moved on to the next rope of vines she worked at cutting vines until her arms were trembling and her joints started aching this was something else that worried her with the tung and the cherar warring inside her she had no stamina at all when i get away when when when let it be when not if when i get back where belong ill spend some of the crystal money on a workover at the nearest meatfarm jaink wont go like my mother wont she was sitting on the lava outcropping singing a sad song to the whispery tump to of the drum when she heard what at first sounded like an echobut an echo louder than the source she sat up and listened her hands on the drumhead toom toom toom came across the water blqwn on the brisk wind that swept the whitecaps off the waves she set her drum aside and jumped to her feet stood staring in the direction of the sound holding her breath in shock and desire as a horn of some kind wove a simple tune about the drumbeats a raft came gliding around the end of the island no not a raft a trimaran with three crescentshaped bows rising dark and elegant from the water a fenced floor built across the middle of the three hulls a large triangular sail on a central mast and a smaller jib cleated to a stay from the tip of the central bow to the top of that mast a pandai in a red mezu stood on the floor in front of one of the structures built on it beating on a broad drum half as tall as he was beside him a smaller figure wrapped in bright gold stood blowing into a huge shell as the beronta came closer the size became more evident it was huge no wonder seruchel said the berotong pandai spent most of their lives on their canoe their beronta she stood shading her eyes and watched it come sliding along the coast moving at a speed that surprised her when it was even with the outcropping it was close enough for her to see children hanging perilously over the railing round the deck waving at her she waved back then snatched up her drum and went running for her house by the time she reached the village half a dozen small boats were tied up at the jetty and the open space was swarming with berotongs and choutis standing in a ring of laughing preening girls a teen boy blushed and smiled and was gradually recovering his poise enough to laugh and answer the girls teases with quips of his own that made them giggle and wiggle into the closest thing lylunda had seen to a dance since shed been here she smiled and eased through the crowd until she was standing next to outocha whos the boy hes from emtoched thats an island about two days west of here all the girls on emtoched are either too young or related to him so hes traveling with the berotong till he can find a girl he likes and a village to settle into and we have several extra girls here do girls travel too sometimes if shes eighteen or more and no ones come by that she likes i see so they do take outsiders on those berontas outocha didnt look at her but as usual she cut through obliquity with the razor of her mind that might be a good idea luna perhaps the berotong life would suit you better than ours you are welcome here but we do want you to be happy lylunda wandered about listening to the gossip from the other islands watching the rituals of trade watching the boy maneuver around local boys his age another sort of courting ritual it couldnt be easy making himself welcome in a new placeeven with the bond to help she walked out to the end of the jetty and stood looking at the beronta wondering what itd be like to live so cramped together for so long her names remeydang soaring house she thought nice and a bit disconcerting she turned her head smiled at the berotong boy pretty name she said how far do you go round the world and round again he had sun spots like seruchel looked a little like her when he grinned me ive only been halfway so far his hand was closed in a loose fist and he was shaking it gently two shells or stones or something similar clicking together inside the fist making a small music names tudil mines luna tudil smarada diam diam the boy said then looked startled when he saw her catch and echo the beat snapping her fingers and swaying her body after a moments thought his face lit up youre the star woman yes the bond she thought and groaned silently i miss mousika huh that oh chelideyr i dont know that word well you wouldnt the land pandai dont have it its only us berotongs who can know what it is and thats because its part of the sea dance tried making a drum its not very good would you like to see ours oh yes id love that would your folks mind why should they its not like youre going to steal the beronta he grinned again slipped his clickers into a pouch on his belt then swung over the side of the jetty into one of the boats tied there so come on down mengar toss the ladder ive brought a visitor one of the oldest pandai that lylunda had seen peered over the rail at them his mouth stretched in a broad grin showing mostly toothless gums star mama hah treat her gentle boy lylunda blinked startled tudil chuckled omel oma luna dont be worried by him ol mengar sniffs all the news in the world from the air that runs past that nose of his he caught the rope ladder as it unrolled down the side of the outer hull can you climb if i hold this steady i can climb better if i do the following she said he giggled shook his head omel oma watch close then he went up the ladder as if he had fingers instead of toes shook his narrow behind at her then was over the rail with an easy kick of his feet she followed more cautiously but found it no more difficult than working an umbilical in an unlicensed fueling station she got over the rail with a bit more decorum than the boy then let the two pandai show her about the ship smiling at their pride but understanding it thoroughly a small ache around her heart because her own ship was so far out of her reach tudil led her to the great drum but he didnt touch it so she didnt either he slid out some pegs and opened the top of a chest took out two much smaller drums closed the top again and pegged it tight we practice on these he said may i you are my guest she turned the drum in her hands tested the weight of it drew her fingers across the single head parchment someone on bol mutiar knew about skins and how to treat them the wood was dark and tight grained hard enough to carve thin she sat on the chest held the drum on her knees and tapped the head the sound was sharp and pure it was joy she closed her eyes and touched it some more testing the different areas of the head using all the hand gestures she could remember then she made a song for herself and tudil with her hands and this giving drum after a minute though she sighed and stilled the sound better than food she said but i dont know how to play it not really tudil was crouched by her feet looking up at her but its there its in you you should come with us not stay with them on land you dont belong there i dont belong here at all she said and sighed as she bent to give him back the drum my father forgot im not a child any more but thats the way he is he thinks he knows better than most people how to run their lives and he has the power so he does it tudil nodded gravely ive seen that he said the bond rejects folk like that after a while anyway and then they die either youre in the bond or you die is that the way it is what about the traders they respect the bond they dont hurt any pandai and they leave in a few days his teeth closed on his lip and his eyes glazed after a minute he said youre fighting the bond trying to be with it but not of it you want to be like them the traders come and go yes traders do you know if there are different kinds of traders or only those who call themselves jilitera tudil looked down he scratched uneasily at a sliver that was separating from the wood of the deck maybe you should talk to menget about that hes the drummer i could ask if you want he sighed you think you cant play but i watched you you know things about the drum i hadnt even thought of i wish youd want to be of us i cant tudil i think the land pandais life is good and yours is even better but not for me its just the way things are id like it if you talked to the drummer about what i asked she got to her feet thank you for showing me your home i think wed best be going back now the drummer came to lylundas house that evening he was a big burly man he wore his coarse brown hair in a thick braid that reached past his waist a large enameled copper amulet covered most of his bare chest and his dark red mezu was narrower than most wrapped about his hips the setfold held in place by a long steel pin with an enameled copper head and a copper point guard when she greeted him he touched his forehead then the amulet smarada diam luna the kitchen is the kindest place to sit theres fruit if you wish and an infusion of iya leaves he sat at the kitchen table and smiled as she brought out a plate heaped with dark purplered berries and slices of golden imekur fruit she filled two mugs with the iya then settled herself across from him what i have is yours she said may it be acceptable it is so he helped himself to the fruit and took the first bite as was custom then spooned down the rest with a gusto that matched his size when he was finished he patted his lips with the napkin shed laid beside the plate and smiled at her you have had a difficult time luna yes and coming here was neither your choice nor your intent yes what do you know of the berotong pandai what the chioutis have told me what tudil said what i saw when i visited your beronta what i heard when the beronta came around the end of the island that you will take young people from where they are excess to where they are needed no more then you know everything and nothing he pushed his mug across the table waited till she refilled it we are of the bond but we live within it in another way than the land pandai do we eat the tung akar when we are on the land but when we are on the sea we do not touch it you might find that more to your hearts liking luna tudil tells me you have a gift for the chelideyr but no teaching tudil is young i have a deep need for chelideyr but no gift its just that ive listened more widely than he has and known more drummers i was remembering not creating i do know the difference ah i see he lifted the mug and drank his eyes fixed on the window open above the sink she could see he was thinking something out and she understood what it was when he spoke again the jilitera have been forbidden to take you away or let you call for help he said so you want to know if there are other traders who come here you have it youve been here almost half a year do you understand that even with the cherar you drink and the purging youve forced on yourself it is not likely you can live away from the tung akar i dont know that though im afraid thats how itd go she sighed i have resources if i can reach my friends with enough coin you can buy almost anything she held up her hand to stop his objection out where i come from i mean why would you want to go back to that because it is my life not something imposed on me its something ive reached out and taken for myself do you understand yes it is my duty and my pleasure to take you with us on the beronta remeydang to the place where we meet the trader tangavik you will need patience starborn it will be another half year before we reach the landing place he comes every third year slipping down under the jiliteras noses and this year is one of those i read that as an omen and a command three days later lylunda hugged seruchel touched cheeks with outocha then climbed into the small boat and let tudil row her out to the beronta remeydang three hours later she stood at the back rail out of the way of those working the ship and watched the island chiouti slip slowly over the horizon worm wriggles faster the harman be blessed at least its stopped raining worm patted at is head with the towel hed set beside the eyescreen even with the sun close to setting the air inside the room was so steamy he was worried for his equipment hed moved the table close to the window so he could shut it once the eye was outside and the conditioner unit was struggling to wring out some of the heat and damp but sweat kept rolling from his hair into his eyes making them burn and blurring his vision he was following the target home a last time making sure the afternoon deluge hadnt changed her habits or the habits of her watchers if this was what the rainy season meant here it wasnt such a bad thing he had to move up the snatch he felt mold growing in every crevice of his body and last week i was wishing it would rain zull lylunda walked briskly circling the puddles wise woman he muttered who knows what grunge is in that slop it was arkel on guard dutybig man rather stupid worm had cleaned him more than once at hezurhairi he kept coming back his faith in his luck untouched by experience arkel slouched along half asleep splashing into puddles and out again going through the motions too bad it wasnt him tomorrow rodzin was the sharpest of the four he was bored by the guard duty and slack at the job but if he sniffed trouble he could turn mean real fast worm swore anything to make his life harder when lylunda reached her home street she stopped at okin the bakers shop came out with a loaf of bread in her net bag looking over her shoulder grinning and trading sass with someone inside at sutegas take out next door she added a cooked bird and two closed containers to the bread joked with halfman ike and tutted into her doorway still laughing youre in a good mood worm said i wonder if i should worry about that a stocky man in a black leather vest with brass buttons stepped into the alcove behind her as she fitted the a key into the topmost lock the two guards with himstood back wary and tautbodied stunners in their hands enemy territory worm said behilarr from up the hill bad news he flew the eye closer clicked on the speaker so he could hear this realtime elangmun lylunda courier whose worm scowled at the screen courier whats that about the anaitar of the erzain hizurrijaz gautaxo and you are elangmun lylunda yes so he handed her a bit of paper with a slash of wax on it she broke the wax and read the note then she tore the paper in half tore it again and again hold out your hand youd best see he gets these back im to come with you if you will elangmun puzzled by her reaction and alarmed by this irruption of enigma into his plans worm sent the eye after the two of them following them up through the low city and into the level of the great houses until they went into a huge pile of stone up by the temple he didnt know what for sure what that place was but it had a familiar smell cop shop no way he could take the eye inside there zoll i bet its those joddadin kliu they messing me up again he scratched at his nose with his free hand shook his head and maybe not looked like she knew what this is about and i dont think shed be so calm if it was kliu is it worth hanging around to see if she comes out again he established the eye on a ledge of the temple focused it on the front of the cop shop and set the alarm to tell him when the woman came out arraaa ill be glad when this is over he shed the control glove got to his feet with a groan andwent towork packing the belt sac for the job sleep gas six caps timers for caps nose plugs two pair zombi cartridge injection gun the soft beeping brought him hurrying back to the table he slid his hand into the glove activated it then checked the screen four figures had emerged from the gate and were walking down the street the courier first the woman in the middle the guards coming along behind worm took the eye closer managed to get a look at the womans face not lylunda but a woman wearing her clothes and fixed up to look like her she even moved like lylunda he flew the eye above the cop shop high enough so he could see all four sides of the massive pile and the streets around it during the hours that followed individuals came and went mostly men but also a few women none of them were lylunda in any sort of disguise there were no boxes or chests taken in or out nothing like that came from any of the other houses nearby by morning he was too tired to go on with the vigil and didnt see any point in keeping the eye hovering up there either she was still inside or whoever had her brought there had gotten her out the back before the decoy left besides it was starting to rain light rain not a storm just a steady downfalla monotonous drip drip drip that made him want to scream he brought the eye in closed the window set the scrubber on high to pull the damp from the air and began to pace back and forth across the room fighting to stay awake and keep his mind working he had pepperpops if he needed them but he didnt trust the fake clarity of mind they gave him xman swore by them but if you didnt keep a firm hold on hint xman would always be rushing the trap and tripping over his own feet first thing i need some sleep thats all right fits the pattern ive set up hit the warehouse the usual time hope bugs around yes hes the best source if he knows the womans gone missing hell be wanting to talk about it see if i can bust loose round midnight get across to kanti and put in a call to the kliu they wont bother talking to me if theyve got her so if i get bounced i better call fa cause i dunno what else i can do his stomach knotted at just the thought of telling his father hed missed again he swallowed nervously and went on pacing if its not them then all i can think to do is watch digbys agent shes here in deep cover so im fairly sure it cant be her working with the locals but looks like shes a smart un or she wouldnt be here at all he went over to the table looked down at the dull ovoid of the deactivated eye hm think id better retire you shouldnt be too hard to find out where shes staying peep that place set for passive collect transmit on code and her dressing room no maybe just an ear there she wouldnt be up to funny stuff at tanks but she might say something useful he collected the recordings from his web of bugs that he hadnt yet watched clicked the flakes into the viewer and began playing them as he listened he began the activation and reconfiguration of the new peeps and ears which he planned to plant as soon as he got back from calling the kliu when worm recognized the pattern of splotches on the ugly face he almost vomited with relief the kliu didnt wait for him to speak you have her im working on it why i called sources tell me the kliu have asked the local cop shop to pick up the woman youre making it harder when you stir up the locals like that cop shop you know what i mean how come what we do is none of your business srin whats taking you so long to get about yours you want the behilarr screwing a joddida humungous fine outta you by way of helvtia for interfering with a local on her own world what im saying is back off and what im saying to you srin is your brother mort butchered two kliu guards a week ago and wed be stretching him over the nearest mravhole if he werent in escrow to that miserable family of yours dont push too hard or wait too long srin or what youll get back will be wellpolished bones the screen blanked worm slumped in the chair closed his eyes and just breathed for a while the good news was that they didnt have her he would have cursed morts stupidity but one doesnt curse ones brother so he shoved that thought away he was so tired and it was clean and cool here on kantis bridge he didnt want to leave he wanted to crawl in his bunk and sleep for a week after a few moments though he got to his feet and went down to the flikits berth there were mort and xman and fa to take care of he had no choice but to go back across the stinking ocean and climb into his stinking life on zurgs star street and see if digbys agent had come up with some new angle flake audio ear in tanks office tank here get me on to grinder grinder here whats this about the new singer shes asking questions about the elang kliu spy dont think so shes the real thing when it comes to music and shes got the kind of background it wouldnt be easy to set up says shes got a message she needs to pass on privatelike says its a favor so no big deal if it doesnt happen what you want me to tell her extended period of silence whens she leave your place hour past midnight shes got two more sets to go call her to your office before she leaves and tell her youve put word to your touch over here but shes not to talk to anyone else about the elang send her off sweet got it got it flake band audvid peep in singers lq door opens krink in two men follow carrying the body of the singer a third carries her harp in its case they dump her on the bed set the harp beside the door then while krink watches the three men proceed to search the room checking out everything the woman owns there isnt much to check just some clothes and a few flakes that are professional recordings the entire time they are there not a word is spoken flake band audvid peep in the singers lq the singer comes in stops sniffs looks around her head stops moving when she sees folder that the men in band had left there she goes back out the door orrialdy you around shadow so the voice is faint as if from a distance think you could bring me up a pot of your tea that i could right now still distant if you will doorll be unlocked some minutes later a big plushy woman brings in a tray with a pot a mug and a plate of wafers the singer is seated at the rooms sole table she closes the folder as the woman approaches takes the tray thanks orrialdy well dont you work too hard not good for your eyes dear as soon as the woman leaves the singer fills the mug opens the folder again and begins studying the papers inside the peep is at the wrong angle to get a good look at the pages but they seem to be lists of something she studies them intently time passes the only sound is the click of the mug against the table when she sets it down the rustle of paperuntil something catches her attention sar first sapato now harmon arms dealers i have known hm he dropped a cargo in one of the warehouses it was picked up three days later by a chandaya merchanter definitely old home week note doesnt say what the cargo was but are we really baffled and the answer is no flake audio ear in tanks office worm stretchedrubbed his eyes and considered what hed seen harmon whatd i hear about harmon gotcha arms dealer blew his last two sales and is running on debt lifting gray freight to keep eating looks like grinder thinks lylunda was took offworld and has set the spy to figuring out how and who if she was somewhere in backcountry hed have her by now the kliu are clueless he grinned bad worm the lift to his spirits was brief though and he went back to brooding those lists ship landings if harmons as bad off as they say hed sell his grandmother and keep his mouth shut about it he glanced at the screen the singer was lifting the harpcase she slipped the strap over her shoulder and went out the tables clean the papers are gone whats she up to now if shes on the move he scowled at the screens set up on the table most of his gear was packed in the lockboxes of the flikit he wanted to be ready to jump when the spy did and figured he wouldnt have much time for packing i can always set up again leave the ears and the peeps youre working xman time worm so do what hed do and jump he broke down the screens and the flaker packed them in their case and stowed the case in the flikit he locked the door and the shed and scurried for star street and almost ran into the spy as he came charging from a sidestreet onto the walkway he slowed to an amble stopped to look into one of the windows of kautkas anything shop when the spy paused to talk to getto he didnt have to strain his ears to hear what she said announcing it to the world he thought shes definitely got plans even look at water gonna make another song want to might they come when they come you know she fluttered her fingers at him and on her way hiring a flit going out over water zoll shes got it found something in those papers harmon thats it shes figured out hes the one took lylunda bet anything on that and shes heading for her ship going after him he snapped his fingers as if hed forgot something and went hurrying back the way hed come as worm swung the flikit south skimming just above the long surges of the ocean wavesto avoid being spotted from haundi zurgile and chased by the local authorities he saw a dark seed flying low over the water near the northern horizon must be the spys flier he clicked on the screen and focused the pickups northand blinked at the gyrations of that flier it was swooping in long arcs racing low enough to cream the water lifting and darting about like a waterbug having fits whats all that has she lost it the flier turned suddenly and swooped north vanishing over the horizon worm took a chance and sent the flikit higher he saw the flier swoop toward the first of the island chain a hump of rock with a tree and some seagrass dart round it dive toward the next island he saw something else tooanother flier hovering over toward the land gotcha grinder or the local lice she knows the watcher is there and shes holding cover until she can get loose enough to run for the wild half he dropped the flikit again and squeezed all the speed out of it that he could manage when he was flying this low too bad he couldnt go upandover but the locals got mean with any unauthorized flights they happened to spot he understood that it was a matter of cash they wanted their passage fees and their storage fees and their taxes hed gotten most of what he needed from the woman a new target he was going after harmon going to get there first and shoot the clot full of babble pry out of him where he left the woman and go pick her up no more fussing about catering to locals he didnt have time for that he wasnt happy about having to admit to his father that someone had scooped the smuggler out from under him again but he needed his fathers sources fa would know where harmon was headed next he kept up on that kind of thing funny how he could since he was stuck in that sustainer back on teripang the drain of keeping him alive was why worm and mort and xman had to do so much work more coin all the time more coin so fa could pamper his sources sasa this time for once that pampering might pay off when hed nearly reached the shore of the wild half he heard the scream of a fullpower lift and saw the flare of a ships drivers burn an arc toward the breakpoint zoll she wasnt heading here the bint went and nicked the elangs ship he grinned i like her shes got class she really must have come here on a worldship as part of her cover dint have her own knew one was handy so she went out and got it neat solution to the problem of getting away from grinder without handing him her head the locals started firing at her he saw the dot seem to jump sideways the missiles swerved and missed then she was gone he tapped the controls had the flikit berth open and waiting as soon as he reached the canyon he left the servos to locking the flikit down and raced toward the bridge if he could just get into the air fast enough and into the insplit behind her he could track her that way he wouldnt hve to bother fa he could put off the skin peel he was bound to get when he had to tell him what happened spy sweet spy i owe you a favor now lets see if i can get off this mudball without a sting up my tail more detours shadith slid the dragoi into the berth next to digbys ship in the university tiedown took the shuttle to the surface and a hopper to the main campus at citystate rhapsody an immense complex on the coast of the largest of the three continents as one who owned voting stock she had a studio apartment in one of the megarons shed kept it even though it was likely shed not spend much time there because it meant shed always have a place to go no matter what happened to the job with digby it felt good to be back clicking along in a chainchair basking in the sunlight of a late spring day and watching the crowds of students and scholars moving through the streets she didnt see any faces she knew but shed been on digbys payroll nearly three years now and gone most of that time the populations in all the citystates of university were fluid as mud geysers shifting and changing with the phases of the moon as it werethe same types though over and over cousins and non curiously alike in their common purpose it was a good place to be for a while at least feeling weightless and free very much like she felt when she left pillory and crawled out of the exoskeleton she touched on the light in her apartment tossed her bag into a chair and combed her hands through her hair aaaahhhhhhh the sound was concentrated pleasure and ended on a brief happy laugh she clicked on the viewer ran through the menu chose a chamber group she knew then rambled around the apartment moving to the music touching her books the small carvings shed picked up here and there cat she thought renewing my scent marks pulling off her clothes and kicking them into a pile going into the kitchen where she snatched packs of tea from the stasis box and started water boiling on the stove she took a long shower washed her hair pulled on a robe settled in a chair with her feet up and the teapot beside her at first she watched a news summary then she tuned in a drama by one of the writers shed worked with when she was taking a course in musical theater vul ri pustanili was a sparglan from a world he called makusij which he said was so far out of touch it was a good thing the local life spans were numbered in centuries rather than decades he was fascinated by the ephemeral qualities of cousin views on life and love and was immersing in them in order to understand the joy and tragedy of such a swiftly passing awareness from what she could see he was persevering in this his peculiar humor and odd angle of approach still part of his charms as a writer twenty minutes into the play though she fell asleep she woke nine hours later with a stiff neck and the message chiming gently in her ears vuls squeaky voice shadow caught your name as a watcher you back for just a visit or are you staying a while ive got this new project want you to look at it see what you think i need music a single instrument i think subtlety over noise i really do want to talk even if you cant stay come see me hm digby why are you on university shadow id like a report if you dont mind have you found the smuggler try to keep traveling times as short as possible this is a race were in remember aslans contralto shadith blinked with surprise shed thought aslan was still on bйluchad shadow vul told me youre back if you have the time its miriks birthday near as she can figure it so were having a party in the eager seagull the usual lot you know love to have you come if you can tonight supposed to start around seven but you know how these things go shadith checked the timer tonight was indeed this coming night she smiled digby you can go on hold ive just finished a month of agonizing boredom and i want to play hm on second thought id probably better give him a call grmp hes going to want more than i want to tell do we mention lylundas ship for sure we do not would that keep him off it i doubt it too many records all of them transparent to him which means when i leave i take dragoi in tow gods what happens when your life gets so convoluted you forget which is back and which is front well we do the best we can with what weve got i hate this im taking his money supposed to be doing the job he hired me for makes me feel lower than hm i should make sure he gets his full fee i owe him that even if ive already quit looks like the only person i can work for is me have to figure out something but not now time for that later away from his main nest digby was a ghost of himself a painted translucent specter hiphitched on the corner of a desk in the satellite office he kept here on university scowling at her as he listened to the carefully edited account of her activities on hutsarte she ended her tale with the delivery of the readouts i brought them with me she said ill scan them for you and give you my reasoning after that then well see if we agree hm this was the tricky point if she could get him interested in the data perhaps she could slide over how she got from hutsarte to university she took the pages from the folder smoothed them out then fed them one by one into the slot on the scanner after a moments pose as the contemplative thinker the ghost lifted his head raised a brow not much difficulty there so tell me harmon she said with the jilitera a distant second the other ship the shuttles the transfer station all of them out of it she explained waited i find no flaws in your reasoning why university the regents try to keep track of arms dealers and people like that i was going to give them what i know about harmons activities and run that name through to see if they have a new loc on him and i thought id pull what they have on the jilitera might be unlikely but they were there she shrugged you said use your ingenuity and your resources just doing the job digby the ghost contemplated her a skeptical look on his sketch of a face your discretion thus far has been admirable so i wont pry into the gaps in that report at the moment at least ill expect your final report to be considerably more detailed he seemed to relax then grinned at her the kliu are agitated and are trying to wring what information they can out of me i suspect they lost track completely of the elang when she vanished from haundi zurgile theyve certainly lost their smug youve won some time shadow but probably not a lot ill give my resources a shake and see what falls out let me know what university comes up with hrn will do um just in case if youve got lines to the jilitera it might be a good thing to get them ready to pull never hurts to have a backup no matter how convincing the logic pleasantly tired shadith eased her way through the crowd to the bar in the corner of the room the party had migrated to aslans apartment after dinner at the eager seagull and was still going strong though the noise level had begun to abate a bit she searched through the empty bottles boxes and more esoteric containers found a bottle with an inch of carta blue in it and refilled her glass any of the gartienta left aslan caught her by the shoulder leaned rather heavily against her breathing a sweetish fog of alcohol past her ear whoo im going to hate myself tomorrow but it feels good now whats it look like dumpy black jug thing smells like apricots this mm bin shadith shook it gently something left hold your glass out they moved around the edge of the room found a futon rolled up and pushed against the wall and eased themselves down on it i was wondering shadith said after a moment why im not still on beluchad funding dried up yaraka thought we were teaching the locals a bit too much instead of studying how to manage them you dont sound unhappy about being kicked offworld aslan grinned im not left a lot of local students behind and university sprung for a couple splitcoms the meruu of medon vale are enthusiastic scholars and they like the idea of setting down their history the yaraka are going to find that the keteng and the fior are rather more than a match for them i think do i ask about you got a letter full of restrained enthusiasm from mum well you know her im in the middle of something cant talk about it now the milling groups of talkers split a moment and she saw mirik melting against sarmaylen his battered fingers moving absently along the elegant bones of her shoulder a sculptors appreciation in the delicate touch mirik and sarmaylen she understand what shes getting into does anybody ever alsan sipped at the gartienta after a minute she sighed he doesnt mean to act like a merd you know he just gets so interested in what hes working on he forgets youre there and you can get pissed at him and leave and he doesnt even notice for months maybe and theres always another sighing femme waiting in the wings shell enjoy these first weeks shadow he can play symphonies on a womans body she smiled fondly at memories that shadith couldnt see but she certainly could feel them through the reactions of alsans body aslan got to her feet and ambled off heading toward a tall lean man with a gleaming bald head and a graystreaked brown beard that reached halfway down his chest shadith watched her smooth her fingers along the line of his jaw saw him smile down at her abruptly she didnt feel like partying any longer she looked down at her glass sighed and set it by the end of the futon roll where it wasnt likely someone would kick it over got unsteadily to her feetand edged along the wall till she reached the door the air outside was crisp and cold she took a deep breath and the wine hit her turning her knees to rubber and churning in her stomach she dropped onto the edge of a granite planter lowered her head to her knees and fought the urge to upchuck everything shed eaten what a stupid thing less sense than mirik showed when she loped off with that scamjack gods im horny and hopeless i want i want more than ive got why cant i just pick something and stick with it sleepy id better get home before i end spending the night on the steps here call a jit im in no shape to chain it or to walk cautiously she sat up she was still a bit dizzy and wine tears blurred her eyes but at least she could navigate now without embarrassing herself she hunted till she found the jit pole then thumbed back the slide and touched the sensor she leaned on the pole and waited for her transport to arrive weeping with loneliness and too much wine the messager woke her again notice from university to come pick up her printouts message from digby informing her that harmon was on his way to sauva kutets a world in the sakuta system one of several newly settled planets in a miniature cluster close to the saber arm mouse its called he said because of its size and a tail of dust curling off one side sauva kutets was a colony in the throes of a savage revolt against the mother world a planet called agregossa in a system way out at the tip of the saber arm because the agregossans havent fought a war in a long time depending upon coercion and indoctrination to keep the peace rather than crude and visible force theyre not very adept at it though they have been learning rapidly the most recent reports have the agregossans making an attempt at an embargo of the system most inept and futile unless youre unlucky enough to surface in front of their outer patrols most of the hostile attention is focused on sauvas surface so keep away from there if you can otherwise you shouldnt have much trouble getting in and out again oblique attacks and ingenuity shadow shouldnt be hard for you to manage when shadith reached the breakout point at the matta system the alarm signaled ships too close she hovered at breakout until the clearlight blinked green at her then emerged to find shed just missed a line of three sting ships prowling inside the limitagregossa guards on what was essentially an attempt at embargo on the cheap if agregossa sowed breakout beepers in a globe inside the limit and kept a dozen interceptors ready to move when one of the alarms was triggered they might be able to slow the smuggling to a trickle even pulling the patrol back until it didnt activate a clutter warning on the incoming ships might work a nose to tail procession hard up against the limitlike the one shed just avoidedlooked more like punishment detail than guard duty passive receptors as wide and sensitive as she could crank them to prevent other possibly fatal surprises worrying about having to drag lylundas ship along besideher she slipped into the shadow of a gas giant then went scooting toward the asteroid belt the sublight shield drawn tight about the twinned ships though the hot tail on the backhoe was impossible to camouflage completely all the fieldsculptors could do was extend the emanation block backward in a slightly flared tube to narrow the chances of detection after a few hours of heavy sweating she edged the linked ships into the belt crept along it according to the plan shed worked out on her way here when she reached the point closest to sauva kutets she settled into the shadow of a large rock locked onto it with fore and aft lines then reconfigured the shield turning the ships into a craggy node of the asteroid both to the eye and to most detec systems the locals were most likely to choose a meeting place that gave them the least possible exposure to agregossan patrols spla i need a bath that was a bit more sweatmaking than i expected first though i see if i figured right about how to locate our happy arms dealer according to her data file sauva was the larger twin the one with the most people there was no mthing or heavy industry because the world was expected to produce food for the homeworld and nothing was allowed to distract from that task sauva was divided into huge salashi owned by the families that ran agregossa and by their friends the salasheri rented the land they worked from those families and paid taxes to the colonial government they also had to buy hardware and machinery from the owners at what they knew were inflated prices in spite of this triple drain the salasheri prosperedto no small degree by growing speciality crops of various kinds and smuggling the harvest offworld the rebellion came with the last increases in the rent and in the tax laid on the salasheri by the homeworld which convinced them that the absentee owners would squeeze them dry in their greed and ignorance they sent a delegation across to kutets to protest the members of that delegation were arrested convicted on the spot of insurrection and signed into contract labor their families were thrown off the land they thought of as their own outsiders were brought in to work it it didnt take much deliberation for the rest to figure out where that road led most of kutets population belonged to one of three groupsthe agregossa colonial government with its mix of politicians police land agents and bureaucrats security forces the contract labor used in the mines and factories no rebellion there according to the report dumb system all around almost guaranteed to generate dissatisfaction on sauva i expect agregossa figured it had the high ground here and the sauvese would follow orders like it or lump it hm high ground in this case depends on whos got the most bang in hand hence harmon gods be blessed i dont have to plunge into that mess just locate old harmon and squeeze out of him where he dumped lylunda elang her chosen rock was on the inner side of the belt and in good viewing range sauva kutets was between her and the sun the dark side toward her with similar crescents of daylit world on the trailing edge no city lights shone in the larger of those velvet black ovoids but here and there she saw the flashes from explosions and in several places wide swathes of fire all so very pretty from way out here even with amplification and nicely silent no screams from the burned and dying she shivered and blanked the screen though she left the pickups working and transferring data to memory cells from the lack of fooforrah i got here first she said well i was closer if i did start later digby said harmon left the accord with a nicely vicious assortment of their products three days before i splitted from university interesting that he could get that kind of information spooky digby as a virus in the corn system im starting to wonder more than a little where hes aiming more stuff to think about later so wheres harmon at a guess his ships not all that much faster than this one if he came directly from the accord and id say thats likely with the load he has and if he had no more problems than i did getting here then he may have arrived around six hours ago so its just possible he could have dumped his cargo and got away before i stuck my nose through not likely though hed have to spend some time making contact with his buyers itd go faster if he grounded the ship on planet but setting down in the middle of a war is a gamble me id do the trade up here let the buyers dance with the agregossan patrols get your pay and get out so if youre around here like you should be you little weasel youre doing just what im doing playing least in sight and waiting for the sauvese to signal their arrival she tapped the screen on again pulled most of the receptors away from sauva kutets and set them mapping the local asteroid configurations she get more precise data once digbys pooter moles were deployed giving her a delicate web out there collecting data about everything that happened in this area of the belt she smiled as she watched the moles creep away from the ship when she was testing out the abilities packed into digbys fleet she asked the tech why they were called that he told her to watch the screen she did and saw this nebulous little object doing a quick odd jig across the space between the ship and the rock that was its target yog see he said like its farting its way across slow enough to get you chewing on your elbows but they dont trigger alarms and when theyve got their paint on they dont show up on most search screens so theyre useful little buggers and you can pickaback them if you have to show some speed let the carriers draw the fire after the moles have dropped twenty minutes later when she was scrolling through the data from the mole web examining hundreds of mediumto largesized rocks floating in the middle of nothing the alarm beeped at her and threw the readout off the screen she found herself looking at an insystem ship that seemed to be coming straight for her when it passed one of the larger asteroids though she saw the nose begin to turn away the battered craft was creeping alongvery slowly almost as if it were tiptoeing across a creaky floor it nestled up against that rock with a delicacy of increment that suggested the pilot was probably a smuggler or perhaps an asteroid miner recruited to the cause hm close enough to be handy far enough to be safe as she watched it power down and set its mooring lines shadith played with the controls pinning the location and maneuvering the pooter moles into a mosaic for a beacon watch no need to go looking for harmon there was the bait to draw him here theres an ego boostersetting my piece on the board just right bmmmp cwmmp the beacon watch told her then went silent bwnunmb very shortrange signalfaint and so low it was a basso mutter rather than the usual beep lovely now we wait for him to come to the call and sit here sweating till i know if i was careless and he spotted me or if he was focused insystem and not worrying about the belt university says hes missed the last two drops he set up barely got away with his life and no cash reduced to ferrying cargo to pay expenses and burning the papers on his ship for this load only way to get them back is make good on the sale hell come oh yes sweet if he can nasty if he has to she waited the beacon did its pattern every twenty minutes and she waited nothing else to do her gear was in the lock ready to go the plan was made during the trip here tweaked a little to suit local conditions no need to go over that again two hours three four bmmmp cwmmp bwmmmb thwop thweep thwop thweep thweep she shook herself out of her half doze began watching the screen intently at first she saw nothing then she noticed that the glimmer of the belt dust was occluded by a roughly spherical object moving counter to the general direction of rotation hello harmon as shadith eased from the sled and used a sticktight to moor it to the side of harmons ship she caught flickers of light from the cargo transfer that was moving at frantic speed on the other side of the bulge as she crossed to the ship shed seen harmons bots handling much of the work with the men from the insystem ship adding their muscle to the process stowing the sealed bundles in their own hold with the care of men who knew they had little leeway with much of the stuff they were hauling she slid the probe over the latch of the maintenance lock raised her brows as the reading remained null no juice through the latch burning paper all right nothing drawing except what is absolutely necessary nice of you to make things easy for me lil harmon before she did anything to the latch she pulled herself against the side of the ship and reached inside searching for life fires three men one nearby probably in the hold overseeing the bot loading stranger the second was harmon faint much farther away on the bridge with the third another stranger probably the paymaster waiting till the transfer was complete before handing over the cash hm dont underestimate the little man shadow he hasnt survived this long by being stupid she focused her reach on harmon so she could act the moment she felt him go tense inserted the mutator key at the end of suit gloves fifth finger into the slot and started the attack on the latch five minutes later she was inside and climbing cautiously along the catwalk in the space between the walls working toward the bridge using her reach to give her an estimate of how close she was getting twice she came on interior maintenance locks but they were too far from her goal she noted the locations and the areas they gave access to and kept moving the third lock was on the bridge level she used her suit arm to wipe dust from the small bronze plate read dichio komugan aux corn good running on the cheap hes probably closed this one down so lil key do your tiny thing and get me in there clean she emerged from the lock into the secondary corn room found the screens and sensor boards sheathed in a skin of crashwebbing and a layer of fine gray dust on every surface dust that came floating up as her steps disturbed it the wrist readouts on her gauntlets told her that the air in the room was stale barely breathable impregnated with slough from every surface in the place she grimaced and moved to the door again there was no power through the latch he was conserving to the point of absurdity or necessity she was beginning to feel sorry for the man though she loathed arms dealers this was death by inches and the thought revolted her harmon was still tense this close she could read an overlay of forced cheerfulness that confused but didnt worry her she slid the door open and moved through as quickly as she could clicking her tongue against her teeth at the ingust of air as the pressure on two sides sought to equalize nothing she could do about that but hope harmon was too busy with his conversation to notice the blink of a telltale she checked her own telltale air thin but breathable she unzipped the gauntlets clipped them to her belt removed the stunner from its pouch and ran on her toes past a dark access that from the smell of stale food led to the galley then past two closed cabin entries she stopped just outside the door to the bridge dropped to her knees and crept close enough to look in harmon sat with his chair turned slightly away from the controls though he glanced at the readouts now and then he was smiling at a burly man who stood beside the co chair a locked case at his feet come up with the cash i know where i can get some outofdate cpe at a big discount out of date the burly mans hands closed into fistsbrieflyuntil he forced them open anger and the effort he was making to hold it in grated in his voice oh its still plenty potent tricky to handle ill grant you that but also going at onetenth the price harmon leaned forward fixed his eyes on the other mans face and spoke with an apparent candor beneath which shadith could hear his desperation look i live by my reputation i sell you worthless word goes out nobody buys from me youve got techs who know how to handle it see what they say theyll tell you its a good deal scrape up the coin and give me a call he broke off at a ting from his wristcom blue leader here stowed and sewed up lets get shadith eased back got to her feet and ran back the way shed come until she reached the galley accessway and plunged into the darkness where she pressed herself against the wall and waited she was a bit surprised that harmon was leaving his bridge then it occurred to her that the man in the hold wasnt crew but one of the locals and harmon was operating the ship solo the two men were still talking deal as they marched along the corridor she heard a soft hiss and smiled to herself face thats what that sound meant he fed enough juice to run a lift tube keeping up the prosperous image in front of his customers she left the accessway moved into the bridge and waited for him to come back eyes mean as snakes if still a touch blurry from the stunner harmon twisted his wrists against the comealong tapes youre dead ill find you thats a stupid thing to say the distorter in the suit hood deepened and roughed her voice gives me a good reason not to want you healthy or whole if youre after the money why didnt you just take it and go you want my ship only one thing i want and thats the girl huh his face went totally blank for an instant what girl she ground her teeth together his body shouted to her what she didnt want to hear he didnt know what she was talking aboutwhich meant shed spent months of travel and a years worth of computer time on university for nothing less than nothing clinging to a last sliver of hope she said three months ago you landed a cargo on a world called hutsarte the chief of security put a young woman in your custody and told you to take her somewhere i want to know where youve got mold in your head yeah i dropped off cargo all right and picked up some too but no femme dont like femmes on my ship bad luck he blinked at her a moment what femmes this and how come you want to know the kliu bounty fool ten thousand gelders alive zip dead she didnt try to disguise her disgust with the situation and could hear it even in the gravelly tones of the distorter all she could do now was getout of there as clean as she could reason im telling you is youd pick it up anyway the first pit you tiedown at she swore as she glanced at a readout she kept concealed in the palm of her gauntlet so he wouldnt see it was an ordinary air sniffer lil henry here says you truthspeaking so hail and farewell im off ee dont leave me tied like this time keyed harmon so contemplate your sins and cultivate the virtue of patience and in around twenty minutes the ties fall off she backed from the bridge and went running for the maintenance hatch and the sled drone shadith to excavations ltddigby no question he was telling the truth spla he was perfect for the part everything i would have postulated were i creating him well enough selfjustification i thought the jilitera the next most likely but ive gone off pride in my logic right at the moment also pride in what you delight in calling my ingenuity so ive reread the data collected so far and twisted it every way i can think of grinder jiraba was convinced the woman was taken offworld and i see no reason to dispute that he wasnt a man to make that kind of mistake or one to bring in strangers to do something he could handle himself so the jilitera are it if youve got a way to pry information out of them nows the time to use it if not locate the jherada for me and ill see what babble can do drone digby to shadith aboard backhoe one install enclosed shriek id on ship take name drina acmorah use enclosed materials for the role meet one jaskara at the crowndome the tricky deacon pit ninth hour of the pit diurn weeks window so dont linger on the way ask him no questions other than the location of lylunda elang if he says he doesnt know believe him tell him nothing about yourself shadith finished the terse message raised her brows curiosity up slap curiosity down for the moment anyone want to wager jaskarah is as phony as drina acmorah no wise deacon hm more travel im getting really tired of all this crawling about in the split after i quit maybe i should drop over to vrithian and vegetate in harskaris garden she sighed id like that i think mucking about with plants and trading lies with willow and ol beetle bodri and watching sunchild airdance for a while anyway a blueblack woman with eyes that glowed like yellow fire above a discreet breathing mask strolled across the lobby of the crowndome she wore a skintight sheath of garnet avrishum a silver turban that completely covered her hair and silver elbowlength gloves shadith blinked as she glimpsed herself in one of the mirrored walls she still hadnt got used to the guise digbyd thought up for her a little man with a yellowish wrinkled pseudoskin mask left the shadows where hed been standing and met her near one of the carved pillars of colored marble that were scattered about and connected to a complex play of arches as if they were really loadbearing instead of freeform art pieces drina acmorah jaskarah yes i have a shielded conference room reserved if youll come lead the way jaskarah tapped the seal on the door walked to the table and sat down you have a question for me she frowned at him a moment wondering if he already know what she wanted knowing at the same time she had no leeway to ask him about that do you know where lylunda elang was taken he blinked at her and she could feel his surprise hunk that answers that and makes me wonder why he doesnt know i dont know the name he said hm perhaps if i put it this way a young woman was taken aboard a particular ship on hutsarte by instructions from an official there she was transferred to another place i wish to know that place ah thats different bol mutiar in the callidar pseudo cluster an island called chiouti is there anything further can you give me more information about this chiouti no then i thank you for your help and would you prefer to leave first or shall i he stood bowed walked to the door unsealed it and left it resealed behind him a red light blinking on the monitor she waited till the red blink turned green walked away from the room her reach sweeping out to make sure the little man wasnt hanging about meaning to follow her until she removed the trappings of drinaacmorah remembering the implicit warning in digbys message she expected to find him out there and he was lingering in the shadow by one of the columns his curiosity about her overlaid with a sense of need that disturbed hermore things she had to figure out about digby it wouldnt surprise her much to learn that the fauxjaskarah didnt know who it was pulling the strings that got him here not that i know either who can say what digby did to get this deacons rules were a lot looser than marrats there were no respectable folk here no gray market with citizen types coming to buy murder was frowned on though duels were common enough and killing in selfdefense with even the faintest of justification rated a minor fine theft and the false report of theft were capital offenses with trial by verification and the sentence carried out approximately twenty seconds after the verifier extruded its report it was not a place for the gentle and the unaware which meant if she trapped and zapped the little man no one would bother noticing he had to know that too so it was going to be tricky and she reminded herself ive got watch out or he does the same to me dont get too sassy shadow you arent the champeen wizard of the universe just think what lee or harskariwoulddo to you if the need arose or even autumn rose if she took a notion she clicked her tongue shook her head im getting so used to deviousness i forget the short way all you have to do is get back to the ship intact shadow the way digby set things up skinface can follow you till his feet rot and bribe the deacons guards for the ships shriek and he wont know more than he does now keep it quick and easy and lets get out of here ten gelders bought her a bot escort out to the tiedown the credit chip in drina acmorahs name paid her mooring fee and a few minutes later she was splitting for the callidara it meant another month of travel but maybe this was the last of the zigs shed have to zag shadith dropped the backhoe into orbit around bol mutiar and breathed a sigh of relief as she finally cut the umbilical to the dragoi she could leave the ship parked here hand it over to lylunda when she got the woman offworld she inspected the globe turning beneath her there was very little about the world in the memory files on the ship and she didnt want to alert digby just yet an island named chiouti she watched the parade of islands sliding past below her and swore with considerable fervor no cities just villages one or two to an island depending on its size no landmasses more than fifty miles on the longest axis almost all of the islands in a wide band about the equator the rest of the world windchurned ocean she had no local maps not a clue which of those humps ofdirt might be called chiouti by the people who lived there looks like i unship the lander and do the lucky dip and hope i dont have to spend the next ten years at it she put the small lander down on one of the larger islands choosing as landing site a barren spit where the weight and heat of the lander would do least damage when youre visiting someone elses home to ask a favor you dont break the furniture or kick the cat she crawled out circled the lander and was pleased to see shed made a neat setdown then she started walking south along the beach toward the small village nestling at the back of a halfmoon bay trying to ignore an uneasiness that tickled at her like flies walking down her back she had a feeling of something watching her measuring hernot hostile yet but a sense of lurking danger she tried a sweep with her reach but there was nothing alive nearby except a few bugs in the sparse grass and shellfish under the sand the first people who came running to meet her were children brown happy unafraid throwing words at her she couldnt understand as yet though the pain in her head meant the translator was working hard to remedy that a droo eoeo a mei a mei erra blyek a mehil erra tiang diak a woman in bail like that mno er el i think yes i think she has tuttas and look at the way she meraii it was the oldest of the girls she giggled and went strutting ahead of them shaking her small behind after a few steps she grinned over her shoulder men dont walk like that you might be surprised young woman shadith said the words came slowly but they came the accent wasnt quite right but she could see from the startled look on the girls face that she understood the words well enough then you are a man no you had that right you come to trade i came to find an island chiouti have you ever heard of a place with that name chiouti i dont think so too bad you missed the berotongs when they came by last month on their beronta they sail all round the world and know just about every place shadith stopped walking when the girl turned and came back to her she bowed straightened blessings on you young woman you have saved me much trouble and travel i will do as you say and seek out a beronta of the berotong pandai but you must come and eat with us well have games and stories and a fine feast to celebrate your being here i thank you for the thought but my need is urgent greet your elders for me and say that i wish they would celebrate the joy that your words have brought me she bowed again swung round and ran for the lander and i wasnt exaggerating she told herself as she took the lander up to the edge of the atmosphere she put the craft on autopilot and began a search of the ocean round the islands looking for a beronta which shouldnt be so hard to spot big melanggas melanggas translator still on the job spla forcegrowing new dendrons is not a fun experience wonder what happens when i run out of room inside this skull does it explode on me i can see it now one langue too many and kaboom the ladys heads a tomb that what they mean when they say go out with a bang not a whimper tsah i could work up a good whimper right about now ah there we are one beronta riding the waves she increased magnification frowned at the image on the small screen kids hm looks like whole families travel on those things interesting as that is its got nothing to do with my problem how do i to them should i wait till they make their next landfall probably best i do this is not the most maneuverable of platforms right we get a measure of average speed see which island is the likely target then we drop down and say hello i really dont like that place and id rather not spend more time there than i have to shadith bowed drummer orros and you may call me shadow yes i do know chiouti is it the island you wish to find shadow or the woman who was on it shadith blinked startled by having her question answered before she voiced it thank you it is the woman ive come to find her i need to talk to her do you mean her harm she is of the bond no harm ive a question to ask and an offer to make she cant leave do you understand that if you take her now shell die and so will you youre sure you come too late star rider perhaps so perhaps not i dont understand this bond of yours but there are things you dont understand about me in any case i do need to talk to her she drums on a beronta these days they make landfall next at an island called keredel it is on the far side of the world six months sail from here how can i recognize keredel the drummer snapped his fingers and a young boy ran to him with a stick some stones leaves and bits of grass he dropped to his knees on the damp sand smoothed out a patch and using the stick began to carve he labored over it for nearly half an hour cutting bits of grass and leaves and fitting them into the sand using the stones as rock outcroppings and to form a curving tail of small rocky islets when he was finished he dusted off his knees rubbed his palms against his menu that is keredel you leave me in your debt drummer orros she examined the small exquisite miniature amazing in its detail and knew shed have no trouble locating that particular island no the woman is unhappy here and more so every day it he paused hunting for words it disturbs the bond the debt will be ours if you can find a way to make her content or to help her leave alive shadith bowed again then went back to the lander she had a lot to think about but more to do before she could find the time she needed for that thinking bargains lylunda took the small practice drum left the bustling trade fair in the village belau and went to sit on the bench her bare feet in the foam from the retreating tide shed gathered cherar on the first island that the remeydang stopped at after leaving chiouti but she could not make herself drink the infusion her throat closed up her insides cramped her hands shook so badly she dropped the glass in the end she poured it out and fought the pull of the tung by drumming herself into exhaustionbut when morning came she ate slices of the tuber with the rest of the pandai that night she curled in a knot and grieved for everything shed lost the pandai understood her struggle and left her alone with it they knew everyone knew everything around the world and back all pandai knew what one pandai knew as if they ate the information with the crisp yellow rounds of tung akar no privacy of thought and feeling on bol mutiar each time she saw evidence of this her body screamed with rage and terror though she swallowed the words she wanted to shout at them rape of the soul taking what she didnt want to give taking the last thing that was hers alone when she was out on the ocean the pressure was gone as if the brisk winds that sent the beronta scudding along blew the addiction from her head she was happy there and it was enough respite to help her keep going but there was always the next island the next meal all around her the smell of the tung and the awareness of its presence that went beyond the senses she touched the drum head listened to it speak shed not eaten the tung yet so she could still feel the song in her bones it helped her push away the clamor to eat and be one in bond with the others bond the tapping of her fingers sang to her bond bond bondaaaage though the pandai were freer within their limits than anyone shed known happier real joy in them in the games and the making of things laughter and no fear yet what they gave up for this she felt something tweak at her a coldness almost anger in the aura of the tung she got to her feet stood holding the drum in front of her like a shield as she watched a dark figure coming toward her a woman in a shipsuit a trader the berotongs had never spoken of femme traders as the woman came closer lylunda watched the vigorous alertness in her body the fierce energy of her walk her eyes blurred with weak tears shed walked like that once shed danced that way the woman stopped in front of her she was tall and slender with a tangle of goldtipped brown curls and eyes like bitter chocolate lylunda elang lylunda sighed whatever the woman wanted she had no will left to fight her yes she felt the coldness grow felt the peril in it she didnt care she was just too tired to be afraid anymore the woman shivered im not here to hurt you in any way do you believe that does it matter you tell me all right i believe you she felt the coldness draw back perhaps it did matter she had no reason to wish harm on this woman thanks im tired of this sand any place where we can sit and talk if you want to talk here the woman raised her brows startled at the violence in lylundas voice but she wasnt about to apologize if she went away from the water the tungs call would grow too strong for her and she wouldnt be able to think all right my name is shadith i work for excavations ltd and the kliu hired us to find you and either get the location of the taalav array or hand you over to them so they could extract it i dont intend to do that by the way hand you over i mean oh lylunda sighed you came too late if you take me away from here i wont live long enough to reach the limit so i was told also that id be dead right beside you why to stay alive on this world for any length of time you have to eat the tung akar once youve eaten enough of it you cant live without it its more complicated than that in ways i wouldnt understand unless i gave up and became part of the tung bond ive an ottodoc on board my ship that wouldnt flush it out of your system the jilitera warned me about that it wont work i think the tung has become part of my cell structure and the ottodoc cant get all of it without me its aware the tung i mean i can feel it yes so can i your father chose well youre certainly safe here if the kliu come after you the lung kills them you know about my father when i was on hutsarte looking for you i tangled with someone called grinder jiraba he figured out what must have happened i see i see something else too no ethical problems telling the kliu where to find me im safe youre away clean not even any bad dreams maybe no ethical problems but an interesting practical one we dont get paid if we just give them your location they want actual possession or a firm location for the array lylunda turned away eased herself onto the sand and sat staring out at the sea her hands flattened against the sides of the drum so their shaking wouldnt betray the surge of hope that was like fire racing through her body she heard shadith drop beside her but she didnt turn to face the woman this tooclever hunter whod sniffed out her hiding place when she had control of her voice she said im not going to tell you unless you are quick ba da considering that you found me i shouldnt be surprised ill sell prangarris and the taalav for a way off this world thats the only coin that will buy me theres nothing else youve got that i want i know a healer i think she can keep you alive id best go have a talk with her travel times being what they are could be around several months before im back so hold tight hm and hold onto this a beeper landed in her lap a warm hand closed on her shoulder in a quick squeeze then she heard the sounds of running feet thudding on the sand lylunda kept staring at the sea trying to calm the turmoil inside her and at the same time wondering how she was going to survive the next few months worm trails the pulse from the beacon cut off as the spy emerged from the split when worm reached the limitand surfaced he listened to the shriek of the transfer station swore when he heard the university id why here i dont understand harmon wouldnt come near this place instead of continuing on to the tiedown he slipped sideways and took the kanti into a polar orbit about one of the outer planets his respite was gone run down the drain he sat for some time scowling at the corn screen i should have called fa it was the right thing to do i wasted a months travel time because i lost my nerve he rubbed at his eyes maybe im wrong maybe shes figured out something else maybe he sighed and punched in his fathers call sign then waited for the connect when the screen lit it was a girls face he saw instead of his fathers trish wheres fa coz having a flushout kliu called said about mort hanging on a thread he took it bad you got good news dont know how hed take more bad no good no bad just got more traveling to do need fas sources you know he dont let no one tap the source node you gonna have to wait till he can least twelve hours that too long maybe so maybe no but i damnsure cant move without ive got some place to go to ta then talk to you when worm went limp as the stiffening hed summoned drained out of him it was all to do again nerving himself to face his fathers anger and maybe give him another seizure when he had to confess what happened he got wearily to his feet and went to scrub the galley once again at least when you cleaned something you could see what youd accomplished just a couple a days fore i was at go on the snatch some local pivr hauls her in to cop shop and she dont come out what comes out is some femme fixed up in her clothes i get on corn to the kliu and complain they interfering with the op that i hear they trying it on with the locals to pick the smuggler up and ship her over to pillory so they can get out of contract they got with us i dint ask if they got her i just said they were messing me up andwhat ol kliu he says makes me some sure they hant got her grinders kid he said it was her fa who got her hes some mucko in the cop shop the kid thinks mucko got biters up his ezel when kliu ticket come by him and he whiffed her off somewhere he dont have to look for her in anyway i see this femme whos digbys agent fijjing around trying to finger the smuggler so i put the ear on her and i pick up shes got her hands on ship lists and she figures the mucko passed his daughter off to harmon you know him scurf who sold snake that stale cpe so he could dump her in some never find so i figure i get to harmon first shoot him to ears with babble go where he dropped her isnt likely shell have the same kind of protection she bought on hutsarte so i need to know where harmons going and how long its gonna taker to get there when the spate of words was finished words he hoped didnt sound too much like whiners excusesfa hated whiningworm sat stiffly upright hands curled tight about the arms of the chair waiting for the blast he knew was coming it didnt come his fathers mouth shaped itself into an unconvincing smile and when he spoke it was in a tone of mild disappointment no thundering scarification no skinpeeling scarcasm sasa i had hoped for better news you done good worm you done right give me a minute ill call up what you want and pulse it through a fathers blessings on you boy the screen blanked and a moment later the keph tinged to let him know the data blip had arrived worm stirred he felt sick his father was frightened hed never seen his father frightened of anything im the last of his sons maybe and hes licking up to me so i wont go off and leave him cousins arent the same he shouldnt do that makes me feel he shouldnt do that the ship was still wellenough supplied for a couple more months of splitting but the comp on harmon had him heading for a warzone in the sakuta system so worm had another bite at kliu credit and topped off at the university transfer station still uncertain about his father replaying the call worrying over every word watching his fathers every expression trying to convince himself it wasnt fear he was seeing but only the result of the purge fa had just been through he headed for the limit and the twoweek journey to the mouse cluster the beacon started pulsing again four hours after his journey had begun and the pulse stayed with him the locator showing it behind and off to one side so that was why university someone there had told the spy where to find harmon and she was going for him worm set the keph to fiddling the exit point until he was above the ecliptic and he hoped away from any patrols he surfaced to realspace and sent kanti slipping toward the asteroid belt where he could bide unseen and do a manual reactivation of the beacon to trace the spy and slip up on her when she whipped her net over harmon he watched her come sneaking along and cheered silently as she settled in the shadow of a rock only a few shiplengths from his hidey holethough he was startled to see two ships not one lylundas little darter tucked up against the flank of a bigger one just as well the spy was into umbilicals meant he could track her some more if this didnt work out he wriggled in his seat on the good side taking lylundas ship along should mean she was expecting to run across the smuggler sometime soon on the bad side this could get real tight real fast watch how she works he thought gotta know what im going against he settled in to brood over what the spy was planning and to wait for events to unfold when he saw the spys sled come slipping through the shield round the ships worm left the chair and hurried to get himself dressed to follow her by the time he was out the lock and riding a hand impellor toward harmons ship she was already at the maintenance inlet and working on the latch that was a datapoint of sorts she knew what he knewthat it was the least regarded area on any ship forgotten or ignored until it was needed he blinked as he realized suddenly that he was as bad as everyone else at protecting kantis flank hed never thought about being boarded so hed never done anything about alarming or trapping that hatch he made a note to do it during the next trip to wherever when he reached harmons ship the spy had been inside for several minutes he was happy about that he didnt want to be treading too close upon her heels he followed the slight sounds she made and the marks in the grime on the walkway hesitated outside the hatch to the aux com if she was inside shed pick up what was happening and be waiting for him he edged back until he reached the first of the locks hed passed up cycled through and found himself in crew quarters a sixer once but little more than a stinking hole these days with the remnants of a crate in one corner a busted dolly beside it stains and scratches on the floor he eased the door open and stood listening by the crack voices came up from the hold briefly as if a hatch had opened he couldnt hear what they were saying but there was a certain urgency about it that told him the buyers had finished loading and wanted to get away from here like ten minutes ago he slid out and began making his way to bridge level what femmes this and how come you want to know the kliu bounty fool ten thousand gelders alive zip dead worm knelt in the shadows of the corridor outside the lighted arch that led onto the bridge though he could hear well enough he couldnt see either harmon or the spy kliu bounty truth isnt in the femme at least dont no not the kliu not when theyre using me to get out of paying digby trying to get out of paying me even with mort and xman too mean to put down good coin for what they could get free another datapoint she was good at laying down false tracks voice distorter too hm didnt want harmon to know she was female interesting meant she was squeamish planning to leave him alive or she wouldnt bother he blinked as he heard her buying the truth of harmons denial why it didnt make sense ee dont leave me tied like this time keyed harmon so contemplate your sins and worm got to his feet and hurried as silently as he could to the galley accessway ducking into it as he heard the sound of running feet harmon was tugging at the ties and cursing with a deplorable lack of imagination as worm walked in he stopped scowled at worm what you doing here got the same question you been hearing wheres the woman i told him and ill tell you i dont know shays about no femme thats what you said yeh maybe she believed you me i dont so were gonna find out the hard way she uhhuh delicate little femme barely old enough to vote like they say whipped you good worm stepped close pushed the shotgun against harmons neck and triggered it when the babble had him worm leaned close spoke slowly and carefully a woman was brought aboard your ship no woman no you were told to take her somewhere no told told nothing where did you take her no woman nowhere where did you go when you left hutsart the accord why the pay for cargo transfer on hutsartd with what i got laid aside it was enoughto buy loan and stock make contract with yobany fitz get back in business zolll she was right and shell be hitting her other leads now id better he shoved the shotgun into his belt sac scowled at harmon you know me and youre worsen mort for holding a grudge till it squalls sorry bout this harm but i gotta protect myself im all fas got till i can ransom mort and xman he took hold of harmons hair and used his cutter to slice neatly through the dealers throat then he collected the satchel of coin that the spy hadnt bothered to take and went running for the nearest lock the soft squeal of the locator was the only thing that kept him sane in the next month he spent following the spy first there was the tricky deacon pit which he didnt understand at all until after she took off from there information thats what it was she was looking for something and she found out where it was hope rising he followed the beacons intermittent squeal until she surfaced at an out of the way world in the callidara pseudo cluster bol mutiar his chart told him and the keph said restricted world rated purple on the danger scale further information interdicted which raised his brows up to his hairline he hid in the shadow of a moon and watched the paired ships come round beneath him the smugglers ship jerked then began to move away tractor shove and the umbilicals cut zolls teeth that has to mean that the smugglers here ive got to get down there no more waiting ive got to drop a loop on both of them before the spy cuts out on me again he chewed on his lip as he watched a lander emerge from the side of the spys ship wondering if he should drop a sticktight inside before he went maybe she wasnt like him maybe she had the maintenance hatch trapped she thought of things but if she got away from him this time no if she got away this time it was over shed head straight back for digby digby would call the kliu and collect his fee and mort would be dead two heartbeats afterward as soon as the shields flared as the lander hit atmosphere worm went arcing away he hit atmosphere twenty minutes later landed kanti on a barren islet just big enough to hold her bonded the eye to its zipper sled and sent it racing toward the place where the lander touched down as he watched her walk toward the children playing on the beach he thought about activating one of the eyes darts and killing her then but she hadnt found the smuggler yet and a world is a big place to search and she was a better searcher than he was and she knew things he didnt he watched her face change as she seemed to absorb the langue the children were speaking though he couldnt make any sense of it in less than a heartbeat she was talking back to them and being understood talent word is digby likes talent buys it wherever he can i bet she can truthtell too and thats why she believed or harmon without worrying about babbling him no wonder its her digby sent spins lies quickern a menaviddan spins web and looks through your lies like youre made out of glass when she went back to the lander alone he started the eye home and chewed on his lip until kantis screen showed her taking the lander up and hovering in the clouds shes looking for something those kids told her something not enough i think but something through the eye which was hovering in the fronds of a tree he watched the local messing with some sand while the spy crouched beside him after a while he understood what the man was doing he was making an island a particular island once again worm thought about darting the woman but he still wasnt sure it was better to wait until he was actually looking at lylunda he couldnt understand what they were saying so that island map could mean anything and hed already made too many wrong choices the spy bowed and walked back to the lander the local looked at the map his face troubled then he smeared it out with his foot and went the other way along the beach uneasy worm called the eye back hoping he had time to reclaim it as he watched the lander shoot for the horizon worm swore and pushed the flikit after it the flikit was a lot slower than a lander so he didnt dare go back to his ship or wait for the eye to come home or even stop to scoop it up as he passed over it in the time any of that would take she could drop the loop on lylunda and be on her way off planet there was enough fuel left in the zipper sled to take it around the world and back so he set the call and concentrated in getting the most speed he could out of the flikit while keeping a wary eye on the screen watching for any sign of the lander the chase seemed to go on forever across the mostly empty sea though he overtook and left behind several large sailboats since the spy had ignored them he did also he passed over several islands most of them with locals doing this and that on the beaches and in the villages ignored these then he saw an island he recognized the one the local had sculptedand a good job it was too hed got the coast just right that spine of mountains like bony teeth the thick jungle round the base of those teeth the wide apron of pale yellow sand and belly down on that sand the lander and a short distance off two women talking he clicked the mufflers on dipped to tree level using the fronds as a sketch of a screen cranked up the visuals and focused on the women lylunda all right looking angry upset sitting with a drum held between her hands staring out at the sea as the spy talked to her he ground his teeth if only he hadnt deployed the eye the last time if hed just kept it with him he could listen to what they were saying he could kill the spy stun lylunda and get off this stinking mudball on the other hand they could be talking local jabber be just his luck cutter in one hand worm began easing closer keeping as low as possible the fronds of the treetops brushing against the side of the flikit as he crept past them he had to be careful he didnt want the spy sheltering herself behind lylunda the closer he could get before she noticed him the less chance shed have to think up something nasty the spy turned and began trotting toward the lander she was inside before worm had time to react she fired up the lifters and took off she was leaving she had the woman and she let her go and now she was gone all he could think of was that lylunda had given her the information the kliu wanted so the spy didnt have to take the trouble to carry her off sick with anger worm brought the flikit down on the sand piled out of it and ran to lylunda he jerked her to her feet started shaking her what did you tell her what tell me what you told her he coughed saw flecks of red splatter her face but that didnt matter he shook her some more not giving her a chance to answer him shouting the same questions over and and over she broke his hold with an ease that surprised him he hadnt expected her to be that strong worm sit down just sit down her voice was soothing and it only increased his rage he reached for her again but she stepped between his arms slapped her open hands against his shoulders and a moment later he was flat on his back staring up at the sky wondering what had happened she knelt beside him a sadness in her eyes that he hadnt expected that youre here tells me why youre here she said it took him a while to sort out the sense of that she waited for him to understand then she went on if you keep being angry at me and trying to hurt me i cant help you what his throat was raw and trying to talk made his head dizzy help me didnt your keph warn you she helped him sit up he couldnt believe how weak he was how suddenly that weakness had flooded through him this is a deadly world if you dont know how to cope with it help me on my feet i have to get back to my ship theres an ottodoc in it that wont work you know you should let me take you into the village no the flikit i got to get back to my ship all right if thats what you want take my hand she pulled him up set his arm about her shoulders and helped him stagger over to the flikit when they reached it he grabbed onto her wrist and with remnants of his strength fueled by desperation he tried to pull her into the flikit she wrenched her arm free slapped at his hand when he reached for her again if you managed to get me in there wed both be dead before we left the ground what what are you talking about he barely got the words out before a fit off coughing seized him and nearly turned him inside out what what whats happening be quiet its the only chance be qui the darkness closed round him cutting off her words he woke inside a room somewhere stretched out on a hard lumpy bed his face was a sticky mess and there was a foul taste in his mouth lylunda was sitting in a chair beside him a bowl in her hands youll live she said but i dont know if ive done you any favor feeding you the tung akar did you need money that much worm that youd come here to earn it not money he said speaking hurt his throat but he wanted her to understand i need you to trade for my brothers thats the price the kliu put on your head mort and xman theyve got them theyre going to hang mort if i dont bring you back or bring back what you know you told the spy why cant you tell me the spy thats what you call her i made a bargain with her but i havent told her anything not yet a blissful ease spread through him there was time there was still time all he had to do was get his strength back he closed his eyes and let sleep take him familywhere you go when theres no help for it message drone to wolffaleytys greybond from ship backhoeshadith written message not recorded lee i need your help its touchy since digby is moving to compete with hunters and im on a job for him but youre the only one i think can do what has to be done i dont want to make a comcall hence this letter im heading for wolff on the off chance that youre home and that you can help im in the callidara so itll be a while i know this is vague but im just letting you know im coming with a problem weve got to talk about shadith reread what shed written wrinkling her nose youre really getting paranoid shadow just because this is digbys ship it doesnt have to mean hes watching everything you do uhhuh maybe no maybe so i like that playful little git but hm think about it shadow what are you really seeing there is the digby you know just a face he puts on to charm you she shook her head dropped the cargo shell into the drone insert keyed in the destination and sent the drone on its way to wolff it would get there in a few days rather than the weeks it would take her to make the journey drones didnt split like ships it was some other quicker way they took but no one knew exactly how they worked even on the hegger world where they were invented and manufactured message drone to ship backhoeshadith from wolffaleytys greybond written message not recorded my my arent we being cautious this is the second time youve written instead of sending a voice flake whats up shadow as to me i havent had ahunt for two years now and theres no prospect of action anywhere in sight well deal with conflicts of interest if and when their ugly heads pop up ill be delighted to see you how long has it been three years four you wont recognize lilai shes such a big girl now ill your cue shadow and wont bother with questions about this mysterious business until i can ask them to your face but dont you dawdle you hear youve got my curiosity steaming shadith set the flit down in the paved patio on the south side of aleytys house she left her gearsac in it and moved along the path that led round to the front door flowers bloomed everywhere in the frantic exuberance of the brief summer of these latitudes and the vines were overgrowing the windows again aside from the chirping of the hoard of meuttertiks moving in and out of their mud nests plastered on the wall up by the roof and the whisper of a halfhearted breeze through the conifers a deep and peaceful silence spread like a quilted comforter over the place she palmed the doors latch sensor raised her brows when it didnt open just triggered a recording shadow come round to the stables lilais having a riding lesson aleytys was leaning on the fence watching her daughters lesson lilai was a redhaired eightyearold a thin and wiry girl with eyes too big for her face she was perched on the back of a black gelding moving at a walk her face intent as she listened to the old man who stood in the center of the ring lee aleytys turned her head smiled at shadith and waved her over you made good time she said keeping her voice low so she wouldnt distract horse and rider look at that little flea like she was born in the saddle i was remembering my first ride i cant believe how ignorant i was good thing i had the mind touch or that poor beast would have shucked me in three steps and gone home to his herd watch your shoulders thats better soften the wrists chuff chuff from the gelding dull clop of his hooves tinkclink of the bridle one way or another weve had our fling with horses lee me i remember the ride across half of ibex lilai is looking good how long has she been having lessons canter right lead two years now shes been crazy about horses since she started walking id look up from something i was trying to get done and there shed be heading for the pasture or plowing through snow to the barn so i found maestre vassil hired him to teach her and gave her anew god aleytys chuckled then shook her head i dont know what im going to do when she gets a few years older shadith smiled at the poorly concealed pride in aleytys voice considering who her mother is head up not so much leg better yes yes keep your mind on what youre doing better keep going aleytys sighed i keep hoping greys part in her is strong enough to give her a little common sense walk wrong lead thats better shoulders is he out on a hunt hes more or less given up on hunting canyli heldeen is thinking seriously of retiring as head and grey wants the job i complicate his maneuvers she moved her shoulders so i stay as far away from the council and politics as i can manage which means hes gone a lot lee if my being here makes problems i dont think so and even if it did i wouldnt care shadow you and swarda and harskari are my family and not going to let that bunch of pinch noses erase you from my life once more yes yes watch your wrists good thats enough for today take him in there was a whispered violence in aleytys words and shadith sensed a darkness in her that she hadnt seen before was there trouble between her and grey or maybe a crisis in the uncertain peace between her and the other wolfflans mouth twisted into a wry halfsmile aleytys patted her arm not to worry shadow shadith snorted put two empaths together and conversation can get more complicated that a menaviddan web maze aleytys smile broadened we might as well go in lilais going to be busy a while polishing tack and cleaning out stalls she shook her head dont have to get after her to do it she loves it loves everything that smells of horse the screens were engaged and the windows open the evening breeze blowing along the living room lilai was in her room working with the tutor circuit shadith and aleytys sat drinking tea and watching the setting sun color the shrunken snow pack on the mountain peaks aleytys set down her cup with a sharp click all right shadow stop wallowing in guilt and tell me what this is about have you ever heard of a world called bol mutiar no thats in the callidara ive never been there it gets a bit iffy here if you were anyone else i dont think well youre not so here it is she sketched her line of investigation and what shed discovered the mistakes shed made the talk she had with the drummer the final conversation with lylunda shes desperate shadith ran the heels of her hands back and forth along the leather chair arms needing a way to vent the pressure that had built up in her i got to know her rather well while i was tracking her lee she was smart tenacious independent it hurt seeing whatd happened to her as if the lylunda shed been was being eaten away and someone else was being poured into empty places she slapped her hands on the leather shes watching it happen lee fighting it and losing and losing and losing gods whatever else happens i want to break her free of that world and you want me to purge her of that tung akar and whatever else thats got its claws in her thats it lee shadith passed her hand over her hair then looked at the palm i suspect theres something in the air a virus maybe an organism of some kind and the tung akar keeps it benign as long as theres some kind of balance the longer you stay the more delicate the balance and sometimes the organism hits a reproductive high thats triggered by who knows what and it consumes the person a collective intelligence there was something there i could feel it pressing at me not liking me much i was very glad to get away and i spent a good while in the ottodoc trying to make sure i wasnt bringing any of it with me it reads me as clean but with the story the drummer told me she shrugged grimaced how do you feel ready to wallow in the glooms otherwise healthy enough hm im not picking up anything peculiar but in a moment i want you to let me check you over whats the other thing thats worrying you aleytys clicked her tongue when shadith raised her brows a rather obvious deduction shadow you didnt need to tell me all that just to persuade me to help get the woman off bol mutiar its the taalav array my job is to find out where they are and give the location to digby to pass on but if i do theyll be destroyed i cant let that happen lee him its possible theyve already died you know intelligent or not transferring a complex species to a new environment is apt to be chancy you have to think about that i hope not itd make things a lot easier for me but i really dont want them to be dead ive quit this job lee i just havent told digby yet talking with him wouldnt work maybe you could come to an arrangement would you really expect digby to kiss his fee goodbye just because one of his shovels has a qualm or two shovel hmp id get bored with that the second time i heard it aleytys inspected her cup refilled it from the samovar right i know that must have been sheltered here too longgrowing illusions like weeds the sooner we see about lylunda the better so well take my ship you can leave the company ship in the tiedown upstairs harskari called last week she and loguisse have been ambling about she chuckled looking for trouble if you ask me shes coming by here next week if you dont mind once weve left ill call her back and tell her to meet us at bol mutiar she got to her feet id better go tell lilai she cant come with me this time i dont want her anywhere near that virus or whatever it is she smiled shook her head i wont get an argument this time mothers are way down on the list of important beings vassil has the place of honor she left trailing an aura of jealousy and pain and amusement turned on herself and interest shadith stretched out in her chair put her feet up on the hassock harskari thats good shell know if storsten would work for the taalav i still have to talk to them first find out what they want storsten the next world out from vrithiana heavyworld in the same range as pillory its largest life forms were wormlike grazers with chitinous armor to protect them from smaller and faster predators like dogsized scorpions since vrithian had never been located by outsiders in all the centuries of vryhh existence the taalav would be safe there she was pleased with herself for coming up with that idea hm itd be a hoot if the kliu swooped down on the smugglers planet with death and destruction in mind and ran into a pair of vryhh ships standing guard she giggled at the thought of the kliu pulling up in consternation when harskari snapped a beam across their bow and told them to get out or get ashed a tridda comic that of course it wouldnt happen too boring for harskari she dipped a finger in her cup the tea was cold she looked at the samovar sighed and set the cup down she didnt really want more tea outside the sun had vanished taking most of the color with it except for a last fugitive gleam lighting the needle peaks for a moment she envied aleytys thishouse but only for a moment lee had paid a price for it and was still paying im not willing to do that not yet anyway i wish i knew what was wrong here i wish i knew if i should do something about digby wish could do something about the taalav get all of them someplace where theyd be safe shadow i called grey hell be home in a bit um id like to talk to him here neutral territory as it were would you mind no problem if youre doing the transport i should probably get back to the ship make sure ive got everything i need hell want to say hello you dont have to leave yet all right i doubt that lee i truly do last time i was here youd need a qscan to measure the amount of welcome he was putting out she knew aleytys could read her skepticism she was sorry for that but there was nothing she could do about it let me take a look at you now hm see what you brought away from your visit to that world if anything stretch out on the couch you know the routine as lees fingers moved lightly over her shadith was aware of heat and an uneasiness so faint she could barely feel itan uneasiness that was not part of her but something else there was a sudden flare of intense pain which vanished almost as soon as it began then only the familiar lassitude from the deep relaxation lees touch induced when she was finished aleytys got to her feet worked her shoulders you had some visitors in a few cells cysted and dormant didnt like it when i poked at them but youre clean now akh horrid thought shadith sat up two years since your last hunt canyli took grey on as her second around then funny how it happens a quick unhappy twist of her mouth then aleytys walked to the window and stood looking out at the developing stars suddenly there were no suitable assignments dont make a fuss he says ive seen whats been available he says you wouldnt want any of them he says maybe so two years its nothing a snap of the fingers weve had problems before but weve worked them out now he looks at me now he looks in the mirror and he sees an aging man while i dont change when he cant handle it any longer he stays in town or at his own place ive tried shadow he wont talk to me or let me i cant i dont want to let this fall apart i think something broke in him that time on avosing you were there sometimes i hate you for that shadow that you were there and i wasnt i think more than anything thats why i had lilai and of course there is lilai and i remember what it felt like when i knew my own mother had run away and left me and you were there shadow still in the diadem that time on cazarit you remember when i begged stavver to let me talk to shari my son you remember shari wouldnt talk to me my son wouldnt even let me look at him i cant let that happen with lilai happily ever after the old stories say well when its really ever after happily goes out the door shadith hadnt turned thelights on after the sunset watch so aleytys was a shadow against the faint flicker of the bug screen she lifted an arm and shadith thought she rubbed at her eyes but she couldnt be sure greys coming hell be landing in a few minutes shadow would you do me a favor and clear away the tea things ive got to wash my face and get myself set for this when grey walked into the room shadith was shocked sometime in the years since shed last seen him hed turned into a pinched old mannot old in the body exactly his hair was still mostly dark his muscles werefirm his hands steady when he walked there was no shortening of his stride the sense of age lay in the stiffness with which he held himself the expression on his face and the fragility she felt inside him the joys gone out of him she thought lo grey she said and managed a smile to go with the greeting shadith he was polite controlled youre looking well and its good to see you grey lee tells me youre possibly in line for the job as head best of luck will you be staying long theres a shooting party next week we could arrange an invitation thanks but this is just a dropby ill be leaving tomorrow and id best go get ready to do that she smiled and went out knowing he was looking after her with barely repressed anger as shadith was doing a last runthrough of her kephalos files checking to see if there was anything else she should download to transfer over to aleytys tigatri the announcer tinged to let her know she had an incoming call aleytys face had a brittle quietness shadow im coming up to tigatri in an hour would you be ready to transfer by then fine ive about got things wrapped up here let me know when youre in and ill sled across will do shadith scowled at the screen shook her head i say goodbye to my sisters ghosts and now lees life is starting to break up i never thought how much it meant knowing she was here a place i could always come back to allerased or will be in a few years not a place i want to visit after this no digby no job no idea what i want to do funny how its all happening at the same time the flux is fluxing royally she sighed got wearily to her feet and went to start packing the bubblesled for the transfer to the other ship tigatris prime mobile waited at the lock to greet her welcome aboard shadow your quarters are ready for you is there anything you need immediately llo abra no all that gear can be stowed she took the flake case from her belt sac if these could be read into the kephalos id appreciate it of course simply stowed or do you wish tzgatri to comment comments would be more than welcome along with any data you have on bol mutiar and she might check the flakes for sneaky hitchhikers hm and my other gear too for the same thing understood she stepped onto the skimmer flat beside the mobile and hummed through melting mutating interior space until walls stabilized about her and she was standing in a pleasant ordinary room much like her apartment on university your gear has been put away doll will be your serviteur if any questions occur she will have the answers for you you are free of all areas of the ship except for the archiras quarters abra bowed with liquid grace and was gone the last time shed seen tigatris prime mobile hed looked rather like grey that was gone now he might have been a twin to swarda if hed had anything resembling flesh that startled her and when she thought about it a little depressed her because it told her more than she wanted to know about the way things were going between aleytys and grey gatri was sensitive to aleytys moods because her kephalos was configured to be in part ampduplicate of lees mindbrain and it was that which took care of abras appearance it wasnt a good sign to see aleytys wiping grey away so completely and retreating symbolically at least to the days before she settled on wolff when she still had that drive to find her mother and a place where she could fit in doll whats the estimated travel time to bol mutiar four days nine hours doll was a small delicate mobile with huge eyes and daintily pointed ears she was a remnant from the time when aleytys old enemy kell had owned this ship an image dredged up from who knew what corner of that vryhhs twisted psyche her only changes were interior she no longer cringed when you spoke to her but grinned like a happy child how much of that was illusion born of programming how much a result of the al doll shared with the ship was something shadith didnt know and didnt worry about tell me what tigatri knows about the tung organism on bol mutiar the organism is indeed a collective awareness its intelligence unmeasurable but probably not much above the higher animals it is rather more complex than you assumed that which exists within the tung akar produces toxins which slow the rate of reproduction to tolerable levels within the bodies of the hosts as long as the host is in contact with the totality remove the host from such contact and the organism will reproduce in such numbers that it will eat the body one must spend more than a day or two on the surface for the organism to invade all the cells of the body which is why the archira only discovered the fragments cysted and dormant in you shadow there is a single exception to that if a host is attacked or seriously threatened by a nonhost the collective awareness reacts to protect the host by a massive invasion of the attackers body this counterstroke is usually fatal would it count an attempt to remove a host from the surface as a threat yes how quickly would it strike the moment it felt the loss as a speculation this might occur at some arbitrary location within the atmosphere perhaps that point where the density of the ambient organisms approaches nil vindictive little merds kill the hosts to get the attacker as i said it is not a particularly intelligent organism hm might be possible to construct a warning device with a bit of lylundas blood in it when the organism begins its explosive growth pattern yes that would be possible i would suggest a more sensitive warning device already exists in your empathic response it seems quite likely that you will sense its agitation before the multiplication actually begins maybe so but it never hurts to have a backup so if youd construct such a device and have it ready for charging with the blood ill do that and work on a plan that will let us take lylunda offworld without getting ourselves killed in the process im thinking this is going to be very complicated yes i will do that shadith sighed and i hope youll come up with something better than the mishmash ive been churning out take me to the garden ive got a song starting in my head and it wants to come out aleytys drifted into the garden space lowered herself onto a boulder and sat with her feet in the running stream shadith looked at the words shed just written sighed and slashed a line through them the black ink from the stylo canceling out another failed attempt she set the pad down let the stylo click home in its magnetic holder lee sorry if im interrupting wasnt getting anywhere anyway figured out how were going to do this tigatris been reconfiguring a lander shes set up a cleanroom where the air can be changed every few minutes dumped outside the ship with fields around it to block anything getting back in we go down you identify lylunda for me we get her into that room and head for changeover fast as we can punch it abra blows all air in the lander except for whats in the room with us with the air exchange going i cleanout lylunda probably you too this time myself as needed we should be flushed sufficiently clear by the time we reachtigatri to be sure of this abra will scan lylunda on the way up get some subcellular mugshots of the organism and tigatri will run a full scan on the lander do another clean on it before she lets us onboard then we do a quick jump to one of the outer planets in the system link with harskari and loguisse and head for the destination lylunda gives us might be a good idea not to let her know about harskari and your plans for the arrays what shedoesnt know she cant babble hm shadith felt uneasy silence shouted questions she didnt want to ask but every subject she thought about bringing up seemed worse than silence did you ask harskari about storsten as a new home for the arrays not yet lets leave that until weve pulled lylunda out all right youre sure about quitting digby im sure i managed to keep faith with myself and him last time but it was a shaky peace i made and this one this is really a simple job he said that and its true in a little while ill have the answer he needs to collect his fee i need to be able to do that lee she sighed but the taalav arent beasts theyre people they make songs and i like them i suppose that shouldnt make a difference but it does would you do as much for them if they were little horrors i like to think i would but who knows shadith rolled onto her back laced her fingers over her ribs and stared up at the blue shimmer meant to represent sky with you and harskari helping me theres half a chance i can pull this one out the next though she sighed its better if there is no next hmp university is all right for a while but too confining over time musics necessary but not enough and in a year or two im going to need a way to make enough money to keep my ship going my agent on helvetia is doing fairly well with the coin i left with him but i cant live on the income for long swardas found his niche and hes happy with it why cant i is that a real question i suppose not she turned her head lee what are you going to do nothing until lilai leaves for university another nine years maybe ten depends on how she matures after she passes puberty grey will be living in his house shell move between the two of us has she inherited the vryhh long life harskaris been after me to have cell studies made ive put it off i dont really want to know easier on all three of us if i dont he asks me that you know every year or so shes his daughter too i want him to love her not resent her and i wont lie to him so no tests until lilai herself does the asking what about talents early days for that took me a while to grow into mine you know right now all she wants is horses hm i just had a disturbing thought what if lylunda elang decides she doesnt need to keep her bargain hah thats a cheerful one i dont like using it because its so apt to do more damage than you expect but ill pump her full of babble and pry the answer out of her i was wondering whether all this fussing about morality means ill dither about resplitting split hairs something like that no that comes under notnice but notfatal and itll get the job done hinnumn aleytys moved her feet in the little stream lifting them at intervals so drops of water cascaded musically from her heels into the rush of the current the minutes slid past in a deepening silence on the other bank of the stream shadith lay watching the blue of the pseudo sky and the small creatures flying about in it two of them looked like tiny green and gold dragons and were swooping in interlocked figure eights others were small bright birds silver and blue and crimson and a dark metallic green with trailing silky tail feathers and elaborate crests there were soft brown moths that sang more sweetly than any bird around her in the grass and the ferns that grew under the trees she heard small rustles sometimes saw redbrown squirrels run up a crackled trunk the whisper of the stream and the tink tink tink of the drips falling from aleytys feet crept into shadiths bones and soothed away the worry and uncertainty after a while she slept waiting lylunda looked up as one of the village girls came into the house hes worn out he should sleep for a good while now whats your name delala drummer she came across the room her bare feet silent on the mat he looks like just a boy dont let that fool you delala hes clever and rather dangerous lylunda stood get him into the bond as soon as you can oh well do that in any case omel oma i leave him in your care theres lung stew simmering on thestove soon as he stirs get some more of it down him ill look in again before the beronta leaves lylunda left the guest house and walked down to the beach where the flikit sat like a metallic cricket already starting to corrode tudil was waiting for her standing beside a small sailing canoe pulled up on the sand she waved to him see you at the edge of the deep she called he laughed edge of the deep he pulled the canoe out into the water swung himself inside with the liquid ease that still amazed her after he got the sail up he went running straight out to sea the canoe bobbing up and down like a rubber toy as it lifted and fell with the waves lylunda waited until all she could see was the tip of the mast then she climbed into the flikit you or me worm she said as she took it up with this out of the way she patted the arm of the pilots chair by the time you can get back to your ship you wont want to and ill be gone one way or another ill be gone she caught up with the canoe slowed down and drifted along ahead of it until tudil dropped sail tossed a sea anchor overside and turned into the wind blessing worms habit of keeping his tools meticulously maintained she clipped the lift harness around her took the flikit spiraling up until she thought she was high enough she disabled the altitude interlock started the flikit racing down a long slant toward the surface of the water a slant pointed away from tudil and the canoe a moment later she ejected and went tumbling away from the machine the lift harness was set to worms weight he was thin and short without a lot of muscle mass so her heavier body plunged swiftly enough to put a lump in her throat but it let her reach the water before the flikit did the flotation bubbles deployed and she began kicking toward the canoe the hit as tudil reached for her he got her inside made her crouch beside the mast hang onto that we gonna be jumping he got the sail up cut the drag and ran farther out to sea letting the swell from the crash lift the canoe and thrust it onward the sun set before they got back to shore as she stumbled from the canoe lylunda could hear the beronta drums sounding in the village they drew her but she was really too tired to answer the throb in her blood she touched tudils arm tell menget ill be sleeping in the guest house tonight we still leaving tomorrow yes after the morning market omel oma come get me when its time hm lylunda sat with worm while delala was fixing breakfast for them his face was knotted with the intensity of his sleep and he looked absurdly like a baby shed have felt worse for him if he and his brother hadnt used zombi on her xman hah exi exinta what an idiot ploy that was she couldnt see much resemblance worm and the xman must have had different mothers the other brother was a convict on pillory not a political she shivered if you werent a political governments sent you to pillory because they didnt do death and cringed at the thought that youd ever get loose i think its probably just as well for the universe if your mort stays right where he is he stirred a little at the sound of her voice his mouth worked he closed one hand into a fist pressed it against his lips and settled back to sleeping she leaned over him pinched his earlobe he woke reluctantly scowling at her you dont talk pandai she said and im leaving so i want to be sure you know what youre into here make up your mind to it if you live and i think you probably will youll never leave bol mutiar again theres something in the air a virus or something like that the pandai call it the tung bond for what thats worth make it mad and itll eat you alive from the inside out you should know because it started to do just that yesterday when you grabbed me remember how it felt worm and walk carefully around these folk even an ottodocs no good so dont count on that the pandai on this island will take care of you its called keredel by the way and the pandai here call themselves kerdela ive explained about your brothers and why you were trying to attack me theyre good people and are really sorry about whats going to happen to you though they cant do anything about it the flikit is at the bottom of the ocean i did that so dont blame the locals the girl who will be bringing your breakfast is called delala remember the bond and treat her nice goodbye worm he shoved himself up and tried to grab her but he was too weak and fainted instead tudil came while she was still in the kitchen drinking the last of the tea luna menget says you should come now theres a storm blowing up and we need to get clear of land before it hits when worm woke a second time a pretty smiling girl was bending over him washing his face with a cool cloth she fetched a cup of water lifted his head and helped him drink delala he said she giggled ngar ngi she said delala kau tkoy ak she touched his brow repeated kau tkoy ak worm he said guessing at her meaning though it seemed obvious enough warrum she said and giggled again ak moi er a tiktut she patted his knee nga mengii he watched her trot from the room listened to the soft pat of her bare feet as she went somewhere to do something his whole body hurt and he was so weak he couldnt stand it was enough to make anyone sink especially when hed done it to himself coming here like this without even wondering why the spy took off without lylunda when all she had to do was put out her hand and take her mort and xman hed killed them no way to get around that his father was going to get hoiked out of his place because who could defend the stead now cousins was all and cousins dont have the same blood bonds cousins betrayed you all the time his eyes burned with tears that wouldnt stop coming he was shamed but he couldnt stop that crying delala came in clicked her tongue and began talking at him he didnt understand a word of it and that just made the misery worse she helped him sit up and empty his bladder into a pitcher of some kind it was odd when he was wrung dry below he stopped leaking from his eyes she washed his penis and his hands eased him back onto the bed pulled the sheet over him and trotted out again carrying the pitcher with her when she returned she lifted his head and made him drink something hot and stinking he almost threw it up again but by the time shed got the mugful of slop down him the woe had retreated somewhere over the horizon it was still there but he was too numb to feel it after she went out for the third time he lay staring at the ceiling trying not to think then he sighed im sorry fa im sorry mort im sorry xmae youll have to get on however you can another sigh he let heavy eyelids droop shut and in a moment was asleep early in the morning a little over a month after leaving keredel lylunda looked up from the mezu she was washing and saw a strange lander go whispering by overhead its shadow slipping like a bird across the beronta a bird with stubby wings and a flared tail the woman has come for you mengets voice she hadnt heard the drummer approach but he was very light on his feet for such a big man lylunda was annoyed though she tried not to show it here was another case of the bond stripping her privacy from her what one pandai knew they all knew as if the bond thought something and those thoughts were echoed in all pandai minds i didnt expect her so soon you sure yes well be making landfall in three hours if the wind stays steady the island oreallin the woman will be waiting for you there he set his hand lightly on her head she could feel the warmth of it through her hair omel oma i dont know what to think about this you arenthappy with us and you make the bond itch with your fighting against it yet you are enough of the bond that im afraid she knows about that she said she might have a way if you can go well miss you luna youve taught us as much as youve learned and were grateful for that dont forget us or your drumming though ill ask you to leave the drum behind it is of the bond he tapped her head lightly and went away lylunda bent over the scrub board rubbing the mezu up and down up and down it working absently her eyes fixed on the water beyond the rail around her she could hear babies crying women and girls gossiping as they repaired sails and prepared food for the one large meal spread out at midafternoon men gossiping as they mended nets and worked at the constant maintenance it took to keep the beronta in good order boys chasing each other across the deck and through the riggingthe thousand sounds large and small that shed got used to in the months shed spent on the remeydang already she felt separated from them and impatient to be gone the things shed found pleasant a day before were suddenly so restrictive that she was choking on them as she wrung out the mezu and got to her feet to hang it on the line stretched from the cabin overhang to the rail she murmured to herself naked i came from my mothers womb naked i go forth from this second womb and the only thing ill miss is my drum the beeper in her hand lylunda walked along the beach shadith was waiting beside the lander but she wasnt alone a redhaired woman a handspan taller stood beside her lylunda wondered about this woman but tried not to let hope get too strong a hold if this fell through the loss of that hope would kill her as she got closer she could feel the tung stirring in her the bond didnt like that redhead and the closer she got the more it started fighting her she took two more steps then stopped about two body lengths from the lander unable to walk closer the tung cramping her muscles and threatening nausea shadith spoke are you willing to come with us lylunda el ang t lylunda understood the formality in the words an offered contract when she tried to speak though her throat knotted and she couldnt make a sound she managed a nod before her whole body froze on her i take that as agreement my companion is aleytys the hunter from wolff if youre heard of her you know that shes a healer if anyone can keep you alive she will aleytys the halfvryhh lylunda thought maybe i will make it she started shaking her eyes watered until she couldnt see much but blurs her stomach jerked and hot vomit filled her mouth a moment later she felt hands on her someone stripped the mezu away someone grabbed her arms and pulled her toward the lander as she stumbled and nearly fell someone swore then hands were lifting her carrying her words came through the roar in her ears abra go broad straps are drawn tight over her body metallic clunks as they are locked down something hard and heavy on her mouth collecting her spew and suctioning it away words hang on a moment shadow soon as ive finished here hands on her pain worse than the last time shed drunk the cherar infusion knives scraping along her bones muscles cramping trying to throw her into convulsions straps holding her bruising her coughing vomit hot in her mouth sucked away again emptying herself into the sucking machine wind hurricane driving across her snatching her breath from her nostrils no wind again the wind no wind again the tung desperate in her clawing at her as it is driven forth she hangs on feeling the tung torn out of her between one breath and the next there was no more pain aleytys hands were warm on her feeding her strength pouring life into her body she was strong again as full of energy as a berry with juice she opened her eyes looked up into that bluegreen gaze thanks aleytys smiled wearily its not done yet not quite rest a while ill be back to you in a minute lylunda turned her head to watch and was appalled at what she saw shadith lay on a cot like hers strapped down an ugly gray and ocher fungus grew in patches on her face and body some of it even on her eyes blood trickled from her nose and mouth with each labored breath she was shuddering and moaning and the moment aleytys set her hands on her she screamed with her mouth and her whole body she screamed spewing blood and bits of rotten flesh over the healers face the hurricane roared again air exchange expelling the organism as aleytys killed it and drove it from the body it was like watching a replay of what had happened to her only seeing it from the outside this time lylunda coughed and was afraid the infection was in her again growing in her exploding through her it wasnt fair she was clean a moment ago it wasnt faiiir an eternity later wellbeing returned to her lylunda watched aleytys lean into the harness that she wore to keep her in place during the rush of the air exchange her face had a faint webbing of fatigue lines that made her look for a moment as if she were a thousand years old her body was slumped in utter exhaustion without opening her eyes she said sterilize abra its time a mellow baritone voice answered heard and done archira the pumps hummed again and in seconds the room was filled with a gas that stank and stung like pepper essence lylundas eyes teared and her body felt as if she were being whipped with nettles the baritone voice sounded again take several deep breaths lylunda elang it will be painful but it is necessary she grimaced but followed instructions thank you lylunda elang the pumps hummed again and the gas was drawn out she sucked in cool clean air and thought that no pleasure would ever be as great aleytys unsnapped the harness and moved alongside shadith undoing the latches that held the straps in place when shed finished and was turning to do the same with lylundas straps shadith sat up stretched and groaned merd lee thats nasty stuff that organism whatsit whew i definitely dont want to go through that again agreed the jilitera can have that world without any complaintfrom me aleytys straightened after shed dealt with the last catch abra if youve finished sterilizing the rest of the lander send doll with the clothing i set aside for us were ready to berth archira the outside clean was finished a moment ago good the clothes please the robe aleytys handed lylunda was a silky material that seemed to caress her skin as she drew it on a dark blue that changed tones with liquid grace as it moved with her she stroked the sleeve sighed avrishum expensive enough to pay rent on a tiedown slot for several months the robe shadith was tying on was a dark crimson and aleytys was a dark green and im about to visit a vryhh ship walking into one legend with another strolling before me wearing the finest avrishum daddy dear would die to be here she grinned as she followed the two women from the cleanroom this time there was no lock to tumble through only a melting wall that put them onto a skimmer flat that might have been stationary while the ship dissolved and reformed about them or might have carried them through a liquefying chaos until they were in another place what solidified around them was a room that looked like images shed seen in triddas about forgotten times paneled with rich carved wood and shelves with books on them large leather chairs scattered about elbow tables by each one there were other larger tables a soft dark green rug on the floor a fireplace with a screen in front of it wood burning on firedogs the sound perfect snapping and crackling as sparks flew the steady hiss of the fire on shipboard it was so out of place it shouted luxury even more than the avrishum aleytys and shadith turned to her then shadith was the one who spoke youre free now lylunda elang weve paid your price where did you take the taalav array solutions in the screen aleytys had called into existence blanking out one wall of the library the world at destination code kld mlyd was a cold stony planet roughly equivalent to pillory in size and surface gravity but colder and harsher the sun had a greenish cast and was smaller and paler than pillorys crimson star shadith raised her brows as she examined the star chart displayed at one side of the screen the xenobis choice was only two systems over from hutsarte lylunda sighed i thought that was deliciously ironic the first few days after i got back home if they only knew i thought not so funny now with a flick of her hand aleytys banished the screen shadow why dont you get lylunda settled in tigatris belle is waiting in your quarters lylunda shes been assigned to you as serviteur and will show you how to move about the ship the public areas have been programmed to accept you the room rippled around aleytys an instant later she was gone lylunda brushed her hand across her eyes that is weird come on our slide flat is disguised as that throwrug over there its lees ship so she doesnt need one but tigatri doesnt sublimn to us like she does to her so we ride the slides actually its rather fun like a magic carpet in its sly way shadith watched lylundas eyes widen as she looked around the cabin and widen again as the mobile belle rippled into existence beside the communications complex set into a desk of dark rich wood belle was another of the elfin serviteurs her face was triangular her smile threecornered freckles were dotted across her nose and the tops of rosy cheeks like the rest of tigates mobiles her substance was more energy than matter despite that she was a warm friendly presence her voice was a deep contralto absurdly big for one so tiny anything you want lylunda elang if i can get it for you i will lylunda glanced at shadith caught her nod said well first thing call me luna of course luna whatever you wish do you have anything like a shipsuit available she smoothed her hand along her sleeve this is lovely but i dont feel comfortable lounging around in something worth a couple months of ship fuel we can do that luna belles green eyes glazed for an instant then brightened again it will be here in a few moments shadith leaned against the wall thumbs hooked over the belt to her robe you neednt worry about cost luna lee has connections and gets the stuff straight from the loom even so shadow id rather play in cutoffs or something like that um belle do you have a drum around or could you make one to my specifications one could bemade simply enough metal or wood wood if possible would you indicate dimensions and shape if you could give us a plan belle waved a hand at the communications complex theres a light stylo you could use shadith watched as lylunda sketched the drum the program turning the crude drawing into a professional plot lylunda made a few final adjustments then turned to the mobile belle how long we can have it for you by tomorrow mid diurne enough to let you try it and see if it needs adjustment belle flickered out when she returned an instant later with three shipsuits draped over her arm shadith stepped onto the slideboard luna youll want food a bath and some time to recover when youre ready have belle bring you to the garden youll like that promise you do all vryyh ships have places like this lylunda settled herself on aleytys boulder and gazed at the stream flowing past her feet disbelief written in every line of her face lee tells me each ship is different ive only seen this one so i wouldnt know its not quite as odd as you think because the garden looks bigger than it is if you wandered around off the paths youd hit walls rather quickly but whats the point of that might as well enjoy the illusion you willing to talk about the taalav lylunda shrugged why not seeing ive sold them out already whats his name your friend the xenobi and how did he get them on your ship prangarris no friend of mine i did the job for three taalav crystals not for any fondness i had for him id done transport for him before pharmaceuticals he pays prompt and doesnt argue not a nice man for all that he was a political and not on pillory for mass murder or the like he was a firstorder zorrit and probably ought to be squashed as to how he got the two arrays on board i was too busy watching screen and holding camou fields in place to pay attention to anything but the time it took who chose that planet he did and got out a list of things he wanted me to provide food supplements for the taalav a years food supply for him a split corn a flikit adapted to heavy world flying a spare exo and a survival pod with an argrav field powered by rechargeable light cells the pod was the hardest to get hold of i picked it up through marrats took a hefty prepayment before the broker would even look at my offer what gripes me most about this is seeing the kliu win way it goes luna if you want them off your back this is whatll do it hm something to cheer you when i decided to skip from hutsarte without grinder noticing i hotwired your ship and took off in it lees got it in tow now topped upwith fuel and completely resupplied so you can go your way anytime you feel like it you mean i just say ta folks its been funand thats it mm hm though you might want to hang about till digbys made his report and the kliu are satisfied lees offered her house as sanctuary if you feel like accepting her invitation huh think id refuse lylunda grinned itll feature in my pit conversation for a decade at least did you know you had one of my recordings on your ship yours harp music and some songs i wrote shadowsongs mm hm why you doing this sort of work then everybody asks me that luna just restless thats all i know the feeling i was about to go crazy back there lovely place nice people peaceful plenty of food work enough to keep you from rotting away but no heavy labor i mean its the kind of place folks dream of and id go through that mess getting clear a dozen times a day if thats what it took to get away shadith blinked paradise is none hm gives me an idea harskari sipped at the tea the firelight painting her face red and black it was the only light source in the library at the moment shadow transferring the taalav to storsten sounds like one of your better ideas ive checked the specs on pillory and its fair matchexcept for light quality might have to do something about that a filter shadow panels hm well that can wait till later well definitely have to fetch plant samples from pillory along with water soil the rest so we can set up a duplicate ecosystem the taalav will need that for health and happiness in a new place shadith rubbed at her nose that might be a problem you know what pillory is hah shadow you mean to say you think a pedestrian little smuggler like lylunda elang could play the fox better than me well i didnt want to presume shadith opened her eyes wide and looked as demure as she could idiot harskari shook her head smiling loguisse and i talked this over since we dont want people connecting the vrya with this we thought wed lay an ambush for the xenobi keep him in stasis while we dealt with the taalav turn him loose elsewhere with a few crystals in his pocket to encourage silence youve taken care of your smuggler friend she doesnt know about my tiauchi and neednt find out hm once abra has worked a thorough clean of the site making sure weve left no traces of our presence you can report that you found where prangarris was camped but that there was no sign of him or any living taalav hanging about the min can look for themselves collect the crystals well leave lying about and go home satisfied as long as i can avoid a verifier which shouldnt arise if they see the site with their own blinky eyes and get their grippers on those crystals she looked down at her hands since youll be going there anyway any chance you could get the rest of the taalav off pillory the adult i talked to was sad and hopeful at the same time when he sang about the arrays being free with a whole world to themselves if the arrays have managed to thrive away from pillory i dont see why not but it does rather depend on what we find when we get to lylundas world and how well they adjust to storsten not much point in a freedom thats a quick road to extinction the parlor in lylundas quarters had been reconfigured to make the whole wall above the comstation into a screen that picked up visuals from the bridge and displayed them in a smaller rather more congested form lylunda was stretched out on the long chair her ankles crossed her hands laced together behind her head shadith sat crosslegged on the floor beside her the diamondshaped continent just coming into view lylunda said the one that crosses the equator i set him down by that freshwater lake near the northem tip of the diamond western edge of the water for a moment longer the nameless world at kld mlyd turned massively in the screen the land areas a paisley pattern of dull browns and ochers with the occasional splash of dark purple then the screen was resorbed into tigatris substance aleytys voice came through the grill thank you lylunda that will be sufficient i believe shadow will you come to the bridge please the mobile abra stood at the left edge of the screen that took up the whole front wall of the bridge his golden nonskin shimmering palely in its light aleytys sat in a massive swivel chair her hair a brilliant splotch of color against the black molding that supported her head abra expand the image of the western shore of that lake scan for mobile life set up a cell for each instance whether its bipedal taalav or other shes looking a lot better shadith thought not so tired and drawn working over luna was good for her wolff and grey are abrading her soul i think if she feels she has to stay for lilai she better make sure grey finds hunts for her and i cant say anything nothing worse than friends getting on your back about things you cant change spla the screen divided into small cells like spreading soap bubbles and images began to appear in thema few adult taalav and some juvenile forms moving rather feebly about some worms and armored beetles the main screen showed the survival pod a flikit sitting beside it and a large object made from interlaced crystal threads aleytys flicked a finger at it abra can tigatri see into that another cell opened in it the cocoons layers peeled back the image shivering and hesitating as the resonances of the crystal threads interfered with the probe finally a body appeared the face clear enough to be recognizable send that to lylunda abra just the one cell got it good luna do you recognize the man prangarris the voice that came through the grill had a dry edge to it it was obvious lylunda didnt appreciate her isolation from what was happening thats him all right he dead abra spoke sensors indicate he has been dead for more than a year luna there is evidence of several aneurysms in the brain that seem to have burst about the same time he died within minutes of the event the body has been preserved by the cold and the spun crystal so much for prangarris and his plans shadith clicked her tongue what a dreary place looks like the taalav are as dead as he is the kliu wont be getting much for their coin luna did prangarris ever say why he chose it there was a moments hesitation then lylundas voice sounded again mostly because no one in his right mind would try to settle it at least thats what he said and he laughed when i agreed with him shadith rubbed at her nose lee could we do a circuit with tigatri scanning surface for more signs of taalav id like to be sure weve found them all abra if you will it was a desolate world large land masses separated by narrow sinuous oceans that were ocher and crimson vegetable stews there were several volcanoes in the process of erupting spewing huge clouds of matter into the atmosphere further cutting down the amount of sunlight reaching the surface the seas were the worlds repositories of strong color on the land only a few colored lichens and mosses broke the dull monotone of mud stone and coarse sand when they were stationary once again above the pod site shadith grimaced maybe the taalav like it when i go down there ill ask them shadith eased herself into the frame that was supposed to help the exoskeleton support her body so she could cope with the complicated language of the taalav with her breathing and the precise control of her voice because too many stilters might frighten the arrays into hiding and keep them from answering the song query aleytys was waiting a short distance off in the lander when shadith was settled she looked round neither array was anywhere in sight not even infants and juveniles but according to tigatri and her own sense they were within reach of her voice she sucked in a lungful of the cold thick air ran through a series of vocalizations to help set her up for what she thought could become a long and difficult bargaining session greet you of the new from tiedtooldland land i singer noharm offered wanted who stand on your their song i offer land she cleared her throat drank from the stem of the waterbottle silence all round she swept the area with her outreach the taalav stayed hidden and she could feel a feeble startlement mixed with anger and distrust she sang again tiedtooldland if ours thrive inamed shadow i hear and repeat for you sing for the oldland let them be this song warning truth and trust i named shadow offer with open hands sing to youofthenew death comes land the twomouthed swarm disturbed nest thieves i named shadow sing warning run here run there burn fire and more search out thenewland fire she continued singing for around ten minutes amplifying the warning saying she had not come to take them against their will though she would mourn their deaths if such were their choice she dropped into silence and waited and waited she could feel two adult taalav circling warily about her edging in closer when one of them finally appeared moving into view around a pile of lichened rock she was appalled it looked sick and mean the once bright cherry hood mottled with black and khaki the large eyes of the headbeast filmy and oozing mucus around it was a dull aura of angerresentmenthate that was thick enough to stain the air why why why why shadow singer trust nottrust you who speak we the betrayed landtied taken stolen by you kind listen should who die thisplace starve this we place woven around this asides that commented on her likeness to prangarris the deep distrust of the singer her smell the inadequacy of her truespeech and other things that once again were too subtle for the translator in her head to catch it was a passionate outcry all the more so because the taalavs voice was weak from hunger and worn to a thread from coping with the bitterness of this world breaking and wavering on some of the more difficult harmonies in the exchange that followed shadith discovered just how brutal life had been for the arrays that prangarris had brought here the sun was the wrong color the taalav sang to her there were things in the water that did grief to the littles so they grew weak and died the food plants that prangarris had brought withered and died and the food the arrays found here was not complete prangarris fed them liquid supplements which helped them live but something went wrong inside him and he was gone they couldnt get into his place and reach the supplements so they starved slowly the food they could find kept them just enough alive to feel the agony of that slow dissolution this was a bad place so many things were wrong here we die the taalav sang to her we rot here and die shadith sang to the taalav i will call to you a healer this person will give you strength and health again adults and littles alike this person need only touch you to heal will you trust enough to allow this the taalav brooded in silence for several minutes its eyes dropping shut its body sagging in the cradle of its legs finally it sang for the good of the newplacepeople this person before youstiltersinger will allow the touch when aleytys left the flier and came toward shadith the taalav stirred gave out a flare of desperate hope its eyes were fixed on the healers bright red hair shadith thought about the cherry hood of healthy taalav adults and understood the gestalt must be thinking ah an adult at last will you permit aleytys sang shadithkept her face carefully blank lee couldnt carry a tune if you gave her a universal gripper her voice wasnt unpleasant but she had no grasp of the relationship of the tones and her approximations were enough off to make any singer wince she watched aleytys set hands on the head and body of the taalav close her eyes and begin work for a while nothing seemed to be happening then a healthy crimson crept back into the hood and the heads eyes brightened when aleytys stepped away the taalavs lively cheerfulness was back the difference in its emanations was astonishing and when it sang its gratitude the harsh dissonances had vanished from the speech the other adults and the littles of the arrays came from hiding scuttling and wriggling and slithering shadith watched aleytys take up the tiny head forms and body forms hold them in her hands until the distressing feebleness was gone then set them down to run and play about the feet of the adults it was as if they were reborn and reinfused with the stock of happiness that this world had sucked out of them with a whine of servos lee knelt and began passing her hands across the wormforms that were also part of the gestalt while she worked the sun moved past zenith and a cold wind rose off the lake bringing with it the rancid sickening smell of rotten vegetation even with the exo and the frame supporting her exhaustion dragged at shadith and she didnt want to think about how aleytys felt she told herself it was like the struggle to keep lylunda alive it reminded lee of her strength where forces on wolff conspired to remind her of her weaknesses shadith sang a soft query to call the first taalav from its contemplation of the healing you have strength now she sang to it and youve seen our good will if you stay here the curl ears will surely find you and kill you do you want to go back where you came from i will take you there if you ask it or there is another world that you can visit that might prove better for you than this will you risk that we went with onebump garrs the taalav sang we had no choice it took us gathered us as we gather fruits from the grony bushes yet we went with a certain willingness for we wished a new place a free place that would be ours alone we understood that the curl ears looked on us as beasts and harvested our histories because they were pleasant to look upon and their songs were prized we thought onebump garrs was weak and alone and we could escape its hand easily enough when there was room to run we did not understand that places could be more deadly than kadbeasts this person looks on your good will and accepts that this person feels whole for the first time in many days yet this person has learned fear of new things and it is hard to contemplate the choice youstiltersinger offer must this person choose istiltersinger dont understand how possible that youofthenewland could be returned and notreturned at the same time this person would look upon the new world yet if the new land is bad also this person would go back to the tieland i see shadith sang yes that is sensible the suns color will be wrong on this new world also but it will be warmer and i think more hospitable she glanced at aleytys sang the healer is nearly finished with its work will you call your folk ofthenewland together and come with us the hold in harskaris tiauchi had been set to a proper gravity and the light provided was a close approximation of that on pillory the arrays left the flier with twitters of excitement and pleasure theyd expected to have to suffer the same primitive conditions they had endured in lylundas dragoi shadith introduced them to the mobile grace who had taken on the semblance of an adult taalav and acquired the taalav langue from tiauchis kephalos through tigatris tie to aleytys this place fitnotfit desired be your comfort you ofthenewland sing to grace food and more dark and light is timed what can be done will for you the taalav whod spoken first to shadith stood beside her it sang an acknowledgment then went silent as it looked around the hold the baby body forms were chasing each other over the spongy flooring in and out of the pseudo plant forms whistling shrilly through their long dangly noses and having a grand time the baby heads were crawling more slowly nudging against each other and piling into sloppy heaps for the comfort of feeling others around them and the other more ambiguous juvenile parts of the gestalt were wriggling and squirming around wrapping themselves around head forms and licking at them getting their taste reregistered coiling round each other looking more or less like knots of earthworms chased out of their holes by a morning rain the other adult gestalts were moving about exploring the place singing their complex songs as they commented on what they saw the huge dark eyes of the taalav turned on shadith for a moment she sensed wonderingtentativeness interesttension and understood the mix as the taalav moved over to the mobile grace and sang a request for open water and food shadith waited until grace sang her answer then she stepped onto the slide flat and was transported to the living areas loguisse the vryhh had the fragile look shadith remembered from the first time shed met her delicate bones with barely enough flesh to put padding between them and the skin but shed lost her aura of ancient desiccation her dark blue eyes sparked with life and there was color in her pale face a fascinating species shadow she said after giving shadith a brief nod to acknowledge the greeting she was examining a small taalav crystal mounted in a dagnoster envelope plotting the intricacies in the weaving of the extruded threads you say these are histories so the taalav say some of the crystals anyway some are story books and some are just for the pleasure they give harskari hasnt come across yet not yet shes doing some last minute planning with lee should be finished soon wed agreed to be gone in another hour or so themis tells me the taalav are settling in quite nicely i can see why you like them so much charming creatures and very intelligent if they prosper on storsten and agree to it i mean to bring more of them there for a viable colony they need a larger breeding base hm the crystals being sometimes histories i wonder what effect a transfer of them between the two groups would have it would be interesting to see how their society changes and develops both on storsten and on pillory she smiled vaguely at shadith then went back to her examination of the crystal shadith turned to tigatris master mobile themis arrange my transfer to tigatri please what are you going to say to digby when you tell him youve quit aleytys was sitting on the boulder again swinging her feet in the gardens stream kicking up sprays of water and watching the drops fall back shadith shifted position a root from the tree she was leaning against was poking too assertively into her back i dont know wouldnt be polite or politic to tell him it was because i just didnt trust him anymore though thatd be the truth the more i learn about the e more spooked i get how far does his reach go thats a lot of power he has what happens when that face he clings to turns into a mask with nothing behind it how does he know who he is then what does he want what will he do to get it what happens when he does get it does he turn into something like kell all malice with no internal limits heavy list of questions aleytys pulled her legs up folded them into a lotus knot thinking of getting answers to them no not unless i have to if he leaves me alone ill return the favor mm you told lylunda the taalav were dead tell him the same thing but that you were really unhappy about the thought of the kliu slaughtering them so youve decided to find another way of making a living and then go play around vrithian for a while till the whole thing cools down what are you going to do about his ship take it to university in tow to mine do my talking from there he can send someone to pick it up im not going back to spotchalls thats for sure lee what am i going to do what do you want to do youre no help aleytys grinned sleepily at her well what kind of help were you when you were infesting my head ah so its revenge you want shadith wrinkled her nose having opted for mortality i suppose i want that choice to mean something i want people to be glad i walked through their lives like the fior and ketang of bluchad that was well satisfying though i suppose its aslan who made the big difference but i helped see you do know what you want but that kind of thing doesnt put fuel in my ship or food in my belly thats why i signed up with digby in the first place i do the jobs while he takes care of logistics seemed like itd be the perfect blend tsah while youre on university why not talk to aslan she might have some ideas i dont think so lee shes a friend and i like her but shes very much into the university ethos im not and i dont want to be picky hm a while back you said you were getting royalties off your lightsailors ive started hearing about them i do still get some of the gossip on wolff and word is theyre hot you might be making more than you think and if you could come up with something else adelaar could handle for you i suppose id better check with ti vnok and see whats happening i dont really count on them much lee fads explode and wither so fast sometimes you blink and theyre gone or the gray market rips off the design and undercuts your prices she twisted her face into a clowns sad grimace and dont tell me ive gone all negative its just i dont hive anything to aim at lee i know shadow youve got to close out this bit first before you can look ahead id tell you to stop fussing but i expect thats useless with a quick twist of her body aleytys was on her feet you need your harp ill have doll bring it out to you and you can pay your way with a concert tonight lylunda and iand tigatri of coursewell be your guests report and farewell shadith stood irresolute for several minutes outside digbys branch office in citystate rhapsody dredging through memory for any loophole she might have missed in the story shed cobbled to cover the abstraction of the taalav she passed her hand over her hair patted the soft springy curls into place she needed a trim but she wasnt going to bother with that now once her report was finished she was booked on a flier heading for the landing field and on a shuttle to take her to the university transfer station and her own ship digbys backhoe was parked up there too but she wasnt going near that ship again then shed make the jigs and jogs on the long and complicated flight to vrithian she was tired and unhappy some time spent in a place where she didnt have to worry about any thing would be a blessing this street wasnt far from star street and was busy this late summer morning she was rather like a boulder diverting the flow momentarily of the traders crew and others moving past her in a steady stream when she started to get annoyed stares she sucked in a breath and plunged inside the greeter bot having been programmed to admit her whenever she called shadith walked through into the inner office without having to wait the office manager looked up yes i need a clear room and a connect to digby tell him ive got the location and im ready to report weve just swept two touch the announcer and ill let you through thanks shadith left and walked down a short tapped the annoucer outside door number two and waited for the massive plug to slide to one side the clear rooms were baffled and insulated as free as possible from any sort of insinuation from outside she seated herself by the desk moving her shoulders uneasily as the door slid shut and sealed itself this was a bit too much like a cell to please her if digby got irritated enough at her quitting it might run from security to prison between one breath and the next she told herself that was crazy hed never shown any inclination to overcontrol his agents but the unease wouldnt go away she leaned back closed her eyes while she was waiting for the connection toso through weariness swept over her and she drifted into a doze she woke with a start as a soft chime announced digbys arrival when she opened her eyes he was sitting in a simulated armchair behind the desk still in his professorial guise he leaned forward a lock of shining gray falling across his brow a grave and disapproving set to his face why university shadith i expected you to report to spotchalls i had reasons for making the full report here digby ill explain them later first the location in the universal catalog the sun is listed as kld mlyd one of the stars in the callidara pseudo cluster the world in question is third from the sun the xenobis name was prangarris a herthite hes dead by the way the taalav wrapped him in a crystal cocoon then proceeded to follow him into death leaving very few traces behind a few crystals and some decayed organic matter with enough definition left to identify it as taalav the transplant didnt take from what i saw definitely not the smuggler you told me we werent required to produce her i see no reason to turn her over to the kliu theyll have what they want at the moment shes on wolff visiting aleytys until its safe to get on with her life she leaned forward set a flake on the desk the complete report everything ive done everything ive learned about hutsarte my expensesits all there so youve pulled it off again congratulations shadow good job he leaned back the chair creaking realistically as he shifted his nonweight i have a feeling youre not happy about this vm not she went through the speech shed worked out with aleytys finished when i saw they were dead the problem went away but when you lean on luck it melts under you and you fall on your face who knows what ill come up against next time so no next time why im here on university no point in going all the way to spotchalls just to say i quit she pushed the chair back and got to her feet its been interesting digby but it was a mistake from the beginning he said nothing didnt try to stop her simply watched as she left the room she was yawning as she palmed the lock on her apartment all the strain of the job all the suspicion and the chewing over and over of what might happen how she could counter it all that had caught up with her and weariness was like a blanket smothering her what she wanted more than anything was to stretch out on her bed and sleep for a week instead she put on water to boil for tea logged a call through one of the rhapsody skipcoms and had a shower while she waited for it to go through aleytys raised a brow in the screen her face was slightly distorted and her skin had acquired a greenish tone but her voice came through clearly enough i see you survived i took your advice and was tactful shadith patted a yawn spla im tired all tensed up and ready to act then the whole thing just dribbled away whatever tell lylunda she should probably hang about for the rest of the month but after that the heat should be off her she yawned again you talked to harskari yet about an hour ago matter of fact she says the injection is taking just fine and the new plants she picked up are thriving shell be going back for more in a few months give the source time to settle down have you decided what youre going to do probably ill go see if swardas home i need to talk to him then ill probably go have a look at harskaris garden aleytys mouth twitched it wasnt a smile i might join you for a few months im tired of the sniping round here nice that your severance was a friendly one and go get yourself some sleep shadow you can start your new life tomorrow shadith came to awareness abruptly she was seated in front of a sensor board in a familiar pilots chair she was on the backhoe her body leaned forward her hands lifted began moving over the board entering a destination code she watched the code print out on the main screen committed it to memory automatically then realized with dull horror that she couldnt turn her head that no part of her body answered her will this was confusing shed meant to leave the backhoe in the university tiedown if digby wanted it back he could send someone to fetch it she should have been frightened and angry she couldnt feel anything it was as if she were back in the diadem looking through the bodys eyes but with no connection to the other senses or to the bodys emotions her mind barely worked a word or an image rose to awareness then faded a long time later a new thing welled up to take its place day digby day digbys techsimage of tron ga working over her body with humming blinking readouts fitting the exo to her adjusting the probe blockers day know me template day nothing blackout day tailored zombi no day mind mindlock no day nothing blackout day both clearroom yes image of self waking seeing digby seated behind the desk and so it went word by word dredged up from the edges of her mind putting the picture together there was time plenty of time nothing to do while the backhoe splitted toward its enigmatic destination and her body moved to someone elses programming feeding itself and keeping itself cleannothing to do but struggle to think to understand what had happened to her day at measuredintervals her awareness left her for about a day it wasnt sleep it was as if someone had touched a button and turned her off the timer on the sensor panel told her how long she was gone but she had no internal sense of time passing and that bothered her a lotall the more because she could do nothing about it interval by interval she pieced together what this was about day through his techs and their reports digby knew her body and her consciousnessat least as much of them as could be measured from the outside and he could do anything he wanted to her because he had a fine and frisky scapegoat to blame it on the kliu he wanted everything she knew her history aleytys vrithian the diadem everything hed been after her from the beginning to tell him things pressing as hard as he could without driving her away hed accepted her evasions because he had no choice about that when she quit though that ultimate evasion was something he must have decided he couldnt allow and with the mu hanging about he didnt even have to kill her when he was finished all he had to do was brainwipe her and turn her loose he could even get her back to university and let her be found wandering mindless traces of drugs in her that might be linked to the kliu he didnt like them it would appeal to his peculiar humor to get them barred from university as theyd gotten themselves barred from marrats market information miser of knowledge sitting in his electronic parlor turning over the golden rounds of his secrets as the days passed her thinking became measurably quicker the alternate pathways strengthening and growing more complex with exercise day huh omphalos had some use after all the work shed done to slide around their mindwipe had set up so many subroutes and branches that even the most effective lock couldnt cut all of them out of service digbys techs are the best around but theyve got the limitations that come from knowing too much blessings be for that lets see what else they missed she couldnt feel anything couldnt smell or taste the food she consumed couldnt turn her head couldnt even twitch an eyeball she tried over and over she tried to wriggle around the bounds of the lock and tease out a way of getting her body back over and over she rammed against a wall there was no penetrating hm if i cant go around maybe i can pull my memories and shove them in a cyst like i did for the thing with omphalos then he can probe all he wants and get nada for his pains but nada was what she got when she tried it it was as if memory were marked read only she could see but not touch she crashed into the wall until her mind ached with the effort and in the trying she called up memories she didnt want to view again images that oozed through the mindlock and flared into brief existence in front of her eyes image flares of light red and blinding white long torturing squeal of landers as they came rushing through the night and dropped the catchnet on the weavers house her mothers house dark figures pouring from the landers it seemed as though there were thousands of them though later she knew it was only a dozen men they came through the catchnet as if it didnt exist the web that paralyzed whatever it touched they killed her mother and the breeding male who lived there they took her sisters her six shining sisters who danced dreams for the shallana they took her too but only because she was young enough thered be a market for her image she bent over the narrow casket she dug from a wall in an ancient ruin ran her threefingered hands over the panels brushing the dust away so she could see the patterns some longdead artist had carved into the stone white jade it was the walls thin as fine porcelain amazing that it was intact so long after it was made her touch triggered it somehow and the lid rose upward inside she saw a pile of ash and something else a necklet she thought at first a delicate gold chain complex and supple draping heavily over her hand when she lifted it fine wires spun into the petals of stylized blooms with jeweled hearts jewels that sang single pure notes as she turned her hand and inspected them she spread out the circle and fitted the diadem onto her head image darkness nothing struggle to be to see to do anything she could to break the intolerable tedium of existence inside the treasure tower of the rmoahl day upon day of wrestling with her limitations as she learned to ride the curators mind so she could get beyond the boundaries of her patterned life then the gem that held her soul sounded its note as a hand snatched it from the case darkness again as the diadem slid into a loot sack and the thief stavvar began retracing his steps day when she emerged from the memory dreams and the futile campaign to free herself from the lock she began watching as much of her body as she could see in the glimpses that chance allowed her knowledge was about the only lever she had access to the pattern of the bodys actions around the blackouts told her what was happening there every four days when the body moved into the cabin and stretched itself out on the cot shed catch a glimpse from the corner of her eye of something descending little more than a sense of movement and a glint of metal a moment later shed be gonenot into sleep but into the blackout it was easy to tell which was which sleep came gradually settling like a blanket over her the blackout would cut a thought in half and when she woke hermind had slowed again she had to exercise it as she would stiff muscles to get the flow moving steadily once more drugs hes got me set up so he can reinforce the lock and replay the program he doesnt want to take a chance on them wearing off before i get to where im going day nothing blackout day he couldnt have installed the drugs and the delivery system in backhoe any time after he assigned her to me he had to have set this up before then what did he say ah theres a pattern that shall we say limits your usefulness and this it just means i have to be careful this is how hes being careful he fixed it so he could control me if he had to i wonder if he has this kind of thing installed for all his agents day memories they were some use after all not just an additional torment replaying for her what shed been in the distraction of her struggle shed forgotten she was a mindrider the images that appeared and reappeared in her efforts reminded her of this the only minds available on this ship were a few spiders some anonymous insets and a roach or two manipulating them gave her a small triumph and drove back the grays that had been closing in on her as she exhausted every possibility shed thought of to escape this trap at first she could only feel them but the more she searched them out and the more she settled into one after the other sending her tiny mounts scurrying here and there the more access she had to that part of her mind she was pleased with herself and delighted at this new joke on the certainties of superior techs day when much of the stiffness from the blackout had worn off she reached for one of the spider minds looked through the compound eyes at the bug it was sucking dry and sighed so what if she could play with bugs where did that get her her melancholy lightened briefly as she visioned roaches dancing over the sensor board but that was not practical a flood of sudden thoughts overloaded the still laboring pathways of her awareness and for a moment all she knew was chaos when she could think again she picked out the idea that sparked the deluge shaped it into a small neat statement and contemplated it if my mindride talent escaped the lock maybe other talents are also available to me the translator was useless but her ability to mindmove small objects close to her close being within reach of her arms seemed to offer interesting possibilities digby didnt know about that one at least she didnt think he knew so maybe he hadnt programmed the backhoes kephalos to counter it first i see if i can move something then i figure out how to use it day when the square lit shadith saw it from the corner of her eye and in her relief felt her focus diffusing in the screen in front of her the first number of wolffs destination code was a bright amber glyph mind on your business shadow amazing how hard it was to deal with tension when she couldnt vent it through the body she regained control and began entering the other elements of the new destination code working by hope and estimation there were several of the sensor squares that she couldnt see because her head was turned the wrong way as she went on though the figures before her were the right ones and her confidence grew she fmished and would have held her breath if shed had any control over that the numbers vanished were replaced by course change denied wolffs out i could try university hm i dont think so spotchalls thats the best chance she visualized the sensor board worked out the moves and entered spotchalls code once again the numbers vanished once again she saw course change denied one more hm why not pillory he wouldnt expect me to go there she finished screamed a silent scream of frustration and anger course change denied because she was so fatigued by this time that she could barely string two thoughts together she rested for a few hours after the last denial letting her favorite songs flow through her mind the imagined sound and the play of the words distracting her from the fear that threatened to swamp the tiny area that shed managed to pull away from the mindlock her body was planted in the pilots chair and she couldnt move it all she did was sit for hours and hours until she could feel muscle tone oozing away that made her angrier than anything else it was just so stupid digby could at least have programmed her body to exercise itself on this trip it was going to last two months by the time she got to where she was going shed have bedsores on her behind shed recognized parts of the code so she knew the place the ship was traveling toward and the time it would take to get there swardheld had a commission out that way while she was playing songmistress for aslan on beluchad he came to see her when he dropped his cargo at the cliostara citystate on university he was vocally annoyed with proctor haldron for sending him out there with only the sketchiest of warnings so offhand youd think he was saying its an old gouty hound but youd better be careful of its temper hah some temper a pair of dragonships chased us halfway back to the arm he didnt mention that was disputed territory hed have had to give me danger pay if thatd come up the miserable skint he wrote out the string for her there it is shadow if your titchy boss wants to send you out that way decline with thanks and be firm about it taking chances may add spice to life but out there troubles not chance but certainty dmgonships big and black at once sinuous and angular named by a free trader with more imagination than sensean eternally optimistic little cousin pooting about the edge of civilization in an ancient singleship held together by spit and prayer no one knew what the entities in those ships looked like but there was no question of their belligerence they chased away or blew to ash anyone who crossed into what they considered their space her destination was definitely in swardas disputed territory she thought about calling up what the kephalos knew about the place but decided that wasnt such a great idea at least not until shed found some way to get word out get the word out now there was an idea day as the words flowed across the screen the bodys eyes followed them out of habit shadith thought complicates things but at least if i get it wrong ill know it and if i get it right lee digby has done his thing he has got me in a mindlock and programmed to keep myself alive till i get to one of his hideaways rzt mmxs is the destination code the whole trip is around days and of them have gone past so there is not much time left after far too many failures i have worked a few synapses free using them i have activated a drone and am managing to get this written with some tickles from the old mindmove i expect he is going to squeeze my mind dry of memory then wipe it and dump me somewhere i would really rather not go through that i have tried to change course but the kephalos will not permit it i have tried to wiggle loose from the lock and failed lee i have to call for help again you know how much i like that but i really do need you shadith she rested for the remainder of the day playing her songs over and over in the small area of brain available to her letting the poisons of fatigue wash away day shadith reread the note then pecked away at the sensor board transferring the message onto a flake and routing it into a drone after a pause during which she recollected her strength she called for a status report message transferred errors drone charged and in tube destination wolff qmt bbef action desired she would have closed her eyes but she couldnt she might have held her breath her hands might have been shaking this didnt happen she gathered her forces sent the release signal the words on the screen vanished and two more appeared drone released day the musical bong that announced emergence from the insplit came as she was surfacing from a blackout she lay on the cot and squeezed enough slow thoughts out of her stiffened brain to wonder if the program was going to keep her there until the ship touched down usually the body rose immediately tended itself ate then moved to the pilots chair where it sat staring at a mostly empty screen she lay and fretted this was one more chain digby was wrapping around her time passed the body rose went to the fresher took care of its wastes washed itself it came out changed to clean clothing then it stretched out on the cot once again lay with its hands crossed on its breasts eyes fixed on the dull metal of the ceiling helpless prisoner in her own head shadith would have wept in frustration if she could some hours later the vibrations in the walls changed the sound changed and yet later the sounds the vibrations stilled the ship was on the ground turned loose a timid scratching on the door lylunda looked up from the remote and saw lilai hesitating in the opening come on in she blanked the screen and smiled at the girl wasnt doing anything important just looking over my finances oh maybe i should come back mum gets scratchity when shes working numbers all depends on what the numbers say besides till i get back on the job i cant really do any planning guessing without hard data is good for passing time and not much more lilai sidled in and perched on the edge of a chair thats sorta what i came to tell you when youll get back i mean mum said i could mum said shadow called and said shed made the report to digby and as soon as the kliu check it out you can go whenever you want she sighed then stared down at her hands the fingers of one scratching the palm of the other ill miss you she whispered so softly lylunda had almost to guess at the words for the first time lylunda realized how lonely the child was and saw some value in the messy often dangerous life shed led while she was growing up lonely wasnt something you suffered in the streets of the izar this place was lovely there was every comfort here you could possibly wanteverything except other people she was bored after a month of it lilai had been here all her young life you have vassil and the horses she said but i cant talk to him about anything but horses and mum well shes my mother and shes lilai sighed again you know she loves me and i love her and we do lots of stuff and shes a great mom but its not like just i dunno aleytys had been friendly but she wasnt the type to sit around chatting with strangers and besides she was distracted it hadnt been to hard to pick up the growing strain between her and the kids father and on top of all that it was rather hard to get chummy with a legend in the flesh lilai must feel that too i wonder if she wishes sometimes that she had an ordinary mother too smart for her own good eight years old going on fifty sort of like bug everything hurts when youre like that jainks nethermost hell what do i say i dont know anything about kids and i swear im never going to have any youre lucky to have a mom lil remember i told you how mine died when i was fifteen but you got to go learn to be a pilot and you have your own ship and you can go wherever you want now so what do you think you want to do mum says shell get me a place on university i think im going to study animals well i already am swarda and shadow bring me books and things when they come to visit and aunt harskari always has something new in her ship garden and she tells me about how it lives and stuff shadow has friends who hunt for animals i thought may i could go work for them after i finish school sounds good to me and mum says when i make twelve well do my first run in the wildlands and ill see the silvercoats live not just on flakes and well gather the first stones for my cairn and when im eighteen ill go by myself and put a stone on the cairn and they cant call me brat any more or say im hanging on mums belt to pull myself along lylunda repressed a shiver her childhood kept looking better the more she heard about wolff this child was anticipating with pleasure being dumped in the colckst most barren part of this unfriendly world with just what she could carry on her back and no weapons but a knife and a bow she was supposed to survive out there for at least a weekand not just survive but cover jaink knew how many kilometers make her mark on some pile of rocks and come back out by foot power and gritted teeth luna theres a tutorial on a little while about the wildlands you want to come watch it with me sure why not while the shows running you can tell me all about the silvercoats grey and aleytys spent the next day in a bitter quarrel arguing in undertones no shouting all control they filled the house with a tension that twanged at lylundas nerves and had lilai shivering like a frightened deer fiddling with the remote screen trying to pretend she was working lylunda stayed in her room until the little ghost that wore lilais shape wandered past the door for the tenth time with an impatient siss she wiped the figures from the screen shut down the remote and marched into the hall come on she didnt wait to see if the child was following her just strode along the hall to the drop tube the barn was warm smelled of horse and hay lylunda threw a blanket over a bale to keep the stubs away from her flesh then settled herself on it and waited for lilai to slip in she wrinkled her nose remembering her first day here when the girl grinned at her and told her they had to be friends their names were almost twins then hauled her off to see her horses looks like a parent doesnt have to be a stone bort like my own daddy dear to mess up a kids life at least hes out of my life for good poor little lilai has got another ten years of this at least well its not my business im outta here soon as its safe lilai came hesitantly through the partly open door she stopped just inside and stood slouched staring at the planks of the floor with the wisps of grass hay strewn across the wood her mouth trembled its tough kid i know come over here and sit down you dont have to say anything lilai nestled close to her she was cold and shaking but she didnt cry even when lylunda slipped an arm about her shoulders and held her close one thing you learn after a while lil these things pass you live through them and life gets better lilai sucked in a long ragged breath but she didnt say anything perhaps out of loyalty to her feuding parents lylunda hugged her she too stayed silent mostly because she didnt know what more to say a horse in one of the stalls that ran along the side of the barn whickered and shifted his feet his shod hooves muffled by the straw bedding another snorted and thumped against the barrier between the stalls two barn cats hissed and yowled in a brief fight then there were scratching noises as one of them fled up near the rafters there was some soft peeping from owlets in their nests outside the little brown meuttertiks broke into scolding chirps something must have been threatening their nests lilais shaking slowly went away she leaned her head against lylundas shoulder for a moment drew a sigh up from the soles of her feet a moment later she wriggled free and got to her feet at the doorway she turned and gave lylunda a wavery smile then she was gone lylunda scrubbed a hand across her eyes jaink i hate this i want to get away from here now grey took lilai with him when he left lylunda did her best to keep out of the way but she did stand at her window as the child walked to the flier with her father lilai waved to her mother climbed inside aleytys was watching from her garden half hidden by a flowering sehnsur the wind blowing delicate lavender petals from its lacy blooms onto her head and shoulders she stood there until the flier vanished into the thready clouds then she walked with quick energetic steps toward the barn brushing away the petals as she went shortly afterward she rode away from the house on one of the blacks keeping the horse to a controlled trot not pushing it but her eyes were fixed on the horizon as if being in motion were something she had to do as if that jagged line between sky and earth were someplace she had to be lylunda stepped away from the window this whole visit has been a letdown you expect legends to have perfect lives not this kind of kak she sighed i ill give digby a call with any luck i can be on my way and out of her hair lylunda smiled as she patted the arm of her pilots chair it was good to be back in her own ship she could feel the tension draining out of her she woke the kephalos and initiated the call to digby then sat back and waited for it to go through digby was a silverhaired docent handsome and stately with what lylunda took to be a smug gleam in his bright blue eyes what can i do for you lylunda elang i was wondering if the kiln had finished inspecting the site and were satisfied with what they saw thats proprietary information you understand however im willing to let it out for a price of course nothing extravagant just a brief report on your views my views about what about the events between the time you left bol mutiar and arrived at wolff shadith will have given you that already and do you never crosscheck your information hm i see no problem with that the whole thing was a disaster she went through the meager calendar of events after the healing adding no commentary keeping strictly to what happened and what she was told youre sure the dead man was the xenobi prangarris i didnt go downside but that wouldnt have helped anyway he was inside that crystal weave i watched tigatris keph peel through the crystal until you could see the man inside it was prangarris no doubt about that and there were shells of dead taalav all around the site she tapped impatiently on the chair ann so have the kliu been there are they satisfied my fee was released from escrow two hours ago they are satisfied i would advise staying away from that sector of cousin space they wont be looking for you but if you fell into their hands your life would be short and messy mmh should you take a notion to look for steady work one day come see me the screen blanked as he cut the connection lylunda wrinkled her nose not likely my friend she stretched groaned with pleasure at the feeling of chains dropping off her body we say goodbye and thanks much aleytys of wolff then i go find a pit and throw myself a party o eee its been a while endgame once the ship was down digby wasted no time he had the body on its feet and moving before the engines cooled it was out of the ship and installed in a bubble car so fast shadith only caught a few glimpses of the lichens and rubble that seemed to make up most of the local landscape after the flat metallic atmosphere of the ship the air was cool and crisp with a sharp fungal tang to it she was irritated at being dumped back into the sterile blandness of machined air and made a note to do her version of the vryhh ship gardens once she got back to her own transport having plants about would make more work and introduce more contaminations into her ship but the feel of the atmosphere would certainly be worth it the car zipped from the recamouflaged pad and plunged straight at a granite cliff rising a hundred meters straight up idiot poseur playing infantile games of scare the prisoner tchah she ignored the rock and mused over what shed have to do to her ship to get it ready for use it had been sitting at wolff since she signed on with digby and would have developed the quirks and crotchets all mothballed ships picked up at least those with complex kephaloi she hadnt run across any major problems splitting from wolff to university even though she was towing the backhoe and putting more strain on the ship but sometimes it took a while for the quirks to start showing the membrane that sealed out the local atmosphere and mocked the mottled gray of the granite twanged as the car passed through it the weight of the mountain pressed down on her as the flimsy car scooted deeper and deeper into it and even more oppressive was her growing fear that she wasnt going to get out of this with mind intact if digby wouldnt let her speak before he tried the probe all she could do was try to short it out which would work once a second membrane squeaked the bubble car stopped and stood shuddering on its supports as jets of fluid hammered at it from above below and both sides after the wash was done shadith heard a series of and clanks then the car began gliding forward drawn along by some exterior method of propulsion during the next fifteen or so minutes the car was scrubbed thoroughly the air in it expelled and replaced repeatedly until she was as battered as the small vehicle the body she couldnt feel coughing with irritation from the sterilizers carried by that air the car passed through a third membrane and stopped the gullwing doors swung up and the body moved stiffly out it walked to a massive plug in the wall waited for it to slide open then stepped into a rock lined with shining white tiles where it was inundated once again with antiseptic fluids if she could have shadith would have sighed with frustration and impatience hair kinked into curls so tight and close to her head they hurt throat raw and temper on the point of exploding she moved with the body into a white room beyond the lock it marched to a chair facing a wall plopped itself down and folded its hands in its lap the wall irised open behind thick glass she saw a nude male body wrapped in a cocoon of wires and tubes a sustain unit almost as complex as those shed seen on ibex when aleytys was hunting the last clues that would put her in touch with her mother in a sort of irony she was in no mood to appreciate it also looked rather like the crystal mass the taalav had woven around prangarris digby she thought the original the one and only wonder how old he is from how he looks he was here before this world formed gods unless i talk really fast for sure im not getting out of here knowing that digbys simulacrum formed translucent so she could see the outline of the body through it youre aware he said you arent supposed to be aware he gestured and her face came back to her control her throat her voice im a lot of things im not supposed to be she said her voice was hoarse her lips trembled and it was difficult to speak but the relief in that much relaxation of the lock was enormous she tried not to let it affect her she had to remain focusedand avoid the temptation to talk too much how practice thats not responsive it isnt is it he gestured again and the chair she sat in began to shift around her no she spat the word at him rushed the rest of it while she still had the ability to speak before you touch me check backhoes kephalos the chair froze in midshift and she went on more slowly i saw the destination code and i programmed it into a drones message flake along with my speculations as to what this was about aleytys should have it by now and be on her way here the simulacrum looked away for a moment when it turned back she faced its fury with her first degree of hope how shed gone over this moment again and again on the way here and had changed her mind as many times as she thought shed finally made it up on top of that the sustained body on the far side of the glass was a factor she had to fit into her reasoning and she didnt have much time go with instinct she thought trade him secret for secret that might be sufficient to tilt the balance i was hatched twenty millennia ago digby you may be old but youre a child compared to me for a long time youve wanted to know who i was what i was so listen i was a weaver of shayalin born to a family who danced dreams for the shallana and any who caine to listen you wouldnt know of shayalin it was ash before your species left the ocean that spawned them thats what i was until i died then i was a pattern of forces caught in the rmoahl diadem and i watched the years pass through other eyes than my own it was useful training the techs who craft mindlocks have limited imaginations they dont dream of someone like me when the diadem came to aleytys after a while i traded eternity for mortal flesh this flesh we are sisters of the soul digby we are more than sisters i would die for her and she for me more important to you shell come for me and she wont be alone the vrya will come because i know how to reach vrithian and thats not a secret theyll trust you with and there are the other souls i shared space with in the diadem like aleytys they are bound to me in ways youd never understand if they find a shell not their sister soul youre dead the vrya and my souls kin theyll destroy this place and purge you from every inch of the systems you control until you simply do not exist any more and why should i believe any of that preposterous story wait a few days vryhh ships are fast it wont take long for lee to get here two weeks at most the others might need more time but theyll come too my defenses are considerable what if i simply deny youre here and let them do their worst thats your decision by that time youll have done your probing and your wipe so ill be dead even if this body lives and i wont care what happens to you seyirshi was right youre a mutagen transforming everything you touch i should have taken his warning and kept clear of you i survive she said one way or another a bargain digby you leave me and mine alone ill go my way and not interfere with you i want to talk to aleytys give me her callsign if youre thinking of infesting tigatris kephalos i warn you shes self aware and apt to react murderously to intruders she saw the smug glint in the simulacnims eyes and sighed send me out to backhoe and ill make the contact for you i dont want to be under all this rock when you make an idiot of yourself and get your plug pulled youve got control of backhoes kephalos so i wont be going anywhere the white noncorpse in the sustain lay stony and immobile and for several minutes the gaze its spokesimage turned on her was as unyielding the body was still held in digbys grip so shadith could do nothing but sit and wait shed considered using the mindmove to attack the sustain since digby had unwittingly brought her close enough but that might mean all systems would go out and the thought of being sealed into this hole in the ground nearly sent her reasoning paths into overload she put that aside to save for a last and desperate stunt taken in the hope that aleytys would arrive before air and food were gone the body coughed coughed again as the remnants of the disinfectant gas irritated its lungs the noise woke the simulacrum from its stasis the ships corn has been tied to the skipcom here you can watch but you wont be permitted to speak once the connection is made a gesture and the last of the mindlock dissolved the car will you back this is not to be considered an agreement you understand but i am contemplating your offer aleytys bluegreen eyes burned through the screen i dont know if i want to listen to you kak who threatens shadow threatens me youd better believe that i seem to have made an error in judgment digbys voice dripped penitence hed chosen a sad puppy look and was doing his best to project rueful contrition is there some way we can resolve this difficulty without mutual destruction for one thing you can stop trying to worm through tigatris defenses if you get her annoyed enough shell seize your trace and do to you what youre trying to do to her ah i must apologize to shadith i thought she was exaggerating for effect hm i think more than apologies are called for in the backhoe watching this exchange on the forescreen shadith smiled squeeze the bort good lee squeeze him till he squeals she blinked as the screen suddenly added a third cell as harskari appeared and joined the conversation yes considerably more shadow is my sister my daughter digby lee is not alone in this look to your health you thing of painted light well pull your house down and melt your flakes to slag she was smiling as she spoke and her voice was soft her dignity pulled like a robe about her shadith was bouncing in her chair and grinning widely enough to threaten her ears go get im mama harskari she drew a deep breath chortled as she watched digbys face go stiff and his eyes empty as he contemplated the nearly identical faces of the two women the load was off her shoulders now she could sit back and watch her soulkin operate for a little while she could revel in being a child again digby seemed to sigh it was an extravagant tale that your daughter you say mm that shadith spun for me but it seems she underspoke the truth what do you require she is indeed the daughter of my heart and of our long companioning in addition to her immediate return to us we harskari laid stress on that word require indemnity deposited on helvetia equal to one years gross income of excavations ltd aleytys will give you the details in a moment as to what shadith requires youll have to ask her the screen blanked and shadith found herself in darkness around her the faint subliminal soughing of the ships life support was hushed digbys voice was silky in her ears i can do more than stop the fans i can evacuate the air from the ship and youll die gasping a moment later the lights were back and a faint current of air tickled at the tiny hairs that curled about her face thats to remind you what happens if you drive me too far he said shadith laughed and enjoyed the look on his face when he heard the freedom of the sound ive died twice already why should i fear a third death then why bother with your friends out there if i had to go i wanted company youre wasting time you know my offer is still open leave me and mine alone and well leave you your secrets and your life so i have to run every job past you to make sure im not violating your precious ambiance leave legalisms to lawyers digby youre trotting out problems that dont exist go about your ordinary business and there wont be a pattern if by chance you and i meet as adversaries we can work out an accommodation or declare allout war and see who emerges at the end if you go after us again youll make a pattern and well know it you havent any notion of the capacity of a vryhhdesigned kephalos i suggest you dont try to test it if you do well come after you the ones you know and the ones you dont i could still fight this out my sanctuary is landbased and the atmosphere will limit the weapons your friends can bring to bear on me plus the fact that youre sitting here more vulnerable to them than i am dont count on that digby theres a lot you cant know about aleytys or vryhh tech threats about what i dont know get thin very fast i do not like the thought that i exist on your sufferance shadith in fact its so unappealing that i find myself just about ready to call you back in here and take my chances with your champions you can try shadith sighed im not going to argue with you digby or let you distract me agree or fight make up your mind there was a long silence shadith stretched out her legs shut her eyes and waited with what patience she could scrape together an hour later the screen lit split into cells with digbys simulacrum in one harskari and aleytys in the other two the simulacrum put on a wry ruefulness and spoke let it be then a years gross profit into a specified account on helvetia and i give my word that i will not search out you or yours with hostile intent is that sufficient shadith it is sufficient epiloguetieing the knots worm delala giggled as worm swung his gathering scoop at the scuttling greel missed and swore as it dug itself back into the sand she took her digging stick popped another greel from his hole and cooed as worm got this one and dumped it into the basket later as he followed her along the path to the village he heard a long low whine and raised his eyes to see the bright seed of a lifting ship arcing across the sky he watched it a moment groping for a memory that wouldnt come delala looked over her shoulder ke mo im coming im coming i dont want to spill this he forgot about the ship and walked beside her his mouth getting itself ready for the feast that night his naming feast and his formal welcome into the tung bond lylunda the perpetual party in the loft of the buzzards roost had come alive again two days after lylunda reached sundari pit she wandered in glanced around took a glass of white wine from a serviteurs tray and went to lean against the wall sipping at the wine while she watched virgin and hopeless dance a strutting pavanne to a tune provided by henry the tentacled centaur as he used his physical advantages to play a harpguitar no pelar lylunda looked round grinned at qatifa you might say ive gone off the whole drug scene right now anyway didnt expect to see you here qatyou clear of that mess at marrats uhhuh why ive got this deal a good one itll set your belly grumbling when you hear it but it needs two to make it work you interested sure been out of it too long dragois all shaped up to run ive got a room over junkers bar say you meet me there tomorrow pit noon ill be there qatifas nose quivered with caan laughter her eyes were narrowed to golden slits less you want to come home with me after the jobs finished qat i just got out of one mess idont want to make another po po you were more fun when you were on the pelar see you tomorrow qatifa twitched a mobile ear wriggled her nose again and ambled off lylunda emptied her glass set it on a window ledge and began her own circuit of the room she was back in her chosen world the scattered anarchy of the pit stop circuit she had prospects for a job that was certainly dangerous and probably interesting at the moment life was very good shadith supported by one of harskaris exos shadith sat on a tussock of rotten stone held together by the complex root system of the grasses that grew over it she watched the taalav moving with noisy cheerfulness about their adopted home rambling in and out of the reddish shadow cast by the translucent shades loguisse had set up for them tending the shoots of the polychrome reeds that were already breaking the surface of the water in the lake at the heart of this equatorial island the other plants harskari had snatched off pillory seemed to be rooting themselves and growing with a similar enthusiasm a horde of infant body beasts were running about getting underfoot hooting with tiny but exuberant joy and infant head beasts lay in slowly heaving piles contributing their modulated hums to the noise most of the worm forms of the gestalt had settled themselves in the mud at the edge of the lake but here and there she could see a bright pink fingeroid popping out of the water to snap at the bugs skating on the surface harskari and loguisse were some distance off supervising a clutch of bot gardeners as they set more plants in place the sun avenar was warm on her back and the air heady in her nostrils the gravity pulled at her and she was growing tired but she was happy as she looked at the taalav arrays working so diligently at settling into their new home its anobject lesson she thought one phase of my life has closed and i dont know where ill go from here but at least i can rejoice that nothing is finished and everything is new again
