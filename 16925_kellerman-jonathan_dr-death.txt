jonathan kellerman dr death book in the alex delaware series this ones for dr jerry dash chapter irony can be a rich dessert so when the contents of the van were publicized some people gorged the ones whod believed eldon h mate to be the angel of death those whod considered him mercy personified grieved i viewed it through a different lens had my own worries mate was murdered in the very early hours of a soursmelling fogladen monday in september no earthquakes or wars interceded by sundown so the death merited a lead story on the evening news newspaper headlines in the times and the daily news followed on tuesday tv dropped the story within twentyfour hours but recaps ran in the wednesday papers in total four days of coverage the maximum in shortattentionspan la unless the corpse is that of a princess or the killer can afford lawyers who yearn for oscars no easy solve on this one no breaks of any kind milo had been doing his job long enough not to expect otherwise hed had an easy summer catching a quartet of lovingly stupid homicides during july and augustone domestic violence taken to the horrible extreme and three braindead drunks shooting other inebriates in squalid westside bars four murderers hanging around long enough to be caught it kept his solve rate high made it a bit but not much easier to be the only openly gay detective in lapd knew i was due he said it was the sunday after the murder when he phoned me at the house mates corpse had been cold for six days and the press had moved on that suited milo just fine like any artist he craved solitude hed played his part by not giving the press anything to work with orders from the brass one thing he and the brass could agree on reporters were almost always the enemy what the papers had printed was squeezed out of clipfile biographies the inevitable ethical debates old photos old quotes beyond the fact that mate had been hooked up to his own killing machine only the sketchiest details had been released van parked on a remote section of mulholland drive discovery by hikers just after dawn dr death murdered i knew more because milo told me the call came in at eight pm just as robin and i had finished dinner i was out the door holding on to the straining leash of spike our little french bulldog pooch and i both looking forward to a night walk up the glen spike loved the dark because pointing at scurrying sounds let him pretend he was a noble hunter i enjoyed getting out because i worked with people all day and solitude was always welcome robin answered the phone caught me in time ended up doing dogduty as i returned to my study mates yours i said surprised because he hadnt told me sooner suddenly edgy because that added a whole new layer of complexity to my week who else merits such blessing i laughed softly feeling my shoulders humping rings of tension around my neck the moment id heard about mate id worried deliberated for a long time finally made a call that hadnt been returned id dropped the issue because thered been no good reason not to it really wasnt any of my business now with milo involved all that had changed i kept the worries to myself his call had nothing to do with my problem coincidenceone of those nasty little overlaps or maybe there really are only a hundred people in the world his reason for getting in touch was simple the dreaded w word whodunit a case with enough psychopathology to make me potentially useful also i was his friend one of the few people left in whom he could confide the psychopathology part was fine with me what bothered me was the friendship component things i knew but didnt tell him couldnt tell him chapter i agreed to meet him at the crime scene the following monday at am when hes at the west la station we usually travel together but he was already scheduled for a meeting downtown at parker center so i drove myself sunrise prayer session i said milking the cows with guys in suits cleaning the stable while guys in suits rate my performance gonna have to find a clean tie is the topic mate what else theyll demand to know why i havent accomplished squat ill nod a lot say yassuh yassuh shuffle off mate had been butchered fairly close to my home and i set out at seventhirty the first leg of the trip was ten minutes north on beverly glen the seville fairly sailing because i was going against traffic ignoring the angry faces of commuters incarcerated by the southbound crush economic recovery and the customary graft had spurred unremitting roadwork in la and hellish traffic was the result this month it was the bottom of the glen smug men in orange caltrans vests installing new storm drains just in time for the next drought the usual municipal division of labor one guy working for every five standing around feeling like a prebastille royalist i sped past the queue of porsches and jaguars forced to idle with clunkers and pickups democracy by oppression everyone coerced into bumpernudging intimacy at mulholland i turned left and drove four miles west past seismically strained dream houses and empty lots that said optimism wasnt for everyone the road coiled scything through weeds brush saplings other kindling twisted upward sharply and changed to packed ocher soil as the asphalt continued east and was renamed encino hills drive up here at the top of the city mulholland had become a dirt road id hiked here as a grad student thrilling at the sight of antlered bucks foxes falcons catching my breath at the furtive shifting of high grass that could be cougars but that had been years ago and the suddenness of the transformation from highway to impasse caught me by surprise i hit the brakes hard steered onto the rise parked below the table of sallow dirt milo was already there his coppercolored unmarked pulled up in front of a warning sign posted by the county seven miles of unfinished road followed no vehicles permitted a locked gate said that la motorists couldnt be trusted he hitched his pants loped forward took my hand in both of his giant mitts alex big guy he had on a fuzzylooking green tweed jacket brown twill pants white shirt with a twisted collar string tie with a big misshapen turquoise clasp the tie looked like tourist junk a new fashion statement i knew hed put it on to needle the brass at this mornings meeting going cowboy my georgia okeeffe period natty he gave a low rumbling laugh pushed a lick of dry black hair off his brow squinted off to the right focusing on a spot that told me exactly where the van had been found not up the dirt road where untrimmed live oaks would have provided cover right here on the turnoff out in the open i said no attempt to conceal he shrugged and jammed his hands in his pockets he looked tired washedout worn down by violence and small print or maybe it was just the time of year september can be a rotten month in la throatconstrictingly hot or clammy cold shadowed by a grimy marine layer that turns the city into a pile of soiled laundry when september mornings start out dreary they ooze into sooty afternoons and sickly nights sometimes blue peeks through the clouds for a nanosecond sometimes the sky sweats and a leakyroof drizzle glazes windshields for the past few years resident experts have been blaming it on el nino but i dont recall it ever being any different september light is bad for the complexion milo s didnt need any further erosion the gray morning light fed his pallor and deepened the pockmarks that peppered his cheeks and ran down his neck white sideburns below stillthick black hair turned his temples into a zebrastriped stunt hed gone back to drinking moderately and his weight had stabilized was my guess much of it settling around his middle his legs remained skinny stilts comprising a good share of his seventyfive inches his jowls always monumental had given wayaround the edges we were about the same age he was nine months older so i supposed my jawline had surrendered a bit too i didnt spend much time looking in the mirror he walked to the killspot and i followed faint chevrons of tire tracks corrugated the yellow soil nearby lay a scrap of yellow cordon tape dusty utterly still a week of dead air nothing had moved we took casts of the tracks he said flicking a hand at them not that it matters we knew where the van came from rental sticker avis tarzana branch brown ford econoline with a nice big cargo area mate rented it last friday got the weekend rate preparing for another mercy mission i said thats what he uses vans for but so far no beneficiarys come forth claiming mate stood him up im surprised the companies still rent to him they probably dont the paperwork was made out to someone else woman named alice zoghbie president of the socrates clubrighttodie outfit headquartered in glendale shes out of the country attending some sort of humanist convention in amsterdam left saturday she rented the van and split the next day i said apparently called her home which also doubles as the socrates office got voice mail had glendale pd drive by no one home zoghbies message says shes due back in a week shes on my todo list he tapped the pocket where his notepad nestled i wonder why mate never bought a van i said from what ive seen so far he was cheap i tossed his apartment the day after the murder not much in the way of creature comforts his personal cars an old chevy that has seen better days before he went automotive he used budget motels i nodded bodies left on the bed for the cleaning crew to find next morning too many traumatized maids turned into bad publicity i saw him on tv once getting defensive about it saying christ had been born in a barn full of goat dung so setting doesnt matter but it does doesnt it he looked at me youve been following mates career didnt have to i said keeping my voice even he wasnt exactly mediashy any tracks of other cars nearby he shook his head so i said youre wondering if the killer drove up with mate or parked farther down the road than we checked or left no tracksthat happens plenty you know how seldom forensic stuff actually helps no ones reported seeing any other vehicles then again no one noticed the damn van and it sat here for hours what about shoe prints just the people who found the van whats the timeofdeath estimate i said early morning one to four am he shot his cuff and looked at his timex the watch crystal was scarred and filmed mate was discovered just after sunrisesixfifteen or so the papers said the people who found him were hikers i said mustve been early risers coupla yuppies walking with their dog came up from the valley for a constitutional before hitting the office they were headed up the dirt road and noticed the van any other passersby i pointed down the road toward encino hills drive i used to come up here remember a housing development being built by now its probably wellpopulated that hour youd think a car or two would drive by yeah its populated he said highpriced development guess the affluent get to sleep in some of the affluent got that way by working what about a broker up early to catch the market a surgeon ready to operate its conceivable someone drove past and saw something but if they did theyre not admitting it our initial canvass produced zip by way of neighborly help how many cars have you seen while we stood here the road had been silent i got here ten minutes before you he said one truck period a gardener and even if someone did drive by thered be no reason to notice the van no streetlights so before sunrise it wouldve been pure black and if someone did happen to spot it no reason to give it a thought let alone stop there was county construction going on up here till a few months ago some kind of drain line caltrans crews left trucks overnight all the time another parked vehicle wouldnt stand out it stood out to the yuppies i said stood out to their dog one of those attentive retrievers they were ready to walk right past the van but the dog kept nosing around barking wouldnt leave it alone finally they had a look inside so much for walking for health huh that kind of thing could put you off exercise for a long time bad not what id want as an aerobic stimulant dr mate was trussed up to his own machine the humanitron i said mates label for his death apparatus silent passage for happy travelers milo s smile was crooked hard to read you hear about that thing all the people he used it on you expect it to be some hightech gizmo its a piece of junk alex looks like a loser in a juniorhigh science fair mismatched screws all wobbly like mate cobbled it from spare parts it worked i said oh yeah it worked fine fifty times which is a good place to start right fifty families maybe someone didnt approve of mates brand of travel agency potentially were talking hundreds of suspects problem one is weve been having a hard time reaching them seems lots of mates chosen were from outofstategood luck locating the survivors the departments lent me two brandnew detectiveis to do phone work and other scut so far people dont want to talk to them about old eldon and the few who do think the guy was a saint grandmas doctors watched her writhe in agony and wouldnt do a damn thing dr mate was the only one willing to help alibitalk or true belief id need facetofaces with all of them maybe you there to psychoanalyze and so far its been telephonic were making our way through the list trussed to the machine i said what makes you think homicide maybe it was voluntary mate decided it was his own time to skid off the mortal coil and practiced what he preached wait theres more he was hooked up all rightiv in each arm one bottle full of the tranquilizer he uses thiopentalthe other with the potassium chloride for the heart attack and his thumb was touching this little tripwire doohickey that gets the flow going coroner said the potassium had kicked in for at least a few minutes so mate wouldve been dead from that if he wasnt dead already but he was the gizmo was all for show alex what dispatched him was no mercy killing he got slammed on the head hard enough to crack his skull and cause a subdural hematoma then someone cut him up none too neatly ensanguination due to extensive genital mutilation he was castrated i said and more bled out coroner says the head wound was serious nice columnar indentation meaning a length of pipe or something like that it wouldve caused bigtime damage if mate had livedmaybe even killed him but it wasnt immediately fatal the rear of the van was soaked with blood and the spatter says arterial spurts meaning mates heart was pumping away when the killer worked on him he rubbed his face he was vivisected alex lord i said some other wounds too deliberate cuts eight of them deep abdomen groin and thighs squares like the killer was playing around proud of himself i said he pulled out his notepad but didnt write any other wounds i said just some superficial cuts the coroner says were probably accidentalthe blade slipping all that blood had to make it a slippery job weapon was very sharp and singleedgedscalpel or a straight razor probably with scissors for backup anesthesia scalpel scissors i said surgery the killer must have been drenched no blood outside the van not one speck it looked like the ground had been swept this guy took extreme care were talking wet work in a confined space in the dead of night he had to use some kind of portable light the front seat was full of blood too especially the passenger seat im thinking this bad boy did his thing got out of the van reentered on the passenger sideeasier than the drivers seat because no steering wheel to get in the way thats where he cleaned most of the mess off then he got out again stripped naked wiped off the rest of the blood bundled the soiled stuff up probably in plastic bags maybe the same plastic hed used to store a change of clean clothes he got into his new duds checked to cover any prints or tracks swept around the van and was gone naked in full view of the road i said that would be risky even in the dark because hed have to use a flashlight to check himself and the dirt on top of operating in the van using light someone couldve driven by seen it shining through the van windows gone to check or reported it the light in the van might not have been that big of a problem there were sheets of thick cardboard cut to the right size for blocking the windows on the drivers seat also streaked with arterial blood so theyd been used during the cutting cardboards just the kind of homemade thing mate wouldve used in lieu of curtains so my bet is dr death brought them himself thinking he was gonna be the trusser not the trussee same for the mattress he was lying on i think mate came ready to play angel of death for the fiftyfirst time and someone said tag youre it the killer used the cardboard then removed it from the windows i said wanting the body to be discovered display just like the geometrical woundslike leaving the van in full sight look what i did look who i did it to he stared down at the soil grim exhausted i pictured the slaughter vicious blitz assault then deliberate surgery on the side of an ink black road the killer silent intent constructing an impromptu operatory within the confines of the vans rear compartment picking his spot knowing few cars drove by working quickly efficiently taking the time to do what hed come to dowhat hed fantasized about taking the time to insert two iv lines positioning mates finger on the trigger swimming in blood yet managing to escape without leaving behind a dot of scarlet sweeping the dirt id never encountered anything more premeditated what was the body position lying on his back head near the front seat on the mattress he provided i said mate prepares the van the killer uses it talk about a power trip cooptation he thought about that for a long time theres something that needs to be kept quiet the killer left a note plain white paper eight by eleven tacked to mates chest nailed into the sternum actually with a stainlesssteel brad computertyped happy traveling you sick bastard vehicle noise caused us both to turn a car appeared from the west on the swell that led down encino hills big white mercedes sedan the middleaged woman at the wheel kept to forty miles per while touching up her makeup sped past without glancing at us happy traveling i said mates euphemism the whole thing stinks of mockery milo which could also be why the killer coldcocked mate before cutting him up he set up a twoact play in order to parody mates technique sedate first then kill piece of pipe instead of thiopental brutal travesty of mates ritual he blinked the morning gloom dulled his leafgreen eyes turned them into a pair of cocktail olives youre saying this guy is playing doctor or he hates doctors wants to make some sort of philosophical statement the note may have been left to get you to think hes taking on mate philosophically he might even be telling himself thats the reason he did it but it aint so sure there are plenty of people who dont approve of what mate did i can even see some zealot taking a potshot at him or trying to blow him up but what you just described goes way beyond a difference of opinion this guy enjoyed the process staging playing around enacting the theater of death and at this level of brutality and calculation it wouldnt surprise me if hes done it before if he has its the first time hes gone public i called vicap nothing in their files matches the agent i spoke to said it had elements of both organized and disorganized serials thank you very much you said the amputation was clumsy i said thats the coroners opinion so maybe our boys got some medical aspirations someone with a grudge like a medschool reject wanting to show the world how clever he is maybe he said then again mate was a legit doc and he was no master craftsman last year he removed a liver from one of his travelers dropped it off at county hospital packed with ice in a picnic cooler not that anyone wouldve accepted it given the source but the liver was garbage mate took it out all wrong hackedup blood vessels made a mess doctors who dont do surgery often forget the little they learned in med school i said mate spent most of his professional life as a bureaucrat bouncing from public health department to public health department when did this liver thing happen never heard about it last december you never heard about it because it was never made public cause whod want it to get out not mate because he looked like a clown but not the das office either theyd given up on prosecuting mate were sick of giving him free publicity i found out because the coroner doing the post on mate had seen the paperwork on the disposal of the liver had heard people talking about it at the morgue maybe i wasnt giving the killer enough credit i said given the tight space darkness the time pressure it couldnt have been easy perhaps those error wounds werent the only time he slipped if he nicked himself he couldve left behind some of his own biochemistry from your mouth to gods ears the lab rats have been going over every square inch of that van but so far the only blood theyve been able to pull up is mates o positive the only common thing about him i was thinking of the one time id seen eldon mate on tv because i had followed his career had watched a press conference after a voyage the death doctor had left the stiffening corpse of a womanalmost all of them were womenin a motel near downtown then showed up at the das office to inform the authorities my take to brag the man had looked jubilant thats when a reporter had brought up the use of budget lodgings mate had turned livid and spat back the line about jesus despite the public taunt the da had done nothing about the death because five acquittals had shown that bringing mate up on charges was a certain loser mates triumphalism had grated hed gloated like a spoiled child a small round bald man in his sixties with the constipated face and the high strident voice of a petty functionary mocking the justice system that couldnt touch him lashing out against those enslaved to the hypocritic oath proclaiming his victory with rambling sentences armored with obscure words my partnership with my travelers has been an exemplar of mutual fructification pausing only to purse slit lips that when they werent moving seemed on the verge of spitting microphones shoved in his face made him smile he had hot eyes a tendency to screech a hitandrun patter had made me think vaudeville yeah he was a piece of work wasnt he said milo i always thought when you peeled away all the medicolegal crap he was just a homicidal nut with a medical degree now hes the victim of a psycho and that made you think of me i said well he said who else also theres the fact that one week later im no closer to anything any profound behavioralscience insights would be welcome doctor just the mockery angle so far i said a killer going for glory an ego out of control sounds like mate himself all the more reason to get rid of mate think about it if you were a frustrated loser who saw yourself as a genius wanted to play god publicly what better than dispatching the angel of death youre very likely right about it being a travel gone wrong if the killer did make a date with mate maybe mate logged it no log in his apartment milo said no work records of any kind im figuring mate kept the paperwork with that lawyer of his roy haiselden mouthy fellow youd think hed be blabbing nonstop but nada hes gone too haiselden had been at the conference with mate big man in his fifties florid complexion toobushy auburn toupee amsterdam also i said another humanist dont know where yet just that he doesnt answer calls yeah everyones a humanist our bad boy probably thinks hes a humanist no i dont think so i said i think he likes being bad another car drove by gray toyota cressida another female driver this one a teenage girl once again no sideward glance see what you mean i said perfect place for a nighttime killing also for a travel jaunt so maybe mate chose it and after all the flack about tacky settings perhaps he decided to go for scenicfinal passage in a serene spot if so he made the killers job easier or the killer picked the spot and mate approved a killer familiar with the areamaybe even someone living within walking distancecould explain the lack of tire tracks it would also be a kickmurder so close to home and he gets away with it either way the confluence between his goals and mates wouldve been fun yeah milo said without enthusiasm gonna have my dis canvass the locals see if any psychos with records turn up another glance at his watch alex if the killer set up an appointment with mate by faking terminal illness that implies theater on another level acting skills good enough to convince mate he was dying not necessarily i said mate had relaxed his standards when he started out he insisted on terminal illness but recently hed been talking about a dignified death being anyones right no formal diagnosis necessary i kept my face blank maybe not blank enough milo was staring at me something the matter beyond a tide of gore in the morning oh he said sometimes i forget youre a civilian guess you dont wanna see the crimescene photos do they add anything not to me but sure he retrieved a manila packet from the unmarked these are copiesthe originals are in the murder book loose photos fullcolor too much color the vans interior shot from every angle eldon mates body was pathetic and small in death his round white face bore the lookdull flat the assault of stupid surprise every murdered face id seen wore it the democracy of extinction the flashbulb had turned the blood splatter greenish around the edges the arterial spurts were a bad abstract painting all of mates smugness was gone the humanitron behind him the photo reduced his machine to a few bowed slats of metal sickeningly delicate like a baby cobra from the top frame dangled the pair of glass iv bottles also bloodwashed just another obscenity human flesh turned to trash i never got used to it each time i encountered it i craved faith in the immortality of the soul included with the death photos were some shots of the brown econoline up close and from a distance the rental sticker was conspicuous on the rear window no attempt had been made to obscure the front plates the vans front end so ordinary the front interesting what is said milo the van was backed in not headed in the easy way i handed him a picture he studied it said nothing turning around took some effort i said only reason i can think of is it wouldve made escape easier it probably wasnt the killers decision he knew the van wouldnt be leaving although i suppose he might have considered the possibility of being interrupted and having to take off quickly no when they arrived mate was in charge or thought he was in the drivers seat literally and psychologically maybe he sensed something was off it didnt stop him from going through with it could be he put his reservations aside because he also enjoyed a bit of danger vans motels sneaking around at night say to me he got off on the whole cloakanddagger thing i handed him the rest of the photos and he slipped them in the packet all that blood i said hard to imagine not a single print was left anywhere lots of smooth surfaces in the van the coroner did find smears like fingerpainting whirls says it might mean rubber gloves we found an open box in the front mate was a dream victim brought all the fixings for the final feast he checked his watch again if the killer had access to a surgical kit he couldve also brought spongesnice and absorbent perfect for cleanup any traces of sponge material in the van he shook his head i said what else did you find in terms of medical supplies empty hypodermic syringe the thiopental and the potassium chloride alcohol swabsthats a kicker aint it youre about to kill someone you bother to swab them with alcohol to prevent infection they do it up in san quentin when they execute someone maybe it makes them feel like healthcare professionals the killer wouldve liked feeling legitimate what about a bag to carry all that equipment no nothing like that no carrying case of any kind no there had to be some kind of case i said even if the equipment was mates he wouldnt have left it rolling around loose in the van also mate had lost his license but he still fancied himself a doctor and doctors carry black bags even if he was too cheap to invest in leather and used something like a paper sack youd expect to find it why would the killer leave the humanitron and everything else behind and take the case snuff the doctor steal his bag taking over the doctors practice he wants to be dr death makes sense doesnt it hes murdered mate cant exactly come out into the open and start soliciting terminally ill people but he could have something in mind milo rubbed his face furiously as if scrubbing without water more wet work its just theory i said milo gazed up at the dismal sky slapped the packet of death photos against his leg again chewed his cheek a sequel oh that would be peachy extremely pleasant and this theory occurs to you because maybe there was a bag and maybe someone took it if you dont think it has merit disregard it how the hell should i know if it has merit he stuffed the photos in his jacket pocket yanked out his pad opened it and stabbed at the paper with a cheweddown pencil then he slammed the pad shut the cover was filled with scrawl the bag coulda been left behind and ended up in the morgue without being logged sure i said absolutely great he said that would be great well folks i said in a w c fields voice in terms of theory i think thats about it for today his laughter was sudden i thought of a mastiffs warning bark he fanned himself with the notepad the air was cool stale still inert he was sweating forgive the peckishness i need sleep yet another glance at the timex expecting company i said the yuppie hikers mr paul ulrich and ms tanya stratton interviewed them the day of the murder but they didnt give me much too upsetespecially the girl the boyfriend spent his time trying to calm her down given what she saw cant blame her but she seemed delicate like if i pressed too hard shed disintegrate ive been trying all week to arrange the reinterview phone tag excuses finally reached them last night figured id go to their house but they said theyd rather meet up here which i thought was gutsy but maybe theyre thinking some kind of selftherapywhatchamacallitworking it through he grinned see it does rub off all those years with you a few more and youll be ready to see patients people tell me their troubles they get locked up when are they due to show up fifteen minutes ago stopping by on their way to workboth have jobs in century city he kicked dust maybe they chickened out even if they do show im not sure what im hoping to get out of them but got to be thorough right so whats your take on mate dogooder or serial killer maybe both i said he came across arrogant with a low view of humanity so its hard to believe his altruism was pure nothing else in his life points to exceptional compassion just the opposite instead of taking care of patients he spent his medical career as a paper pusher and he never amounted to much as a doctor until he started helping people die if i had to bet on a primary motive id say he craved attention on the other hand theres a reason the families youve talked to support him he alleviated a lot of suffering most of the people who pulled the trigger of that machine were in torment so you condone what he did even if his reasons for doing it were less than pure i havent decided how i feel about what he did i said ah he fiddled with the turquoise clasp there was plenty more i couldve said and i felt low evasive another burst of engine hum rescued me from selfexamination this time the car approached from the east and milo turned darkblue bmw sedan model a few years old two people inside the car stopped the drivers window lowered and a man with a huge spreading mustache looked out at us next to him sat a young woman gazing straight ahead the yuppies show up said milo finally someone respects the rule of law chapter milo waved the bmw up the mustachioed man turned the wheel and parked behind the seville here okay detective sureanywhere said milo the man smiled uncomfortably didnt want to mess something up no problem mr ulrich thanks for coming paul ulrich turned off the engine and he and the woman got out he was mediumsize late thirties to forty solidly built with a wellcured beach tan and a nubby sunburned nose his crew cut was duncolored softlooking to the point of fuzziness with lots of pinkish scalp glowing through as if all his hairgrowing energy had been focused on the mustache an extravagance as wide as his face parted into two flaring redbrown wings stiff with wax luxuriant as an oldtime grenadiers his sole burst of flamboyance and it clashed with haberdashery that seemed chosen for inconspicuousness on century park east charcoal suit white buttondown shirt navy and silver rep tie black wingtips he held the womans elbow as they made their way toward us she was younger late twenties as tall as he thin and narrowshouldered with a stiff tentative walk that belied any hiking experience her skin tone said indoors too more than that indoor pallor chalkywhite edged with translucent blue so pale she made milo look ruddy her hair was dark brown almost black boyshort wispy she wore big blackframed sunglasses a mocha silk blazer over a long brown print dress flatsoled basketweave sandals milo said ms stratton and she took his hand reluctantly up close i saw rouge on her cheeks clear gloss on chapped lips she turned to me this is dr delaware ms stratton our psychological consultant uhhuh she said unimpressed doctor these are our witnessesms tanya stratton and mr paul ulrich thanks again for showing up folks i really appreciate it sure no prob said ulrich glancing at his girlfriend i dont know what else we can tell you the shades blocked strattons eyes and her expression ulrich had started to smile but he stopped midway the mustache straightened he trying to fake calm after what theyd been through she not bothering the typical malefemale mambo i tried to imagine what it had been like peering into that van she touched a sidepiece of her sunglasses can we get this over quickly sure maam milo said the first time we talked you didnt notice anything out of the ordinary but sometimes people remember things afterward unfortunately we dont said tanya stratton her voice was soft nasal inflected with that syllablestretching california female twang we went over it last night because we were coming here to meet you but theres nothing she hugged herself and looked to the right over at the spot ulrich put his arm around her she didnt resist him but she didnt give herself over to the embrace ulrich said so far our names havent been in the paper were going to be able to keep it that way arent we detective sturgis most likely said milo likely but not definitely i cant say for sure sir frankly with a case like this you never know and if we ever catch who did it your testimony might be required i certainly wont give your names out if thats what you mean as far as the departments concerned the less we reveal the better ulrich touched the slit of flesh between his mustaches whys that control of the data sir i see sure makes sense he looked at tanya stratton again she licked her lips said at least youre honest about not being able to protect us have you learned anything about who did it not yet maam not that youd tell us right milo smiled paul ulrich said fifteen minutes of fame andy warhol coined that phrase and look what happened to him what happened said milo checked into a hospital for routine surgery went out in a bag stratums black glasses flashed as she turned her head sharply all i meant honey is celebrity stinks the sooner were through with this the better look at princess di look at dr mate for that matter were not celebrities paul and thats good hon milo said so you think dr mates notoriety had something to do with his death mr ulrich i dont knowi mean im no expert but wouldnt you say so it does seem logical given who he was not that we recognized him when we saw himnot in the condition he was in he shook his head whatever you didnt even tell us who he was when you were questioning us last week we found out by watching the news tanya strattons hand took hold of his biceps he said thats about it we need to get to work speaking of which do you always hike before work said milo we walk four five times a week said stratton keeping healthy said ulrich she dropped her hand and turned away from him were both early risers he said as if pressed to explain we both have long workdays so if we dont get our exercise in the morning forget it he flexed his fingers milo pointed up the dirt road come here often not really said stratton its just one of the places we go in fact we rarely come up here except on sundays because its far and we need to drive back shower off change mostly we stick closer to home encino said milo right over the hill said ulrich that morning we were up early i suggested mulholland because its so pretty he edged closer to stratton put his hand back on her shoulder milo said you were here whensix sixfifteen we usually start out by six said stratton id say we were here by sixtwenty maybe later by the time we parked the sun was up already you could see it over that peak pointing east toward foothills beyond the gate ulrich said we like to catch at least part of the sunrise once you get past therehooking a thumb at the gateits like being in another world birds deer chipmunks duchess goes crazy cause she gets to run around without a leash tanyas had her for ten years and she still runs like a puppy great nose thinks shes a drug dog too good said stratton grimacing if duchess hadnt run to the van said milo would you have approached it what do you mean she said was there anything different about it was it conspicuous in any way no she said not really duchess mustve sensed something off said ulrich her instincts are terrific stratton said shes always bringing me presents dead squirrels birds now this every time i think about it i get sick to my stomach i really need to go have a pile of work to go through what kind of work do you do said milo executive secretary to a vice president at unity bank mr gerald van armstren milo checked his notes and youre a financial planner mr ulrich financial consultant mostly realestate work stratton turned abruptly and walked back to the bmw ulrich called out honey but he didnt go after her sorry guys shes been really traumatized says shell never get the image out of her head i thought coming up here might actually helpnot a good idea at all he shook his head gazed at stratton her back was to him really bad idea milo strode over to the car tanya stratton stood with her hand on the handle of the passenger door facing west he said something to her she shook her head turned away revealing a tight white profile ulrich rocked on his heels and exhaled a strand of mustache hair that had eluded wax vibrated i said have you two been together long a while shes sensitive over by the car strattons face was a white mask as milo talked the two of them looked like kabuki players how long have you been into hiking i said years ive always exercised it took a while to get tanya into it shes notlets just say thisll probably be the conclusion of that he looked over at the bmw shes a great gal just needs special handling actually there was one thing i remembered came to me last night isnt that bizarre can i tell you or do i have to wait for him its fine to tell me ulrich smoothed his left mustache i didnt want to say this in front of tanya not because its anything significant but she thinks anything we say will get us more deeply involved but i dont see how this could it was just another car parked on the side of the road the south side we passed it as we drove up not particularly close maybe a quarter mile down that way indicating east couldnt be relevant right because by the time we arrived mate had been dead for a while right so why would anyone stick around what kind of car i said bmw like ours thats why i noticed it darker than ours maybe black or dark gray same model cant say all i remember is the grille no big deal thereve got to be lots of beemers up here right i just thought i should mention it you didnt happen to notice the license plate he laughed yeah right and the facial features of some psychotic killer drooling at the wheel no thats all i can tell youa dark beemer the only reason i even remembered it was that when detective sturgis called last night he asked us to search our minds for any other details and i really gave it a go i cant even swear it was that dark maybe it was mediumgray brown whatever amazing i remembered it at all after seeing what was inside that van its hard to think about anything else whoever did that to mate must have really hated him i said rough which window did you look through first the front windshield saw blood on the seats and i said oh shit then duchess ran around the back so we followed her thats where we caught a full view milo backed away and stratton got in the car ulrich said better hustle nice to meet you dr delaware he jogged toward the blue car saluted milo as he entered starting up he shifted into gear hooked a uturn and sped down the rise i told milo about the dark bmw well its something he said then he laughed coldly no its not hes right why would the killer stick around for three four hours he stashed the notepad back in his pocket okay one reinterview heard from shes a tense one i said blame her why she set off some buzzers no but i see what you meant about delicacy what did she tell you when you spoke to her alone it was pauls idea to come up here pauls idea to hike pauls a superjock would live in a tree if he could they probably werent in the throes of love when they found mate guess it didnt spice up their relationship murder as aphrodisiac for some folks it is now that i know about the second bmw im gonna have to log and do some kind of followup hopefully a basic dmv will sync with some neighbors vehicle and thatll be it he rubbed his ear as if dreading phone work first things first follow up with my junior ds to see how the family list is going if youre so inclined you could do some research on mate any particular theories you want checked out just the basic one someone hated him bad enough to slaughter him not necessarily a news item maybe someone popping off about mate in cyberspace our killers a careful fellow why would he go public its beyond long shot but you never know last year we had a case father who molested and murdered his fiveyearold daughter we suspected him couldnt get a damn bit of evidence then a half year later the asshole goes and brags about it to another pedophile in a chat room even then it was only a lucky accident that we heard about it one of our vice guys was monitoring the kiddierapers thought the details sounded familiar you never told me about that one im not out to introduce pollution into your life alex unless i need help sure i said ill do what i can he slapped a hand on my shoulder thank you sir the suits are right miffed about a highprofile case popping up right now just when the crime rate was allegedly dropping just when they thought theyd get some good publicity before funding time so if you produce i might even be able to get you some money fairly soon i panted like a dog oh master how wonderful hey he said hasnt the department always treated you well like royalty royalty you and old duchess maybe its her i should be interviewing maybe itll come to that chapter i drove down mulholland and eased into the traffic at beverly glen the jazz station had gotten talky of late so the radio was tuned to kusc something easy on the ears was playing debussy was my guess too pretty for this morning i switched it off and used the time to think about the way eldon mate had died the phone call id made when id first heard about it no answer and trying again was a much worse idea than it had been last week but how long could i work with milo without clearing things up as i tossed it back and forth the ethical ramifications spiraled some of the answers were covered in the rule books but others werent real life always transcends the rule books i arrived home hyped by indecision the house was quiet cooled by the surrounding pines oak floors gleaming white walls bleached metallic by eastern light robin had left toast and coffee out no sign of her no panting canine welcome the morning paper remained folded on the kitchen counter she and spike were out back in the studio she had several big jobs backordered with obligation on both our minds we hadnt talked much since rising i filled a cup and drank the silence was annoying once the house had been smaller darker far less comfortable considerably less practical a psychopath had burned it down a few years ago and wed rebuilt everyone agreed it was an improvement sometimes when i was alone there seemed to be too much space its been a long time since ive pretended to be emotionally independent when you love someone for a long time when that love is cemented in routine as well as thrill her very presence fills too much space to be ignored i knew robin would interrupt her work if i dropped in but i was in no mood to be sociable so instead of continuing out the back door i reached for the kitchen phone and checked with my service and the problem of the unanswered call solved itself morning dr delaware said the operator only one message just a few minutes ago a mr richard doss heres the number an exchange not dosss santa monica office ventura or santa barbara county i punched it in and a woman answered rtd properties dr delaware returning mr dosss call this is his phonerouting service one moment several clicks cricketed in my ear followed by a rub of static and then a familiar voice dr delaware long time reedy tone staccato delivery that hint of sarcasm richard doss always sounded as if he was mocking someone or something id never decided if it was intentional or just a vocal quirk morning richard more static fadeout on his reply several seconds passed before he returned we may get cut off again im out in the boonies carpinteria looking at some land avocado orchard thatll do just fine as a minimall if my coldblooded capitalist claws get hold of it if we lose each other again dont phone me ill phone you the usual number taking charge as always same one richard not mr doss because hed always insisted i use his first name one of the many rules hed laid down the illusion of informality just a regular guy from what id seen richard t doss never really let down his guard i know why you called he said and why you think i called back mates death festive times the sonofabitch finally got what he deserved i didnt reply he laughed come on doctor be a sport im dealing with lifes challenges with humor wouldnt a psychologist recommend that isnt humor a good coping skill is dr mates death something you need to cope with well he laughed again even positive change is a challenge right right youre thinking how vindictive im beingby the way when it happened i was out of town san francisco looking over a hotel trailed by ten clinically depressed tokyo bankers they paid thirty million five years ago are itching to unload for considerably less great i said it certainly is do you recall all that yellowperil nonsense a while back death rays from the rising sun soon our kids will be eating sushi for school lunch about as realistic as godzilla everything cycles the key to feeling smart is to live long enough another laugh guess the sonofabitch wont feel smart anymore so thats my alibi do you feel you need an alibi the first thing id wondered when id heard about mate silence not a phone problem this time i could hear him breathing when he spoke again his tone was subdued and tight i wasnt being literal doctor though the police have tried to talk to me probably have some kind of list theyre running down if theyre proceeding sequentially id be at the bottom or close to it the sonofabitch murdered another two women after joanne anyway enough of that my call wasnt about him its about stacy hows stacy doing essentially fine if youre asking did the sonofabitchs death flash her back to her mother i havent noticed any untoward reactions not that weve talked about it joanne hasnt been a topic since stacy stopped seeing you and mates never been of interest to her which is good dirt like that doesnt deserve her time essentially weve all been fine erics back at stanford finished up the year with terrific grades working with an econ professor on his honors paper im flying up to see him this weekend may take stacy with me give her another look at the campus shes decided on stanford not yet thats why i want her to see it again shes in good shape applicationwise her grades really picked up after she saw you this semester shes going the whole nine yards full load ap courses honors track were still trying to decide whether she should apply for early admission or play the field stanford and the ivys are taking most of their students early her being a legacy wont hurt but its always competitive thats why im calling she still has problems with decisionmaking and the earlyadmit deadlines are in november so theres some time pressure i assume youll be able to find time for her this week i can do that i said but payment will be the same correct unless youve raised your fee payments the same no surprise he said with the hmos closing in youd be hardpressed to raise weve still got you on computer just bill through the office i took a single deep breath richard id be happy to see stacy but before i do you need to know that the police have consulted me on mates murder i see actually i dont why would they do that ive consulted to the department in the past and the primary detective is someone ive worked with he hasnt made a specific request just wants openended psychological consultation because the sonofabitch was crazy because the detective thinks i might be helpful dr delaware thats ambiguous to the point of meaninglessness but true i said inhaling again ive said nothing about having seen your family but there may be conflict because they are running down the list of mates victims he broke in please dont give me that travelersbullshit the point im trying to make richard is that the police will try to reach you before i go any further i wanted to discuss it with you i dont want you to feel theres a conflict of interest so i called so youve found yourself in a conflictual situation and now youre trying to establish your position its not a matter of position its your sincere attempt to do the right thing fine i accept that in my business we call it due diligence whats your plan now that youve called and asked me to see stacy again ill bow off mate why shes an ongoing patient continuing as consultant is not an option what reason will you give the police therell be no need to explain richard one thing though the police may learn about our relationship anyway these things have a way of getting out well thats fine he said dont keep any secrets on my account in fact when they do get hold of me ill inform them myself that stacys seen you whats to hide caring father obtains help for suffering children even better go ahead and tell them yourself he chuckled guess its fortunate that i do have an alibiyou know what doctor bring the police on ill be happy to tell them how i feel about the sonofabitch tell them theres nothing id like better than to dance on the sonofabitchs grave and dont even think about giving up your consultant money dr delaware far be it for me to reduce your income in the hmo age keep right on working with the cops in fact id prefer that why who knows maybe youll be able to dig around in the sonofabitchs life uncover some dirt that tells the world what he really was richard i know youll be discreet about anything you find discretions your middle name and all that but everything goes into the police file and the police have big mouths so itll come out i like it dr delaware by working for them youll be doing double duty for me now when can i bring stacy by i made an appointment for the next morning and hung up feeling as if id stood on the bow of a small boat during a typhoon half a year had passed since id spoken to richard doss but nothing had changed about the way we interacted no reason for it to be any different richard hadnt changed that had never been his goal one of the first things hed let me know was that he despised mate when mates murder had flashed on the tube my initial thought had been richard went after him after hearing the details of the murder i felt better the butchery didnt seem like richards style though how sure of that could i be richard hadnt disclosed any more about himself than hed wanted to in control always in control one of those people who crowds every room he enters maybe that had been part of what led his wife to seek out eldon mate the referral had come from a familycourt judge id worked with named judy manitow the message her clerk left was brief a neighbor had died leaving behind a seventeenyearold daughter who could use some counseling i called back hesitant i take very few therapy cases stay away from longtermers and this didnt sound like a quickie but id worked well with judy manitow she was smart if authoritarian seemed to care about kids i phoned her chambers and she picked up herself cant promise you itll be brief she admitted though stacys always impressed me as a solid kid no obvious problems at least until now how did her mother die horribly lingering illnesssevere deterioration she was only fortythree what kind of illness she was never really diagnosed alex the actual cause of death was suicide her name was joanne doss maybe you read about her it happened three months ago she was one of dr mates i guess you couldnt call her a patient whatever he calls them travelers i said no i didnt read about it it wasnt much of a story she said back of the westside supplement now that they dont prosecute mate guess he doesnt get prime coverage i knew joanne for a long time since we had our first babies we did mommy and me together preschool the works went through it twice had kids the same years my allison and her eric then becky and stacy becky and stacy used to hang out sweet kid she always seemed grounded so maybe she wont need longterm therapy just a few sessions of grief work you used to do that right working on the cancer wards at western pediatrics years ago i said what i did there was mostly the reverse trying to help parents whod lost kids but sure ive worked with all kinds of bereavement good she said i just felt it was my duty because i know the family and stacy seems to be a little depressed how couldnt she be i know youll like her and i do think youll find the family interesting interesting i said scariest word in the english language she laughed like someone trying to fix you up with an ugly blind date is he cute well hes interesting thats not what i meant alex the dosses are smart just about the brightest bunch ive ever met individuals each of themone thing i promise you you wont be bored joanne earned two phds first in english from stanford shed already gotten an appointment as a lecturer at the u when they moved to la she switched gears suddenly enrolled as a student took science courses when she was pregnant with eric she ended up getting a doctorate in microbiology was hired by the u to do research before she got sick she ran her own lab richards a selfmade millionaire stanford undergrad and mba he and bob were in the same fraternity he buys distressed properties fixes them up develops bob says hes amassed a fortune erics one of those extreme geniuses won awards in everythingacademics sports you name it a fireball stacy never seemed to have his confidence more internal so it makes sense shed be the one hit hardest by joannes death being a daughter too mothers and daughters have something special she paused ive gone on a bit havent i i guess its because i really like the family also to be honest ive put myself in a spot because richard was resistant to the idea of therapy i had to work on him a bit to get him to agree it was bob who finally got through he and richard play tennis at the cliffside last week richard mentioned to bob that stacys grades had slipped she seemed more tired than usual did he have a recommendation for vitamins bob told him he was being a damn fool stacy didnt need vitamins she needed counseling hed better get his own act in gear tough love i said must have been some tennis game im sure it was testosterone at its finest i love my guy but hes not a master of subtlety anyway it worked richard agreed so if you could see stacy it would help me not look like a complete idiot sure judy thank you alex therell certainly be no problem paying the bills richards doing great financially what about emotionally to tell the truth he seems fine there too not that hed ever show it he did have time to adjust because joanne was sick for over a year alex ive never seen such a negative transformation she gave up her career withdrew stopped taking care of herself gained weightim talking a tremendous amount really huge maybe seventy a hundred pounds she became this inert lump stayed in bed eating and sleeping complaining of pain her skin broke out in rashesit was a horror and there was never any diagnosis none several doctors saw her including bob he wasnt her internistbob likes to stay away from people he knows socially but he worked up joanne as a favor to richard found nothing referred her to an immunologist who did his thing and sent her to someone else and so on and so on whose decision was it to go to mate definitely joannesnot richards joanne never told him just disappeared one night and was found the next morning out in lancaster maybe thats why richard hates mate so much being left out he found out when the police called him tried to get in touch with mate but mate never returned his calls enough im digressing on the contrary i said anything you know could be helpful thats all i know alex a woman destroyed herself and now her kids are left behind i can only imagine what poor stacys going through does she look depressed to you shes not the kind of kid to bleed all over but id say yes she has gained some weight nothing like joanne maybe ten pounds but shes not a tall girl i know how my girls watch themselves at that age they all do that and she seems quieter preoccupied are she and becky friends they used to be really close she said but becky doesnt know anything you know kids were all very fond of stacy alex please help her the morning after that conversation a secretary from rtd properties called and asked me to hold for mr doss pop music played for several minutes and then richard came on sounding alert almost cheerful not at all like a man whose wife had killed herself three months before then again as judy had said hed had time to prepare no hint of the resistance judy had described he sounded eager as if readying himself for a new challenge then he began laying out the rules no more of that mr doss doctor call me richard services to be billed monthly through my corporate office heres the number stacy cant afford to miss school so lateafternoon appointments are essential i expect some definition of the process you foresee specifically what kind of treatment is called for and how long it will take once youve completed your preliminary findings please submit them to me in writing and well take it from there how old is stacy i said she turned seventeen last month theres something you should know then legally she has no rights to confidentiality but i cant work with a teen unless the parent agrees to respect confidentiality meaning im shut out of the process not necessarily fine when can i bring her in one more thing i said ill need to see you first why before i see a patient i take a complete history from the parent i dont know about that im extraordinarily busy right in the middle of some complex deals what would be the point doctor were focusing on a rather discrete topic stacys grief not her infancy i could see her development being relevant if it was a learning disability or some kind of immaturity but any school problems shes experiencing have got to be a reaction to her mothers death dont get me wrong i understand all about family therapy but thats not whats called for here i consulted a family therapist when my wifes illness intensified some quack referred by a doctor i no longer employ because he felt someone should inquire about stacy and eric i was reluctant but i complied the quack kept pressuring me to get the entire family involved including joanne one of those new agey types miniature fountain in the waiting room patronizing voice i thought it was absolute nonsense judy manitow claims youre quite good his tone implied judy was wellmeaning but far from infallible i said whatever form treatment takes mr doss richard ill need to see you first cant we do historytaking over the phone isnt that what were doing right now look if payments the issue just bill me for telephonic services god knows my lawyers do its not that i said i need to meet you facetoface why its the way i work richard well he said that sounds rather dogmatic the quack insisted on family therapy and you insist upon facetoface ive found it to be the best way and if i dont agree then im sorry but i wont be able to see your daughter his chuckle was flat percussive i thought of a mechanical noisemaker you must be busy to afford to be that cavalier doctor congratulations neither of us talked for several seconds and i wondered if id erred the man had been through hell why not be flexible but something in his manner had gotten to methe truth was hed pushed so id pushed back amateur hour delaware i shouldve known better i was about to back off when he said all right i admire a man with spine ill see you once but not this week im out of town let me check my calendar hold on click on hold again more pop music belchtone synthesizer syrup in waltztime tuesday at six is my only window this week doctor fine not that busy eh give me your address i did thats residential he said i work out of my house makes sense keep the overhead down okay see you tuesday in the meantime you can begin with stacy on monday shell be available anytime after school ill see her after weve spoken richard what a tough sonofabitch you are doctor shouldve gone into my business the moneys a helluva lot better and you could still work out of your house chapter an alibi richards call made me want to get out of the house i filled a cup for robin and carried it along with mine out through the house and into the garden passing the perennial bed robin had laid down last winter crossing the footbridge to the pond the rock waterfall placing the coffee on a stone bench i paused to toss pellets to the koi the fish darted toward me before the food hit the water coalescing in a frothy swirl at the rim iron skies bore down dyeing the water charcoal playing on metallic scales the air was cool odorless just as stagnant as up at the murder site but greenery and water burble blunted the sense of lifelessness up in the hills september haze can be romanticized as fog our propertys not large but its secluded because of an unbuildable western border and surrounded by oldgrowth pines and lemon gums that create the illusion of solitude this morning the treetops were capped with gray i crouched allowing one of the larger carp to nibble my fingers reminding myself as i sometimes did that life was transitory and i was lucky to be living amid beauty and relative quiet my father destroyed himself with alcohol and my mother was heroic but habitually sad no whining the past isnt a straitjacket but for people breastfed on misery it can be an awfully tight sweater no sounds from the studio then the chipchip of robins chisel the buildings a singlestory miniature of the house with high windows and an old burnished pine door rescued by robin from a downtown demolition i pushed the door open heard music playing softlyry cooder on slide robin was at her workbench hair tied up in a red silk scarf wearing gray denim overalls over a black tshirt hunched in a way that would cause her shoulders to ache by nightfall she didnt hear me enter smooth slender arms worked the chisel on a guitarshaped piece of alaskan spruce wood shavings curled at her feet creating a cozy bed for spike his bulldog bulk had sunk into the scrap and he snored away flews flapping i watched for a while as robin continued to tune the soundboard tapping chiseling tapping again running her fingers along the inner edges pausing to reflect before resuming her wrists were childsize seemed too fragile to manipulate steel but she handled the tool as if it were a chopstick biting her lower lip then licking it as her back humped more acutely a stray bit of auburn curl sprang loose from the kerchief and she tucked it back impatiently oblivious to my presence though i stood ten fifteen feet away as with most creative people time and space have no meaning for her when her minds engaged i came closer stopped at the far end of the bench mahogany eyes widened she placed the chisel on the workbench and the ivory flash of those two oversize incisors appeared between full soft lips i smiled back and held out a cup enjoying the contours of her face heartshaped olivetinted decorated by a few more lines than ages ago when wed met but still smooth usually she wore earrings not this morning no watch no jewelry or makeup shed rushed out too quickly to bother i felt a nudge at my ankle heard a wheeze and a snort spike grumbled and butted my shin wed both adopted him but hed adopted her call off your beast i said robin laughed and took the coffee thanks baby she touched my face spike growled louder she told him dont worry youre still my handsome setting the cup down she wrapped both her arms around my neck spike produced a poor excuse for a bark raspy and attenuated by his stubby bulldog larynx oh spikey she told him snaring her fingers in my hair if you stop to pet him i said ill start snorting stop what this i kissed her ran my hands over her back down to her rear then up again grazing her shoulder blades starting at the top and kneading the knobs of her spine oh thats good im a little sore bad posture i said not that id ever preach no nothing like that we kissed again more deeply she relaxed allowing her bodyall pounds of itto depend upon mine i felt the warmth of her breath at my ear as i undid the straps of her overalls the denim fell to her waist but no farther blocked by the rim of the workbench i stroked her left arm luxuriating in the feel of firm muscle under soft skin slipping my fingers under her tshirt i aimed for the spot that tended to pain hertwo spots really a pair of knots just above her gluteal cleft robins by no means skeletal shes a curvy woman blessed with hips and thighs and breasts and that sheath of body fat that is so wonderfully female but a small frame meant a back narrow enough for one of my hands to cover both tendernesses simultaneously she arched toward me oh youre bad thought it felt good thats why youre bad i should be working i should be too i took her chin in one hand reached down with my other hand and cupped her bottom no jewelry or makeup but she had taken the time for perfume and the fragrance radiated at the juncture of jawline and jugular back to the sore spots fine go ahead she whispered now that youve corrupted me and im completely distracted her fingers fumbled at my zipper corruption i said this is nothing i touched her she moaned spike went nuts she said i feel like an abusive parent then she put him outside when we finished the coffee was long cold but we drank it anyway the red scarf was on the floor and the wood shavings were no longer in a neat pile i was sitting in an old leather chair naked with robin on my lap still breathing hard still wanting to kiss her finally she pulled away stood got dressed returned to the guitar top a privatejoke smile graced her lips what we moved around a bit just want to make sure we didnt get anything on my masterpiece like what like sweat maybe that would be a good thing i said truly organic luthiery orgasmic luthiery that too i got up and stood behind her smelling her hair i love you love you too she laughed you are such a guy is that a compliment depends on my mood at this moment its a whimsical observation every time we make love you tell me you love me thats good right a guy who expresses his feelings its great she said quickly and youre very consistent i tell you other times dont i of course you do but this is predictable one hundred percent so i said professor castagna has been keeping a record dont have to not that im complaining sweetie you can always tell me you love me i just think its cute my predictability better that than instability well i said i can vary itsay it in another languagehow about hungarian should i call berlitz she pecked my cheek picked up her chisel pure guy she said spike began scratching at the door i let him in and he raced past me came to a short stop at robins feet rolled over and presented his abdomen she kneeled and rubbed him and his short legs flailed ecstatically i said oh you jezebel okay back to the sawmill no saw today just this indicating the chisel i meant me she looked at me over her shoulder tough day ahead the usual i said other peoples problems which is what i get paid for right howd your meeting with milo go has he learned anything about dr mate not so far he asked me to do some research on mate thought id try the computer first shouldnt be hard to produce hits on mate no doubt i said but finding something valuable in the slag heaps another story if i deadend ill try the research library maybe biomed ill be here all day she said if you dont interrupt me ill push my hands too far how about an early dinner sure i mean baby dont stay away i want to hear you say you love me pure guy often especially after a day when id seen more patients than usual we spent evenings where i did very little talking despite all my training sometimes getting the words out got lost on the highway between head and mouth sometimes i thought about the nice things id tell her but never followed through but when we made love for me the physical released the emotional and i supposed that put me in some sort of ychromosome file box theres a common belief that men use love to get sex and women do just the opposite like most alleged wisdom about human beings its anything but absolute ive known women who turned thoughtless promiscuity into a fine art and men so bound by affection that the idea of strangersex repulsed them to the point of impotence id never been sure where richard doss fell along that continuum by the time i met him he hadnt made love to his wife for over three years he told me so within minutes of entering the office as if it was important for me to know of his deprivation hed resisted any notion of anyone but his daughter being my patient yet began by talking about himself if he was trying to clarify something i never figured out what it was hed met joanne heckler in college termed the match ideal offered the fact that hed stayed married to her over twenty years as proof when i met him shed been dead for ninetythree days but he spoke of her as having existed in a very distant past when he professed to have loved her deeply i had no reason to doubt him other than the absence of feeling in his voice eyes body posture not that he was incapable of emotion when i opened the side door that leads to my office he burst into the house talking on a tiny silver cell phone continuing to talk in an animated tone after wed entered the office and id sat behind my desk wagging an index finger to let me know it would be a minute finally he said okay gotta go scott work the spread at this point thats the key if they give us the rate they promised were in like flynn otherwise its a dealkiller get them to commit now not later scott you know the drill eyes flashing free hand waving enjoying it he said well chat later clicked off the phone sat crossed his legs negotiations i said the usual okay first joanne at his mention of his wifes name his voice went dead physically he wasnt what id expected my training is supposed to endow me with an open mind but everyone develops preconceptions and my mental picture of richard doss had been based upon what judy manitow had told me and five minutes of phonesparring aggressive articulate dominant exfrat boy tennisplaying countryclub member tennis partner of bob manitow who was a physician but about as corporatelooking as you could get for no good reason id guessed someone who looked like bob tall imposing a bit beefy the basic ceo hairstyle short and sideparted silver at the temples a wellcut suit in a somber shade white or blue shirt power tie shiny wingtips richard doss was fivefive tops with a weathered leprechaun facewide at the brow tapering to an almost womanish point at the chin a dancers build very lean with square shoulders a narrow waist oversize hands sporting manicured nails coated with clear polish palm springs tan the kind you rarely saw anymore because of the melanoma scare the fibrous complexion of one who ignores melanoma warnings his hair was black kinky and he wore it long enough to evoke another decade white mans afro thin gold chain around his neck his black silk shirt had flap pockets and buccaneer sleeves and hed left the top two buttons undone advertising a hairless chest and extension of the tan baggy tailored gray tweed slacks were held in place by a lizardskin belt with a silver buckle matching loafers no socks he carried a smallish black purselike thing in one hand the silver phone in the other i wouldve pegged him as joe hollywood one of those producer wannabes you see hanging out at sunset plaza cafes the type with cheap apartments on monthtomonth poorly maintained leased corniches too much leisure time schemes masquerading as ideas richard doss had made his way south from palo alto and embraced the la image almost to the point of parody he said my wife was a testament to the failure of modern medicine the silver phone rang he jammed it to his ear hi what okay good no not now bye click where was imodern medicine we saw dozens of doctors they put her through every test in the book cat scans mris serologic toxicologic she had two lumbar punctures no real reason i found out later the neurologist was just fishing around what were her symptoms i said joint pain headaches skin sensitivity fatigue it started out as fatigue shed always been a ball of energy fivetwo a hundred and ten pounds she used to dance play tennis powerwalk the change was gradualat first i figured a flu or one of those crazy viruses thats going around i figured the best thing was stay out of her face give her time to rest by the time i realized something serious was going on she was hard to reach on another planet he hooked a finger under the gold chain joannes parents didnt live long maybe her constitution shed always been into the mom thing that went too i suppose that was her main symptom disengagement from me the kids everything judy told me she was a microbiologist what kinds of things did she work on he shook his head youre hypothesizing the obvious she was infected by some pathogen from her lab logical but wrong that was looked into right away from every anglesome sort of rogue microbe allergies hypersensitivity to a chemical she worked with germs all right but they were plant germsvegetable pathogensmolds and funguses that affect food crops broccoli specifically she had a usda grant to study broccoli do you like broccoli sure i dont as it turns out there are crosssensitivities between plants and animals but nothing joanne worked with fit that categoryher equipment her reagents she went through every blood test known to medicine he thumbed his black silk cuff his watch was blackfaced with a gold band so skinny it looked like a tattoo lets not get distracted he said the precise reason for what happened to joanne will never be known back to the core issue her disengagement the first thing to go was entertaining and socializing she refused to go out with anyone no more business dinnerstoo tired not hungry even though all she did in bed was eat were members of the cliffside country club and shed played tennis and a little golf used the gym no more soon she was going to bed earlier and rising later eventually she started spending all her time in bed saying the pain had gotten worse i told her she might be aching because of inactivityher muscles were contracting stiffening up she didnt answer me thats when i started taking her to doctors he recrossed his legs then there was the weight gain the only thing she didnt withdraw from was food cookies cake potato chips anything sweet or greasy his lips curled as if hed tasted something bad by the end she weighed two hundred ten pounds had more than doubled her weight in less than a year a hundred and ten extra pounds of pure fatisnt that incredible doctor it was hard to keep seeing her as the girl i married she used to be lithe athletic all of a sudden i was married to a strangersome asexual alien youre with someone for twentyfive years you just dont stop liking them but i wont deny it my feelings for her changed for all practical purposes she was no longer my wife i tried to help her with the food suggesting maybe shed be just as satisfied with fruit as with oreos but she wouldnt hear of it and she arranged the grocery deliveries when i was at work i suppose i couldve taken drastic measuresgotten her on fenphen bolted the refrigerator but food seemed to be the only thing that kept her going i felt it was cruel to withdraw it from her i assume every metabolic link was checked out thyroid pituitary adrenal you name it i know enough to be an endocrinologist the weight gain was simply joanne drowning herself in food when i made suggestions about cutting back she responded the same way she did to any opinion i offered by turning off completelyhere look out of the purse came a pair of plasticencased snapshots he made no effort to hand them to me merely stretched out his arm so i had to get up from my chair to retrieve them before and after he said the left photo was a color shot of a young couple green lawn big trees imposing beige buildings id collaborated with a stanford professor on a research project years ago recognized the campus i was a senior she was a sophomore said doss that was taken right after we got engaged for many students the seventies had meant long coifs facial hair torn jeans and sandals counterculture giving way to brooks brothers only when the realities of making a living sank in it was as if richard doss had reversed the process his college do had been a dense black crew cut in the picture he wore a white shirt pressed gray slacks hornrimmed glasses and here were the shiny black wingtips studypallor on the elfin face no tan youthful progenitor of the corporate type id expected him to be distracted expression no celebration of the engagement that i could detect the girl under his arm was smiling joanne heckler petite as described had been pretty in a wellscrubbed way fairskinned and narrowfaced she wore her brown hair long and straight topped by a white band glasses for her too smaller than richards and goldframed a diamond glinted on her ring finger her sleeveless dress was bright blue modest for that era another elf marriage of the leprechauns they say couples who live together long enough start to look like each other richard and joanne had begun that way but diverged i turned to the second photo a washedout polaroid a subject who resembled no one longview of a kingsize bed shot from the foot rumpled gold comforter strewn across a tapestrycovered bed bench high mound of beige pillows propped against the headboard in their midst a head floated white face round so porcine and bloated the features were compressed to a smear bladdercheeks eyes buried in folds just a hint of brown hair tied back tight from a pasty forehead puckermouth devoid of expression below the head beige sheets rose like a bellcurved tented bulk to the right was an elegant carved nightstand in some kind of dark glossy wood with gold pulls behind the headboard was peach wallpaper printed with teal flowers a length of gilded frame and linen mat hinted at artwork cropped out of the photo for one shocking moment i wondered if richard doss had a postmortem shot but no the eyes were open something in them despair no worse a living death eric took it said doss my son he wanted a record of his mom i said hoarse i cleared my throat of what had happened to his mom frankly put it pissed him off he was angry at her no he said as if i were an idiot at the situation thats how my son deals with his anger by documenting by organizing putting things in their place personally i think its a great way to handle stress lets you wade through the emotional garbage analyze the factual content of events get in touch with how you feel then move on because what choice is there wallow in other peoples misery allow yourself to be destroyed he pointed a finger at me as if id accused him of something if that sounds callous he said so be it doctor you havent lived in my house never went through what i did joanne took over a year to leave us we had time to figure things out erics a brilliant boythe smartest person ive ever met even so it affected him he was in his second semester at stanford came home to be with joanne he devoted himself to her so if taking that picture seems callous bear that in mind and its not as if his mother minded she just lay therethat picture captures exactly what she was like at the end how she ever mobilized the energy to contact the sonofabitch who killed her ill never know dr mate he ignored me fingered the silver phone finally our eyes met i smiled trying to let him know i wasnt judging his lids were slightly lowered beneath them dark eyes shone like nuggets of coal ill take those back he leaned forward holding out his hand for the pictures again i had to stand to return them how did stacy cope i said he took his time zipping open the purse and placing the snapshots within crossing his legs yet again massaging the phone as if hoping a call would rescue him from having to answer stacy he said is another story chapter i booted up the computer eldon mates name pulled up over a hundred sites most of the references were reprints of newspaper columns covering mates career as a oneway travel agent pros cons no shortage of strong opinions from experts on both sides everyone responding on an intellectual level nothing psychopathic none of the cold cruelty that had flavored the murder a dr death home page featured a flattering photo of mate recaps of his acquittals and a brief biography mate had been born in san diego sixtythree years ago received a degree in chemistry from san diego state and worked as a chemist for an oil company before entering medical school in guadalajara mexico at the age of forty hed served an internship at a hospital in oakland gotten licensed as a general practitioner at fortysix no specialty training the only jobs the news pieces had mentioned were civilservice positions at health departments all over the southwest where mate had overseen immunization programs and pushed paper no indication hed ever treated a patient beginning a new career as a doctor in middle age but avoiding contact with the living had he been drawn to medicine in order to get closer to death the name and phone number at the bottom of the page was attorney roy haiseldens hed listed no email address next came several euthanasia stories the first few covered the case of roger damon sharveneau a respiratory therapist at a hospital in rochester new york whod confessed eighteen months earlier to snuffing out three dozen intensivecare patients by injecting potassium chloride into their iv lineswanting to ease their journey sharveneaus lawyer claimed his client was insane had him examined by a psychiatrist who diagnosed borderline personality and prescribed the antidepressant imipramine a few days later sharveneau recanted without his confession the only evidence against him was proximity to the icu every night a questionable death had occurred the same applied to three other techs so the police released sharveneau terming the case still under investigation sharveneau filed for disability benefits granted an interview to a local newspaper and claimed hed been under the influence of a shadowy figure named dr burke whom no one had ever seen soon after he overdosed fatally on imipramine the case prompted an investigation of other respiratory techs living in the rochester area several with criminal backgrounds were found working at hospitals and convalescent homes around the state the health commissioner vowed to institute tighter controls i plugged sharveneaus name into the system found only one followup article that cited lack of progress on the original investigation and doubts as to whether the thirtysix deaths had been unnatural the next link was a decadeold case four nurses in vienna had killed as many as three hundred people using overdoses of morphine and insulin arrest conviction sentences ranging from fifteen years to life eldon mate was quoted as suggesting the killers might have been acting out of compassion a similar case from chicago two years later a pair of nurses aides whod smothered elderly terminal patients to death as part of a lesbian romance plea bargain for the one who talked life without parole for the other once again mate had offered a contrarian opinion onward a cleveland piece dated only two months earlier kevin arthur haupt an emergency medical tech working the night shift on a city ambulance had decided to shortcut the treatment of twelve drunks hed picked up on heartattack calls by clamping his hand over their noses and mouths during transport to the hospital discovery came when one of the intended victims turned out to be healthier than expected awoke to find himself being smothered and fought back arrest multiple murder charge guilty plea thirtyyear sentence mate wondered in print if spending money to resuscitate habitual alcoholics was a wise use of tax dollars an old wireservice piece about the netherlands where assisted suicide was no longer prosecuted claimed that doctorinitiated killings had grown to percent of all recorded dutch deaths with percent of physicians admitting theyd euthanized patients deemed unfit to live without the patients consent years ago while working western pediatrics medical center id served on something called the ad hoc life support committeesix physicians and myself drafted by the hospital board to come up with guidelines for ending the treatment of children in finalstage illness wed been a fractious group producing debate and very little else but each of us knew that scarcely a month went by when a slightlylargerthanusual dose of morphine didnt find its way into the mesh of tubes attached to a tiny arm kids suffering from bone or brain cancer atrophied livers ravaged lungs who just happened to stop breathing once their parents had said goodbye some caring soul ending the pain of a child who wouldve died anyway sparing the family the agony of a protracted deathwatch the same motivation claimed by eldon h mate why did it feel different to me from mates gloating use of the humanitron because i believed the doctors and nurses on cancer wards had been acting out of compassion but i suspected mates motivations because mate came across obnoxious and publicityseeking was that the worst type of hypocrisy on my part accepting covert godplay from those i greeted in the hall while allowing myself to be repelled by mates inyourface approach to death so what if the screeching little man with the homemade killing machine wouldnt have won any charm contests did the psyche of the travel agent matter when the final destination was always the same my father had died quietly fading away from cirrhosis and kidney failure and general breakdown of his body after a lifetime of bad habits muscles reabsorbing skin bagging as he devolved into a wizened yellowed gnome i hardly recognized as the poisons in his system accumulated it took only a few weeks for harry delaware to sink from lethargy to torpor to coma if hed gone out screaming in agony would i now harbor any reservations about the humanitron and what about people like joanne doss suffering but undiagnosed if you accepted death as a civil rights issue did a medical label matter whose life was it anyway religion supplied answers but when you took god out of the equation things got complicated that was as good a reason as any for god i supposed i wished id been blessed with a greater capacity for faith and obedience what would happen if one day i found myself being devoured by cancer or deadened by paralysis sitting there hand poised to strike the enter key i found that my thoughts kept flying back to my fathers last days strangehe rarely came to mind then i pictured dad as a healthy man big bald head creased bull neck sandpaper hands from all those years turning wood on the lathe alcohol breath and tobacco laughter onehanded pushups the toohard slap on the back hed been well into his fifties by the time i could hold my own against him in the arm wrestles he demanded as a greeting ritual during my increasingly rare trips back to missouri i found myself edging forward on the chair positioning myself for combat just as id done as dads forearm and mine pressed against each other hot and sticky elbows slipping on the formica of the kitchen table as we purpled and strained muscles quivering with tetany mom leaving the room looking pained by the time dad hit fiftyfive the pattern was set mostly id win occasionally wed tie hed laugh at first alexanderer when i was young i could climb walls then hed light up a chesterfield frown and mutter leave the room my visits thinned to once a year the ten days i spent sitting silently holding my mothers hand as he died was my longest stay since leaving home for college i shuttered the memories tried to relax punched a key the computerperfect silent companion that it wasobliged by flashing a new image a site posted by a washington dcbased handicappedrights group named still alive a position statement all human life was precious no one should judge anyone elses quality of life then a section on mateto this group hitler incarnate archival photo of still alive members picketing a motel where mate had

minutes safe clean silent let the camera focus on the travelers face show how peaceful they were once the thiopental kicked in teach the world that the true nature of compassion isnt some priest or rabbi claiming to be gods holy messenger or some government mongoloid lackey who couldnt pass a basic biology course trying to tell me whats life and what isnt cause its not that complex amigos when the brain aint workin you aint livin the tonight show yeah that would be educational if they let me set it up the right way sure id do it mate in response to a press question about why he liked publicity dr mate should get the nobel prize double payment for medicine and peace i wouldnt mind a piece of that myself being his lawyer i deserve it haiselden other assorted oddities ranked lower for relevance a threeyearold denver news item about a colorado outsider artist with the improbable name of zero tollranee whod created a series of paintings inspired by mate and his machine using an abandoned building in a rundown section of denver tollrance previously unknown had exhibited thirty canvases a freelance writer had covered the show for the denver post citing several portraits of the controversial death doctor in a wide range of familiar poses gilbert stuarts george washington thomas gainsboroughs blue boy vincent van goghs bandagedear selfportrait andy warhols marilyn monroe nonmate works included collages of coffins cadavers skulls and maggotinfested meat but perhaps the most ambitious of tollrances productions is a faithfully rendered recreation of rembrandts anatomy lesson a graphic portrayal of human dissection with dr mate serving a dual role as scalpelwielding lecturer as well as flayed cadaver when asked how many paintings had sold tollrance walked away without comment mate as cutter and victim be interesting to talk to mr tollrance save print two citations from a healthissues academic bulletin board posted by harvard university a geriatric study found that while percent of the relatives of elderly patients favored legalizing physicianassisted suicide only percent of the old people agreed and a study done at a cancer treatment center found that twothirds of the american public endorsed assisted death but percent of cancer patients suffering from constant pain had no interest in exploring the topic and felt that a doctors bringing it up would erode their trust in a feminist resource site i found an article in a journal called shero entitled mercy or misogyny does dr mate have a problem with women the author wondered why percent of mates travelers had been female mate she claimed had never been known to have a relationship with a woman and had refused to answer questions about his personal life freudian speculation followed milo hadnt mentioned any family i made a note to follow up on that the final item four years ago in san francisco a group calling itself the secular humanist infantry had granted mate its highest award the heretic prior to the ceremony a syringe mate had used on a recent travel venture had been auctioned off for two hundred dollars only to be confiscated immediately by an undercover police officer citing violation of state health regulations commotion and protest as the cop dropped the needle into an evidence bag and exited during his acceptance speech mate donated his windbreaker as a consolation prize and termed the officer a mental gnat with all the morals of a rota virus the name of the winning bidder caught my eye alice zoghbie treasurer of the secular humanist infantry now president of the socrates club the same woman whod leased the death van and left that day for amsterdam i ran a search on the club found the home page topped by a logo of the greek philosophers sculpted head surrounded by a wreath that i assumed was hemlock as milod said headquarters on glenmont circle in glendale california the socrates mission statement emphasized the personal ownership of life unfettered by the outmoded and barbaric conventions foisted upon society by organized religion signed alice zoghbie mpa a hundreddollar fee entitled the fortunate to notification of events and all other benefits of membership amex visa mc and disc accepted zoghbies masters in public administration didnt tell me much about her professional background searching her name produced a long article in the san jose mercury news that filled in the blanks entitled righttodie groups leaders comments cause controversy the piece described zoghbie as fiftyish pencilthin and tall the former hospital personnel director is now engaged fulltime running the socrates club an organization devoted to legalizing assisted suicide until recently members have maintained a low profile concentrating upon filing friendofcourt briefs in righttodie cases however recent remarks by zoghbie at last sundays brunch at the western sun inn here in san jose have cast the club into the limelight and raised questions about its true goals during the meeting attended by an estimated fifty people zoghbie delivered a speech calling for the humane dispatch of patients with alzheimers disease and other types of thought impairment as well as disabled children and others who are legally incapable of making the decision theyd clearly form if they were in their right minds i worked at a hospital for twenty years the tan whitehaired woman said and i witnessed firsthand the abuses that took place in the name of treatment real compassion isnt creating vegetables real compassion is scientists putting their heads together to create a measurement scale that would quantify suffering those who score above a predetermined criterion could then be helped in a timely manner even if they lacked the capacity to liberate themselves reaction to zoghbies proposal by local religious leaders was swift and negative catholic bishop armand rodriguez termed the plan a call to genocide and dr archie van sandt of the mount zion baptist church accused zoghbie of being an instrument of cancerous secularism rabbi eugene brandner of temple emanuel said that zoghbies ideas were certainly not in line with jewish thought at any point along the spectrum an unattributed statement by the socrates club issued two days later attempted to qualify zoghbies remarks terming them an impetus to discussion rather than a policy statement dr j randolph smith director of the western medical associations committee on medical ethics viewed the disavowal with some skepticism a simple reading of the transcript shows this was a perfectly clear expression of philosophy and intent the slippery slope yawns before us and groups such as the socrates club seem intent on shoving us down into the abyss of amorality given further acceptance of views such as ms zoghbies its only a matter of time before the legalization of murder of those who say they want to die gives way to the murder of those who have never asked to die as is now the case in the netherlands i logged off called milo at the station a young man answered his phone asked me who i was with some suspicion and put me on hold a few seconds later milo said hi new secretary detective stephen korn one of my little helpers whats up got some stuff for you but nothing profound got a resolved ethical issue too but ill save that for later what kind of stuff he said mostly biography and the expected controversy but alice zoghbies name came up alice zoghbie just called me he said back in la and willing to talk thought she wasnt due for two days she cut her trip short distraught about mate delayed grief reaction i said mates been dead for a week she claims she didnt hear about it till yesterday was up in nepal somewhereclimbing mountains the amsterdam thing was the tail end of her trip big confab of death freaks from all over the world not the place to choke on your chicken salad huh anyway zoghbie says she had no access to news in nepal got to amsterdam three days ago her hosts met her at the airport and gave her the news she slept over one day booked a return flight so she arrived two days ago i said still a bit of delay before she called you giving herself time to think composing herself her quote when are you meeting her three hours at her place he recited the glenmont address socrates club headquarters i said found their website hundred bucks to join creditcard friendly wonder how many of her bills that pays you dont trust this ladys intentions her views dont inspire trust she thinks senile old folks and handicapped kids should be put out of their misery whether they want to be or not got the quotes for youpart of todays work product along with assorted other goodies including some other deathfreak stuff and more weirdness i told him about roger sharveneau and the other hospital ghouls finished with zero tollrances exhibition cute he said the art worlds always been a warm and fuzzy place one thing about tollrance i found particularly interesting he posed mate in the anatomy lesson as wielding the scalpel and getting flayed so it implies a certain ambivalencewanting to play doctor on the doctor youre saying i should take this guy seriously might be interesting to talk to him tollrance like thats a real name denver ill see what i can find how far down the family list have your little helpers gotten i said all the way down in terms of locating phone numbers and first attempts at contact he said theyve talked to about half the sample everyone loves mate not everyone want me to come along to meet alice indeathland sure he said look how cruel life can be climbing mountains in nepal one day enduring the police the next shes probably one of those fit types body image uber alles depends on whose body youre talking about chapter we agreed to meet at the station in two hours and i hung up id intended to bring up the doss family but hadnt my excuse some topics didnt lend themselves to phone chat i wanted to know more about eldon mate the physician so i drove over to the biomed library at the u found myself a terminal the periodicals index gave me a few more magazine articles but nothing new i scanned scientific databases for any technical articles mate might have published not expecting anything in view of his lackluster career but i found two citations a chemical abstracts reference that led me to a thirtyyearold letter to the editor mate had written in response to an article about polymerizationsomething about small molecules combining to create large molecules and the potential for better gasoline mate disagreed crankily the author of the article a professor at mit had dismissed mates comments as irrelevant mates title back then had been assistant research chemist iteg petroleum the second reference appeared in medline sixteen years old also a letter this time in a swedish pathology journal mate had his md by then cited his affiliation at oxford hill hospital in oakland california no title no mention that he was a lowly intern the second letter didnt argue with anyone titled precise measurement of time of death a social boon it began with a quote by sir thomas browne we all labour against our own cure for death is the cure of all diseases mate went on to bemoan the stigma associated with cellular cessation and subsequent moral cowardice exhibited by physicians when dealing with parathanatological phenomena as the ultimate caretakers of body and that fiction known as soul we must do everything in our power to demystify the process of life termination utilizing the scientific tools at our disposal to avoid needless prolongation of life that is the fruit of theologybased myths in this regard quantification of precise time of death will be useful in robbing the myth mongers of their fictions and save costs that accrue from the needless employment of socalled heroic measures that create nothing more than respirating corpses along these lines i have attempted to discern which outward physical manifestations advertise the precise shutoff of vital systems the central nervous system often continues to fire synaptically well after the heart stops beating and vice versa even a highschool biology student can keep a pithed frogs heart beating for a substantial postmortem period through the use of stimulant drugs furthermore brain death is not a discrete event and this fact leads to confusion and uncertainty i have thus looked for other changes specifically ocular and muscular alterations that correlate with our best judgment of thanatological progress i have sat at the bedside of numerous premortem patients gazing into their eyes and studying minute movements of their faces though this research is in the formative stage i am encouraged by what appears to be a dual manifestation of cardiac and neurological shutoff typified by simultaneous twitchlike movement of the eyes combined with a measurable slackening of the lips in some patients i have also discerned an audible noise that appears to manifest sublaryngitically perhaps the death rattle commonly cited in popular fiction however this does not occur in all patients and is best dispensed with in favor of the aforementioned ocularmuscular phenomenon i label the lightsout syndrome i suggest that this event be studied in great detail for its potential in serving as a simple yet precise indicator of cellular surrender interns back then worked hundredhour weeks this intern had found the time to indulge his extracurricular interest sitting and staring into the eyes of the dying trying to capture the precise moment my hunch about his intentions confirmed early in the game mates obsession had been with the minutiae of death not the quality of life no comments from the swedish journal editor i wondered how mates side activities had been received at oxford hill hospital leaving the reading room i found a pay phone in the hallway got oakland information and asked for the number no listing returning to the computers i looked up the call when i pulled up milo was standing in front with two men in their late twenties both wore gray sport coats and dark slacks and held notepads against their thighs both were tall as milo each was forty pounds lighter neither looked happy the man to the left had a puffy face squashed features and wheatcolored blowdried hair the other di was dark balding bespectacled milo said something to them and they returned inside your little elves i said when he came over korn and demetri they dont like working for me and my opinion of them aint too grand i put them back on the phones recontacting families they whined about scut workoh this younger generation ready for zoghbie lets take my ferrari in case we need a police presence he crossed the street to the police lot and i followed in the seville waiting till he backed out then sliding into his parking space signs all over said police personnel only all others will be towed i got in the unmarked and handed him the material id printed from the internet he put it on the backseat wedged between two of the file boxes that filled the space the car smelled of old breakfast the police radio was stuttering and milo snapped it off what if i said pointing to the warning signs ill go your bail stretching his neck to one side he winced cleared his throat pressed down on the gas and sped to santa monica boulevard then over to the north toward the valley i knew what i had to do and my body responded by tightening up when we passed the mammoth white boxes that the getty museum comprised i told him about joanne doss he didnt say anything for a while opened his window spit rolled it up another minute passed you were waiting for the right moment to inform me as a matter of fact i was till a few hours ago i couldnt tell you anything because even the fact that id seen them was confidential then mr doss called and asked me to see his daughter and i figured id have to bow off mate but he wants me to continue first things first huh his jaw worked i kept quiet and if hed said not to mention it id have bowed off told you i couldnt explain why half mile of silence he stretched his neck again doss yeah local familythe palisades toward the end of the listthe missus was in her early forties traveler number fortyeight i said you knew her no she was already dead when i saw stacythe daughter mr doss is one of those who has not returned our repeated calls he travels a lot that so anything about him i should worry about such as he shrugged you tell me he said you could blab right he kept his eyes on the freeway but i felt surveilled sorry if this is rubbing you the wrong way i said maybe i shouldve begged off the case right from the beginning pause long pause as if he was considering that finally he said nah im just being a hardass weve all got our rule books so what was the matter with mrs doss that led her to consult dr mate she was one of the undiagnosed ones i mentioned had been deteriorating for a while fatigue chronic pain she withdrew socially took to bed gained a hundred pounds he whistled touched his own gut and no clue as to why all this happened she saw a lot of doctors but no formal diagnosis i said maybe a head case like i said i never knew her milo he smiled meaning youre also thinking she mightve been a head case and mate killed her anywayscuse me assisted her passage that could irritate a family member if they didnt think she was really sick he waited i said nothing how long after she died did you see the daughter three months whyre you seeing her again something to do with mates murder that i cant get into i said lets just say its nothing you have to worry about something that just happens to come up now after mates killed college i said nows when kids get serious about applying to college he didnt answer the freeway was uncommonly clear and we sped toward the interchange milo pumped the unmarked up the eastbound ramp and we merged into slightly heavier traffic orange signs on the turnoff announced impending construction for one and a half years everyone was going fifteen miles over the limit as if getting in some last speed licks he said so youre telling me mr doss is like all the othersbig fan of mate ill leave it to him to express his opinion on that he smiled again not a nice smile at all the guy didnt like mate i didnt say that no you didnt he eased up on the gas pedal we cruised past the van nuys exits sherman oaks north hollywood the freeway turned into the i said i found a feminist journal that claimed mate hated women because eighty percent of his travelers were female and hed never been seen with a woman know anything about his personal life graceless change of subject he knew what i was doing but let it ride not so far he lived alone and his landlady said shed never seen him go out with anyone i havent checked marriage licenses yet but no ones turned up claiming insurance benefits wonder if a guy like that would carry life insurance i said why not i dont think he valued life well maybe youre right cause i didnt find any policies at his apartment then again all his papers might be with that goddamn attorney haiselden who is still incommunicado maybe ms zoghbie can direct us to him find out anything else about her no criminal record not even parking tickets guess she just gets off on people dying there seems to be a lot of that going around doesnt there or maybe its just my unique perspective any attraction alice zoghbie had to the culture of death wasnt reflected by her landscaping she lived in a vanilla stucco english country house centered on a modest lot in the northern hills of glendale cute house the spotless shake roof over the entry turret was topped by a copper rooster weather vane white pullback drapes framed immaculate mullion windows a flagstone path twisted its way toward an iron canopy over a carved oak door banks of flowers rimmed the house arranged by descending height the crinkled foliage and purple bloom of statice then billowing clouds of multicolored impatiens fringed by a low border of some sort of creeping white blossom a white audi sat in the cobblestoned driveway shaded by a young carefully shaped podocarpus tree still staked on the other side of the flagstone stood an equally tonsured much larger sycamore where the sun hit the sloping lawn was so green it appeared spraypainted the big tree had started to release its leaves and the sprinkle of rusty brown on grass and stone was the sole suggestion that not everything could be controlled milo and i parked on the street and climbed the pathway the door knocker was a large brass goats head and he lifted the front part of the animals face causing it to leer allowed the jaw piece to fall setting off oak vibrations the door opened before the sound died detectives said the woman in the doorway thrust of hand firm dry handshake for both of us please come on in alice zoghbie was indeed fiftyishearly fifties was my guess but despite sunworn skin and a cap of whitehot hair she seemed more youthful than middleaged tall slim fullbusted strong square shoulders long limbs rosy overlay on the outdoorsy dermis wide sapphire eyes as she led us through the round entry hall created by the turret into a small elegant living room her stride took on a dancers bouncespeedy welllubricated arms swinging hips swaying the room was set up as carefully as the flower beds yellow walls white moldings a red damask sofa various floralprint chairs little tables placed strategically by someone with an eye california oil paintings hung on the walls all in period gilt frames nothing that looked expensive but each picture was right for its place alice zoghbie stood in front of a blue brocade chair and cocked a hip indicating the red couch for us after we sat she folded herself on the chair tucked one leg under the other and smoothed back a feather of white bangs down cushions on the sofa made us sink low milos weight plunged him below me and i noticed him shifting uncomfortably alice zoghbie laced her fingers in her lap her face was round taut around the mandible seamed at the eyes she wore a bulky babyblue cashmere turtleneck pressed blue jeans white socks white suede loafers big silver pearls covered her earlobes and a gold chain interspersed with multicolored cabochons followed the swell of her chest bare fingers between us was a tileinlaid coffee table set with a japanese imari bowl full of hard candy gold and green nuggets butterscotch and mint please she said pointing to the candy managing to sound lighthearted while wearing a grave expression no thanks milo said appreciate your seeing us maam this is all so hideous do you have any idea who sacrificed eldon sacrificed thats what it was she said some fanatic asshole making a point one hand clenched she stared down at her fist opened the fingers eldon and i talked about the risksome lunatic deciding to make headlines he said it wouldnt happen and i believed him but it did didnt it so dr mate wasnt afraid eldon didnt function from fear he was his own man knew the only way to dictate your own passage was to dictate the terms and eldon was committed vital he intended to be around for a long long time milo moved his bulk again as if trying to remain afloat in a sea of red silk the movement served only to plunge him lower and he edged forward on the couch but you and he did discuss danger i brought it up in general terms so no theres no specific asshole i can direct you toward maybe it was one of those pathetic cripples who used to carp at him still alive i said them their ilk milo said you spoke in general terms but did something happen to make you worry maam no i simply wanted eldon to be more careful he didnt want to hear it he just didnt believe anyone would hurt him what kind of cautions did you want him to take simple security have you seen his apartment yes maam then you know its a joke anyone could just walk in it wasnt that eldon was reckless he simply wasnt attuned to his surroundings most brilliant people arent look at einstein some foundation sent him a tenthousanddollar check and he never cashed it dr mate was brilliant said milo alice zoghbie stared at him dr mate was one of the great minds of our generation that didnt jibe with med school in mexico internship at an obscure hospital the bureaucratic jobs alice zoghbie might have known what i was thinking because now she turned to me and said einstein worked as a clerk until the world discovered him the world wasnt smart enough to understand him eldon had a mind that just never stopped working thinking all the time science history you name it and unlike most people he wasnt blinded by personal circumstance because he lived alone i said no no thats not what i mean he didnt get distracted by irrelevancies ill bet you assume his own parents died in pain and thats why he decided to dedicate his life to relieving pain her hand drew an invisible x wrong both his mother and his father lived to ripe old ages and passed on peacefully maybe that impressed him said milo seeing the way it should be alice zoghbie uncrossed a long leg what im trying to get across to you people is that eldon had a worldview perspective seeing the big picture zoghbie shot him a disgusted look talking about him is making me very sad stating it calmly almost boastfully milo remained expressionless and i did the same she gazed back at both of us as if waiting for further response suddenly the lower lids of the sapphire eyes pooled and twin rivulets flowed down her cheeks tears flowing perfectly parallel to her slender nose she sat there immobile allowing the tracks to reach the corners of her mouth before reaching up and dabbing with spidery fingers pink glossy nail polish from somewhere in the house a clock chimed she said i sure as hell hope you find the vicious fuck who did this they just cant get away with this that would be the worst thing they they he whoever what would be the worst thing maam no consequences everything should have consequences well said milo my job is catching vicious fucks zoghbies expression went flat maam is there anything you can tell us that might help the process along enough with the maam okay she said its coming across patronizing is there anything i can tell you sure look for a fanaticprobably a religious extremist my bet would be a catholic they seem to be the worst though i was married to a muslim and theyre no great shakes her head bobbed forward as she studied milos face whats your background actually i was raised catholic maam so was i said zoghbie down on my knees confessing my sins what rubbish the pity for both of us candles and guilt and bullshit spewed by impotent old men in funny hatsyes id definitely look for a catholic or a bornagain christian anyone fundamentalist for that matter orthodox jews are just as bad but they dont seem as predisposed to violence as the catholics probably because theres not enough of them to get cocky fanatics are all cut out of the same mold gods on my side i can do whatever the fuck i please as if the pope or imam whatever is going to be around when your loved one is writhing in agony and choking on their own vomit the whole righttolife thing is obscene lifes sacred but its okay to set off bombs at abortion clinics pick off doctors eldon was made an example of look for a religious fanatic she smiled it didnt fit the diatribe her eyes were dry again talk about sin she said hypocrisys the worst sin why the hell cant we get past the bullshit they feed us in childhood and learn to think independently conditioning i said thats for lower animals were supposed to be better milo pulled out his pad do you know of any actual threats against dr mate the specificity of the questionthe police routine seemed to bore her if there were eldon never told me what about his attorney roy haiselden do you know him as well roy and i have met any idea where he is maam cant seem to locate him roys all over the place she said he owns laundromats up and down the state laundromats coinops in strip malls thats how he makes his money what he does for eldon doesnt pay the bills it basically killed the rest of his law practice have you known him and dr mate for a long time ive known eldon for five years roy a little less any reason mr haiselden wouldnt return our calls youd have to ask him that milo smiled five years howd you get to know dr mate id been following his career for a while her turn to smile hearing about him was like a giant lightbulb going on someone was finally shaking things up doing what needed to be done i wrote him a letter i guess you could call it a fan letter though that sounds so adolescent i told him how much i admired his courage id been working with a humanist group had retired from my jobgot retired actually i decided to find some meaning in all of it you were fired because of your views i said her shoulders shifted toward me big surprise she snapped i was working in a hospital and had the nerve to talk about things that needed talking about that chafed the hides of the assholes in charge which hospital pasadena mercy catholic hospital she said leaving that dump was the best thing that ever happened to me i founded the socrates club kept up with the shimy first group we were having a convention in san francisco and eldon had just won another victory in court so i thought who better to deliver the keynote he answered my invitation with a charming note accepting blink after that eldon and i began to see each othersocially but not sexually since youre obviously going to ask life of the mind id have him over for dinner wed discuss things id cook for him probably the only decent meals he had dr mate didnt care about food said milo like most geniuses eldon tended to ignore his personal needs im a great cook felt it was the least i could do for a mentor a mentor said milo he was training you a philosophical guide she jabbed a finger at us stop wasting your time with me and catch this fuckhead milo sat back sank in surrendered to gravity so the two of you became friends you seem to be the only female friend he had he wasnt gay if thats what youre getting at just choosy he was married and divorced a long time ago not an edifying experience why not eldon didnt say i could see he didnt want to talk about it and i respected his wishes now is there anything else lets talk about the weekend dr mate was murdered you rented the van yes i did id done it before because when eldon showed up at the rental company sometimes there were troubles they didnt want to rent to him zoghbie nodded so said milo the night he was murdered dr mate was planning to help another traveler i assume he didnt tell you who of course not eldon never discussed his clinical activities he called and said alice ill be needing a van tomorrow why didnt he discuss his work said milo ethics detective zoghbie said with exaggerated patience patient confidentiality he was a doctor the phone rang distant as the clock chime better get that she said standing could be the press theyve been in touch no but they might be once they find out im back how would they know that maam please she said dont be naive they have their ways she dancewalked through the dining room and out of sight milo rubbed his face and turned to me think mate was boffing her she did take the time to mention that their relationship was social but not sexual because we were obviously going to ask so maybe alice zoghbie returned looking grim the press said milo a nuisance callmy accountant the irs wants to audit mebig surprise huh ive got to go gather my tax records so if theres nothing else she pointed to the door we stood you climb mountains for fun said milo i hike detective longdistance walks on the lower slopes no pitons or any of that stuff she gave milos gut a long appraisal stop moving and you might as well die that reminded me of something richard doss had told me six months ago ill rest when im dead milo said did dr mate stay active mentally only never could get him to exercise but what does that have to do with so you have no idea who dr mate was going to help the weekend he died no i told you we never discussed patient issues the reason im asking is you think a traveler killed him thats absurd why maam these are sick people were talking about detective weak people quadriplegics lou gehrigs disease terminal cancer how could they have the strength and why would they now please her foot tapped she looked jumpy i supposed an audit could do that to you just a few more details said milo whyd you choose the avis in tarzana far from here and from dr mates place that was the point detective what was covering our tracks just in case someone got suspicious and refused to rent to us thats also why i chose avis we alternated last time was hertz before that budget she hurried to the door opened it stood tapping her foot forget about it being a traveler none of eldons people would hurt him most of the time they required help just to get over to the travel site help from who long silence she smiled folded her arms no were not going there other people have been involved said milo dr mate had assistants unhunh no way couldnt tell you even if i wanted to because i dont know didnt want to know because dr mate never discussed clinical details with you now please leave lets say dr mate did have confederates say whatever you please what makes you so sure one of them couldnt have turned on him because why would they she laughed harshly too loudly i cant get you to see eldon was brilliant he wouldnt have trusted just anyone she put a foot out onto her front porch jabbed a manicured fingernail look for a fanatic what about a fanatic passing himself off as a confederate oh please another loud laugh zoghbies hands flew upward fingers fluttering she dropped them quickly a series of clumsy movements at odds with the dancers grace i cant answer any more stupid questions this is a very hard time for me the tears returned no more symmetrical trickle a gush this time she wiped them hastily she slammed the door behind us chapter back in the unmarked milo looked up at the vanilla cottage what a harpy her attitude changed after that phone call i said maybe it was the irs or she was let down that it wasnt the press but maybe it was someone whod worked with mate telling her to be discreet dr death had his own little elves huh she did everything but confirm their existence which leads me to an interesting question this morning we talked about the killer luring mate to mulholland by posing as a traveler what if he was someone mate already knew and trusted elf goes bad elf gets next to mate because he likes killing people then he decides hes finished his apprenticeship time to coopt it would fit with playing doctor taking mates black bag so i shouldnt start rounding up catholics and orthodox jews huh old alice would have been an asset to the third reich too bad her alibi checks outflights confirmed by the airlines he punched the dashboard lightly a confederate gone bad ive gotta get hold of haiselden see what kind of paper hes been stashing what about storage lockers in mates name i said nothing so far no pobs either its like he was covering his tracks all the timethe same kind of crap you get with a vie whos a criminal all part of the intrigue plus he did have enemies then why wasnt he more careful shes right about the way he lived no security at all monumental ego i said play god long enough you can start to believe your own publicity mate was out for notoriety right from the beginning fooled around on the edge of medical ethics long before he built the machine i told him about the letter to the pathology journal mates deathside vigils staring into the faces of dying people he said cellular cessation huh goddamn ghoul can you imagine being one of those poor patients here you are stuck in the icu fading in and out of consciousness you wake up see some schmuck in a white coat just sitting there staring at you not doing a damn thing to help just trying to figure out exactly when youre gonna croak and how could he look in their eyes if they were that sick maybe he lifted the lids and peeked i said or used toothpicks to prop them up he slapped the dash again some childhood he mustve had another glance at the vanilla house an exwife first ive heard of it dont want her popping up in the press and making me look like the fool i feel smile and some of my best sources have been exes they love to talk he got on the cell phone steve its me no nothing earthshaking listen call county records and see if you can find any marriage certificate or divorce papers on old eldon if not try other counties orange ventura berdoo try em all before med school he worked in san diego i said try san diego first steve just found out he was based there before he became a doc why because it might be important what hold on he turned to me whered mate go to med school guadalajara that made him frown mexico steve forget trying to pry anything out of there i said he interned in oakland oxford hills hospital seventeen years ago its out of business but there might be some kind of record thats dr delaware said milo hes been doing some independent research yeah he does that what ill ask him if none of what i told you pans out try our buds at social security no ones filed for insurance benefits but maybe therere some kind of federal payments going out to dependents i know its an hour of voice mail and brain death steve but thats the job if you get nothing with ss go back to the counties kern riverside whatever just keep working your way through the state yeah yeah yeah any callback from haiselden okay stay on him too leave fifty goddamn messages at his house and his office if you have to zoghbie said he runs laundromats yeah as in clean clothes check that out if that doesnt lead anywhere bug his neighbors be a pest whats that which one tiny smile interesting yeah i know the name i definitely know the name he hung up poor baby is getting bored he wanted me to ask you if working with me will turn him psychotic theres always that chance what made you smile your man doss finally called back korn and demetri are gonna talk to him tomorrow progress i said mrs doss he said was she able to move around on her own as far as i know she may have driven herself to meet mate may have no one knows she just walked out on hubbie i shrugged but she had middle of the night no note no warning no goodbye the deepest wound shed inflicted on stacy not very considerate he said pain will do that to you time to call in dr mate take two aspirins hook yourself up to the machine and dont call me in the morning he started up the car then swiveled toward me again wedging his bulk against the steering wheel seeing as well be facetoface with mr doss soon are there any blanks you want to fill in he didnt like mate i said wanted me to tell you bragging more like nothing to hide what was his beef with mate dont know maybe the fact that mate killed his wife and he never knew it was going to happen could be he leaned across the seat moved his big face inches from mine i smelled aftershave and tobacco the wheel dug into his sport coat bunching the tweed around his neck highlighting love handles whats going on here alex the guy said you could talk whyre you parceling info out to me i guess im still not comfortable talking about patients because sometimes patients feel really communicative then they change their minds and whats the big deal milo dosss feelings about mate arent relevant he has an alibi as tight as zoghbies out of town just like zoghbie the day mate was killed he was in san francisco looking at a hotel to buy i nodded he was in the company of a group of japanese businessmen has the receipts to prove it he told you all that yes well aint that fascinating he knuckled his right eye with his left hand in my experience its mostly criminals who come prepared with an alibi he wasnt prepared i said it came up in the course of the conversation what like hows it going richard peachy doc and by the way i have an alibi i didnt answer he said buying a hotel guy like that rich honcho gotta be used to delegating why would he do his own dirty work so what the hells an alibi worth the job done on mate all that anger all that personal viciousness did it smell like hired help to you depends upon what the help was hired to do and who got hired he reached out placed a heavy hand on my shoulder i felt like a suspect and i didnt like it do you see doss as capable of setting it up ive never seen any signs of that i said in a tight voice he released his hand that sounds like a maybe this is exactly why i didnt want to get into it theres absolutely nothing i know about richard doss that tells me hes capable of contracting that level of brutality okay that he said sounds like expertwitness talk then count yourself lucky cause when i go to court i get paid well we stared at each other he shifted away looked past me up at zoghbies house two california jays danced among the branches of the sycamore this is something he said what is you and me all the cases weve been through and now were having a wee bit of tension veneering the last few words in an irish brogue i wanted to laugh tried to more to fill time and space than out of any glee the movement started at my diaphragm but died a soundless ripple as my mouth refused to obey hey i said can this friendship be saved okay then he said as if he hadnt heard heres a direct question for you is there anything else you know that i should know about doss or anything else heres a direct answer no you want to drop the case want me to not unless you want to i dont want to but why would you want to stay on it he said curious about what whodunit whydunit and riding around with the police makes me feel ohsosafe you want me off though just say so oh christ he said nyahnyahnyahnyahnyah now we both laughed he was sweating again and my head hurt so he said onward you do your job i do mine and ill get to scotland afore ye it aint scotland i care about he said its mulholland drivegonna be interesting hearing what mr doss has to say maybe ill interview him myself when are you seeing the daughterwhats her name stacy tomorrow he wrote it down how many other kids in the family a brother two years older eric hes up at stanford tomorrow he said college stuff you got it i may be talking to her too alex she didnt carve up mate long as youve got a good rapport with her why dont you ask her if her daddy had it done oh sure he shifted into drive i said i wouldnt mind getting a look at mates apartment why to see how the genius lived where is it hollywood where else aint no bidness like shooow bidness cmon ill shooow youfasten your seat belt chapter mates building was on north vista between sunset and hollywood the upper level of a seventyyearold duplex the landlady lived below a tiny ancient named mrs ednalynn krohnfeld who walked stiffly and wore twin hearing aids a sixtyinch mitsubishi tv ruled her front room and after she let us in she returned to her chair folded a crocheted brown throw over her knees and fastened her attention upon a talk show the skin tones on the screen were off flesh dyed the carotene orange of a nuclear sunburn trash talk show a pair of poorly kept women cursing at each other setting off a storm of bleeps the host a feloniously coiffed blonde with lizard eyes behind oversize eyeglasses pretended to represent the voice of reason milo said were here to take another look at dr mates apartment mrs krohnfeld no answer the image of a holloweyed man flashed in the righthand corner of the screen gaptoothed fellow leering smugly a written legend said duane deneshas husband but jeanines lover mrs krohnfeld the old woman quarterturned but kept watching have you thought of anything since last week that you want to tell me mrs krohnfeld the landlady squinted the room was curtained to gloom and barricaded with old but cheap mahogany pieces milo repeated the question tell you about what she said anything about dr mate head shake hes dead has anyone been by recently mrs krohnfeld what another repeat by for what asking about dr mate snooping around the apartment no reply she continued to squint her hands tightened and gathered the comforter duane swaggering onstage taking a seat between the harridans giving a sowhat shrug and spreading his legs wide wide wide mrs krohnfeld muttered something milo kneeled down next to her recliner whats that maam just a bum fixed on the screen that guy up there said milo no no no here out there climbing up the stairs she jabbed an impatient finger at the front window slapped both hands to her cheeks and plucked a bumlotsa hairdirty you know street trash climbing the stairs to dr mates apartment when no nojust tried to get up there i shooed him away glued to the orange melodrama when was this few days agomaybe thursday what did he want said milo how would i know you think i let him in one of the feuding women had jumped to her feet pointing and cursing at her rival duane was positioned between them relishing every struttingrooster moment of it bleep bleep bleep mrs krohnfeld read lips and her own mouth slackened such talk milo said the bum what else can you tell me about him no answer he asked the same question louder mrs krohnfeld jerked toward us yeah a bum he went jabbing over her shoulder tried to go up i saw him yelled out the window to get the hell outa there and he skedaddled on foot grunt that type dont drive no mercedes what a louse this time directing the epithet at duane stupid idjits wasting their time on a louse like that thursday yupor friday look at that the women had raced toward each other and collided alloying into a clawing hairpulling cyclone idjits milo sighed and rose were going upstairs now mrs krohnfeld when can i put the place up for rent soon sooner the betteridjits the steps to mates unit were on the right side of the duplex and before i climbed i had a look at the rear yard not much more than a strip of concrete barely space for the double carport an old chevy that milo identified as mates was parked next to an even older chrysler new yorker unused laundry lines sketched crosshatch shadows across the cement low block fencing revealed neighbors on all sides mostly multipleunit apartment buildings higher than the duplex throw a barbecue down here and lots of people would know the menu mate had chased headlines desired no privacy in his offhours an exhibitionist or had alice zoghbie been right not cued into his surroundings either way easy victim i mentioned that to milo he sucked his teeth and took me back to the entrance mates front door was capped by a small overhang ads from fastfood joints littered the floor milo picked them up glanced at a few dropped them yellow tape banded the plain wood door milo yanked it loose one key twist and we were in a single lock not a dead bolt anyone couldve kicked it in mold must rot the nosetweaking snap of decaying paper air so heavy with dust it felt granular milo opened the ancient venetian blinds where light penetrated the apartment it highlighted the particulate storms that we set off as we moved through tight shadowed spaces tight because virtually the entire front of the flat was filled with bookshelves plywood cases separated by narrow aisles unfinished wood warped shelves suffering under the weight of scholarship life of the mind eldon mate had turned his entire domicile into a library even the kitchen counters were piled high with books inside the fridge were bottles of water a moldering slab of hoop cheese a few softening vegetables i walked around reading titles as dust settled on my shoulders chemistry physics mathematics biology toxicology two entire cases of pathology forensics another wall of lawcivil liability jurisprudence the criminal codes of what appeared to be every state of the union mostly crumbling paperbacks and cold shabby texts with torn spines and flaking pages the kind of treasures that can be found at any thrift shop no fiction i moved to the tiny back room where mate had slept ten feet square lowceilinged lit by a bare bulb screwed to a white porcelain ceiling fixture bare gray walls jaundiced by western light seeping through parchmentcolored window shades the cheap cot and nightstand took up most of the space leaving barely enough room for a rawlooking threedrawer pine dresser teninch zenith tv atop the dresseras if mate had had to make up for mrs krohnfelds video excess a door led to the adjoining bathroom and i went in there because bathrooms can sometimes tell you more about a person than any other space this one didnt razor shaving cream laxatives antigas tablets and aspirin in the medicine cabinet amber ring around the tub bar of green soap bottomed by slime sitting like a dead frog in a brown plastic dish the closet was skinny and crammed full sharp with the reek of camphor a dozen washandwear white shirts half that many pairs of gray twill slacks all sears label one heavy charcoal suit from zachary all wide lapels testifying to a longago fashion cycle three pairs of black captoe oxfords stretched by cedar shoe trees two beige windbreakers also sears a pair of narrow black ties hanging from a hookpolyester made in korea what was his financial situation i said doesnt look like he spent much on clothes he spent on food gas car repairs books phone and utilities i havent gotten his tax forms yet but there were some bankbooks in there indicating the dresser his basic income seems to have been his us public health service pension two and a half grand a month deposited directly into the savings account plus occasional cash payments two hundred to a thou each irregularly spaced those i figure were donations they add up to another fifteen a year donations from who my guess would be satisfied travelersor those who survived them none of the families weve talked to admit paying mate a dime but theyd want to avoid looking like they hired someone to kill grandma wouldnt they so he was pulling in around fifty grand a year and in terms of assets he was no pauper the three other passbooks were for jumbo cds of a hundred grand each dinky interest doesnt look as if he cared about investing i figure three hundred would be about a decade of income minus expenses and taxes looks like hes just about held on to every penny hes earned since going into the death business three hundred thousand i said an md in practice could put away a lot more than that over ten years so he wasnt in the travel business to get rich notoriety was the prize or he really was operating idealistically or both you could say the same for mengele flipping the skimpy mattress he peered underneath not that i havent done this already his back must have twinged because he sucked in breath as he straightened okay he said suddenly the room felt oppressive some of the book aroma had made its way in here along with a riper smell more humanmale that and the mothballs added up to the sad sedate aroma of old man as if nothing here was expected to ever change that same sense of staleness and stasis that id experienced up on mulholland i was probably getting overimaginative anything interesting on his phone bills i said nope despite his publicityseeking once he got home he wasnt mr chatty there were days at a time when he never phoned anyone the few calls we did find were to haiselden zoghbie and boring stuff local market thrifty drugs couple of usedbook stores shoemaker sears hardware store no cell phone account he laughed the tvs blackandwhite guy didnt own a computer or a stereo were talking manual typewriteri found blank sheets of carbon paper in the dresser no sheets with any impressions for a hot clue like in the movies yeah right and im dirty harry oldfashioned guy i said but he pushed the envelope ethically i opened the top drawer of the dresser on mounds of folded underwear white and rounded like giant marshmallows stuffed on each side were cylinders of rolled black socks the middle drawer contained stacks of cardigans all brown and gray i ran my hand below them came up empty the next drawer was full of medical books he said same with the bottom guess next to killing people reading was his favorite thing i crouched and opened the lowest drawer four hardbacks the first three with warped bindings and foxed edges i inspected one principles of surgery copyright i said maybe if hed kept up that liver wouldve fared better the fourth book caught my eye smaller than the others rubyred leather binding shiny new goldtooled decorations on the ribbed spine ornate gilt lettering but a crude orangepeel texture to the leather leatherette collectors edition of beowulf published by some outfit called the literary gem society i picked it up it rattled too light to be a book i lifted the cover no pages within just hollow masonite space made in taiwan label affixed to the underside of the lid a box noveltyshop gag inside the source of the rattle miniature stethoscope childsize pink plastic tubing silvered plastic earpieces and disc broken earpieces snapped off cleanly silvery grit in the box milos eyes slitted why dont you put that down i complied whats wrong i checked that damn drawer the first time i tossed the place and that wasnt in there the other books were but not that i remember reading each of the copyrights thinking mate was relying on antiques he stared into the red box a visitor i said our vanboy commemorating what hed done broken stethoscope delivering a message mates out of business im the doctor now he bent wincing again looks like someone clipped the plastic clean from the dust maybe he did it right herevery clean no problem if you had bone shears one very nasty little elf he rubbed his face he came back to celebrate and to leave his mark he walked to the door looked out at the bookcases in the front room scowled ive been here twice since the murder and nothing else looks messed with talking to himself more than to me knowing full well that with thousands of volumes there was no way to be sure knowing the yellow tape across the door was meaningless anyone couldve pried the lock i said the bum mrs krohnfeld saw the bum walked up the stairs in plain sight and ran away when mrs krohnfeld screamed at him she said he was a mess wouldnt you expect our boy to be a little better organized like you said some people delegate what the killer hires a schizo to break in and stick a box in a drawer why not if it was an attempt to piss on mates grave wouldnt delegating lessen the thrill probably but at this point hes being careful i said and delegating could offer its own thrill being the boss wielding power it couldve happened this way the killer knows the neighborhood because he stalked mate for a while he cruises hollywood finds a street guy gives him cash to deliver a package half up front the rest upon completion he couldve even positioned himself up the street to watch and get off and to make sure the street guy followed through he picked someone disorganized specifically because it added another layer of safety if the bum gets caught theres very little he can tell you the killer used some sort of disguise for extra insurance his cheeks bubbled as he filled them with air bounced it around blew it out silently out of his pocket came a sealed package of surgical gloves and an evidence bag dr milos in the house he said working his hands into the latex you touched it but ill vouch for you fully gloved he lifted the box examined it on all sides someone who knows the neighborhood he said hollywood boulevards full of novelty shops maybe i can find someone who remembers selling this recently i said maybe the choice of titles wasnt a coincidence beowulf valiant hero slays the monster we spent another hour in the apartment going over the kitchen and the front rooms searching cupboards scanning the bookcases for other false volumes coming up with nothing in some of the books i found bills of sale going back decades thrift shops in san diego oakland a few in la outside on the landing milo retaped the door locked up and brushed dust from his lapels he looked shrunken across the street a middleaged hispanic woman stood in the paltry shade of a wretchedlooking magnolia purse in hand newspaper folded under her arm no one else around and like any midday pedestrian in la she stood out no bus stop probably waiting for a ride she saw me looking at her stared back for a second shifted the purse to the other shoulder removed the paper and began to read if the box is a gift i said its another point in favor of the confederate angle someone wanting to put himself in mates place literally choosing the bedrooms consistent with that the most personal space in the apartment think of it as a rape of sorts which is consistent with the violation of mates genitalia someone into power domination playing goda psychopathic monotheist there can only be one deity so he needs to eliminate any competition on the competitions home base i can see him walking around exhilarated by triumph enjoying the extra bit of thrill of sneaking into an official crime scene maybe he came at night to minimize the chance of discovery but still he couldnt be sure if you or anyone else from the department had shown up hed have been trapped the bedrooms at the back of the apartment and theres no rear exit no place to hide except that bedroom closet so to escape hed have had to cross the front room hide in that maze of bookshelves i think hes jazzed by the danger element its the same first impression i had of the murder itself choosing an open road to perform surgery on mate removing the cardboard so mates body would be discovered cleaning up carefully but leaving the scene naked the note extreme meticulousness combined with recklessness a psychopath with an aboveaverage iq hes bright enough to plan precisely in the short term but vulnerable in the long run because he gets off on danger is that supposed to comfort me he aint superman milo good cause i aint got no kryptonite he stood there thinking and swinging the bag the woman across the street looked up our eyes met she returned to her paper if the guy walked around said milo maybe he touched stuff after the apartment was printed now you and i just mauled it asking for new prints is gonna be fun i doubt he left any that careful he is ill ask anyway he began trudging down the stairs stopped midway if this is a message whos it aimed at not the public unlike the body and the note there was no way he could be sure it would be found at this point i said hes talking to himself doing anything he can to enhance the kick evoke memories of the kill he may very well want to return to the scene of the murder but views that as too dangerous so breaking into mates home directly or by surrogate would be the nextbest thing i thought of something richard doss had told me dancing on mates grave broken stethoscope i said if im right about his taking the black bag the message is cleari get the real tools you get broken garbage we resumed our descent at the bottom of the stairs milo said the idea of a confederate gets me thinking about attorney haiselden who should be in town but isnt because who spent more time with mate whod be more familiar with the apartment maybe even have a key the guys behavior is wrong alex here we are mates cold for a week haiselden should be throwing press conferences but not a peep out of him just the oppositehe rabbits collecting coins from laundromats gimme a break this assholes hiding from something zoghbie said representing mate was the only thing haiselden did as a lawyer that says overinvolvement mate was haiseldens ticket to celebrity maybe haiselden got hooked on it wanted more no more second fiddle he watches mate iv enough travelers figures it qualifies him as a death doc hell maybe haiseldens one of those guys who went to law school because he couldnt get into med school interesting i said something else i pulled off the computer fits that newspaper account of a press conference haiselden did call after one of the trials he said mate deserved the nobel prize then he added that as mates lawyer he deserved part of the money his free hand balled ive been delegating finding him to korn and demetri but now im handling it personally going over to his house right now south westwood i can drop you at the station or you can come along i looked at my watch nearly five it had been a long day ill call robin and come along we crossed the street to the unmarked milo locked the evidence bag in the trunk circled to the drivers side stopped glancing to his left the hispanic woman hadnt moved milo turned her head flipped away quick as a shuffled card and i knew shed been watching us eyes back on the newspaper concentrating the paper waved no breeze her hands had tightened her bag was a macrame sack that shed placed on the grass milo studied her she ignored him licked her lips buried her nose deeper in newsprint he began to turn away from her and her eyes flickedjust for a secondtoward mates apartment he said hold on i followed him as he strode toward her her hands were clenching the paper causing it to shimmy she folded her lips inward and drew the newsprint closer to her face i got near enough to read the date yesterdays paper the classifieds employment opportunities milo said maam the woman looked up her lips unfolded thin purplish lips chapped and puckered bleached white around the edges the rest of her complexion was nutmeg brown bags under the eyes she was somewhere between fifty and sixty short and heavy with a plump face and big gorgeous black eyes she wore a navy polyester bomber jacket over a blueandwhite flowered dress that reached to midcalf the dress material looked flimsy riding up her stocky frame adhering to bulges thick ankles swelled over the top seams of old but clean nike running shoes white socks rolled low exposed chafed shins her nails were squarecut her black hair was threaded with gray and braided past her waist her skin was slack around neck jaw and chipmunk cheeks but stretched tight over a wide brow no makeup no jewelry a rural look while working at western peds id known several latin women whod chosen that same unadorned appearance long hair always a braid dresses never pants devout women pentecostal christians something i can do for you maam are you youre police right the old mouth emitted a young voice breathy and tentative no accent the merest softening at the end of each syllable she couldve found employment giving phone sex yes maam milo flashed the badge and you are she reached into the macrame bag and brought out a red plastic alligatorprint wallet producing her own id as if it had been demanded of her many times social security card she thrust it at milo he read guillerma salcido guillerma salcido mate said the woman defiantly i dont use his name anymore but that doesnt change a thing im still dr mates wifehis widow chapter guillerma mate stood straighter as if fortified by the claim took the social security card from milos fingers and slipped it back into her purse youre married to dr mate he sounded doubtful another dip into the bag another thrust of paper marriage license fold marks grubby photocopied lettering faded to the color of raw plywood date of issue twentyseven years ago city of san diego county of san diego guillerma salcido de vega and eldon howard mate wagering on nuptial bliss there she said yes maam do you live here in la oakland when i heardits been a long time i didnt know if i should come im busy got a job taking care of the elderly at a convalescent home but i figured i should come eldon was sending me money this pension he had now that hes gone i should know whats going on i took the greyhound when i got here i couldnt believe it what a mess this place is all the streets dug up i got lost on the city bus ive never been here to la i been to la never been here jabbing a stubby finger at the duplex maybe the whole thing was a sign what happened to eldon i dont mean im some prophet but when things happen that arent natural sometimes it means you have to take a big step i thought i should find out like whos burying him he had no faith but everyone should be buriedhe didnt want to be cremated did he not that i know okay then maybe i should do it my church would help how long exactly has it been since you saw dr mate she touched her finger to her upper lip twentyfive years and four months since right after my son was bornhis son eldon junior he goes by donny eldon didnt like donnydidnt like kids he was honest about that told me right at the beginning but i figured he was just talking once he had his own hed change his mind so i got pregnant anyway and what do you think eldon left me but he supported you financially not really she said you cant call five hundred a month supporti always worked but he did send it every month money order right on the dot ill give him that only this month i didnt get it it was due five days ago i have to figure out who to talk to at the army it was an army reserve pension they need to send it directly to me now you have any idea how to contact them i might be able to get you a number said milo during the twentyfive years how often did you and dr mate communicate we didnt he just sent the money i used to think it was because he felt guilty about walking out but now i know he probably didnt for guilt you got to have faith out or habit i dont know when his mother was alive he used to send her money instead of visiting he was always one for habitsdoing things the same exact way every single time one color shirt one color pants he said it left time for important things like what she shrugged her eyes fluttered and she began to sway began to fall both milo and i took hold of her shoulders im okay she said shrugging us off angrily smoothing her dress as if wed messed it got a little low blood sugar thats all no big deal i just got to eat i brought food from home but in the bus station someone stole my tupperware the black eyes lifted to milo i want to eat something we drove her to a coffee shop on santa monica near la brea dulled gold booths streaked windows friedbacon air the clash and clatter of silverware scooped into gray plastic tubs by sleepy busboys who looked underage milo chose the usual cops vantage point at the back of the restaurant the nearest patrons were a pair of caltrans workers inhaling the daily steakandeggs special heralded by a frontdoor banner loss leader the price belonged to the fifties unlikely to cover the cost of slaughter guillerma mate ordered a double cheeseburger fries and a diet dr pepper milo told the waitress ham on rye potato salad coffee the ambience was doing nothing for my appetite but id put nothing in my stomach since the morning coffee and i asked for a roastbeef dip on french roll wondering if the meat had been carved from the budget cows the food came quickly my beef dip was lukewarm and rubbery and from the way milo picked his order was no better guillerma mate ate lustily while trying to maintain dignity cutting her burger up into small pieces and forking morsels into her mouth with an assemblyline pace finishing the sandwich she forked french fries one at a time consuming every greasy stick she wiped her mouth sipped dr pepper through two straws i feel better thanks pleasure maam so who killed eldon she said i wish i knew this pension he had two but i only get onethe five hundred from the reserves the big one for a couple thousand from the public health service he kept for himself i dont think i coulda gotten more out of him we werent even divorced and he was giving me money she edged closer across the table did he make more maam you know from all the killing he did what do you think of all the killing he did what do i think disgusting mortal sinthats why i dont go by his name had everything changed back to salcidohe wasnt even a doctor when we were married went to medical school after he walked out went down in mexico because he was too old for anyplace else i have friends up in oakland who know we were married at my church but i keep it quiet its embarrassing some of them used to tell me to go get a lawyer eldons rich now i could get more out of him i told them it would be sin money they said i should take it anyway give it to the church i dont know about thatdid he leave a will we havent found one yet so that means i have to go through that thing probate milo didnt answer actually she said we did talk in the beginning eldon and me right after he walked out but just a few times donny and me were in san diego and eldon wasnt that far down in mexico then after he became a doctor he went up to oakland to work in a hospital and i did a real stupid thing i took donny and we went there too i dont know what i coulda been thinking maybe now that he was a doctorit was stupid but there i was with a boy who didnt even know his father oakland didnt work out i said oakland worked out im still there but eldon didnt work out he wouldnt talk to donny wouldnt even pick him up look at him i remember it like yesterday eldon in his white coatthat scared donny and he started screaming eldon got mad and yelled at me to get the brat out of therethe whole thing just fell apart she picked at a scrap of lettuce i called him a couple more times after that he wasnt interested refused to visit donnys being born just turned him off like a faucet so i moved across the bridge to san francisco got a job funny thing is a few years later i was back to oakland cause the rent was cheaper but by that time eldon was gone and the checks were coming from arizona he had some kind of government job doing i dont know what back thens when i thought of getting a lawyer any reason you didnt file for divorce i said why bother she said there was no other man i wanted to know and eldon was sending me his army pension you know how it is how is it said milo you dont make a move in the beginning nothing happens he sent the check every month that was enough for me then when he started in on that killing business i knew i was lucky hed left whod want to live with that i mean when i heard about that i got sick really sick i remember the first time i saw it on tv eldon standing therei hadnt seen him in years and now he was on the tv looking older balder but the same face the same voice bragging about what he did i thought hes finally gone a hundred percent crazy the next day i was on the phone changing my name on the social security and everything else i could find so you never talked to him about his new career didnt talk to him about anything she said didnt i just say that she shoved her plate away pulled more soda through the straws let the brown liquid drop like the bubble in a carpenters level before it reached her lips even if it was making him real rich how would it look if suddenly i showed up wanting more she touched the handle of her butter knife that was filthy money i been working my whole life doing just fine tell me did he get rich from the killing doesnt look like it said milo so what was the point he claimed he was helping people the devil claims hes an angel back when i knew eldon he wasnt interested in helping anyone but himself selfish i said you bet always in his own world doing what he wanted which was reading always reading whyd you come down here maam said milo she held her hands out as if expecting a gift her palms were scrubbed pale crisscrossed by brown hatch marks i told you i just thought i shouldi guess i was curious about what she moved back in the booth about eldon where he livedwhat had happened to him i never could figure him out howd the two of you meet i said she smiled smoothed her dress sucked soda up the straw what because he was a doctor and im some brown lady no its okay im used to it when we were married and i used to walk donny in the stroller people thought i was the maid cause donnys light like eldonspitting image of eldon in fact and eldon still didnt like him go figure but stuff like that dont bother me anymore the only thing that matters is doing right for jesus thats the real reason id never put a claim on eldons killing money jesus would weep and i know youre gonna think im some kind of religious nut for saying this but my faith is strong and when you live for jesus your soul is full of riches she laughed of course a nice meal once in a while dont hurt right how about dessert said milo she pretended to contemplate the offer if youre having he waved for the waitress apple pie hot a la mode and for the lady guillerma mate said as long as were talking pie honey you got any chocolate cream the waitress said sure copied down the order turned to me i shook my head and she left eldon didnt believe in jesus that was the problem said guillerma dabbing at her lips again didnt believe in nothing you wanna know how we met it was just one of those things eldon was living at this apartment complex where my mother did the cleaningshe wasnt legal so she couldnt get a decent job my dad was a hundred percent legal had a work permit did landscaping for luckett construction they were the biggest back then my dad got citizenship brought my mom over from el salvador but she never bothered to get papers i was born here pure american my friends call me willy anyway eldon was living in the complex and i used to run into him when i was washing down the walkways or trimming the flowers wed talk this was in san diego thats right i was out of high school only a few years helping my mom out taking classes part time at the jc planning to be a nurse eldon was a lot older thirtysix and he looked in his forties had lost most of his hair already i wasnt attracted to him at first but then i started to like him cause he was polite not just for show all the time quiet too that was good id had enough of noisy men also back then i thought he was a genius he had a job as a chemist kept science books and all kinds of other books everywhere reading all the time back then that impressed me back then i thought education was the way to get saved no more huh wise man foolwere all weak mortals the only genius is the one up there pointing to the ceiling proof is would a genius go around killing other people even those who asked for it does that sound like a smart thing to do when were all gonna answer for our deeds in the next world she shook her head and spoke to the ceiling tiles eldon i wouldnt want to be in your shoes right now the dessert came she waited until milod taken a forkful before attacking her pie i said but at the beginning you were impressed with his education i used to think education was everything i was gonna be a registered nursewhen i moved up to oakland i had these fantasies i guess youd call em eldon would open up a doctors office id work with him but then he wouldnt have nothing to do with donny and me so i had to keep working and never got to finish school she licked her lips im not complaining i take care of the elderly do what nurses do anyway and now i know theres no shortcut to happiness doesnt matter what your job is in this world the main world is the one afterward and the only way to get there is jesus its exactly what my mother taught me only back then i wasnt listening to her no one listened to her that was the burden she carried around my father was godless she never turned him around till he was dying and even then not till the pain came on real bad so what else could he do but pray the back of her spoon skated over the chocolate cream pie picking up a coating of whipped cream she licked it said my dad smoked all his life got lung cancer it spread to his bones all over his spine he died in bad pain choking and screaming it was horrible made a big impression on eldon eldon saw your father die i said you bet dad died right after we were married wed go visit dad in the hospital and hed be coughing up blood and screaming from the pain and eldon would turn white as a ghost and have to leave whoda figured hed be a doctor you know what i think seeing dad die could be part of what started out eldon on this killing business cause it really was horrible mom and me got through it by praying but eldon didnt pray refused to even when mom begged him said he wouldnt be a hypocrite if you dont have no faith seeing something like that is gonna scare you she finished her pie milo said is there anything you can tell us that might help us learn who killed your husband id say someone didnt like what eldon was doing anyone in particular no she said im just talking logical theres got to be lots of people who didnt approve of eldon not godfearing people godfearing dont go running around killing but maybe someone smile you know it could be someone like eldon got no faith and a big hate grew inside him about eldon cause eldon had a difficult personalitydidnt care what he said or how he said it least thats the way he was back when we were married always getting into it with peoplebring him into a place like this and hed be complaining about the food marching up to the manager and starting an argument maybe he got the wrong person mad and this person said look what he does and gets away with it sure its okay to kill its no different from tying my shoes cause lets face it if you dont believe in the world hereafter whats to stop you from killing or raping or robbing or doing whatever it is your lust tells you to do milo sat there probing the rim of his piecrust with his fork i wondered if he was thinking what i was a lot of insight in one little speech so she said who do i talk to about that pension and the will back in the car milo made a series of calls and got her the number of the army pension office as far as the will is concerned he told her were still trying to contact dr mates lawyer a man named roy haiselden has he ever called you that big fat guy always with eldon on tv nope you think he has the will if there is one he might nothings been filed with county records if i learn anything ill let you know thanks i guess ill be staying in town for a few days see what i can find out know of any clean cheap places hollywoods a tough area maam and nothing decents gonna be that cheap well she said im not saying i dont have any money i work i brought two hundred dollars with me i just dont want to spend more than i have to we drove her to a west coast inn on fairfax near beverly and checked her in she paid with a hundreddollar bill and as we walked her to her firstfloor room milo warned her about flashing cash on the street and she said im not stupid the room was small clean noisy with a view across fairfax cars whizzing by the sleek modern lines of the cbs studios a blackandwhite subpanel to the horizon maybe ill see a game show she said parting the drapes she removed another floral dress from the macrame bag and headed for the closet okay thanks for everything milo handed her his card call me if you think of anything maamby the way wheres your son her back was to us she opened the closet door took a long time to hang the dress on the top shelf was an extra pillow that she removed fluffing compressing fluffing maam dont know where donny is she said punching the pillow all at once she looked tiny and bowed donnys real smart just like eldon did a year at san francisco state i used to think hed be a doctor too he got good grades he liked science she stood there hugging the pillow what happened i said her shoulders heaved i went over and stood next to her she edged away placed the pillow atop a dresser they said it was drugs my friends at church said it had to be that but i never saw him take any drugs he changed i said she bent cupped a hand over her eyes i risked taking her by the elbow her skin was soft gelatinous i guided her onto a chair handed her a tissue that she grabbed crushed finally used to wipe her face donny changed totally she said stopped taking care of himself grew long hair a beard got filthy like one of those homeless people only hes got a home if hed ever come back there how long has it been since youve seen him two years she sprang up marched into the bathroom closed the door water ran for a while then she emerged announcing she was tired when im ready to eat where can i get some dinner around here do you like chinese maam said milo sure anything he phoned up a takeout place and asked them to deliver in two hours when we left she was consulting the cable tv channel guide out in the car milo sat back in his seat and frowned one happy family and juniors a homeless guy with mental problems maybe a druggie someone with a reason to kill matewho might still want to be mate maybe i was wrong to dismiss the street bum so quickly if donny was intelligent to begin with even with some sort of mental breakdown he mightve held on to enough smarts to be able to plan mate abandoned and rejected him in the worst kind of way exactly the kind of primal anger that leads to violence mates getting famous wouldnt have helped things maybe donny smoldered seethed decided to come back take over the family business oedipus wrecks maybe mate finally agreed to see him arranged a talk up in mulholland because he didnt want donny in his apartment he couldve even had concerns about his safety thats why he backed the van in but he went through with itguilt or he enjoyed the danger he made no comment got on the phone hooked up with ncic asked for a felony search on eldon s mate nothing but plugging in eldon salcido pulled up three convictions all in california and the vital statistics fit driving under the influence six years ago larceny two years after that assault eighteen months ago jail time in marin county release six months ago a year and a half in jail and he doesnt call his mother i said socially isolated and he progressed from dui to assault getting more aggressive family values he said be interesting to see what the grieving widow does when she finds out mate left over three hundred grand in the bank wonder if alice or anyone else will press a claimthats really why old willy came down here it always boils down to anger and moneyokay ill look into donny but in the meantime lets try to ferret out that goddamn lawyer chapter roy haiselden was living better than his prime client but he was no sultan his house was a peachcolored onestory plainwrap on camden avenue west of westwood south of wilshire mown lawn but no shrubs empty driveway alarmcompany sign staked in the grass milo rang the bell knocked on the doordeadbolted with a sturdy quiksetpushed open the mail slot and sighted down just some throwaway flyers he said no mail so he left recently he rang and knocked again tried to peer through the white drapes that sheathed the front windows muttered that it just looked like a goddamn house a check in back of the house revealed more grass and a small oval swimming pool set in a brick deck the water starting to green the gunite spotted with algae if he had a pool man i said looks like he canceled a while back maybe hes been gone for a while and put on a mail stop korn and demetri checked for that and the gardeners been here the garage was a double locked milo managed to pry the door upward several inches and he peered in no car old bicycle hoses the usual junk he inspected every side of the house most of the windows were barred and bolted and the back door was secured by an identical dead bolt the kitchen window was undraped but narrow and high and he boosted me up for a look dishes in the sink but they look clean no food another alarm sticker high on the window but i dont see any alarm leads probably a fakeout job he said one of those clever boys who thinks appearance is everything overconfident i said just like mate he let me down okay lets see what the neighbors have to offer both of the adjacent houses were empty milo scrawled requests to call on the back of his business cards and left them in the mailboxes in the second house to the south a young black man answered cleanshaven fullfaced barefoot wearing a gray athletic shirt with the u logo and red cotton shorts under his arm was a book a yellow underlining pen was clenched between his teeth he removed it shifted the book so i could see the title organizational structure an advanced text the room behind him was set up with two brightblue beanbag chairs and not much else soda cans potato chip bags an extralarge pizza box mottled with grease on the thin khaki rug he greeted milo pleasantly but the sight of the badge caused his face to tighten yes the unspoken overtone what now i wondered how many times hed been stopped for driving in westwood milo stepped back bent his knee in a relaxed pose i was wondering sir if youve seen your neighbor mr haiselden recently whooh him no not for a few days could you say how many days mr chambers said the young man curtis chambers i think i saw him drive away five six days ago whether hes been back since i cant say cause ive been holed up here studying why do you recall what time of day it was when you saw him mr chambers morning before nine i was going to meet with a prof and he needed to do it by nine i think it was tuesday whats going on milo smiled and held up a delaying finger what kind of car was mr haiselden driving some kind of van silver with a blue stripe down the side that his only vehicle only one ive seen him in anyone else live there with him not that i know said curtis chambers could you please tell me whats up were trying to contact mr haiselden about a case dr deaths murder youve seen him with dr mate no but everyone knew he was dr deaths lawyer people in the neighborhood talk about it hes a jerk haiselden last year we had a partythere are four of us living here grad students nothing wild were all grinds all we had was that single party the entire year to celebrate semesterend we tried to be considerate even sent notes around to the neighbors one woman mrskaplan next door sent us a bottle of wine no one had a problem with it except haiselden he called the cops on us twenty after eleven and believe me it was nothing wild just some music maybe it got a little loud what an uptight hypocrite after all the disruption he brought to the neighborhood what kind of disruption reporters media all that garbage recently no a few years ago said chambers i never saw it wasnt living here back then but one of my roommates washe said the whole street was a zoo this was back when mate was still getting arrested he and haiselden threw press conferences right here tv crews would show uplights cameras the works blocked driveways cigarettes and garbage left on the lawns some of the neighbors finally complained to haiselden but he ignored them so after all that he goes and calls the cops on us a jerk always had this irritated look on his face so why do you want him did he kill his buddy why would you say that mr chambers chambers grinned because i dont like the man and the fact that he split youd think his being mates mouthpiece that hed stick around grab some more pr cause thats what it was all about right thats the only problem i have with what mate did what do you mean said milo the tackiness making a spectacle out of other peoples pain you want to put a sick person out of their misery fine but shouldnt it be private from what my roommate told me about the way haiselden used to behave he loved playing for the cameras so youd think hed be doing the same thing now though i guess theres nothing for him to comment on anymore with mate gone guess not said milo is there anything else you want to tell me about him nopelisten if you leave me your number and i see him ill call you siccing the cops on our party what a jerk driving back to the station milo said first mrs mate now him insights from the man on the street everyone seems to have figured things out except me a lawyer who drives a van yeah yeah psycho killers transport of choice wouldnt that be something one serial killer representing another in court and winning only thing he did win i said he couldnt make a living practicing law so he turned to coinops zoghbie said it was because of mate but maybe he was struggling before and mate was his salvation he latches on to the whole travel thing rides the coattails enjoys the glory then he and mate have some kind of rift or as you said haiselden starts yearning for more up the suspect ladder he goes time for a pass by his office wheres that miracle mile the old part east of museum row he leases some space over a persian restaurant him and some other lowrent outfits the place has a moldy feel to it like out of an old movie no secretary ive been there twice korn and demetri another two times the doors always locked and no one answers time to find the landlord no sense wasting your time go home to robin and fido i didnt argue i was tired and stacy doss was coming in tomorrow i needed to review her file so whore you concentrating on i said haiselden or donny mate do i have to choose between door number one and door number two monty can i take number three better yet ill concentrate on both of them if donnys our street wacko it may take a while to find him i wanna find out if he was released clean or placed on parole maybe hes got a po i can talk to if he was the bum mrs krohnfeld saw maybe hes still hanging in hollywood that would also fit with your idea about stalking mate stalking daddy whos off in his own world and thinks hes immortal i think ill touch base with petra shes as clued in to the streets as anyone petra connor was a hollywood division homicide detective young bright intense recently promoted to dii because of some help shed given milo on a series of killings of handicapped people just after that she and her partner had solved the lisa ramsey caseexwife of a tv actor found hacked up in griffith park shed referred me a case a twelveyearold boy whod witnessed the crime while living in the park a brilliant complex child one of the most fascinating patients id ever encountered rumors were that her partner stu bishop was in line for a major administrative job and that shed be a diii by years end then groomed by the new chief for something conspicuous give her my best i said sure he said but his tone was detached and his eyes were somewhere off in the distance staring into his own world at that moment i was happy not to be sharing chapter monday ninethirty pm nearing the end of a very long day robin was soaking in the bath and i was in bed reviewing stacy dosss chart tomorrow morning stacy and i would be talking ostensibly about college shed used college as a cover the first time march a warm friday afternoon id seen two other kids before her sad children caught up in the poison of a custody dispute the next hour was spent writing reports then waiting for stacy curious about stacy despite my preconceptions about richard doss because of themid labored to keep an open mind about his daughter still i wondered what kind of girl would result from the union of richard and joanne i really had no clue the red light signaling someone at the side door lit up precisely on time and i went to fetch her a small girl fivetwo in brown loafers perfect genetic logic no reason for the dosses to produce a basketball player a brightgreen oversize book was sandwiched between her right arm and her chest the title obscured by her sleeve she wore a white cotton mock turtle snug blue jeans white socks with the loafers normal teenage curves a bit of flesh on her face but certainly not overweight if shed gained ten pounds as judy manitow had claimed shed have been extremely thin before that made me wonder about judyher own tendency toward sharp angles snapshots of her daughters in her chambers a pair of brighteyed blondes in very short very tight party dresses also skinny the younger onebeckyveering too close to skeletal no matter stacy was the patient she had full cheeks but a long face that evoked her mothers college picture richards high broad brow stippled by a few tiny pimples pixie features another endowment from both parents she smiled nervously i introduced myself and held out my hand she took it readily maintained eye contact flashed a halfsecond smile that burned lots of calories making an effort prettier than joanne with dark almond eyes and the kind of smallboned good looks that would attract the boys during my highschool days shed have been labeled a gidget in any generation shed be termed cute another paternal donation her hairthick black very curly she wore it long and loose glossed with some kind of product that relaxed the helixes to dancing corkscrews lighter complexion than richardsskin the color of clotted cream thin skin traces of blue surfaced at jawline and temple a cuticle picked raw on her left middle finger had turned red and swollen to a silky sheen she hugged the book tighter and followed me in thats a pretty pond i passed koi right right the manitows have a koi pond a big one really id been in judy manitows chambers several dozen times never visited her home dr manitow put in an incredible waterfall you could swim in there yours is actually more accessible you have a beautiful garden thanks we entered the office and she sat down with the green book across her lap yellow lettering shouted choosing the right college for you no problem finding the place i said settling opposite her not at all thanks for seeing me dr delaware i wasnt used to being thanked by adolescents my pleasure stacy she blushed and turned away recreational reading i said another strained smile not exactly she began to look around the office so i said do you have any questions no thanks as if id offered her something i smiled waited she said i guess i should talk about my mother if you want to i dont know if i want to her right index finger curled and moved toward her left hand located the inflamed cuticle stroking picking a dot of blood stretched to a scarlet comma she covered it with her right hand dad says hes worried about my future but i suppose i should talk about mom she angled her face so that it was shielded by black curls i mean its probably the right thing for me thats what my friend saysshe wants to be a psychologist becky manitow judge manitows daughter beckys been doing some amateur therapy she shook her head as if thinking about that made her tired her eyes were the same dark brown as her fathers yet a whole different flavor beckys been in counseling herself thinks its the cure for everything she lost a lot of weight even more than her mother wanted her to so they shipped her off to some therapist and now she wants to be one you two friends we used to be actually beckys not i dont want to be cruel lets just say shes not into school not an intellectual she let out a small soft laugh not exactly my mom used to tutor her in math judy had never mentioned her daughters problem no reason to still i wondered why judy hadnt referred stacy to beckys therapist maybe too close to home keeping everything in neat little boxes well i said no matter what becky or anyone says you know whats best for you think so i do you dont even know me competent till proven otherwise stacy okay another weak smile so much effort to smile i wrote a mental note poss depress as noted by j manitow her hand lifted the blood on her finger had dried and she rubbed the sore spot i dont think i really do want to talk about my mother that is i mean what can i say when i think about it i get down for days and ive already had enough of those and its not as if it was a shockher what happened i mean it was when it actually happened but shed been sick for so long same thing her father had said her own little speech or his this she said smiling again is starting to sound like one of those gross movies of the week lindsay wagner as everyones mom what im saying is that what happened to my mother took so long it wasnt like another friend of mine her mother died in a skiing accident crashed into a tree and she was gone just like that snap of the inflamed finger the whole family watching it happen thats traumatic my mother i knew it was going to happen i spent a long time wondering when but her bosom rose and fell one foot tapped the right index finger sought the sore spot again curled to strike scratched retracted maybe we should talk about my socalled future she said lifting the green book first could i use the bathroom please she was gone ten minutes after seven i started to wonder was ready to get up to check if shed left the house but she returned hair tied back in a bushy ponytail mouth shiny with freshly applied lip gloss okay she said college the process my lack of direction that sounds like something someone told you dad my school counselor my brother everyone im almost eighteen nearly a senior so im supposed to be into itcareer aspirations compiling lists of extracurricular activities composing brag sheets ready to sell myself it feels so phony i go to pali prep freakcity when it comes to college everyone in my class is freaking out daily im not so im the space alien her free hand flipped the edges of the green books pages cant get into it i said dont want to get into it i honestly dont care dr delaware i mean i know im going to end up somewhere does it really make a difference where does it not to me but everyones telling you you should care either explicitly or you knowits in the air the atmosphere at school everythings been split down the middlesociologically either youre a goof and you know youll end up at a party school or youre a grind and expected to obsess on stanford or the ivy league i should be a grind because my grades are okay i should have my nose glued to the sat prep book be filling out practice applications when do you take the sat i already took it in december we all did just for practice but i did okay enough dont see why i should go through it again whatd you get she blushed again fifteentwenty thats a fantastic score i said youd be surprised at pp kids who get fifteeneighty take it again one kid had his parents write that he was american indian so hed get some kind of minority edge i dont see the point neither do i i honestly think that if you offered most of the senior class a deal to murder someone in order to be guaranteed admission to harvard stanford or yale theyd take it pretty brutal i said fascinated by her choice of example its a brutal world out there she said at least thats what my father keeps telling me does he want you to take the sat again he pretends hes not pressuring me but he lets me know hell pay for it if i want to which is a kind of pressure i suppose you met him what was that like what do you mean did you get along he told me you were smart but there was something in his voicelike he wasnt sure about you she cracked up ive got a big mouth dads superactive always needs to keep moving thinking doing something moms illness drove him crazy before she got sick they were totally active together jogging dancing tennis traveling when she stopped living he was left on his own its made him cranky that sounded detached a clinical assessment the family observer sometimes kids assume that role because its easier than participating tough adjustment for him i said yes but he finally caught on about what about having to do things for himself he always finds a way to adjust that sounded accusatory my raised eyebrow was my next question she said his main way of handling stress is by staying on the go business trips you know what he does right realestate development she shook her head as if id gotten it wrong but said yes distressed properties he makes money off other peoples failures i can see why hed view the world as brutal oh yes the brutal world of distressed properties she laughed and sighed and her hands loosened placing the big green book on an end table she pushed it away her hands returned to her lap loose defenseless suddenly she was slumping like a teenager suddenly she seemed truly happy to be here he calls himself a heartless capitalist she said probably because he knows thats what everyone else says actually hes quite proud of himself undertone of contempt low and steady as a monks drone deriding her father to a virtual stranger but doing it charmingly that kind of easy seepage often means the lids rising on a longboiling pot i sat there waiting for more she crossed her legs slumped lower fluffed her hair as if aiming for nonchalance her shrug said your turn i said i get the feeling real estate isnt a strong interest of yours who knows im thinking of becoming an architect so i cant hate it that much actually i dont hate business at all not like some other kids do its just that id rather build something than be a id rather be productive rather than be a what i was going to say scavenger but thats not fair to my father he doesnt cause anyone else to fail hes just there to seek opportunities nothing wrong with that its just not what id like to doactually i have no idea what id like to do she rang an imaginary bell dahdah big insight i have no goals what about architecture i probably just say that to tell people something when they ask me for all i know i might end up despising architecture do any subjects in school interest you i said i used to like science for a while i thought medicine might be a good choice i took all the ap science courses got fives on the exams now i dont know what changed your mind the death of your scientist mother it just seems well for one medicines not what it used to be is it becky told me her father cant stand his job anymore all the hmos telling him what he can and cant do dr manitow calls it mismanaged care after all that school it would be nice to have some occupational freedom do you like your job very much psychology she said as if the word were new i was more interested in real scienceoh sorry that was rude what i meant was hard science no offense taken i smiled i mean i do respect psychology i was just thinking more in terms of chemistry and biology for myself im good with organic things psychology is a soft science i said thats part of what i like about it what do you mean she said the unpredictability of human nature i said keeps life interesting keeps me on my toes she thought about that i had one psych course in my junior year nonhonor track actually a mickey mouse but it ended up being interesting becky went nuts with it picking out every symptom we learned about and pinning it on someone then she got real cold to medont ask me why i dont know dont care either we havent shared common interests since the barbies got stored in the closet no i dont think any kind of medicines for me frankly none of it seems too scientific my mother saw every species of doctor known to mankind and no one could do a thing for her if i ever decide to do anything with my life i think id like it to be more productive something with quick results not necessarily quick she said just valid she pulled the ponytail forward played with the crimped edges so what if im unfocused im the second child isnt that normal my brother has enough focus for both of us knows exactly what he wants to win the nobel prize in economics then make billions one day youll read about him in fortune that is pretty specific erics always known what he wants hes a genius picked up the wall street journal when he was five read an article on supply and demand in the soybean market and gave his kindergarten class a lecture the next day is that a family tale i said what do you mean it sounds like something you mightve heard from your parents unless you remember it yourself but you were only three right she said confused i think i heard it from my father couldve been my mother either of them my father still tells the story it probably was him mental note what stories does dad tell about stacy does that mean something she said no i said im just interested in family tales so erics focused focused and a genius i mean that literally hes the smartest person ive ever met not a nerd either aggressive tenacious once he sets his mind on something he wont let go does he like stanford he likes it it likes him your parents went there family tradition does that put pressure on you to go there as well im sure dad would be thrilled assuming id get in you dont think you would i dont knowdont really care id put some space between our chairs careful not to crowd her but now her body arched forward as if yearning for touch im not putting myself down dr delaware i know im smart enough not like eric but smart enough yes i probably could get in if for no other reason than im a multiple legacy but the truth is all that is wasted on mesmarts are wasted on me i really couldnt care less about intellectual goals or tackling challenges or changing the world or making big bucks maybe that sounds airheady but thats the way it is she sat back how much time do we have left please i forgot my watch at home twenty minutes ah well she began studying the office walls busy day i said no easy day as a matter of fact its just that i told my friends id meet them at the beverly center lots of good sales on perfect time to do some airhead shopping i said sounds like fun sounds mindless nothing wrong with leisure i should just enjoy my life exactly exactly she repeated just have fun tears welled in her eyes i handed her a tissue she took it crushed the paper enveloping it with a fineboned ivory fist lets she said talk about my mother i saw her thirteen times twice a week for four weeks then five weekly sessions she was punctual cooperative filled the first half of each session with edgy fasttalk about movies shed seen books shed read school friends keeping the inevitable at bay then finally relenting her decision no prodding from me the final twenty minutes of each session reserved for her mother no more tears just softspoken monologues heavy with obligation shed been sixteen when joanne doss began falling apart remembered the decline as had her father as gradual insidious ending in grotesquerie id look at her and shed be lying there passive even before she was always kind of passive letting my father make all the decisionsshed cook dinner but hed determine the menu she was a pretty good cook as a matter of fact but what she made never seemed to matter to her like it was her job and she was going to do it and do it well but she wouldnt pretend to be inspired once years ago i found this little menu box and shed put in all these dinner plans stuff she cut out of magazines so once upon a time i guess she cared but not when i was around so your dad had all the opinions in the family i said dad and eric not you smile oh i have a few too but i tend to keep them to myself whys that ive found that a good strategy for what a pleasant life do eric and your father exclude you no not at allnot consciously anyway its just that the two of them have this lets just call it a big male thing two major brains speeding along jumping in would be like hopping on a moving traingood metaphor huh maybe i should use it in english class my teachers a real pretentious snot loves metaphors so joining ins dangerous i said she pressed a finger to her lower lip its not that they put me down i guess i dont want them to think im stupid theyre just theyre a pair dr delaware when erics home sometimes its like having dad in duplicate and when erics not home what do you mean do you and your father interact we get along its just that he travels and we have different interests hes into collecting i couldnt care less about accumulating stuff collecting what first it was paintingscalifornia art then he sold those for a giant profit and got into chinese porcelain the house is filled with walls and walls of the stuff han dynasty sung dynasty ming dynasty whatever i appreciate it its beautiful i just cant get into accumulating i guess hes an optimist buying porcelain in earthquake country he putties it down with this wax the museums use but still if the big one comes our house will be one big crockery disaster zone how did it fare during the last quake he didnt have it back then he got into it when mom started to get sick do you think theres a connection i said between what getting into porcelain and your mother becoming ill why should there beoh i see she couldnt do things with him anymore so he learned to amuse himself yes maybe like i said he knows how to adapt what did your mom think about the porcelain she didnt think anything that i saw she didnt think much about anythingeric likes the porcelain he can inherit it i couldnt care less sudden smile im the queen of apathy at the end of the sixth session she said sometimes i wonder what kind of guy ill marry i mean will it be someone dominant like dad or eric because thats what im used to or will i go in a totally opposite direction not that im thinking about that its just that eric was down for the weekend and the two of them went off to some asian art auction and i watched them leave the houselike twins thats basically what i know of men she shook her head dad keeps buying stuff sometimes i think thats what hes all aboutexpansion as if one worlds not big enough for himeric was thinking of coming with me today to meet you why he doesnt have classes till tomorrow asked me if i wanted to hang out before he flies up tonight kind of sweet dont you think he really is a good brother i told him i had to see you first he didnt know about you dad makes a big thing about confidentiality gave me this whole big speech about even though i was under eighteen as far as he was concerned i had full rights like he was giving me a big gift but i think hes kind of embarrassed about it once when i brought up beckys therapy he changed the subject really fast anyway eric hadnt known about you and it surprised him he started asking me all these questions wanting to know if you were smart where you got your degree i realized i didnt know i pointed to my diplomas she said the good old u not stanford or the ivys but itll probably satisfy him do you feel you need to satisfy eric sure hes the smart one no hes entitled to his opinions but they dont influence mine he decided not to come took a bike ride instead maybe one day youll get to meet him if i behave myself she laughed yes absolutely meeting eric is a reward of the highest order id thought a lot about eric about the hellish polaroids hed shot of his mother standing at the foot of the bed highlighting her misery in cold unforgiving light his father considered them trophies carried them around in that little purse how badly had richard doss hated his wife i said how did eric react to your mothers death silence silent anger hed already dropped out of school to be with her maybe that did it for him because right after he returned to stanford sudden chill in her voice she picked at her cuticles stared down into her lap bad move bringing up her brother keep the focus on her always on her but i wondered if shed ever seen the snapshots so i said so she looked at her watch ten minutes to go she frowned i tried to reel her back in a couple of weeks ago we were discussing how expressing opinions can be tricky in your family how did your mother by having none by turning herself into a nothing a nothing i said exactly thats why i wasnt surprised when i found out what she didwith mate i mean i was when i heard about it on the news but after the shock wore off i realized it made sense the ultimate passivity so you had no warning none she never said a word to me never said goodbye that morning she had called me in to say hi before i went to school told me i looked pretty she did that sometimes there was nothing different she looked the way she always did erasedthe truth is shed already rubbed herself out by the time mate got involved the media always make it out like hes doing something but he isnt not if the other people were like my mom he didnt do a damn thing there was nothing left for him to do she didnt want to be i readied my hand for a dive toward the tissue box stacy straightened placed her feet on the floor sat up straight the whole things an incredible pity dr delaware back to the clinical detachment of the first session yes it is she was brilliant two phds she couldve won the nobel prize if shed wanted to thats where eric got his smarts my fathers a bright man but she was a genius her parents were brilliant too librarians they never made much money but they were brilliant both died young cancer maybe my mother was afraid of dying young of cancer i dont know she brought becky manitow from a d to a b in algebra when becky stopped seeing her she dropped down to a d again becky stopped because your mother was ill i suppose long silence a minute to go she said our times up isnt it in a moment i said no rules are rules thanks for all your help im dealing with stuff pretty well all things considered she picked up her books all things considered one never knows she said then she laughed oh dont worry about me im fine whats the choice during the last few sessions she entered ready to talk about her grief dryeyed solemn no changes of subject or digressions to trivia or laughing danceaways trying yearning to understand why her mother had left her without saying goodbye knowing some questions could never be answered asking them anyway why her family why her had her mother even been sick had it all been psychosomatic the way dr manitow said it wasshed heard him say so to judge manitow when the two of them didnt know she was in earshot judge manitow saying oh i dont know bob he replying trust me judy theres nothing physically wrong with herits slow suicide stacy listening from the bathroom next to the kitchen had been angry at him really furious what a bastard how could he say something like that but then she started wondering herself because the doctors never did find anything her father kept saying doctors dont know everything theyre not as smart as they think then he stopped taking her for tests so didnt that prove that even he thought it might be in moms head youd think something would show up on some test during the eleventh session she talked about mate not angry at him the way dad was the way eric was thats all the two of them could do when faced with something they couldnt control get angry at it big male thing get pissed off want to crush it i said your father wants to crush mate rhetorically he says that about anything he doesnt likesome guy trying to cheat him in a business deal he jokes about pulverizing him wiping him off the planet that kind of macho bs what do you think of mate pathetic a loser with or without him mom would have stopped being at the beginning of the twelfth session she announced that there was nothing left to say about her mother shed better start paying attention to her future because shed finally decided she just might want one maybe architecture still smile ive eliminated everything else im forging straight ahead dr delaware setting my sights on architecture at stanford everyone will be happy including you definitely including me no point doing anything if it doesnt bring me satisfaction thanks for getting me to see that she was ready to terminate but i encouraged her to make another appointment she came in the next week with brochures and the course catalog from stanford going over the architecture curriculum with me telling me she was pretty sure shed made the right choice if you dont mind she said id like to come in when i apply next year maybe you can give me some pointersif you do that kind of thing sure my pleasure and call any time somethings on your mind youre very nice she said it was instructive to meet you i didnt have to ask what she meant i was a male who wasnt her father wasnt her brother chapter it was nearly ten pm when i closed the file stacy had left therapy claiming shed found direction this morning her father had implied the transformation had been temporary shed promised to call but never followed through normal teenage flakiness not wanting me to view her as a failure despite her declaration of independence id never considered her a therapeutic triumph you couldnt deal with what shed been through in thirteen sessions i suppose id known all along that shed held back would we really talk about college tomorrow morning i paged through the file again found something in my notes of the eleventh session my deliberately sketchy shorthand born of too many subpoenas pt disc fath hostility to mate thats all the two of them could do when faced with something they couldnt control get angry at it big male thing get pissed off want to crush it the phone rang dr delaware this came in an hour ago said the operator a mr fusco he said you can call him back anytime the name wasnt familiar i asked her to spell it leimert fusco i thought it was leonard but its leimert she recited a westwood exchange guess what doctorhe says hes with the fbi the federal building where the fbi was headquartered was in westwood on wilshire and veteran only blocks as a matter of fact from roy haiseldens house something to do with that then why call me not milo better to check with milo i figured the frustrations of the day would push him to keep going so i tried his desk at the station no answer there or at his home and his cell phone didnt connect unsure i was doing the right thing i punched in fuscos number a deep harsh voiceheavy shoes being dragged over rough cementrecited the usual speech this is special agent leimert fusco leave a message this is dr alex delaware returning your doctor the same voice broke in thanks for getting back so quickly what can i do for you ive been assigned to look into a police case youre currently working on which case is that laughter how many police cases are you working on dont worry doctor im aware of your allegiance to detective sturgis have cleared it with him he and i will be meeting soon he wasnt sure whether or not youd be able to make it so i thought id touch base with you personally just to see if youve got any information youd like to share with the bureau psychological insights by the way im trained as a psychologist i see i didnt the little i know ive told detective sturgis yes said fusco he as much as said so silence he said well thanks anyway its a tough one isnt it looks to be guess weve all got our work cut out for us thanks for calling back sure i said you know doctor we do have some expertise in this area the bureau what area specifically psychopathic killings homicides with psychosexual overtones our data banks are pretty impressive great i said hope you come up with something hope so too bye now click i sat there feeling like an unwitting character in a candid video something about him i called information and asked for the fbi number same prefix fusco had given so his number was probably an extension a female recorded voice said no one was in this late rust never sleeps but the government does i tried milo again no success fuscos call bothered me too brief pointless as if hed been checking me out knowing i was being paranoid i got up checked all the doors and windows set the alarm when i got to the bedroom robin was in bed reading and i slid in beside her she had on one of my tshirts and nothing else and i stroked her flank youve been industrious she said midwestern work ethic i reached up under the tshirt felt the orange peel of goose bumps between her shoulder blades she yawned ready to sleep i dont know she mussed my hair another rough night in store hope not youre sure you dont want to try to sleep in a while i said i promise well ive got to nightynight she turned off the light we kissed and she rolled away i got up closed the bedroom door after me padded to the kitchen and made some green tea from his bed in the service porch spike played a prolonged snore solo i sipped the tea and tried to forget everything normally i like the stuff tonight it reminded me of sushi bars minus the food which is kind of like a concert hall without the music i reminded myself that it was the only herbal substance proven to the satisfaction of whizbang whitecoats to be good for you crammed as it is with antioxidants and with all life throws at you why oxidize needlessly when i finished the cup i gave milo one last try reversing the order cell phone first then home then the station superstition paid off he picked up in the detectives room whereve you been i said realizing i sounded like a peeved parent right here why whats wrong i just called a few minutes ago and they said you were gone gone upstairs the lieutenants office not mate bureaucratic bs seems my poor little baby detectives are unhappy insufficiently challenged by their assignment to homicide like im running a kindergarten no success finding haiselden rub it in he said some therapist you are locked office the landlords some chinese guy barely speaks english haiseldens rent isnt due for another two weeks so what does he care i guess i should go back to his house try to find out who does his gardening normally id send korn and demetri to do it but all their bitching means i have to be careful youre on the defensive thought lapd was paramilitary more like day care nowadays did you know you can get into the academy now with prior drug arrests as long as theyre not too serious cokehead cops reassuring huh anyway whats up i told him about fuscos call yeah the grand voice of the federal government hes got a phd i figured he might call you i didnt want to talk to him without clearing it with you not that i have anything to tell him oh he said yeah of course sorry i didnt tell you it was okay hes originally from virginia bigtime poohbah from their behavioral science unit looks like my call to vicap triggered something whats he offering a powwow i figure what he really wants is to pick my brainlittle does he know what a waste thatll be if the case is hopeless he bugs out if im onto something he jumps aboard sees if he can claim some credit he faxed a charming note anything i can do blah blah blah lem assistant deputy director behavioral science hooha he said youd be meeting with him soon he wanted tomorrow i put him off said id be in touch gonna keep putting him off unless the bosses order me to waste time or do you think i should be openminded not so open your brain falls out thats already happened if we do meet its gonna be at his expense twopound steaks hyperthyroid potatoes at the dining car or the palmim making myself hungry i work three months out of the year to pay the irs let the bureau pick up the tab for my cholesterol anything else still planning on seeing mr doss tomorrow eleven am his office why how bout that i said elevens when im due to see stacy there you go he said synchronicitysomething you want to tell me about daddy nope okay then happy therapy im heading home if i fall asleep at the wheel you can have my pencil box take care of yourself i said sure i always do sweet dreams professor same to you i dont dream alex against department regulations chapter eleven am tuesday sun and heat and clarity an unseasonably beautiful morning the weather didnt matter much id been waiting in my office for half an hour no sign of stacy i cleared some paperwork phoned pali prep the secretary knew my name because id treated other students yes stacy had been excused from class two hours ago i tried the doss home no answer no cancellation message left at my service i wanted to call richards office but with teenagers you had to be careful not to breach trust especially when dealing with a parent like richard also milo was with richard and that complicated matters ten more minutes and now the session time was gone your basic noshow happened all the time it had never happened with stacy but i hadnt seen stacy in half a year and six months was a long stretch of adolescence maybe seeing me had been her fathers idea and shed finally stood up to him or perhaps mates death had something to do with it churning up memories that reminded her what could happen to a woman who allowed herself not to be i filed the chart expecting a phone call from one doss or the other by days end but it was milo who cleared things up he showed up at my house just after one pm had a quiet morning huh he walked past me and entered the kitchen my fridge is an old friend of his and he greeted it with a small smile removing a halfgallon of milk and a ripe peach looking inside the carton he muttered not much left why bother with a glass he brought the milk to the table upended the carton gulped wiped his mouth assaulted the peach as if exacting revenge on all fruit no session with little ms doss he said swami milo knows because ms doss came over to daddys office right around the time she was supposed to be with you right when id started talking to daddy something about her brother looks like hes run away from stanford from stanford doss moved my eleven up to ten and id just gotten into his sanctum sanctorumever been there i shook my head penthouse suite with an ocean view executive trappings plus your basic private museum antiques paintings but mostly walls of oriental breakableshundreds of bowls vases statues little incense burners whatever these glass shelves that make it look as if everythings floating had me worried about breathing too hard but maybe thats the point maybe throwing me off balance is why he changed the time he left the message at midnight it was only by luck that i got it i figure the plan was i wouldnt would show up at eleven and hed tell me aw shucks anyway i made it waited finally got ushered in doss is sitting behind this ultrawide desk so big that ive got to reach over and kill my back to shake his handthe guy thinks everything out doesnt he alex i remembered my stretch for the photos so what happened my butts just hitting the chair and his intercom burps stacys here that throws doss before he puts down the phone the kid runs in like shes about to blurt something to daddy then she sees me gives daddy one of those wehavetotalkinprivate looks doss asks me to please leave for a second i head back for the waiting room but the secretarys on the phone has her back to me so i keep the door open a crack i know its naughty but detectives grin ripe with suspicion and worstcase glee mostly what i heard was a helluva lot of anxiety a few stanfords bunch of erics so i knew it had something to do with her brother then doss starts asking her questionswhen how youre sure like whats going on is her fault at that point the secretary gets off the phone turns around shoots me a murderous look and closes the door i wait out there another ten minutes he chomped the peach ripping golden flesh away from the pit went for the milk holding the spout inches from his mouth white liquid arced down his gullet his throat muscles pulsed lowering the empty carton he crushed it said ahhh does a body good what else i said a few minutes later stacy comes out looking very uptight and leaves then doss emerges tells me he cant talk family emergency i do the old protectandserve any way i can be of service sir doss looks at me like who are you kidding moron then he tells me to make another appointment with the secretary goes back inside the porcelain palace the secretary looks at her book says nothing tomorrow how about thursday i say fine when im back down in the parking garage i ask the attendant to show me dosss car blackonblack bmw i chrome wheels illegally tinted windows custom spoiler shiniest damn thing ive ever seen like he dipped it in glass theres only one exit from the garage so i wait down the block but doss never comes out so whatever the problem is hes handling it by phone one thing i did think of though a dark bmw what paul ulrich saw parked on the road the morning of mates murder lots of those on the westside true jumping up he made it back to the fridge with two giant steps grabbed a new quart of orange juice popped the seal began gulping but im still curious so i call stanford locate erics dorm talk to his roommate some kid named chad soo what i manage to get out of him is that eric was looking real depressed for a few days then he didnt come back to his room for a couple of days after that when yesterday but chad didnt call till this morning didnt want to get eric in trouble but eric had a big test he didnt show up for and that wasnt like eric so after the second day he thought maybe he should tell someone he called the house talked to stacy he told you all this he was under the misconception that i was palo alto pd so how come the kid gets depressed now alex nine months since his mother dies but a week after mate gets killed mates death couldve brought up memories i said yeah well thats how i knew your morning was gonna be quiet so stacy never called im sure she will when things settle down he drank more juice i said regarding the bmw ulrich said he saw a smaller model like his yes he did i got up im going to try to reach stacy from my office meaning im kicked out meaning feel free to stay in the kitchen fine he said ill wait why something about this family bugs me what too secretive too evasive doss has no reason to play games with me unless hes got something to hide i headed for the office he called out make sure you close the door all the way richards secretary used her bosss very busy schedule as a weapon the chance of talking to him today was less probable than the sudden achievement of world peace im calling about stacy i said any idea where she might be is there a problem sir she didnt show up for her appointment at eleven i said oh but she didnt sound surprised well im sure theres an explanation may i assume youll be billing us anyway doctor thats not the issue i want to make sure everythings okay oh i see well as i said mr ds not here now but i did see stacy a while back and shes fine she didnt mention the appointment richard made it perhaps he forgot to tell her please have him call me ill give him the message sir but hes traveling on business business as usual i said pause we will honor your bill dr delaware bye now returning to the kitchen i found myself hoping somethinga sudden lead anythinghad spirited milo away and i wouldnt have to wear my calm mask but he was still sitting at the table finishing the juice looking too damn smug for someone working a whodunit with no clues bellyful of doubletalk he said i shrugged so whats next more of the same i guess doss is an interesting one little man behind a gigantic desk his chairs elevated on some kind of pedestal ill bet hes one of those guys who believes intimidation is the ultimate orgasm the power of positive domination yeah ive definitely got to take a closer look at him what about roy haiselden and donny mate still looking for them too i lucked out and found haiseldens gardener mowing the lawn haiselden didnt tell him to stop showing up keeping up appearances i said the utilities are also still on only the mails been cut off waiting in the westwood branch general delivery and alice z was telling the truth about haiselden being into laundromats hes the registered owner of six mostly on the eastsideel monte artesia pasadena collecting coins can be a dangerous business did he do it himself dont know yet all ive got is his business registration roy haiselden dba kleenuup inc as far as donny mate goes there was no parole he served his full sentence was let straight out petras asking about him thanks for brunch his hand landed on my shoulder lightly very lightly then he began to leave happy hunting i said im always happy when hunting chapter stacys call came at four pm the connection was grainy and i wondered where she was had richard given her her own little silver phone sorry for the inconvenience she said not sounding apologetic at all cool the detachment was back what happened stacy dont you already know from cool to cold eric i said so my father was right about what the cop who was here to talk to him my father said hes your friend he informs you you inform him didnt you think that would be a problem dr delaware stacy i spoke to your father about that and he you didnt speak to me about it we havent spoken at all i was planning to bring it up when you arrived and if i told you i didnt like it then id drop off the mate investigation thats exactly what i planned to do until your father asked me not to he wanted me to continue why would he want that youd have to ask him stacy he told you to continue in no uncertain terms stacy if its a matter of trust i dont get it she said when he told me about the cop he seemed angry at something detective sturgis did at being questioned like a criminal and hes right after all we went through with my mother to be harassed by the police and now i find out youre working with them it just seems wrong then im off the investigation no she said dont bother youre my patient you come first pause thats the other thing im not sure i want to be your patient nothing to do with you i just dont see why i need therapy again so the appointment was all your fathers idea same as all the other appointments no i dont mean that before once i got into it it was good great you helped me im coming across so rude im sorry i just dont see that i need any more help maybe not i said but can we at least sit down once to discuss it ive got time right now if you can make it over i dont know things are pretty intense what exactly did your cop friend tell you about eric that eric hadnt returned to his dorm for a couple of days that hed missed a test more like a day and a half she said its probably no big deal he was always going off on his own back when he was living at home back to ninth or tenth grade hed cut school without explanation take his bike somewhere disappear all day later he told me he used to check out usedbook stores play pool on the pier or go over to the santa monica courts and listen to trials the school used to phone but eric always got away with it because his grades were so much higher than anyone elses once he got his drivers license hed go away overnight not come home till morning that got to my father waking up in the morning and finding erics bed still made and eric gone then eric would drive up at breakfast time start toasting poptarts and the two of them would get into hassles my father demanding to know where eric had been eric refusing to say did your mother get involved when she was still healthy shed take my fathers side but dads always been the main one was eric ever punished dad made threats kept warning hed take away erics car keys but eric shined him on everyone knew he wouldnt follow through why not because erics his golden boy any time dad complains about him all eric has to say is what arent straight as good enough want me to get higher than sixteen hundred on the sat same for pali prep he was their big advertisement perfect gpa bank of america award winner national merit scholar prudential life scholar science achievement winner hockey team fencing team baseball team when he interviewed for stanford the interviewer called our headmaster and told him hed just encountered one of the great minds of the century so why would they want to tick him off so youre not worried about him i said not really the only thing that does bother me is his missing an exam eric always took care of business academically speaking maybe he just decided to hike hike back when he was living at home and stayed out all night hed sometimes come home with mud on his shoes looking pretty dusty at least one time im sure he was out camping this was maybe a year ago when he was home taking care of mom our rooms are next to each other and when he came in i woke up went to see what was going on he was folding up this nylon tent had this backpack bag of potato chips and candy pepperoni sticks whatever i said whats all this some kind of lonerloser picnic he got angry and kicked me out of his room so maybe thats what he did last nightwent out hiking there are lots of nice places around palo alto maybe he just wanted to get away from the city lights so he could look up at the stars he used to love astronomy had his own telescope all these expensive filters the works i heard her breath catch what is it stacy i was just thinking we had a dog this yellow mutt named helen that we got from the pound eric would take her with him on long walks then she got old and lost the use of her legs and he built her a little wagon thingie and pulled her aroundpretty funnylooking but he took it seriously she dieda year before mom eric stayed out all night with her thats got to be what happened when i asked him about it he said he did his best thinking late at night up in the mountains so thats probably it hes a little stressed decided to try that as far as the test he probably figured he could talk his professor into a makeuperic can talk his way into anything whys he stressed i dont know long silence okay to be honest erics having a real hard time with mom he had a terrible time with it right from the beginning took it much worse than i did bet thats not what my father told you though right my son deals with his anger by organizing i think its a great way of handling stress get in touch with how you feel then move on we didnt discuss eric in detail i said but i know she said dad thinks im the screwedup one because i get low while eric does a great job of looking okay on the surfacekeeping up his grades staying achievementoriented saying the right things to my father but i can see through that hes the one who took it really hard by the time my mother died id already done my years of crying but eric kept trying to pretend nothing was wrong saying shed get better sitting with mom playing cards with her acting happy like nothing was any big deal like she just had a cold i dont think he ever dealt with it maybe hearing about dr mate brought the memories back did eric talk about mate no we havent talked at all not for weeks sometimes he emails me but i havent heard from him in a while one timetoward the end of my mothers a few days before she died eric came into my room and found me crying asked what was the matter i said i was sad about mom and he just lost it started screaming that i was stupid a wimp and a loser that falling apart would accomplish nothing i shouldnt be so selfish thinking about my own feelingswallowing in my feelings was the phrase he used it was moms feelings i should be concentrating on we all needed to be positive to never give up he was tough on you i said no big deal he yells at me all the time thats his style basically hes this big huge brain machine with the emotions of a little kid so maybe hes having some sort of delayed reaction doing what he used to do when he got uptight do you think i should be worried about him no but i think you did exactly the right thing by calling your father walking in on that detective guess what my father did chartered a plane and flew up to palo alto he looked worried and that bothers me he doesnt get worried too often never he says anxiety is the province of fools i thought the lack of anxiety is the province of psychopaths said so youre alone in the house just for a couple of days im used to it my father travels all the time and gisellathe maidcomes every day the phone cut in and out during the last sentence where are you stacy at the beach some big parking lot on pch i must have driven here from dads office she laughed dont even remember thats weird which beach i said um lets see theres a sign over there says topanga topanga beach kind of pretty out here dr delaware plenty of traffic on the highway but no one on the sandexcept for one guy walking around near the tide line seems to be looking for something hes holding some kind of a machine looks like a metal detector i know this place you can see it from dads office her voice had softened turned dreamy stay right there stacy i can be there in twenty twentyfive minutes theres no need she said it sounded like a policy statement humor me stacy silence crackle for a moment i thought id lost her then sure why not got nowhere else to go i drove too fast thinking about eric a brilliant impetuous loner used to getting his way the one person who seemed able to elude richards dominance working hard at maintaining control but powerless over what had mattered most his mothers survival close to his father and his father despised mate expressed his hatred openly eric a hiker who disappeared when he wanted to liked the mountains knew the terrain dark hidden places like the dirt road stretch of mulholland impetuous enough to get violent smart enough to clean up thoroughly how far had filial devotion taken him after joannes death richard had tried to contact mate but the death doctor hadnt called back had joanne warned mate about richard knowing richard would fight her decisionthats why shed kept it from him from her children as well but what if mate had answered a call from eric poor distraught kid wanting to talk about his mothers final passage had there been enough of the physician left in mate to respond to a cry for help dark bmw parked down the road borrowing daddys car i kept racing west on sunset turning it over and over pure speculation id never breathe a word to milo or anyone else but there was nothing that didnt fit a red light at mandeville canyon stopped the seville but my mind kept revving stacy had offered a siblings eloquence a big brain machine combined with emotional immaturity combined with boiling adolescent rage perfect for the meld of compulsive planning and reckless daring that had transformed the brown van into a charnel house on wheels broken stethoscope beowulf happy traveling you sick bastard slaying the monster as if it were just another myth just another video game there was an adolescent feel to the phony book to sneaking into mates flat and leaving a note the message itself primitive gamesmanship but backed up by an intellect that was starting to scare the hell out of me where had eric been last sunday the trip from stanford to la was no big deal shuttles from san francisco ran all day easy enough for a college student with a credit card do your business jet back to school show up for class as if nothing had happened but now the perfect student had missed a test for the first time unable to run from what hed done or had some other stress worked apart the fissures that had spidered their way across the perfect porcelain image of the doss family richard jetting up to stanford leaving stacy alone sitting at the beach oblivious i sensed shed always been alone squeakless wheel not getting any grease a car horn honked the light had turned green but id sat thereobliviousness was contagious i shot forward warning myself not to get caught up in it not good for the soul all this hypothesizing besides milo had other suspects roy haiselden donny mate richard doss none of the above none of my business time to concentrate on what the state said i was qualified to do stacy was easy to spot little white mustang coupe facing the water one of the few cars stationed in the city lot that paralleled the beach low tide miles of beige kissing wedgwoodblue water all of it topped by the same clear sky as inland the ocean was pretty but roiling as i hooked across the highway and pulled onto the asphalt beside her i saw the man with the metal detector a hundred feet past stacys car knees bent hunched over a find stacys windows were closed as i got out of the seville the drivers panel rolled down she glanced at me both hands on the steering wheel her face was thinner than six months ago deepened hollows around the cheeks darkened flesh beneath the eyes a few more pimples no makeup her black hair was tied back in a ponytail bound by a red rubber band didnt know doctors still did house calls weak smile beach calls i must have sounded pretty screwed up for you to drive all the way here im sorry the man with the metal detector straightened turned and faced us as if he could hear our conversation but of course he couldnt too far away and the ocean was roaring before i could answer stacy said whyd you come dr delaware especially after i snotted off to you like that i wanted to make sure you were okay you thought id do something stupid no i said you sounded worried about eric youre by yourself if theres some way i can help i want to her eyes faced forward and her hands whitened around the wheel thats very sweet but im fine no im not im screwed up arent i even our dog was screwed up helen she nodded two legs that couldnt move and eric pulled her around thats why you drove all the way you think im cracking up no i said i think youve got good insights she whipped around stared at me laughed maybe i should be a psychologist then like beckynot that shed ever get to be one talk is shes barely passing thats got to be making dr manitow and the judge real happy you sound angry at them i said i do no not at all im a little resentful of becky turning into a total snob never even saying hello maybe shes getting back at me for eric he and allison manitow were dating and eric dumped her but that was a long time ago why am i talking about this maybe its on your mind no its not helen is after i told you about her on the phone i started thinking about her laughter she had to be the dumbest mutt ever put on this earth dr delaware thirteen years old and she was never completely housebroken when you gave her a command she just sat there and stared at you with her tongue hanging out eric called her the ultimate canine moron alien from the vortex of idiocy she used to jump on him and paw him and lick him and hed say get a brain bitch but he ended up feeding her walking her cleaning up her poop cause dad was too busy and mom was too passive that stupid little wagon he rigged up it kept her alive my father wanted to put her to sleep but eric wouldnt hear of it eventually even with the wagon she started failing toward the end he was carrying her outside to poop cursing the whole time then one night he took her with him on one of his overnights she looked awfulrotting gums her hair was falling out in clumps even so when eric wheeled her out she looked thrilledlike oh boy another adventure they were out all night the next morning eric came home by himself she turned to me no one talked about it a few weeks later mom died her fingers snapped away from the steering wheel as if shoved by an unseen demon flew to her face grabbing concealing she bent forward touched her brow to the steering wheel the ponytail bounced black curls fibrillating she shook like a wet puppy and when she cried out the ocean blocked nearly all the sound the man with the metal detector had moved fifty yards up the beach back in his own world hunched probing when i reached through the window and placed a hand on stacys shoulder she shivered as if repulsed and i withdrew all those years listening to people in pain and i can do it like a pro but ive never stopped hating it i stood there and waited as she sobbed and shuddered voice tightening and rising in pitch until she was letting out the raw keen of a startled gull then she stopped shaking went silent her hands flipped upward like visors exposing her face but she kept her head low mumbled at the steering wheel i bent forward heard her say disappearing what is she shut her eyes opened them turned toward me heavy labored movements what she said sleepily whats disappearing stacy she gave a casual shrug everything i didnt like the sound of her laughter eventually i convinced her to get out of the car and we strolled north on the asphalt following the shoreline not talking the man with the metal detector was a pulsating speck buried treasure she said that guy believes in it i saw him up close hes got to be seventy but hes digging for nickelslisten im sorry for making you come all the way out here sorry for being bratty over the phone for hassling you because youre working with the cops youre entitled to do whatever work you want it had to be confusing i said your father okayed it but he didnt tell you if he changed his mind he didnt tell me i dont know that he did he was just getting peevy because the cop came to question him and he doesnt like not being in charge still i said i think its best that i drop off the no she said dont do it on my account i dont careit really doesnt matter who am i to take away your income its no big deal stacy no i insist someone killed that man and we should be doing everything we can to find out who it was we for justice she said for societys sake no matter who he was people cant get away with that kind of thing how do you feel about dr mate dont feel much one way or the other dr delaware all those other times we talked i was never really honest with you never talked about how screwed up our family is but we areno one really communicates its like we live togetherexist together but we dont connect since your mother got sick even before then when i was young and she was healthy we must have had fun together but i dont remember im not saying she wasnt a good mother she did all the right things but i never felt she i dont know its hard to express its like she was made of air you couldnt get hold of it i just cant resolve what she did dr delaware my dad and eric blamed mate it was this big topic in our house what a monster he was but thats not true they just cant deal with the truth it was her decision wasnt it turning to me wanting a real answer not therapeutic reflection ultimately it was i said mate was just the vehicleshe could have chosen anyone she left because she just didnt care enough to keep trying she made a decision to leave us without saying goodbye snapping her arms across her bust she drew her shoulders forward as if bound by the straps on a straitjacket of course she said there was the pain but she chewed her lip shook her head but what i said with all that pain she kept eatingshe used to have such a good figure that was always a big thing in the househer figure my fathers physique they both used to wear the skimpiest bathing suits it was embarrassing i remember once the manitows were over for a swim party and mom and dad were in the pool groping each other and dr manitow was just staring like how tastelessi guess that was good though right the fact that they were attracted to each other my father would always talk about how they didnt age as quickly as everyone else theyd always be kids and then mom just inflated herself she took a step put her foot down heavily stopped again fought back tears whats the use of going on and on about it she did it its over whatever i have to keep thinking of the good memories dont i because she was a good mother i know that she edged closer to me everyone talks about getting closure moving on but where do i go to dr delaware thats what we need to find out thats why im here yes you are she surged forward threw her arms around me her hands dug into my coat curly shampooed hairtoosweet shampoo heavy with apricots tickled my nose someone watching from a distance would have thought romance on the beach the professional thing would be to pull away i compromised avoiding a full embrace by keeping one arm at my side patting her back lightly with the other what used to be called therapeutic touch before the lawyers got involved i held her for the shortest possible period then gently drew away she smiled we resumed walking walked in step i kept enough distance between us to avoid the accidental graze of hand against hand college she said laughing thats what we were supposed to be talking about this morning college isnt all of your future but its part of it i said part of where to go a small part so no big deal ill make dad happy apply to stanford if i get in ill go why not one place is the same as another im not some spoiled brat i know im lucky my dad can afford a place like that but there are other things we need to talk about right if you trust me not to flake out i can come in tomorrowif youve got time ive got time how about after schoolfive pm yes she said thank you so so much id better get back home see if dad called maybe he found eric hell probably just blow into the dorm and scream at my father for flying up we turned around back at the mustang she said and i meant what i saidplease dont stop working with the cops take care of yourself nice kid i watched her drive away eased onto pch feeling pretty good chapter when i got home robin was in the kitchen stirring a potone of those big blue things flecked with white spike was off in a corner making rapturous overtures to a deliciouslooking bone you look tired she said bad traffic i kissed her cheek and looked inside the pot chunks of lamb carrots prunes onions my nose filled with cumin and cinnamon and heat and my eyes watered something new she said a tajine got the recipe from the guy who sells me maple i dipped the spoon blew tasted fantastic thank you thank you thank you hungry starving no sleep no food she sighed bad traffic where i told her about having to meet a patient at the beach emergency potentially but it resolved i placed my arms under her rear lifted her deposited her on the counter what is this she said passion amid the pots and pans one of those malefantasy things maybe later if you behave yourself i went to the fridge found some leftover white wine sniffed the bottle poured two glasses first we celebrate whats the occasion no occasion i said thats the point the rest of the evening passed quietly no calls from milo or anyone else i tried to imagine what life would be like without a phone we ate too much lamb drank enough wine to get silly the idea of making love seemed remote more of a scripted segment than passion both of us seemed content just to be so we just sat on the couch holding hands not moving not talking would it be like this when we grew old that prospect seemed suddenly glorious eventually something changed in the air and we began touching each other stroking kissing risking exploration eventually we were naked intertwined moving from the couch to the floor enduring chafed knees and elbows strained muscles ridiculous postures we ended up in bed afterward robin showered off then announced she was going to do a bit of carving did i mind after she left for the studio i slouched in my big leather chair reading journals hawaiian slackkey guitar music droning in the background for a while i did a pretty good job of forgetting then i was thinking about stacy again eric richard the deterioration of joanne doss i considered calling judy manitow tomorrow to find out if shed come up with any new insights since the original referral bad idea stacy might find that intrusive and stacy had told me enough for me to see that the dosses and the manitows had been entangled beyond mere neighborliness joanne tutoring becky eric dumping allison becky and stacy drifting apart bob regarding richard and joannes displays of affection with distaste judy and bob dealing with beckys problems yet theyd cared enough about stacy to pressure richard to contact me me not beckys therapist because theyd been guarding their privacykeeping stacys issues at arms length from beckys or had it been beckys choicestacy had just told me becky had distanced herself barely spoke to her whatever the details it was best to avoid further complications i got up and poured a finger of chivas added to the wine that put me way past my usual alcohol consumption some hawaiian virtuoso let forth a glissando in cwahine tuning and i thought about palm trees i finished the scotch and had another on wednesday morning i woke up with a welldeserved headache an agreeably moldy tongue sandpaper eyes robin was already out in back i couldnt smell the coffee shed put on i took a oneminute shower and got dressed without falling over looked for the morning paper robin had been so eager to work that she hadnt taken it in i went outside and retrieved it the front page screamed at me the mysterious portrait of dr death sudden appearance of painting raises new questions about eldon mates murder santa monica when grant kugler owner of the primal images art gallery on colorado avenue showed up last night to unpack an installation he found a surprise donation propped against the rear door a package wrapped in brown paper containing an original unsigned oil painting described as a copy of rembrandts the anatomy lesson only this version deviated from the original in that it depicted murdered death doctor eldon mate in a double role as dissector and cadaver not the work of a master opined kugler id rate it competent why it ended up at my door i cant say im not one for representational art though i can be amused by social commentary the article went on to quote police sources who spoke on condition of not being named and attested to intriguing similarities between the painting and details of the eldon mate crime scene raising questions about the identity of the artist and the motivations for abandoning the portrait the picture has been taken into custody that conjured images of burly men trying to figure out a way of handcuffing the frame i wondered how long it would take milo to get in touch id finished half a cup of coffee when the phone screeched i assume you read he said sounds like zero tollrance is in town tried to do some followup on that colorado article you gave me no one knows tollrance there was no lease on the building he used for his show because he was squatting in it one of those big industrial shells full of lowlifes i dont know if tollrance was even living there denver pd never heard of him and the critic who wrote up the show doesnt remember much other than tollrance looked like a bum and didnt answer his questionsdidnt talk at all just pointed to his canvases and stomped away he figured him for a nut thats why he called it outsider art a bum long hair and a beard mr critic said he had some primitive talent said the same thing the gallery owner didrepresentations not his thing which i guess means in the art world if you know how to draw you suck so whyd he go to tollrances show cuuuuurious intriiiiigued couldnt even get out of him how he found out about the show maybe tollrance faxed him an announcement maybe not he said there hadnt been much of a crowd no one buying he never heard from tollrance again has no idea what happened to the paintings well we know where one is i said a bearded bum could be the same guy mrs krohnfeld chased away could be donny salcido mate it crossed my mind he said any idea where donny was at the time of the show no but it wasnt prison he didnt get busted till four months later his mother said by then he was living on the street i said he couldve drifted east ended up in colorado found himself a vacant building to pursue his art funny his mother never mentioned any talent then again she didnt want to talk about him at all i called her at the motel she checked out yesterday youre thinking donny painted daddy getting sliced up then maybe decided to act it out the paintings couldve been yet another attempt to establish a bond with daddy selling himself maybe he tried to show off to mate and got rebuffed again why deliver the painting to the gallery hes an artist he wants recognition and look at the painting he delivered all the others were straight portraits of mate the anatomy lesson put mate on the dissecting table look what i did to daddy showing off just like the note and the broken stethoscope on the other hand he said tollrance could just be another starving artist and this is a pure publicity stunttaking advantage of mates murder to breathe some life into a dead career if so it workedhere he is on the front page making my life difficult if he shows up tomorrow on tv with an agent and a publicist scratch the whole psychological scenario maybe i said this is la but if he doesnt surface that says something too three beats of silence meanwhile the paintings resting comfortably in our evidence room care to see it sure i said representation is my thing chapter nor half bad but no rembrandt i said milo ran his finger along the top of the canvas we were in the robberyhomicide room second story at west la half a dozen detectives hunched at their desks a few sidelong stares as milo propped the painting on his chair zero tollrances masterpiece was all browns and blacks and muted light just the merest wash of pink where the left arm of the man on the dissecting table had been reduced to tendons and ligaments cadaver with the fussy soft face of eldon mate even tollrances middling talent made that clear seven men extravagantly robed and ruffed and goateed surrounded the dissecting table gazing down at the corpse with academic detachment the dissectoranother matewas clad in a black robe white lace collar tall black hat probing the shredded arm with a scalpel wearing a look of boredom in the original the artists genius had distracted from the cruelty of the scene tollrances cartoon drove it home angry swirling brushstrokes pigments laid on thickly to the point of impasto sharp peaks of paint stabbing up from the surface of the canvas a smallish canvastwentyfour by eighteen inches id expected something far more grand reducing mate to size milo lifted a stack of message slips let them fall to the desk in disarray kugler the art dealer has been bugging me all day all of a sudden he likes realism probably got an offer i said same guy wholl pay big bucks for a stained blue dress phones rang keys clicked someone laughed the room smelled of scorched coffee and gym sweat got sleazeball talk shows wanting to interview me too and a six am memo from the brass reminding me to keep my mouth shut tollrance has bought himself some celebrity too i said i wonder how long thatll satisfy him meaning hell want true realism i shrugged well he said so far he hasnt made any slipups he tapped the upper edge of the painting not a single print maybe youre right a careful head case he angled the painting toward me does seeing this give you any other ideas not really i said rage toward mate ambivalence about mate you dont need me to tell you that his phone rang sturgisoh yeah hi his expression brightened as if an internal filament had ignited really thanks when sure that would be better than convenient ive got dr d with me yeah sure great talk about karma he said hanging up that was petra seems she came up with some stuff on donny shes on her way to a trial at the santa monica courthouse will stop by in ten minutes well meet her out in front we waited by the curb milo paced and smoked a tiparillo and i thought about the doss family a few moments later petra connor drove up in a black accord parked in the red zone and got out with her usual economy of movement id never seen her when she wasnt wearing a black pantsuit this time it was a slimcut thing with indigo overtones some kind of slinky wool that flattered her long lean frame and looked beyond a diis budget on her feet were mediumheeled black laceups her black hair was cropped in the usual nononsense wedge cut and slung across her shoulder was a black leather bag the texture of a windwhipped motorcycle jacket no gun visible beneath the tailored jacket so she was probably toting it in the bag the bad september light was somehow kind to her ivory skin setting off her tight jaw pointed chin skislope nose pretty in a taut way but something about her always warned keep your distance the dedication with which shed followed billy straights recovery told me there was warmth tucked behind the searching brown eyes but that was inference on my part she was all business never talked about herself i figured shed jumped high hurdles to get where she was hi she said flashing a cool smile and i knew what i was supposed to ask hows our guy doing great from what i can tell straight as and he tested out a full grade aheadamazing considering most of what he knows is selftaught a true intellectual just like you said at the beginning what about his ulcer i said clearing up slowly he fusses about taking his medicine but for the most part hes compliant hes also making some friends finally other creative types quoth the principal mrs adamsons big worry is he doesnt want to do much other than study and read and play with his computer what would she prefer him to do im not sure theres anything specificshe just seems to be nervous about doing everything right i think she feels she needs to report to me she calls me once a week hey youre the long arm of the law i said small smile i know she really cares about him i tell her not to worry hell be fine she blinked wanting confirmation good advice i said rosy coins appeared on her cheeks all in all hes getting plenty of attention maybe too much considering that hes basically a loner sam shows up like clockwork on friday takes him to venice on weekends san marino all week then the freak scene hows that for contrast multicultural experience im sure he can handle it yesgood if any problems come up i assume its okay to call you anytime thanks she turned to milo sorry i know youre waiting for this out of the leather bag came a folder heres the info on your mr salcido turns out hes a known quantity to us because of the hollywood redevelopment thing councilwoman goldsteins office ordered us to keep tabs on transientsthe bum squad we called it lasted a month salcidos name came up in one bum squad file no arrest all they did was canvass squats find out what the squatters were up to if they saw drugs or any other crime they could make an arrest but basically it was to appease councilwoman goldstein milo flipped the chart open petra said salcido was living in an abandoned building near western and hollywoodthe one with the big frieze in front i think louis b mayer or some other film type built it later the bummers found out he had a felony record and noted it accordingly our tax dollars at work milo thumbed the pages of the file was he living alone unless a known associate is noted he probably was says they found him in a room full of garbage as you see he claimed to be gainfully employed but couldnt produce backup the squad pegged him as mentally ill probably a dope fiend suggested he seek some help at a community mh center he refused why didnt the squad evict him without a complaint from the owner no grounds i stopped off at the building this morning but hes gone everyone is just construction workers big remodeling project sorry its not more hey its somethingthanks for taking the time said milo squatting by himself i knew he was thinking about the abandoned building in denver he turned a page no mug shot the bummers didnt carry cameras but look at the back page i got a booking photo faxed down from marin county jail not terrific quality milo found the shot studied it showed it to me eldon salcido mate freshly inducted to penal custody numbered plaque dangling from a chain around his neck the mandatory sullen stare leavened by a hard hot light in the eyes that mightve been madness or just the glare of the room long stringy hair but cleanshaven lightcomplected as guillerma salcido had said round face weak around the jowls small prissy features that couldve made incarceration a greaterthanusual challenge premature wrinkles a young man aging too fast striking resemblance to a face on a dissecting table guillerma salcido mate had been right donny was his fathers son milo read some more says here he claimed to be working in a tattoo parlor on the boulevard didnt remember which one i tried a few places no one knows him but the jailer up in marin said salcido had done some skin work on other inmates that was probably what kept him safe safe from what i said the jails organized along gang lines she said someone without affiliation is fair prey unless theyve got something to offer salcido sold his art but the jailer said no one wanted him in their group because he was seen as a mental case tattoos said milo the boy likes to draw petra nodded i read about the painting youre thinking its him seems like a good bet whats the painting like not what id want in my dining room milo shut the file youre an artist arent you not hardly come on ive seen your stuff my past life she insisted want to see it she looked at her watch sure why not she held it at arms length squinted turned it around inspected the sides placed it on the floor and backed away ten feet before returning to get another close look he really slapped on the paint she said looks like he worked quickly hereprobably a palette knife as well as a brush here too fast but not sloppy the compositions actually pretty goodhe got the proportions just about right she turned away from the painting this is only a guess but what i see here is someone alternating between careful draftsmanship and abandonat some point he planned meticulously but once he got into the groove he gave himself over to it milo frowned then glanced at me anyway said petra so much for art criticism what does that mean milo asked her being careful and then cutting loose that hes like most artists you see any talent here oh sure nothing staggering but he can render plenty of ambition tooredoing rembrandt rembrandt and tattoos said milo if salcido did tattoos well enough to keep himself out of trouble in prison hes got to be pretty good skin works challenging you have to get a feel for the changing density of the epidermis movement resistance to the needle now she was flushed pink milo smiled im not even going to ask she smiled back high school anyway got to run hope it helps i owe you petra im sure ill find a way to collect shifting her bag to her other shoulder she moved toward the stairs i wish i could tell you well have our eyes peeled for salcido milo but you know how it issorry to run good luck in court said milo hopefully i wont need luck nobrainer shooting that got transferred to sm because downtowns backlogged with potential threestrikers unattractive defendant inexperienced public defender with a caseload as long as the english patient today i will triumph nice to see you doctorlets keep rooting for billy back to milos desk during the time wed spent with petra a new message slip had been added to the stack special agent fusco again the painting probably heated up his attentionseeking blood he tossed the slip looked across the room detectives korn and demetri were headed our way they stopped at the desk glaring as if it were a barrier to freedom milo made the introductions they nodded stiffly didnt offer their hands demetris eyeglasses were slightly askew and his bald head was sunburned and peeling whats up gentlemen nothing said demetri he had one of those voices so low it sounded electronically manipulated thats the problem korn ran his finger under his collar his blowdried hair seemed an affront to his partners tonsure nothing with whipped cream and a cherry he said we spent all morning at haiseldens neighborhood found the gardener big deal haiseldens paid up for the month guy has no idea where senor is couldnt give a shit where senor went haiseldens mail is piling up at the westwood post office but we cant get hold of it without a warrant you want us to do that yes said milo figures problem steve no no problem at all korn played with his collar again demetri removed his glasses and wiped them on a corner of his sport coat dont lose heart boys said milo haiseldens mail stop shows he definitely rabbited so keep on himwho knows you might solve this one a glance passed between the two detectives demetri shifted his weight to his left leg thats assuming haiselden has anything to do with mate we discussed it and were not convinced he does whys that brad theres sure no evidence in that direction besides it doesnt make sense haiselden made money from mate why would he off his meal ticket we figure he just went on a vacationprobably got depressed because he lost his meal ticket taking some time off to reflect said milo right diagnosis of depression he decided to deal with his feelings on some sunny beach demetri looked at korn for support korn said makes sense to me his jaw tightened with all the publicity over mate maybe haiselden wants time to sort things out face it youve got nothing on his being dirty nothing at all said milo except for the fact that he was a damn publicity hound who rabbited during what has to be the most public moment of his life neither of the younger men spoke okay then said milo so how about you write up that warrant for his mail see if you can get hold of his credit card bills too maybe therell be a travel agent charge somewhere in there and you can verify your vacation hypothesis another passed glance demetri said yeah sure whatever you say we figured wed hit the gym first all the hours weve been puttin in we havent had a chance to work out sure get yourselves a coupla jamba juices afterwardmake sure they put plenty of enzymes in them something else said demetri that painting we just saw it real piece of shit if you ask me everyones a critic said milo chapter what now i said if those two manage to write a decent warrant application ill have a look at haiseldens mail more likely ill be correcting their grammar meantime im gonna check out art galleries tattoo parlors see if anyone else knows donny as himself or tollrance the fact that he chose a santa monica gallery might mean he left hollywood and is squatting somewhere on the westside there are a few abandoned buildings in venice i want to take a look at are you liking him better than haiselden because of the painting that his felony record and what petra said about the combination of cleverness and psychosisyour hypothesis with haiselden all ive got is his rabbiting for all i know those two lazboys could be right and its one big goose chase but let them prove it to me he stood as good a time as any to heed the call of nature scuse me he loped toward the mens room and i used his phone to call in for messages two requests for consults from judges that had come in during my ride to the station and richard dosss office wanting me to callthat one was less than five minutes old richards secretarythe same woman whod treated me like hired help yesterdaythanked me for getting back so soon and asked me to please hold for just one second before her words had faded richard came on thank you he said in a tone id never heard hoarse faltering tentative both volume and tone controls switched to low whats up richard i found eric this morning four am on campus he never left was sitting in an outoftheway spot under a tree hed been there for a long time just sitting wont say why he refuses to talk to me at all i did manage to get him back on the plane brought him back to la hes missing all kinds of exams but i dont give a goddamn about that id like you to see him please does stacy know about this i knew youd be concerned about sibling rivalry or whatever so i asked her if you could see eric and she said sureif you want to verify that ill get her on another line voice straininga man racing against something inexorable no thats all right richard i said have you had eric examined medically no there wasnt a scratch on him its his psychological status im worried about lets do it sooner rather than later okay this isnt eric hes always been the never lost his productivity whatever the hells going on i dont like it when should we set it up bring him by this afternoon but please have a physician check him out first just to make sure were not missing something silence sure whatever you say are there any particular tests you want check for head trauma fever acute infection fine finewhat time lets plan on four thats nearly four hours from now if the doctor finishes sooner call me ill stay close wheres eric now right here in my office ive got him in the conference room one of my girls is keeping him company he hasnt said anything since you found him not a word just sitting therethis is so damn neurotic but i cant help thinking this is what joanne did the way she started pulling away when you touch eric or move him hows his muscle tone fine its not like hes catatonic or anything he looks me in the eye i can tell hes all there he just wont talk to me shutting me out i dont like this one damn bit one more thing i dont want stanford to know about this see him as damaged goods the only one who knows so far is that chinese kid the roommate and i let him know it would be in all our interests to keep this close to the vest click milo entered the room before he reached the desk another detective pulled a sheet out of the fax machine and handed it to him look at this he said bringing it over further communication from agent fusco persistent little civil servant aint he he placed the fax on the desk reprint of a news item dated fifteen months earlier datelined buffalo new york doctor suspected in attempted murder an emergency room physician who allegedly laced the drink of a former supervisor with poison is being sought by police michael

center in rochester burke had recently been placed on suspension by rabinowitz due to questionable medical practices and had made veiled threats to his superior rabinowitz drank one sip of the

getting to the point where everything sounds familiar i gave the clipping another read something came into focus wheres the material i pulled off the internet he opened a drawer searched for a while pulled out more papers produced the printouts i found what i was looking for right away here you go another upstate new york story rochester roger sharveneau the respiratory tech who confessed to poisoning icu patients then recanted months later he claimed to have been under the influence of a dr burke whom no one had ever seen no sign anyone followed up on that probably because sharveneaus pattern of confessing and recanting led them to believe hed made it all up but this dr burke was working in buffalo sixty seventy miles away and getting into mischief poison mischief and sharveneau died of an overdose milo exhaled okay he said i give in sa fusco gets his meeting want to come if its soon i said ive got an appointment at four appointment for what what they sent me to school for oh yeah you do that occasionally dont you he punched the number fuscod listed on the fax got through listened taped message he said hey personalized for me if im interested meet him at morts deli on wilshire and wellesley in santa monica hell be the one with the boring tie what time he didnt specify he knew id call after i got the fax is confident ill show up i just love being played he put on his jacket what key i said d minor as in detective as in dumb but why the hell not the delis not far from those squats in venice how about you ill take my own car sure he said thats how it starts soon youll be wanting your own dish and spoon chapter the exterior of morts deli was a single cloudy window over a swath of brown board below redpainted letters proclaiming lunch for the interior was all yellows and scarlets narrow black leatherette booths wallpaper that looked inspired by parrot plumage the uneasily coexisting odors of fried fish pickle brine and overripe potatoes leimert fusco was easy to spot with or without neckwear the only other patron was an ancient woman up in front spooning soup into a palsying mouth the fbi man was three booths back the tie was gray tweedsame fabric and shade as his sport coat as if the jacket had given birth to a nursing pup welcome he said pointing to the sandwich on his plate the briskets not bad for la in his fifties the same gravel voice wheres the brisket better said milo fusco smiled showed lots of gum his teeth were huge equine white as hotel sheeting short bristly white hair rode low on his brow long heavily wrinkled face aggressive jaw big bulbous nose the tail end of his fifties the saddest brown eyes id ever seen nearly hidden by crepey folds he had broad shoulders and wide hands seated he gave the impression of bulk and frustrated movement meaning where am i from he said most recently quantico before that all kinds of places i learned about brisket in new yorkwhere else spent five years at the main manhattan office those qualifications good enough for you to sit down milo slid into the booth and i followed fusco looked me over dr delaware excellent my doctorates not in clinical personality theory he twisted the tweed tie thanks for coming i wont insult your intelligence by asking how youre doing on mate youre here because even though you think its a waste of time youre not in a position to refuse data want to order something or is this going to remain at the level of testosteroneladen watchfulness so how do you really feel about life said milo fusco gave another toothy grin nothing for me milo said whats with this burke a waitress approached fusco motioned her away next to his sandwich was a tall glass of cola he sipped put the glass down silently michael ferris burke he said as if delivering the title of a poem hes like the aids virus i know what he is know what he does but i cant get hold of him gazing pleasantly at milo i wondered if the aids reference went beyond general metaphor milos expression said he thought it did weve all got our problems want to fill me in or just bitch fusco kept smiling as he reached down to his left and produced a brickred accordion file folder two inches thick and fastened with string copy of the burke file for your perusal more accurately the rushton file he went to med school as michael ferris burke but he was born grant huie rushton there are a few other monikers in between he likes to reinvent himself so now he can get a job in hollywood said milo fusco pushed the file closer milo hesitated then pulled it over and placed it on the seat between us fusco said if you want a capsule summary ill give you one go ahead the muscles of fuscos left eyelid twitched before settling grant huie rushton was born forty years ago in queens new york flushing to be exact fullterm birth no complications only child the parents were philip walter rushton a toolanddie maker age twentynine and lorraine margaret huie twentyseven a housewife when the boy was two both parents were killed in an accident on the pennsylvania turnpike little grant was shipped off to syracuse to be raised by his maternal grandmother irma huie a widow with a history of alcoholism fuscos hands rubbed together logic and psychology tell me rushtons problems had to begin early but getting hold of childhood records that document his pathology has been difficult because he never received professional help i located some gradeschool reports that note disciplinary problems he wasnt a sociable child so locating peers who remember him clearly has been a problem a trip i made to his syracuse neighborhood several years ago unearthed some people who remember the boy as bright and talented and majorleague meanmalicious is the word that keeps cropping up he ticked his left index finger with its righthand counterpart cruelty to animals bullying other kids suspicions of neighborhood pranks and thefts and burglaries the grandmother was an inept parent and grant had free rein he was smart enough to avoid getting caught has no juvenile record that i can find his highschool yearbook entrya copys in therelists no extracurricular activities or honors he graduated with a b average which for him was no challenge he couldve done that in his sleep a few unsatisfactories in conduct but no suspensions or expulsions to me you know the data on psychopaths doctor high iq can be protective grant rushton knew how to keep his impulses under control even back then precisely when he went all the way is unclear but when he was eighteen a fourteenyearold girla neighbordisappeared her body was found two months later in a forested area on the outskirts of town decomposition was advanced and precise cause of death was never determined but the autopsy did reveal head trauma and neck wounds and sexual exploration without actual rape the investigation never got very far and no suspects were ever named was rushton questioned said milo no after the girljennifer chapellewas found rushton graduated and joined the navy basic training in californiaoceanside honorable discharge after only two months military records have proven to be less than precise all ive been able to learn is that he went awol once and they let him go that merits honorable i said in a volunteer military sometimes it does during the time he was stationed at oceanside a prostitute named kristen strunk was chopped up and dumped a mile from the base another unsolved same question said milo was rushton ever considered a suspect fusco shook his head bear with me after his discharge grant rushton died singlecar crash off the old route in nevada burnedup auto charred corpse same death as his parents i said fuscos sad eyes glowed milo said what are you saying a body switch the corpse was never examined closelywere talking french fry it wasnt till years later when i matched rushtons navy prints to those of michael burke that i came across the switch by that time it was too late to learn anything about who really got burned the owner was an accountant from tucson driving to vegas with his wife the car was hotwired while they sat at a truckstop eating burgers any idea who got burned said milo fusco shook his head and looked over his shoulder again no sign of rushton for a year and a half i figure he copped one or more false identities and traveled around for a while the next time i can tag him he was living in denver and going by the name of mitchell lee sartin a student at rocky mountain community college majoring in biology the print backtrack verifies sartin as rushton he applied for a job as a security guard got his fingers inked the sartin id was one of those graveyard switcheroosthe real mitchell was buried twentytwo years before in boulder sudden infant death three months old and no reason for the security firm to crossreference with the navy said milo not hardly those guys have been known to hire schizophrenics the prints were checked with local felony files where of course they didnt show up sartin got a job patrolling a pharmaceutical company at night by day he attended classes he lasted one semester straight as life sciences and a course in human figure drawing drawing i said is that what you meant by talented fusco nodded a couple of his former schoolmates remember him as a great doodlercartoons mostly obscene stuff making fun of teachers other authority figures he never worked for the school paper never chose to affiliate he took a long drink of cola during sartins enrollment at rocky mountain cc two female students went missing one was eventually found up in the mountains dead sexually abused and mutilated the other girls whereabouts remain unknown this was the first time grant rushtonmitchell sartin attracted any attention from law enforcement he was among several individuals questioned by the denver police because hed been seen talking to one of the girls in the college cafeteria the day before she disappeared but it was just a routine interview no reason to check further sartin didnt reenroll left town disappeared all this within two years of highschool graduation i said he was only twenty correct said fusco precocious lad the next few years are another cloudy area i cant prove it but i know he returned to syracuse to visit grandma a year later though no one remembers seeing him something happened to grandma said milo fuscos lips curled inward he ran a hand over the white bush atop his head one of those syracuse winters late at night grandma drove her car into a tree on a rural road and went through the windshield her blood alcohol was just over the limit and an empty brandy bottle was found on the front seat by the time they found her body it was frozen stiff no reason to think it was anything other than a singledriver dui thing except for the fact that grandma was a stayathome drinker never went out at night rarely drove period no one could explain why shed taken the car out in a freezing storm or why she was out in the sticks a good fifteen miles from her house no one also thought to question why with that kind of impact the bottle would be right there on the seat irma huie didnt leave much of an estateher place was rented she kept no bank accounts the police didnt find any money not a penny in the cookie jar which i find curious because shed lived on pension money from her husband and social security income and her landlord said she kept cash around hed seen wads of bills bound by rubber bands a year later mitchell sartin surfaced as michael ferris burke and enrolled in city university of new york as a sophomore premed major he presented a transcriptlater shown to be forgedfrom michigan state university claiming a year of courses gpa of cuny bought it burke gave his age as twentysixto match the stats on another id hed cribbed this time from a dead baby in connecticut but he was only twentytwo he bought himself some time with grandmas money i said but he made no attempt to claim the pension or the social security payments he knows how to be careful said fusco thats why there are periods in his life i just cant tag and a lot of what im going to tell you wont go beyond theory and guesses but have i said anything so far that doesnt make sense from a psychological standpoint doctor go on i said let me backtrack during the year between irma huies death in syracuse and michael burkes enrollment at cuny two clusters of mutilation murders occurred that bear marked similarities to the particulars of the denver victim the first popped up in michigan beginning four months after mitchell sartin left colorado three coeds were attacked in ann arbor all were jogging at night on pathways near the university of michigan campus two were ambushed from behind by a man wearing a ski mask knocked to the ground punched in the face till semiconscious then raped stabbed and slashed with a sharp knifeprobably a surgical scalpel both escaped with their lives when other joggers happened upon the scene and the assailant fled into the bushes the third girl wasnt so lucky she was taken three months later by that time some of the campus panic generated by the first two attacks had died down her body was found near a reservoir badly mutilated mutilated in what way i said extensive abdominal and pelvic cutting wrists and ankles bound to a tree with a thick hemp rope breasts removed skin peeled from the inner thighsyour basic sadistic sexual surgery subdural hematomas from head wounds that mightve eventually proven fatal but arterial spurts on the tree said shed been alive while being cut the official cause of death was bleeding out from a jugular slash shreds of blue paper were found nearby and the ann arbor investigators matched it eventually to disposable surgical scrub suits used at that time at the university of michigan medical center that led to numerous interviews with medschool staff and students but no serious leads developed the surviving girls could only give a sketchy description of the attacker male caucasian mediumsize very strong he never spoke or showed his face but one of them remembers seeing white skin between his sleeve and his glove his modus was to throw a choke hold on them as he hit them from behind then flip them over and punch them in the face three very hard blows in rapid succession fuscos fist smacked into an open hand three loud hollow reports the old woman drinking soup didnt turn around calculated one of the surviving victims called it a girl named shelly spreen i had the chance to interview her four years agofourteen years after the attack married two kids a husband who loves her like crazy reconstructive facial surgery restored most of her looks but if you see preattack pictures you know it didnt do the trick completely gutsy girl shes been one of the few people willing to talk to me id like to think talking about it helped her out a little calculated i said the way he hit hersilently mechanically methodically she never felt he was doing it out of anger he always seemed to be in control like someone going about his business she told me ann arbor did a competent job but once again no leads i had the luxury of working backwardfocusing on young men in their twenties possibly security guards or university employees whod left town shortly after then dropped completely out of sight the only individual who fit the bill was a fellow named huey grant mitchell hed worked at the u mich medical school as an orderly on the cardiac unit i said grant huie rushton plus mitchell sartin equals huey grant mitchellwordplay instead of a graveyard switch exactly doctor he loves to play the mitchell id was created out of whole cloth the job reference he gavea hospital in phoenix arizonaturned out to be bogus and the social security number listed on his employment application was brandnew he paid for his ann arbor single with cash left behind no credit card receiptsno paper trail of any kind except for a single employment rating hed been an excellent orderly i think the switch from graveyard hoax to brandnew id represents a psychological shift heightened confidence fusco pushed his coke glass away then the halfeaten sandwich something else leads me to think he was stretching craving a new game during the time he worked the cardiac floor several patients died suddenly and inexplicably sick but not terminally ill patients who couldve gone either way no one suspected anything no one realizes anything to this day its just something that turned up when i was digging he cuts up girls and snuffs icu patients said milo versatile any trace of amiability left fuscos face you have no idea he said youre talking nearly two decades of bad stuff and its never come out what one of those covert federal things or are you out to write a book look said fusco jawbones flexing then he smiled sat back let his eyes disappear in a mass of folds its covert because ive got nothing to go overt airsandwich time ive only been on it for three years you said two clusters where and when was the second back here in your golden state fresno a month after huey mitchell left ann arbor two more girls were snagged off hiking trails two weeks apart both were found tied to trees cut up nearly identically to the colorado and the michigan vies a hospital orderly named hank spreen left town five weeks after the second body turned up spreen i said shelly spreen he took his victims name fusco grinned horribly mr irony once again he got away with it hank spreen had worked at a private hospital in bakersfield specializing in cosmetic work cyst removals that kind of thing it was a big surprise when three postop patients had sudden reversals and died in the middle of the night official cause heart attacks idiopathic reactions to anesthesia that happens but not usually three times in a row over a sixmonth period the publicity helped close the hospital down but by then hank spreen was long gone the following summer michael burke showed up at cuny long body list for a twentytwoyearold i said a twentytwoyearold smart enough to make it through premed and med school he worked his way through by holding down a job as a lab assistant to a biology professorbasically a nighttime bottle washer but he didnt need much income lived in student housing had grandmas dough pulled a gpafrom what i can tell he really earned those grades summers he worked as an orderly at three public hospitalsnew york medical middle state general and long island general he applied to ten med schools got into four chose the university of washington in seattle any coed murders during his premed period said milo fusco licked his lips no i cant find any definite matches during that time but there was no shortage of missing girls all over the country bodies that never showed up i believe rushtonburke kept on killing but hid his handiwork better you believe this jokers a homicidal psychopath and he just changes his ways not his ways said fusco his mode of expression thats what sets him apart he can let loose his impulses along with the bloodiest of them but he also knows how to be careful exquisitely careful think about the patience it took to actually become a doctor theres something else to consider during his new york period he may have diverted his attention from rapemurder to the parallel interest hed developed in michigan and continued in bakersfield putting hospital patients out of their misery i know they seem like different patterns but what theyve got in common is a lust for power playing god once he learned all about hospital systems playing ward games wouldve been a snap how is he supposed to have killed all those patients said milo there are any number of ways that make detection nearly impossible pinching off the nose smothering fooling with med lines injecting succinyl insulin potassium any funny stuff go down at the three hospitals where burke spent his summers new yorks the worst place to obtain information large institutions lots of regulations lets just say i have learned of several questionable deaths that occurred on wards where burke was assigned thirteen to be exact milo pointed down at the file folder all this is in here fusco shook his head ive limited my written material to data no supposition police reports autopsies etcetera meaning some of your stuff was obtained illegally so it can never be used in court fusco didnt reply pretty dedicated agent fusco said milo cowboy stuffs not exactly what im used to when dealing with quantico fusco flashed those big teeth of his pleased to bust your stereotype detective sturgis i didnt say that the agent leaned forward i cant stop you from being hostile and distrustful but really whats the point of playing uptightlocalbesiegedbythebigbadfed how many times does someone offer you this level of information exactly said milo when something seems to be too good to be true it usually is fine said fusco if you dont want the file give it back good luck chipping away at dr mate who by the way began his own little death trip around the same time michael burkegrant rushton decided to seriously pursue a career in medicine i believe burke took note of mate i believe mates escapades and the resulting publicity played a role in michael burkes evolution as a ward killer though of course michael had begun snuffing out patients earlier michaels main objective was killing people to me wouldnt you say that applied to dr mate as well calling burke by his first name the hateful intimacy born of futile investigation milo said you see mate as a serial killer fuscos face went pleasantly bland you dont some people consider mate an angel of mercy im sure michael burke could manipulate some people to say the same of him but we all know what was really going on mate loved the ultimate power so does burke you know all the jokes about doctors playing god herere a couple who put it into practice milo rubbed the side of the table as if cleaning off his fingertips so mate inspires burke and burke goes up to seattle for med school he moves around a lot he does nothing but move said fusco funny thing though until he showed up in seattle and purchased a used vw van hed never officially owned a car like i said a retroviruskeeps changing cant be grabbed hold of who died in seattle the university of washington hasnt been forthcoming with its records au contraire officially none of their wards have experienced a pattern of unusual patient deaths but would you take that to the bank theres certainly no shortage of serials up there so now burkes back to girls what hes the green river killer fusco smiled none of the green river scenes match his previous work but i know of at least four cases that do bear further study girls cut up and left tied to trees in semirural spots all within a hundred miles of seattle all unsolved burkes fooling with iv lines by day cutting up girls in his spare time somehow working in med school bundy killed and worked while in law school burkes a lot smarter though like most psychopaths he tends to slack off that almost cost him his md he had to spend a summer making up poor basicscience grades received low marks for his clinical skills graduated near the bottom of his class still he finished got an internship at a va clinic in bellingham once again i cant get hold of hospital records but if someone finds an unusual number of old soldiers expiring under his watch im not going to faint from shock he finished an emergency medicine residency at the same place got a sixfigure job with unitas moved back to new york and added another car to his auto arsenal he held on to the van i said most definitely what kind of car said milo i knew he was wondering bmw threeyearold lexus said fusco the way i see it emergency medicines perfect for a twisted lonerplenty of blood and suffering you get to make lifeanddeath decisions cut and stitch the hours are flexiblework a twentyfourhour shift take days off and important no followup of patients no longterm relationships office or staff burke couldve gone on for years but hes still a psychopath has that tendency to screw up finally did milo smiled hed been living with an er doctor for fifteen years id heard rick praise the freedom that resulted from no longterm entanglements poisoning the boss milo said the article said hed been suspended for bad medicine meaning he had a habit of not showing up at the er when he was supposed to plus poor doctorpatient relations the bossdr rabinowitzsaid sometimes burke could be terrific with patients charming empathetic taking extra time with kids but other times hed turnlose his temper accuse someone of overdramatizing or faking get really nasty he actually tried to kick a few patients out of the er told them to stop taking up bed space that belonged to sick people toward the end that was happening more and more burke was warned repeatedly but he simply denied any of it had ever happened sounds like he was losing it said milo he looked at me maybe heightened tension i said the pressure of working a tough job when his qualifications were marginal being scrutinized by people who were smarter or some kind of emotional trauma has he ever had an outwardly normal relationship with a woman no longterm girlfriend and hes a nicelooking guy fuscos eyes drooped lower his hands balled that brings me to another pattern a more recent one as far as i can tell he developed a friendship with one of his patients up in seattle former cheerleader with bone cancer burke was circulating through as an intern ended up spending a lot of time with her thought you couldnt get hospital records said milo i couldnt but i did find some nurses who remembered michael nothing dramatic they just thought hed spent too much time with the cheerleader it ended when the girl died a couple of weeks later the first of the four unsolved cutting vies was found next year in rochester burke got close to another sick woman divorcee in her early fifties onetime beauty queen with brain cancer she came into the er in some sort of crisis burke revived her visited her during the four months she spent as an inpatient saw her at home after she was discharged he was at her side when she died pronounced her dead died of what said milo respiratory failure said fusco not inconsistent with the spread of her disease any mutilation clusters after that not in rochester per se but five girls within a twohundredmile radius have gone missing during burkes two years at unitas hospital three of them after burkes lady friend died i agree with dr delawares point about loss and tension two hundred miles said milo fusco said as ive pointed out burke has the means to travel and plenty of privacy in rochester he lived in a rented house in a semirural area his neighbors said he kept to himself tended to disappear for days at a time sometimes he took along skis or camping equipment both the van and the lexus had roof racks hes in good shape likes the outdoors these five cases are missing only no bodies so far said fusco detective you know that two hundred miles is no big deal if youve got decent wheels burke kept his vehicles in beautiful shape clean as a whistle same for his house hes a lad of impeccable habits the house reeked of disinfectant and his bed was made tight enough to bounce a hubcap howd he get tagged for poisoning rabinowitz circumstantial burke kept screwing up and rabinowitz finally put him on suspension rabinowitz said the look in burkes eyes gave him the creeps a week later rabinowitz got sick it turned out to be cyanide burke was the last person to be seen in the vicinity of rabinowitzs coffee cup other than rabinowitzs secretary and she passed the polygraph when the locals tried to question burke and put him on the machine he was gone later they found needles and a penicillin ampule in a locker in the physicians lounge traces of cyanide in the ampule rabinowitz is lucky he took a small sip even with that he was hospitalized for a month burke left cyanide in his locker in another doctors locker a colleague burke had had words with fortunately for him he was alibied home sick with the stomach flu never left his house lots of witnesses there was some suspicion hed been poisoned too but it turned out to just be the flu so all youve really got on the poisoning is burkes rabbit thats all rochesters got ive got that pointing toward the stillunopened file folder ive also got roger sharveneau certified respiratory tech buffalo police never checked out his burke story but sharveneau worked at unitas for three months same time burke was there sharveneau mentions burke and a week later hes dead why didnt buffalo check out the burke lead said milo to be charitable said fusco sharveneau came across highly disturbed and lacking credibility my guess would be severe borderline personality maybe even a fullblown schizophrenic he jerked buffalo pd around for a monthconfessing recanting then hinting that maybe hed killed some of the patients but not all of them calling press conferences changing lawyers acting goofier and goofier during the time he was locked up he went on a hunger strike went mute refused to talk to the courtappointed psychiatrists by the time he gave them the burke story they were fed up with him but i believe he did know michael burke and that burke had some kind of influence on him i said why would burke put himself in jeopardy by confiding in someone as unstable as sharveneau im not saying he confided in sharveneau or gave sharveneau direct orders im saying he exerted some kind of influence it could very well have been subtle a remark here a nudge there sharveneau was unstable passive highly suggestible michael burkes the peg that fits that hole dominant manipulative in his own way charismatic i believe burke knew what buttons to push milo said dominant manipulative and he gets away with bad stuff so whats next he runs for public office you dont want to see the profiles of the people who run the country the bureaus still doing that j edgar stuff huh fusco smiled milo said even if your boy really is the ultimate purveyor of evil whats the connection to mate tell me about mates wounds milo laughed how about you tell me what you think they might be fusco shifted in the booth leaned to his left stretched his left arm across the top of the seat fair enough id guess that mate was rendered semiconscious or totally unconscious probably with a strong blow to the head that came from behind or a choke hold the papers said he was found in the van if thats true thats at odds with burkes treepropping signature but the wooded site fits burkes kills more public than burkes previous dumps but that fits the pattern of increased confidence and mate was a public figure i suspect burke conned mate into arranging a meeting possibly by feigning interest in mates work from what ive seen of mate an appeal to his ego would be most effective he stopped milo said nothing his hand had come to rest atop the file folder touching the string unfurling it slowly fusco said however the meeting was arranged i see burke familiarizing himself with the site beforehand learning the traffic patterns leaving a getaway vehicle within walking distance of the killspot which in his case could be miles probably to the east of the killspot because the east affords multiple avenues of escape living in la burke needs wheels so im sure hes obtained registration under a new identity but whether he used his own car or a stolen vehicle i couldnt say i assume youve combed dmv done all the combinations of burke rushton sartin spreen whatever you assume correctly no good hits you were going to speculate about the wounds speculate fusco smiled brutal but precise carved with a surgicalgrade blade or something equally sharp there may also have been some geometry involved what do you mean by geometry said milo sounding casual geometrical shapes incised into the skin he began that in ann arbor the last victim diamonds snipped out of her upper pubic region when i first saw it i thought his idea of a jokethe irony again diamonds are a girls best friend but then he changed shapes with one of the fresno vies circles so i wont tell you i know exactly what it means just that he likes to play around there were two fresno victims i said was only one incised geometrically fusco nodded maybe burke had to hurry away from the other kill or maybe said milo both victims werent his read the file and decide for yourself fusco drew his glass nearer touched the corner of his sandwich anything more you want to say just that you probably didnt find much trace evidence if any burke loves to clean up and killing mate would represent a special achievement for him synthesis of his two previous modes bloody knife work and pseudoeuthanasia the papers said mate was hooked up to his own machine that true pseudoeuthanasia its never real said fusco with sudden heat all that talk about right to die putting people out of their misery until we can crawl into a dying persons head and read their thoughts itll never be real forced smile more of a snarl really when i heard about the painting i knew i had to be more assertive with you burke loves to draw his house in rochester was full of art books and sketch pads how good is he i said better than average i took some photos its all in there but dont hold me to any specific guess look at the overall picture ive done hundreds of profiles most of the time i miss something what youve done with burke goes beyond profiling i said he stared at me meaning what sounds as if youve made him your project part of my current job description is depth research on cold cases to milo youd know something about that milo uncoiled the string and opened the file inside were three black folders labeled i ii and iii he removed the first opened it to a page containing five photocopied head shots in the upper left a color school photo of tenyearold tshirted grant huie rushton button nose blond crew cut norman rockwell cute except this kid hadnt smiled for the camera had looked away from it set his mouth in a horizontal line that shouldve been merely noncommittal but wasnt anger cool anger backed by wariness emotional unsteadiness furtive wounded eyes norman rockwell meets diane arbus or was i interpreting because of what fusco had told me next a highschool graduation shot at eighteen grant rushton looked more relaxed pleasantlooking young man wearing a plaid shirt face broadened by puberty the features symmetrical tending a bit toward pug clear complexion but for sprinkles of pimples in the folds between nostril and cheek strong square chin mouth shut tight but uplifted at the corners teenage grants hair was several shades darker but still fair worn to his shoulders with thick bangs this time he confronted the lens fullfaceconfidentmore than that brash by then fusco claimed rushton had murdered and gotten away with it below the childhood shots was huey mitchells bearded face on a great lakes security badge the beard was thick spadeshaped a mink brown that contrasted with mitchells dirtyblond head hair running from atop the cheekbones to his first shirt button in an uninterrupted swath broken only by a mouth slit it rendered any comparison to the other photos useless mitchell wore his hair even longer drawn back tight into a ponytail that dangled over his right shoulder the pale eyes narrower harder my flash impression would have been bluecollar resentment vital statistics fiveten one eighty blond hair blue eyes the bottom row featured two pictures of michael burke md in the first taken from a new york drivers license the beard remained this time clipped and barbered to an inch of dark pelt that served the now powerfullooking head well so did burkes haircut razorlayered blowdried worn just above the ears by his early thirties burkes face had begun to reveal the advent of middle age thinner hair wrinkles around the mouth puffiness under the eyes overall a pleasantlooking man wholly unremarkable this time the stats said fivenine one sixtyfive he shrank an inch and lost fifteen pounds i said or lied about it to motor vehicles said fusco doesnt everyone people reduce their weight but they dont generally claim to be shorter michael isnt people said fusco youll also notice that the license says brown eyes his true colors greenblue obviously burke jerked them aroundeither because he was hiding something or just having fun on his unitas id hes back to blue i examined the last photo michael r burke md dept of emergency medicine cleanshaven squarejawed even fuller the hair thinner but worn slightly longer flatter burke had been content with a decent combover i compared the last shot with grant rushtons highschool photo searching for some commonality similar bone structure i supposed the eyes were the same shape but even there gravity had tugged sufficiently to prevent immediate identification huey mitchells beard obscured everything rushtons bangshadowed brow and burkes clear forehead gave the rest of their faces entirely different appearances five faces id never have linked any of them milo shut the folder and placed it back in the file fusco had been waiting for some kind of response and now he looked unhappy curled his fingers around his glass anything else said milo fusco shook his head unfolding a paper napkin he wrapped the halfeaten brisket sandwich and stashed it in a pocket of his sport coat you bunked down at the federal building said milo officially said fusco but mostly im on the road i wrote down a number in there that routes automatically to my beeper my fax runs twentyfour hours a day feel free anytime on the road where wherever the job takes me as i said ive got projects other than michael burke though michael does tend to occupy my thoughts tonight ill be flying up to seattle see if i can get u wash to be a bit more forthcoming also to look into those unsolveds which is a mite touchy with all the publicity about the pacific northwest being the serialkiller capital of the world and no resolution on green river they dont like being reminded of loose ends milo said bon voyage fusco slid out of the booth no briefcase his jacket bulged where hed stuffed the sandwich not a tall man after all fiveeight tops with a big torso riding stumpy bowed legs his jacket hung open and i saw several black pens lined up in his shirt pocket the beeper and a cell phone hitched to his belt no visible weapon fingering his white hair he left the restaurant limping looking like a tired old salesman whod just failed to make his quota chapter milo and i stayed in the booth the waitress was leaning protectively over the old woman he waved for her she held up a finger he said just like the fedswe get stuck for the check he liked the brisket but didnt eat much of it i said maybe his guts full of something else like what frustration hes been on this for a whilegot a bit touchy when i called burke his project sometimes that can lead to tunnel vision on the other hand theres a lot that seems to match whatgeometry a killer with a medical background and artistic interests the combination of euthanasia and lustmurder and he was awfully close when he described the details of mates murder down to the blitz attack and the cleanup that he couldve gotten from a departmental leak the waitress came over its been taken care of sir the whitehaired gentleman and a gentleman he is milo handed her a ten the tips also been taken care of she said now its been taken care of twice she beamed thanks when she was gone i said see you judged him too harshly force of habit okay so some of my income tax came back to me yeah there are similarities there often are with psycho killers right limited repertoire you bludgeon you shoot you cut but its far from a perfect match starting with the basics mates not a young girl and he wasnt tied against a tree fusco can fudge all he wants but phd or not in the end it comes down to his feelings and where does making burke a suspect lead me trying to chase down some phantom the bureau hasnt been able to snag for three years ive already got prospects close to home his hand grazed the file folder if i dont cooperate eventually hell call the brass and ill be stuck with taskforce bullshit for the moment hes trying coptocop a couple of multiplepierced kids dressed in black entered the deli and took a booth at the front lots of laughter i heard the word pastrami used as if it was a punch line nitrites for the night crawlers milo muttered wanna do me a big favor one that wont put you in conflict of interest tapping the file go over this for me you come up with something juicy i take it more seriously artistic burke draws he doesnt paint weve already got a good idea who did that masterpiece so you mind not at all thanks that frees me up for the fun stuff which is scrounging through putrid squats in venice cops day at the beach he hoisted himself out of the booth feds with phds he said bad guys with mds and mot with a lowly mastersits not pretty being outclassed i brought the file home just after three robins truck was gone and the days mail was still in the box i collected the stack made coffee drank a cup and a half brought the file to my office and called my service richard dosss secretary had phoned to let me know eric would be a half hour early for his four oclock appointment the boy had been examined by dr robert manitow if i had time please call the doctor shed left manitows number and i punched it his receptionist sounded harried and my name evoked no recognition she put me on hold for a long time no music good id never met bob or talked to him knew him only from silverframed family photos on a carved credenza in judys chambers a clipped voice said dr manitow whos this dr delaware what can i do for you curt had his wife never mentioned working with me im a psychologist i know who you are erics on his way over to see you hows he doing physically hes doing fine it was your idea to have me check him out wasnt it each word sounded as if it had been dragged over broken glass no mistaking the accusatory tone i said i thought it would be a good idea seeing what hes gone through what exactly is he supposed to have gone through beyond the longterm effects of losing his mom his behavior was unusual according to his father disappearing without explanation refusing to talk he talks fine said manitow he just talked to me told me this whole thing was bullshit and i heartily concur hes a college student for gods sake they leave home and do all kinds of crazy thingsdidnt you his roommate was concerned enough to so the kid decided not to be perfect for once of all people i thought youd evaluate the source before getting sucked into all this hysteria the source richard he said everything in richards life is one big goddamn production the whole familys like thatnothings casual everythings a big goddamn deal youre saying they overdramatize dont do that he said dont bounce my words back to me like im on the couch hell yes they overdramatize when they built that house of theirs they shouldve included an amphitheater im sure you know them well i said but given what happened to joanne what happened to joanne was hell for those poor kids but the truth is she was screwed up psychologically pure and simple not a damn thing wrong with her other than she chose to drop out of life and eat herself to death she discarded her good sense thats why she called that quack to finish the job nothing more than depression im no shrink and i could diagnose it i told her to get psychiatric help she refused if richard had listened to me in the first place and had her committed they couldve put her on a good tricyclic and she might be alive today and the kids couldve been spared all the shit they went through he wasnt talking loud but i found myself holding the phone away from my ear he said good luck with the kid ive got to run click his anger hung in the air bitter as september smog yesterday after viewing stacys pain as we walked along the beach id decided not to call judy wondering about entanglements between the manitows and the dosses something that went beyond mommy and me countryclub tennis laura ashley bedrooms now my curiosity took off in a whole new direction her eric my allison then stacy and becky becky having trouble in schooltutored by joanne then dropping back down to ds when joanne could no longer see her was bobs anger a reaction to perceived rejection becky getting too skinny entering therapy trying to play therapist with stacy then cooling off eric dumping allison yet another rejection bob manitow smarting at his daughters broken heart no it had to be more than that and his resentment of the dosses problems wasnt shared by his wife judy had referred stacy to me because she cared about the girl just another case of male impatience versus female empathy or had bobs empathy been trashed by his inability to rouse joanne from what he saw as nothing more than depression sometimes physicians get angry at psychosomatic illness or maybe this physician was just having a really bad day i thought of something else stacys tale of how bob had stared with distaste as richard and joanne groped each other in the pool a prudish man offended perhaps his resentment at having to confront the dosses tribulations was emotional prudishness id seen that most often in those running from their own despair what a professor of mine had called baloney fleeing the slicer no sense speculating the manitows werent the issue id allowed bob manitows anger to take me too far afield still his reaction had been so intenseso out of proportionthat i had trouble letting go of it and as i waited for eric my thoughts kept drifting back to judy pencilthin judy in her chambers impeccable office impeccable occupant tanned tightskinned strongboned good looks hanging her robe on a walnut valet revealing the bodyhugging st john knits suit underneath the room perpetually ready for a photo shoot polished furniture fresh flowers in crystal vases soft lights gelid convexities no hint that the fury and tedium of superior court waited just beyond the door those family photos two lithe blond girls with that same strongboned beauty thin very thin dad in the background had any of them smiled for the camera i couldnt remember was pretty sure bob hadnt stickmom and a pair of stickdaughters becky carrying it too far did judys attention to detail manifest as pressure upon her kids to look sound act be faultless had the dosses and their problems somehow become enmeshed with their neighbors maybe i was indulging myself in speculation because the family was far less unpleasant than the file id taken from the deli geometry finally the red light flashed richard and stacy at the side door eric between them richard in his usual black shirt and slacks the little silver phone in one hand looking a bit haggard stacys hair was loose and she wore a sleeveless white dress and white flats i thought of a little girl in church eric gave a disgusted look his father and his sister had spoken about him in a way that connoted a huge presence but when it came to physical stature doss dna hadnt faltered he was no taller than richard and a good ten pounds lighter a dejected slump bowed his back small hands small feet a fraillooking boy with enormous black eyes a delicate nose and a soft curling mouth rounder face than stacys but that same leprechaun cast copper skin black hair clipped so short the curls had diminished to fuzz his chambray shirt was oversize and it bagged over the sagging waistband of dirtstained baggy khakis wrinkled to usedkleenex consistency the cuffs accordioned atop running shoes encrusted with gray dried mud skimpy beard stubble dotted his chin and cheeks he looked everywhere but at me his fingers flexed against his thighs delicate hands blackened cracked nails as if hed been clawing in the dirt his father hadnt tried to clean him up or maybe hed tried and eric had resisted i said eric dr delaware and extended my hand he ignored the gesture stared at the ground the fingers kept flexing goodlooking kid on a certain kind of sweet convincing college night girls attracted to the brooding sensitive type would be drawn to him just as i began to retract my hand he gripped it his skin was cold moist turning to his father he grimaced as if bracing for pain i said richard you and stacy can wait out here or walk around in the garden check back in an hour or so you dont need to talk to me said richard later his lips seemed on the verge of a retortmaking a pointbut he thought better of it okay then how about we get coffee or something stace we can make it into westwood and back in an hour sure daddy i caught stacys eye she gave a tiny nod letting me know seeing her brother was okay i nodded back the two of them left and i closed the door behind eric and myself and said this way he followed me into the office stood in the center of the room make yourself comfortable i said or at least as comfortable as you can be he moved to the nearest chair and lowered himself slowly i can understand your not wanting to be here eric so if no i want to be here a big mans voice flowed out of the cupids mouth richards baritone even more incongruous he flexed his neck i deserve to be here im rucked up he fingered a shirt button thats absurd isnt it he said the way i just phrased that the way we use fuck as a pejorative supposedly the most beautiful act in the world and we use it that way sickly smile scroll back and edit im dysfunctional now youre supposed to ask in what way in what way isnt your job finding out yup i said good deal your job he said looking around the office no need for any equipment just your psyche and the patients encountering each other in the great affective void hoping for a collision of insight the briefest smile as you can see ive had intro psych did you enjoy it nice relief from the cold cruel world of supply and demand one thing did bother me though you people put so much emphasis upon function and dysfunction but pay no attention to guilt and expiation too valuefree for you i said too incomplete guilts a virtuemaybe the cardinal virtue think about it what else is going to motivate us bipeds to behave with proper restraint what else prevents society from sinking into mass entropic fuckupedness his left leg crossed over his right and his shoulders loosened using big words relaxed him i imagined his first precocious utterances met with astonishment then cheers achievements piling up expectations exceeded i said guilt as a virtue what other virtue is there what else keeps us civilized assuming we are civilized highly open to debate there are degrees of civilization i said he smiled you probably believe in altruism for its own sake good deeds carried out for the intrinsic satisfaction i think lifes essentially an avoidance paradigm people do things to avoid being punished does that come from personal experience he shifted back in the chair well well well isnt that a bit directive considering ive been here all of five minutes and its not exactly a voluntary transaction i said nothing he said get too pushy and i could revert to the treatment i gave my father when he chanced upon my meditation spot which is total freezeoutwhat you guys call elective mutism at least its elective he stared at me meaning meaning youre in control i said am i is there really any such thing as volition without volition why the need for guilt eric he frowned for less than a second wiped away consternation with a smile aha fingering a button of his wrinkled shirt a philosopher probably an ivy league guylets take a look at those diplomas oh sorry the u native son midwesterner corn and cows and yet youre philosophicalthis could start sounding like my dinner with andre favorite movie of yours i said i liked it considering the chattiness level lethal weapons more to my taste oh the comfort of simplicity because lifes complicated he began to reply checked himself scanned my diplomas again resumed studying the carpet neither of us spoke for a minute or so then he looked up waiting me out technique number thirtysix b its your time i said your job requires patience id be lousy at it ive been told i dont suffer fools well told by whom everyone dad he meant it as a compliment hes rather proud of me and displays it with ostentatious shows of supporttheres a case of constructive guilt for you whats your father guilty about i said losing control raising his kiddies by himself when all three of us know what hed really rather be doing is flying all over the country amassing real estate its not as if it was his decision wellthe curling lips twisted upwarddads not always rational but then who is to understand the root of his guilt youd need to know something about his backgrounddo you why dont you fill me in hes your basic selfmade man the cream of immigrant stock his fathers greek his mothers sicilian they ran a grocery in bayonne new jersey cant you just smell the kalamata olives in that world family means mama papa kiddies grape leaves farting after too much soup the usual mediterranean accoutrements but poor dads stuck with no mama in his familyhe didnt save his wife was that within his power his face flushed and his hands rolled into fists how the fuck should i know why even ask that kind of question when its structurally unanswerable why should i have to answer any of your questions he looked at the door as if considering escape muttered whats the use and slumped lower the question bothered you i said have you been asked it by someone else no he said and why would i give a fuck about anyone else why the fuck would i give a fuck about the fucking past period its whats happening now thats forget it theres clearly no point discussing this dont start feeling all triumphant because the first time i meet you i exhibit emotion if you knew me youd know thats no big deal im mr emotion i think it i say it in the brain out the mouth ill emote to a fucking stranger if the mood strikes me so this isnt progress more sotto voce swearing the only reason i let dad get me into this is silence is what eric he caught me in a weak moment the moon was full and i was full of shit believe me it wont happen again first item of business back to palo alto tonight second item get a new roommate who wont rat me out if i decide to deviate from routine this is bullshit understand i know it dr manitow knows it and if you earned all that paper on the wall you should know it much ado about nothing i said it sure isnt a midsummer nights dreamno comedy in my life dottore im a po po child of tragedy my mother came to a horrible end im entitled to be obnoxious right her death bought me leeway his hands pressed together prayerfully thank you mom for miles of leeway he slid down so that he was nearly lying in the chair smiled okay then lets talk about something a bit cheerierhow about them dodgers i said seeing as youre going back to stanford and ill probably never talk to you again im going to incur your wrath by suggesting you find someone there to talk to hear me out eric im not saying youre dysfunctional but you have been through something terrible and you are so full of shit he broke in discomfortingly mild tone how can you sit there and judge my experience im not judging im empathizing i was older than you when my father died but not much older he brought on his own death too i was a good deal older when my mother died but the loss was more profound because i was closer to her and now i was an orphan theres something about thatthe aloneness my fathers death was a big blow to my sense of trust the fact that something so important can be taken away from you just like that the powerlessness you view the world differently i think thats worth talking about to someone wholl really listen the black eyes hadnt moved from mine a vein in his neck pulsed he smiled slouched nice speech bro whats that called constructive selfdisclosure technique number fiftyfive c i shrugged enough said sorry he said in a small hurried voice youre a nice guy problem is im not so dont waste your time you seem heavily invested in that i said in what being the quirky obnoxious genius my guess is that somewhere along the line you were taught to associate smarts with having an edge but ive met some really bad people and you dont qualify for that club his face went scarlet i apologized man no need to twist the fucking knife no need for apologies eric this is about you not me and yes youre right that was constructive selfdisclosure i chose to expose part of myself in the hope it might spur you to get some help he turned away from me this is bullshit if dad hadnt been a fucking old maid and freaked out none of this would be happening that wouldnt change the reality give me a break forget philosophy eric forget intro psych your reality is what youre experiencing most people your age dont have to endure what youve endured most arent concerned with guilt and expiation his shoulders jerked as if id shaken him i was talking abstractly were you he seemed poised to leap from the chair settled back down laughed so youve met a lot of bad guys have you more than id care to killers among others serial killers that too another laugh and you dont think id qualify lets call it an educated guess eric though youre right i dont really know you im also guessing guilts more than an abstraction for you your father and your sister both told me how much time you spent with your mother during her illness taking the semester off so now i get punished for it have to listen to all this fucking shit being heres not punishment it is if its against your will could your father really have forced you i said he didnt answer its your choice i said your volition and since this is a oneshot deal the best i can do is give you some advice and let you run with it my advice is forget itdont waste your midwestern time i shouldnt be here in the first place i shouldnt be horning in on stacys therapy stacys okay with it thats what she says thats the way she always starts out path of least resistance everythings fine but believe me shell get pissed about it its just a matter of time basically she hates me im a shadow in her life the best thing that ever happened to her was my going away stanfords the last place she should go but with dad leaning on her shell comply once againthe path of least resistance shell come up there want to hang out with me start hating me again she stops hating you when youre apart absence makes the heart grow fonder sometimes absence makes the heart grow hollow profound he said all this fucking profundity so early in the day you really think stacy hates you ah knows she duz not that i can do anything about it birth orders birth order shell just have to deal with being number two and you have to deal with being number one the burdens of primacy he peeled back a sleeve oh man left my watch back in my dorm room hopefully no one swiped itive really got to get back take care of business how much more time do we have ten more minutes he examined the room some more saw the play corner the bookcase stacked with board games hey lets play candy land see who gets to the top of that big rockcandy mountain first nothing wrong i said with having a sweet life he wheeled gaped at me i never saw the tears in his eyes but the frantic way he swiped at them told me they were there everythings a punch line with you making your fucking point well thanks for all the fucking insight doc the bell rang eight minutes early richard overeager i picked up the phone punched the intercom button for the side door its me said richard sorry for interrupting but weve got a bit of a problem out here eric and i hurried over richard stood on the porch along with stacy two tall men behind them detectives korn and demetri richard said these gentlemen want me to accompany them to the police station korn said hey doc nice place richard said you know them whats going on i said korn said like mr doss said his presence is requested at the station for what questioning in regard to demetri stepped forward thats not your business doctor we allowed mr doss to call you because his children are present and one of thems a minor the boys twenty right so he can drive both of them home in mr dosss car he and korn moved closer to richard richard looked scared stacy said daddy her eyes were wide with terror richard didnt answer her nor did he ask what it was all about not wanting his children to hear the answer you ride with us sir said demetri first im calling my lawyer youre not being arrested sir said korn you can call from the station im going to call my lawyer richard brandished the silver phone korn and demetri looked at each other korn said fine tell him to meet you at the west la station but youre coming with us what the fuck said eric moving toward the detectives demetri said stand back son im not your fucking son if i was my knuckles would be scraping the ground demetri reached inside his jacket and touched his gun stacy gasped and erics eyes got wide i placed my hand on his shoulder bore down he was trembling richard stabbed the keypad of the silver phone eric got next to stacy put his arm around her she threw her arm across his chest her lips quivered erics were still but the neck vein was racing both of them watched their father as he held the phone to his ear richards foot tapped impatiently no more fear in his eyes calm under fire or not totally surprised saundra richard doss please get max on the phone whats that when okay listen its really important that i talk to him im in a bit of a jam no something different i cant get into it right now just reach him in aspen asap ill be at the west la police stationwith some detectives whatre your names korn demetri richard repeated that reach him saundra if he cant jet back at the very least i need the name of someone who can help me im on cellular im counting on you bye he clicked off the phone on our way said demetri richard said demetri greek american said demetri too quickly then lithuanian a long time ago lets get going sir no one can make sir sound like an insult the way a cop can stacy started to cry eric held her tight richard said ill be okay kids you just hold onill see you for dinner promise daddy said stacy itll be fine sir said korn taking hold of richards arm hold on i said im going to call milo both detectives grinned as if on cue i was the perfect shill demetri moved behind richard as korn kept his grip the two of them shadowing the much smaller man milo demetri said knows chapter the big pale palm of a hand hung inches from my face a fleshy cloud dont said milo barely audible dont say a thing it was i was in the front reception area of the west la station and hed just come down the stairs i wanted to knock his hand away waited as it lowered his jacket was off but his tie was tighttoo tight reddening his neck and face what did he have to be angry about id been waiting in the lobby for over an hour most of it alone with the civilian clerk behind the desk a pasty overly enunciative man named dwight moore i knew some of the clerks not moore the first time id approached hed looked wary as if i had something to sell when i asked him to reach milo upstairs he took a long time to put the call through for the next sixtythree minutes i used every angerreduction trick i knew while warming a hard plastic chair as moore answered the phone and moved paper around twenty minutes into the wait i stepped up to the desk and moore said why dont you just go home sir if he really does know you hes got your number my hands clenched below the counter no ill wait suit yourself moore got up walked into a back room returned with a large cup of coffee and a glazed bear claw he ate with his back to me taking very small bites and wiping his chin several times minutes dripped by a few blues came and went some of them greeting moore none with enthusiasm i thought of stacy and eric watching their father taken away by lapds finest at fivefifteen an elderly couple in matching green cardigans walked into the station and asked moore what could be done about their lost dog moore adopted a skeptical look and gave them the number for animal control when the woman asked another question moore said im not animal control and turned his back what you are said the old man is a little prick herb said his wife easing him toward the door as they left he told her and they wonder why no one likes them fivetwenty eric and stacy were nowhere in sight if theyd made it i assumed theyd been allowed upstairs but moore wouldnt confirm it id sped over in the seville following richards black bmw as eric gunned it down from the glen and wove through westwood traffic easy to follow the car was a blade of onyx cutting through dirty air the car that id wondered about as the match to the vehicle paul ulrich had spotted on mulholland richard eric the boy drove much too fast took foolish chances at sepulveda and wilshire he ran a red light nearly collided with a gardeners truck swerved into the center lane sped away from a chorus of honks i was two cars back got caught at the light lost sight of him by the time i reached the station i couldnt find the bmw on the street no parking space for me in the police lot this time i circled several times finally grabbed a spot two blocks away jogging the distance i arrived huffing remembering the fear in stacys eyes as korn and demetri placed their father in the back of a dungbrown unmarked tears striping her face as korn slammed the door of the police cat she mouthed daddy eric dragged her to the bmw opened her door nearly shoved her into the passenger seat flashing me one furious look he ran to the drivers side started the car up hard shoved the rpms to a defiant whine fishtailing and burning rubber he took off where are the kids i asked milo something in my voice made him wince lets talk upstairs alex the use of my name made moore look up hey there detective sturgis he said this gents been waiting for you milo grunted and led me to the stairs we climbed quickly to the second floor but instead of exiting he stopped at the fire door and leaned against it hear me out this was not my decision you didnt send those two the command to pick up and question doss came from downtown command not request downtown claims they tried to reach me i was out in venice and instead of trying harder they went around me and gave the order to korn demetri said you knew demetris an asshole neck bulging against the collar unhealthy flush i was three steps below him and he probably didnt mean to glare down at me but the effect was therelooming bulk volcanic rage the stairwell was hot gray soupy with the steelandsweat pungency of a highschool corridor would i have done the same thing he said yes it was a command but not at your house so please ive got plenty to deal with fine i said not sounding fine at all but cut me some slack too i saw the looks on those kids faces what the hells the emergency whats richard done he exhaled upsetting his kids is the least of his problems hes in serious trouble alex my stomach lurched on mate oh yeah what the hell changed in two hours i said what changed is weve got evidence on doss what kind of evidence he ran a finger under his collar if you breathe a word of it youre essentially decapitating me heaven forbid i said without a head you couldnt eat come on what do you have he stretched a leg sat on the top step what i have is a pleasant fellow named quentin goad locked up at county waiting trial on an armed robbery beef he fished a mug shot out of his pocket heavyset white man with a shaved head and black goatee looks like an overweight satan i said when quentins not holding up elevens he works constructionroofing and sheetmetal work hes done a lot of work for mr dossapparently mr doss likes to hire cons pays them under the table to avoid taxes which tells you something about his character the way goad tells it two months ago he was roofing a project out in san bernardinosome big shopping center doss bought cheap and was refurbishingwhen doss approached him and offered him five thousand bucks to kill mate told him to make it nasty and bloody so everyone would think it was a serial killer gave goad a thousand up front promised four when the job was finished goad says he took the dough but never intended to follow through saw it as a perfect way to con doss and cut town with a grand hed been wanting to move to nevada anyway because he had two strikes against him in california and it made him nervous dont tell me i said before he left he decided to give himself a goingaway party a month ago hamburger joint in san fernando late at night just before closing time mr goad a a paper bag eighthundredbuck haul goad already had the counter boy facedown on the floor and the money in the bag when the security guard appeared out of nowhere and took him down gunshot to the leg flesh wound goad spent two weeks at county gen getting free medical care and then they moved him to the twin towers the wasnt even loaded so now hes facing three strikes and hes trying to deal by selling out richard hes claiming richard gave him money two months ago and didnt mind no followthrough the richard i know isnt high on patience richard bugged him all right about three weeks in wanting a progress report goad told him he needed to plan it just right was watching mate waiting for the perfect opportunity was he he says no the whole thing was a scam come on milo however you look at it this guys a liar and a lowlife moke and if it was only goads story your pal would be facing a much brighter future unfortunately witnesses saw doss and goad meet at one of goads hangoutsexcon bar in san fernando only a block from the hamburger joint he tried to rip off which tells you how smart goad is the thing is doss didnt act too smart either weve got three drinkers and the bartender who saw the two of them having a serious headtohead they remember doss because of the way he dressed fancy black duds he didnt fit in the waitress saw doss pass an envelope to goad nice fat envelope and shes got no reason to lie but she never actually saw money changing hands what he said doss was passing him halloween candy goad claims richard passed him cash right out in the open the bars a con hangout alex dark dive maybe doss figured no one was watching or that it wouldnt come back to haunt him for all i know this isnt the first time doss paid a con to do dirty work for him weve also recovered some of the money doss paid goad ten hundreds goad spent eight but two bills are left we just printed doss should know soon if anything shows up want to take bets on that a dumb psychopath like goad actually held on to loose cash he says it was greyhound money something to tide him over until he pulled off the hamburger heist whats the alternative explanation alex everyone in the bars lying some grand conspiracy to frame poor richard because maybe one time he played golf with oj come on this is crime as i know it tawdry predictable stupid doss may be a hotshot businessman but he was out of his element and he screwed up hes been on my list along with haiselden and donny now hes moved up to number one man does goad claim richard gave him a reason to kill mate goad says richard told him mate had murdered his wife that she wasnt really sick that as a doctor mate should have known that should have tried to talk her out of it he told goad hed be doing a public service by getting rid of the guy as if goad cared about doing goodyour boy thinks hes streetsmart but that shows how out of his element he was mr brentwood slumming with the lowlife it sounds damn real to me alex even if you do find richards prints on the money what would that prove i said goad worked for richard and you just said he paid his workers under the table he looked up at me wearily all of a sudden youre a defense attorney in my humble opinion your time would be better spent dealing with those two kids than constructing excuses for their daddy im sorry for you that it worked out this way but as the guy whos been slogging this case im happy as hell to have a real lead he didnt look happy i said once more with feeling where are the kids now he hooked a thumb at the door i put them in a victims family room assigned them a nice sensitive female d to keep them company howre they doing dont know frankly ive been spending my time on the phone with my alleged superiors and trying to talk to daddywhos clammed till his attorney gets here i cant promise you the kids wont be interviewed eventually but right now theyre just waiting want to see them if theyll see me i said having the gruesome twosome show up at my door didnt do much for my credibility im sorry alex goads pd called parker center direct ready to deal and a big brass hardon developed try to forget the kids for a second and see this for what it is major unsolved homicide going nowhere and along comes credible evidence of a prior threat against the victim from someone with means and motive at the very least weve got doss on conspiracy to solicit murder which might be enough to hold him while we go looking for goodies howd korn and demetri figure out where he was dropped in on his secretary he chewed his cheek saw your name in the appointment book great you of all people should know its not a pretty job alex whens richards lawyer due soon bigtime mouthpiece named safer specializes in getting the upper crust out of scrapes hell advise doss to stay clammed well try to hold your boy on conspiracy either way itll take a long time clearing the paperwork so figure on his being here overnight at least he stood stretched his arms said im stiff too much sitting around poor baby you want me to apologize again fine mea culpa culpamea i said what about fuscos file what about the painting what does doss have to do with that whos to say the painting has anything to do with the murder and no nothings forgotten just deferred if you can still bring yourself to do it read the damn file if not i understand he shoved at the door and walked out into the hall the victims family room was a few doors up a young honeyhaired woman in a powderblue pantsuit stood a few feet away detective marchesi dr delaware said milo hi she said i offered them cokes but they refused milo howre they doing cant really say because ive been out here the whole time they insistedthe boy insistedthat they be by themselves he seems to be the boss thanks sheila said milo take a break sure ill be at my desk if you need me marchesi made her way to the detectives room milo said all yours and i turned the handle the room wasnt much different from an interrogation cell had probably been converted from one tiny windowless hemmed by highgloss mustard walls three chairs upholstered in mismatched floral cotton prints instead of countyissue metal in place of the steel table with the cuff bolts was a low wooden slatted thing that resembled a picnic bench with the legs cut off magazines people ladies home journal modern computer eric and stacy sat in two of the chairs stacy stared at me eric said get out stacy said eric hes the fuck out of heredont argue stace hes obviously part of this we cant trust him i said eric i can understand your thinking no more bullshit the fat cops your pal you set my dad up you fuck i said just give me ill give you dick he shouted then he rushed me as stacy cried out suffused blood darkened his skin to chocolate his eyes were wild and his arms were churning and i knew hed try to hit me i backed away got ready to protect myself without hurting him stacy was still shouting her voice high and feline and frightened id made it out the door when eric stopped stood there waved his fist spittle foamed at the corners of his mouth get out of our lives well take care of ourselves over his shoulder i saw stacy bent low face buried in her hands eric said youre off the case you fucking loser chapter i drove home cold hands strangling the steering wheel heart punching against my chest wall try to forget the kids they are no longer my affair concentrate on facts milo was right the facts fit his instincts had aimed him at richard time to be honest so had mine the first time id heard about mates death richard had popped into my head id run from the truth hidden behind the complexities of ethical conflict but now reality was spitting in my face i recalled richards gloating after bringing up mates death festive times the sonofabitch finally got what he deserved finally did that mean hed turned to someone else when goad had failed to follow through means motive vicarious opportunity ready with an alibi milo had pegged it right away people like richard didnt do their own dirty work for all my theories about cooptation and irony did the van butchery boil down to stupid bloody revenge but why what could lead someone as bright as richard to risk so much over a man whod been no more than an accomplice to his wifes last wishes was he one of those skillful psychopaths bright enough to channel his drives into high finance distressed properties a man who profited from the distress of others had richard been running from a truth of his own the fact that joanne had frozen him out of her life shut him out completely chosen death in a cheap motel room over a life with him in the palisades dying in the company of another man the intimacy of death the feminist journalsherowondered about the preponderance of female travelers speculated about the sexual overtones of assisted suicide had richard seen joannes last night as the worst kind of adultery i supposed it was possible but it still seemed so clumsy was richard behind the phony book and the broken stethoscope youre out of business doc a sick uneasiness slithered over me happy traveling you sick bastard why had richard contacted me within a week of the murder stacys college future as hed claimed or knowing that quentin goad had been arrested was he preparing himself for exactly what had happened asking me to see eric too take care of the kids while im gone look how that had turned out then i thought of something much worse eric all that talk of guilt and expiation the directed child the gifted firstborn whod dropped out to tend to his mother had seemed to be adjusting suddenly leaving his dorm room sitting up all night obsessed with guilt because guilt was all he felt involved had his father been cruel enough crazy enough to get him involved id allowed myself to wonder if eric had been mates slayer now that id seen his anger at work those speculations took on weight richards deal with goad peters out so he keeps it in the family dad in san francisco son down in la for a couple of days with the keys to dads car i wanted to think richard wasif nothing elsetoo smart for that but if hed been willing to risk his family by passing cash in a con bar was there any reason to trust his judgment somethinga fissurehad forced its way through this family something to do with joannes deaththe how the why bob manitow claimed her deterioration was all due to depression and maybe he was right even so that kind of emotional collapse didnt manifest overnight what had led a woman with two phds to destroy herself slowly something longstanding something richard had reason to feel guilty about a guilt so crushing it had caused him to displace his feelings onto mate kill the messenger make it bloody father and son and daughter stacy sitting alone at the beach eric sitting alone under a tree everyone isolated driven apart something that mates murder had brought to a head here i was again guessing obsessing once when i was nine i went through a compulsive phase labeling my drawers lining my shoes up in the closet unable to sleep unless i pulled the covers over my head in a very special way or maybe id just been trying to shut out the sound of my fathers rage i turned off veteran onto sunset raced up the glen was still groping and supposing when the road to my house appeared so suddenly i nearly missed it hooking onto the bridle path i sped up the hill drove through the gateposts parked in front of my little chunk of the american dream home sweet home richards was being torn down brick by brick robin was in the living room straightening up no sign of spike out in back she said doing his business if you must know a businessman she laughed kissed me saw my face looked at the file looks like youve got business too things you dont want to know about i said more on mate the news said they arrested someone did they i told her about korn and demetris dropin here oh my god rang the bell and took him away in front of his kids thats horriblehow could milo do that not his decision the brass went around him thats just horriblemust have been hell for you a lot worse for the kids poor things the father alex is he capable of that sorry theyre still your patients i shouldnt be asking i said im not sure they are and i dont have a good answer to that but id answered her as clearly as if id spelled it out sure hes capable honey she said cupping her hand around the back of my neck she stood on her tiptoes pressed her nose to mine i realized id been standing there for a long time silent oblivious the file felt leaden i hoisted it higher she put her arm around my waist and we entered the kitchen she poured iced tea for both of us and i sat at the table placing fuscos opus out of my field of vision fighting the urge to walk away from her throw myself into the fbi mans crusade wanting to build up faith in fuscos project discover some grand forensic aha that would exonerate richard make me a hero in stacys eyes erics too instead i sat there reached for the remote control flicked on tv news a red update banner filled a corner of the screen a very happy reporter clutched his microphone and warbled in the murder of death doctor eldon mate police sources tell us that the man being questioned is richard theodore doss fortysix a wealthy pacific palisades businessman and former husband of joanne doss a woman whose suicide dr mate assisted nearly a year ago reports of a possible murderforhire scheme have not been confirmed a few minutes ago dosss attorney arrived at the west los angeles police station well update you on this story as it unfolds brian frobush for onthescene news in the background was the building id just left the news crew must have showed up moments after i drove away i pressed off robin sat down next to me we touched glasses i said cheers i endured ten more minutes of togetherness then i told her i was sorry picked up the file and left wounds fissures real ones it was well after midnight robin had been asleep for over an hour and i was pretty sure she hadnt heard when id left the bed and made my way to the office id started with the file but shed come after me convincing me to bathe with her take a walk a long walk drive into santa monica for an italian dinner come home and play scrabble then gin then sit side by side in bed collaborating on the crossword puzzle like normal folks i said when she said she was sleepy acting genius i love youand see i said it without making love first hey a new pattern what do you mean saying it before how nice she reached for me now here i was throwing on a robe making my way through the dark house feeling like a burglar back in the office switching on the greenshaded desk lamp and casting a hazy beam on the file the room was cold the house was cold the robe was old terry cloth worn to gauze in spots no socks the chill took hold in the soles of my feet and worked its way up to my thighs telling myself that was appropriate for the task at hand i drew the file close and untied the string fusco had spared no detail in his study of grant rushton michael burke everything neat organized subheaded threeholepunched the detached precision of postmortem reports the weights and measures of degradation page after page of crimescene descriptionfuscos summaries and analyses as well as some of the original police reports the agents prose was more erudite than the typically stilted copwrite but still far from shakespeare he seemed to like dwelling on the nasty stuff or maybe that was my fatigue and the cold talking i stuck with it found myself entering a state of hyperawareness as i sucked up page after page of small print photographs crimescene polaroids autopsy shots the beautiful hideous lurid hues of the human body imploded debased exploited like a rain forest sternumcracking facepeeling skinflaying all in the name of truth the framing of fleshtunnels in threebyfive universes blossoming orchids of ruptured viscera rivers of hemoglobin syrup dead faces the look extraction of the soul a realization strobed my brain mate wouldve liked this had he sensed what was happening to him i returned my eyes to the pictures womenthings that had once been womenpropped up against trees a page of abdominal closeups gashes and gapes on skin transmuted to plumcolored shapes sketched on gray paper precisely excised wounds the geometry the chill found my chest inhaling and letting the breath out slowly i studied the shapes and tried to recall the death shots of mate that milo had showed me up on mulholland craving equivalence between all of this and the concentric squares engraved in mates flabby white belly some concordance i supposed but once again milo was right lots of killers like to carve skin art where was donny salcido mate selfproclaimed rembrandt of the flesh the anatomy lesson let us carve and learn let us carve daddy cause we hate daddy but want to be him the art of death why couldnt it be him it should be him then i thought of guillerma mate the way shed stood at the closet of that dingy little motel room frozen as i asked about her only child maybe faith was its own reward but still hers had to be a lonely life a single mom abandoned by her husband disappointed by her only child she prayed regularly offered thanks casting her eye upon some grand world to come or had she truly found peace her bus trip to la said she hadnt richard and his kids guillerma and her boy alone everyone alone chapter three hours into thursday three twentytwo am and id finished every word in fuscos omnibus no thunderous conclusions then i went over the photos a second time and saw it crimescene shot from a washington state unsolved one of the four victims murdered during michael burkes term as a medical student four killings fusco saw as consistent with burkes technique because the victims had been left propped against or near trees the girl was a twentyyearold waitress named marissa bonpaine last seen serving shrimp cocktail at a stand in the pike place market in seattle found a week later splayed in front of a fir in a remote part of the olympic national forest no footprints near the scene the buildup of pine needles and decaying leaves on the forest floor was a potentially fertile nest for forensic data but nothing had been found add eleven days of rain to that and the scene was as clean as the operating room the killer had intended it to be marissa bonpaine had been savaged in a manner i now found uncomfortably familiar throat slash abdominal mutilations sexual posturing a single deep trapezoidal wound just above the pubic bone could be considered geometrical though the edges were rough death from shock and blood loss no bluntforce head wound i supposed fusco would attribute that to the killers escalating confidence and the seclusion of the spot wanting bonpaine conscious wanting her to watch to suffer taking his time i checked the girls physical dimensions foureleven one hundred one tiny easy to subdue without knocking her out what caught my eye wasnt any of that after three hours of wading in gore and sadism id grown sadly habituated id noticed something glinting against the brown cushion of forest detritus several feet to the right of marissa bonpaines frail left hand something shiny enough to catch the miserly light filtering through the dense conifer ceiling and bounce it back i flipped pages till i found the police report a hiker had found the body forest rangers and law enforcement personnel from three departments had conducted a twohundredyard grid search and listed their findings under crime scene inventory one hundred eightythree retrieved items mostly trashempty cans and bottles broken sunglasses a can opener rotted paper cigarette buttstobacco and cannabisanimal skeletons solid lead buckshot two copperjacketed bullets ballistically analyzed but deemed unimportant because marissa bonpaines body bore no gunshot wounds three pairs of insectinfested hiking boots and other discarded clothing had been studied by the crime lab and dated well before the murder halfway down the list there it was csi item childs toy hypodermic manu tommitoy taiwan orig component of ubethedoctor kit imported location ground m from victims i hand no prints no organic residue no residue might have indicated recent placement but the rain might have just washed any residue away i read the rest of the bonpaine documents no sign anyone had considered the toy a review of all the other washington cases revealed no other medical toys marissa bonpaine was the last of the washington victims her body had been found july but the abduction was believed to have occurred around june more pageflipping michael burke had received his md on june graduation party im a doctor heres my needle im the doctor stethoscope hypodermic one broken the other intact i knew what milo would say cute but so what maybe he was righthed been too damn right so farand the injector was nothing more than a piece of trash left by some kid whod hiked through the forest with his parents still it made me wonder a message always messages to marissa im the doctor to mate im the doctor and youre not i reread fuscos notes no mention of the toy maybe id mention it to milo if he and i had the chance to talk soon i flipped back to the front of the first volume the various incarnations of michael burke studied every feature of every photo a song danced through my headgetting to know you getting to know all about youbut burke remained a stranger highiq psychopath lustkiller master euthanist comforter of terminally ill women brutalizer of healthy females compartmentalizing it helped in murder as well as politics maybe in real estate as well the world of distressed properties milo had his prime witness and i had two toys still the wounds fit and milo had asked me to study the files youre out of business im in when wed questioned alice zoghbie wed asked her about confederates and shed just about admitted they existed but refused to go further poohpoohed the chance anyone close to mate could have savaged him eldon was brilliant he wouldnt have trusted just anyone but mate wouldve loved the idea of the md sidekick another boost to his respectabilitysupervising an internship in cellular cessation zoghbie was worth another try shed worshiped mate would want to punish his murderer now i had a name to throw her a general physical description could observe her reaction what risk was there id call her later this morning worst case shed tell me to go to hell best case id learn something maybe make some progress revealing a new suspect someone other than richard anyone but richard stretching out on the old leather sofa i covered myself with a woolen throw stared up at the ceiling knowing id never fall back asleep when i awoke it was just after seven and robin was standing over me what a guy she said moves out to the couch even when he hasnt misbehaved she sat perched on the edge of the cushion smoothed my hair morning i said she looked at the file cramming for the big test what can i say always been a grind and look where its gotten you where fame fortune me rise and shine fix yourself up so i can take care of youi seem to be doing that a lot lately dont i showering and shaving provided a veneer of humanness but my stomach recoiled at the idea of breakfast and i sat watching as robin ate toast and eggs and grapefruit we shared a pleasant half hour and i thought i pulled off amiable pretty well when she left for the studio it was eight and i turned on the morning news recap of the doss story but no new facts at i phoned alice zoghbie and heard the taped greeting from her machine just as i hung up my service rang in morning dr delaware i have a joseph safer on the phone richards lawyer put him on doctor joe safer im a criminaldefense attorney representing your patient richard doss mellow baritone slow pace but no faltering the voice of an older mandeliberate grandfatherly comforting hows richard doing i said weell said safer hes still incarcerated so i dont imagine hes doing too well but that should be resolved by this afternoon paperwork not to be paranoid doctor but i do wonder if the boys in blue havent slowed things down a bit god forbid are you a religious man doctor doesnt everyone invoke god when times get rough he chuckled how true anyway the reason im calling is once richard does get out he would like to speak with you about his children how to best get them through this of course i said terrific well be in touch cheerful as if planning a picnic whats in store for him mr safer call me joe weell thats hard to say we both enjoy the privilege of confidentiality here so ill be a bit forthcoming i dont believe the police have anything one might judge as seriously incriminating unless something turns up during the search and i dont expect it will doctor youve got more latitude than i in terms of your confidentiality what do you mean unless your patient poses a tarasoff risk youre not obligated to divulge anything i on the other hand there are questions i dont ask letting me know he didnt want to know if his client was guilty that i should keep my mouth shut if i knew i understand i said splendid well then talk about stacy and eric for a moment they seem like nice children bright extremely bright thats evident even under the circumstances but troubledtheyd have to be im glad youre on board if therapys called for there may be a problem with that erics furious with me convinced im aligned with the police i can understand that because i am friends with one of the milo sturgis said safer a very effective investigatorim well aware of your friendship with mr sturgis commendable what is a heterosexual man enjoying a friendship with a homosexual man one of my sons was gay he taught me a lot about having an open mind i didnt learn quickly enough past tense his voice had dropped in pitch and volume impetuous youth he continued im referring to eric i have five of my own thirteen grandchildren four of my own to be truthful my boy daniel passed on last year his diagnosis sped up my learning curve im sorry oh it was terrible doctor your lifes never the same but enough of that in terms of erics recalcitrance ill have a talk with the boy as will richard what about stacy i dont have as much of a feel for her she sits there while eric does all the talking reminds me of my daniel he was my firstborn always a peacemakerhis siblings ambassador to their mother and me when things got rough i heard him sigh stacys a good kid i said my primary patient in the family i had only one session with eric and not a complete one the police showed up before we were through and took richard away yes dreadful rather cossacklike behavior weell thank you for your time dr delaware take care of yourself youre needed here chapter thursday at am i called alice zoghbie got the same taped message fifteen minutes later i caught a newsbreak different reporter same ivegotascoop smile another backdrop that i recognized the woman amber breckenham claims that in addition haiselden regularly abused her and her daughter during their relationship were here at haiseldens house where neighbors say he hasnt been seen for well over a week at the moment this remains a civil case and no word has come down from lapd as to whether a criminal investigation will be pursued from westwood with another bizarre twist on the murder of death doctor eldon mate im dana almodovar onthespot news shift to the weather report hazy skies low sixties to midseventies for the fortieth day in a row i played with the remote finally found a complete story on one of the networks specializing in lurid amber breckenham thirtyfour the manager of one of roy haiseldens laundromats in baldwin park had filed a civil suit against her former boss a shot of breckenham walking into court with her attorney showed a tall thickly built bleached blonde holding her hand was a darkhaired girl eleven or twelve the child kept her head down but someone called her namelauretteand she looked up just long enough for the camera to capture a glimpse of pretty african features and straightened hair brushed back from a high smooth brow breckenhams story was that shed had a sevenyear affair with haiselden during which time hed claimed to be investing her money but had in fact embezzled furthermore hed abused her physically and intimidated laurette psychologically the suit was for five million dollars most of it punitive damages haiseldens reason for cutting town scratch one murder suspect but if amber breckenhams charges were true it indicated mate had been less than a sterling judge of character had he misjudged fatally or had choosing joanne doss been his big mistake and what had been joannes mistakethe sin if there was one that had caused her to turn herself into the creature in erics polaroid i left the house drove to the u for my second trip to the research library in as many days only one reference to joannes death a page story in the times body found in desert motel attributed to dr mates machine lancaster a motel maid entering to clean a room at the happy trails motel on the outskirts of this high desert community discovered the fully clothed body of a pacific palisades woman early yesterday morning while no sightings of death doctor eldon mates van in the vicinity have been reported toxicologic analysis of the blood of joanne doss indicating the presence of two drugs used consistently by the selfstyled euthanist as well as puncture marks suggesting intravenous injection and the absence of forced entry or struggle have led sheriffs detectives to suspect assisted suicide lead investigator david graham stated she looked peaceful classical music was playing on the radio and shed eaten a last meal from what i understand dr mate encourages his patients to listen to music ms doss married to a businessman and the mother of two was reported to have suffered from deteriorating health and would be the fortyeighth person whose death mate has facilitated given mates success in avoiding conviction and most recently his indictment authorities say it is unlikely criminal charges will be filed no followup not even an obituary for joanne no attempt by mate to claim credit maybe id missed something i spent another half hour combing the data banks not a single additional line on joanne dosss final night because by victim number fortyeight mate and the humanitron were no longer news mate had hooked two additional travelers to his machine before ending up in the van himself the van when had he stopped using motels using mates name as a keyword and limiting my search to three months before and after joannes death i pulled up three references traveler fortyseven seven weeks before joanne maria quillen sixtythree terminal ovarian cancer her body deposited at the front door of the county morgue wrapped in a frilly pink comforter mates business card tucked into the folds driven in the rented van where mate had helped her die mate informed the press of the details number fortynine one month after joanne alberta jo johnson fiftyfour muscular dystrophy a black woman the papers specified mates first african american as if her death represented a new variant of affirmative action her corpse had been left at the charles drew medical center in south la similarly wrapped another van job another statement by dr mate now my pulse was racing i found the fiftieth traveler a man named brenton spear lou gehrigs van press conference three people with definitive diagnoses three van jobs three public statementsmate chasing the press because i was right he loved the attention no word out of him on joanne no van joannes death didnt fit i kept searching till i found the last time hed used a motel number thirtynine a full two years before joanne another lou gehrigs patient reynolds dobson dispatched in a cowboy inn up near fresno i reread the account of joannes final night no sightings of mate in the vicinity attribution to mate because circumstances had pointed to him cheap motel the risk of a traumatized maid after nearly a years success with motor vehicles it didnt make sense mate hadnt taken credit for joanne because he knew he didnt deserve it then why hadnt he come out and denied his involvement because that would have made him look foolish displaced someone horning in a new dr death just as id guessed broken stethoscope someonemichael burke making his grand entry by bathing himself in the blood of his predecessor hacking off mates manhood you could deny freud had ever existed and still understand that but how had joanne gotten in contact with the person whod accompanied her to the happy trails motel maybe i had it all wrong and mate had known had allowed his apprentice to strike out on his own i considered that joanne ready to die calling mate and talking instead to an underlinglets say burke mate supervising judging burkes readiness unaware burke was already an expert in the fine art of cellular cessation then i remembered michael burkes affinity for older seriously ill womenpatients he met in hospitalsand a whole different scenario flashed joanne shuffled from doctor to doctor enduring batteries of medical tests mris cat scans lumbar punctures procedures carried out in hospitals i pictured her bloated painracked regressed to silence waiting in yet another antiseptic waiting room for the next round of indignities as people in white coats hurried by no one noticing her then someone did a charming helpful young man md on his badge but he took the time to talk how wonderful to finally encounter a doctor who actually talked or perhaps burke had been more than a dropin maybe hed actually carried out some of the tests working as a technician because he hadnt figured out a way yet to bogus a new medical diploma but was wellqualified to obtain a paramedical job either way i needed to learn where joanne had been evaluated richard could tell me but richard was indisposed bob manitow would also know but there was no reason to think hed even take my call whatever the reason for his antipathy his wife didnt share it id phone judy find some pretense for asking about joannes hospital experienceswanting to know more so i could help the kids especially now that richard was in jail id also try to learn more about the stress fractures that had worked their way through the doss family maybe her family as well about why her husband was so angry better a facetoface a chance to read nonverbal cues could i get judy out of chambers long enough she and i had always been cordial and id come through for her on lots of tough cases now shed landed me in the toughest one of all and i was ready to tell her so i called her number at superior court expecting someone to tell me the judge was in trial instead she picked up herself youre calling about richard the police took him away at my house eric and stacy were there youre kidding why would they do that orders from above i said they see richard as a prime suspect for mate have you heard anything around the courthouse no she said just what was on the news bob and i were in newport for the evening never looked at the tv didnt find out about it till last night when we drove home and saw the police cars at richards house i just cant believe this alex it makes no sense richard as a murderer pause richard doing something so stupid on the other hand i said he did despise mate wasnt shy about expressing it you think hes guilty just playing devils advocate i dont allow those in my court seriously alex if richard was up to no good why would he advertise it all that tough talk was just richard being richard spouting off attributing blame hes always been a big blamer who else did he blame besides mate no one in particularits just his overall style being dominant the truth is richards always been a difficult personand yes he does have a vindictive streak you should hear him talk about how he destroys business rivals but this no it just doesnt make sense he has too much to losehold on fifteensecond hold alex theyre waiting for me got to go could we talk more judy what about eric and stacy with all this going on i really need all the data i can get if you could spare me an hour id greatly appreciate it i i just dont know what i can tell you that hasnt already been said brittle laughter some referral huh ill bet from now on youre not going to return my calls quite so quickly ill always take your referrals judy whys that because you give a damn oh come on she said dont get all sugary on me im just a judicial hack putting in my time i dont think so thats very kind of you now she sounded sad just an hour use that egg timer you pull out when attorneys go on too long she laughed again youve heard about that ive seen it the jenkins case oh yeah good old mr and mrs jenkins that one deserved an egg timer with a sonic alarm okay let me check my calendar here theres so much scrawl i can barely make it out sooner rather than later if possible judy hold again another female voice in the background her clerk doriss contralto judys soprano reply the husbands lawyer is trying to pull shtick time to whip him into shape okay how about dinner tonight ive got a ton of reports to do will be working late anyway bobs taking becky to the cliffside so im flexible how about someplace on my way homegrun in westwood thats not far from youeightthirty tonight grun it is thanks judy i really appreciate it oh yes she said im quite the saint chapter westwood village as those who live nearby are quick to point out used to be a nice place once a highend shopping district for a highend residential area a twist of charmingly curving streets lined with singlestory brick buildings the village has devolved into a confused tangle of neon and chrome weekends pulsating with noise fastfood joints ejaculating gusts of grease and sugar some of that was inevitable dominating the north end of the village is the landgrant sprawl of the u perched like a hungry bear the encroachment stretches beyond campus borders as the university pounces on vacant offices and builds parking lots student sensibilities means multiplex theaters uprint tshirt shops discount record stores jeans emporiums student budgets means burgers not beluga when a grizzly lolls near a trout stream guess who gets eaten but there are other beasts at work developers aiming to squeeze every dollar out of dirt building up up up beyond beyond beyond lunching and boozing and bribing their way past zoning restrictions people like richard as token appeasements to the neighbors some of the highrise barons bring in pricey restaurants grun was one of those set on the top floor of a heartless black glass rhomboid on the north end of glendon the latest creation of a german celebrity chef with his own brand of frozen dinners id been there once the lunch guest of an overeager personalinjury lawyer allegedly healthful dining formed of unlikely ethnic melds prices that kept out the middle class waiters in pink shirts and khakis who launched into a worldweary robotic recitation of the daily specials as if it were another audition what happened to all the kids who didnt break into pictures i drove down hilgard passing sorority houses to the west the us botanical garden to the east made it to the restaurant in ten minutes i live close to the village but i rarely venture into the cacophony a redjacketed valet lounged by the curb i squeezed in between two porsche boxsters and the attendant examined the seville as if it were a museum piece i was inside by eightthirty on the nose the hostess was a hollowcheeked lankhaired brunette working hard on a morticia addams act judy manitow hadnt arrived it took a while to get tishs attention and figure out that the jtj in the reservation book stood for judy the judge tish directed me to the bar i looked over her shoulder at the halfempty dining room and gave my best boyish grin she sighed and fluttered her lashes and allowed me to trail her to a corner table halfempty but noisy sound waves caroming against bleached wood walls ostentatiously distressed plank floors and mockwormwood ceiling beams where plaster had been applied it was an unhealthy sunburn pink iron tables covered in rose linen chairs sheathed in dark green suedette tish stopped midway in our trek sighed again turned rotated her neck as if warming up for a workout i just love the way the light hits the room from this spot fantastic lights camera action cut the table was barely big enough for solitaire a couple of waiters loitered nearby but neither made a move toward me finally a hispanic busboy came over and asked if i wanted something to drink i said id wait and he thanked me and brought water ten minutes later judy breezed in looking harried she wore a formfitting plumcolored knit suit the skirt ending two inches above her knees and matching pumps with precarious heels her creamcolored handbag had a sparkly clasp that functioned like a headlight and as she approached at powerwalk speed i thought of a little hot rod she looked even thinner than i remembered facial bones expressing themselves sharply under an ashblond tennisfriendly cap of hair sparkles flashed at her neck too and on both hands as she got closer she saw me wiggled two fingers and picked up speed playing a castanet solo on the plank floor hips swiveling calves defined the waiters exchanged appreciative glances as they followed her and i wondered if they thought they had her figured out goodlooking wealthy woman out for a night on the town little chance shed be pegged as a presiding superior court judge i stood to greet her and she pecked my cheek when i held her chair she acted as if she was used to it good to see you again alex though im sure wed both rather it be under different circumstances one of the loitering waiters came over smiled at judy opened his mouth before he could speak she said gin and tonic sapphire gin and no bruising please he pouted and his eyes found their way over to me sir iced tea very good as he walked away judy said veddy good im so glad the children approve she laughed too loud too much edge i dont know why i suggested this place bob and i never come anymore pardon me alex im feeling mean need time to wind down and get human thats one good thing about the drive from downtown if you dont succumb to road rage theres plenty of time to decompress rough day in court i said is it ever sweetness and light no nothing extraordinary just the usual parade of people with unsolvable problems when things are fairly calm on the outside i have no problem with any of it but today she fingered a diamond ring on her left hand big round solitaire in a platinum setting her right hand sported a cocktail pieceyellow diamonds and sapphires formed into a marigold i still cant believe this mess with richard did you have a chance to see eric and stacy after they took him away i saw them briefly at the station but didnt have a chance to talk to them richards lawyerjoseph safer called me this morning and told me he expected to get richard out by today and that richard would be calling me to talk im still waiting it had been a day for waiting and guesswork if a hypothesis is formed in the forest and no ones there to after returning from the library id gone over fuscos file again no new insights no new messages from anyone i hadnt run for a couple of days forced myself to do it ended up in the mountains for a long time got home still wired did some pushups showered drank water at six despite the dinner appointment with judy i broiled two steaks and baked a couple of idahos steak with robin i figured on a salad with judy light and healthful me what a social butterfly the drinks came judy raised her glass inspected the contents and sipped joe safer is a princeim not being sarcastic the ideal defense attorney kindly demeanor combined with the singlemindedness of a psychopath if i were in trouble id want him to talk for me her blue eyes clouded for a moment she drank some more and they seemed to clear ah she said this hits the spot i dont ingest enough poison too temperate too weightconscious you she smiled when i was sixteen i weighed a hundred and ninetyseven pounds in high school i was a total slug to be accurate i was repugnant walking two steps exhausted me another sip i guess thats why i could empathize with joanne up to a point up to a point i said only up to a point angry squint lets just say that where she ended up was a whole different planet she drank more licked her lips its hard to imagine someone deciding to eat herself into a stupor oh she said joanne was full of surprises such as another squint just that and unlike me she started off thin her voice had filled with anger and i decided to veer away when in doubt show personal interest howd you take off the weight i said the oldfashioned way deprivation selfdenial has become my lifestyle alex she ran her finger around the rim of the glass theres no other way is there selfdenial fighting she said most people lack the will thats why we spend gazillions on the socalled war on drugs preach about smoking and eating too much fat but never make any progress people will never stop getting high people will take comfort where they find it another laugh some talk for a judge huh anyway i take care of myself for health not cosmetics i keep my family healthy your girls are pretty athletic arent they what makes you say that i seem to recall pictures in your officeoutdoor sports my what a memory she said yes ali and becky like to sail and ski and theyre trim now but both of them have a tendency to pudge lousy genetics bob and i were both lumpy kids i stay on them its easier now that theyve discovered boys she sat back they both have thank goodness does that sound terrible perfectionistic mom im sure you care about them that was shamelessly nonjudgmental alex were diametric opposites arent we i get paid to do precisely what you avoid the waiter approached and asked if she wanted a refill not at this point she said the doctor here will have a look at the menu but i know what i want the tender greens salad everything chopped very fine no dried apricots or olives or nuts dressing on the side ill have the same i said but leave in the nuts the waiter glanced at his list of specials and walked away looking miffed judy said leave in the nuts funny soyou have no idea how eric and stacy are coping im sure its rough for them any further thoughts about richard do i think hes capable of soliciting murder alex you know as well as i do that no one can ever really fathom what goes on in someones head so yes i suppose its theoretically possible that richard tried to have mate killed but the way they said he did it sounds so damn stupid and richards anything but joanne was brilliant too her face tightened tiny lines softened by makeup and indirect lighting appeared all over the surface of her skin a woman cracking yes she was i wont profess to understand why she did the things she did i waited for the stress lines to fade they didnt she was gazing into her gin and tonic playing with the stirrer i guess we never really understand anyone do we i said lets assumefor arguments sakethat richard did pay quentin goad why would he hate mate that much she touched a finger to her upper lip massaged looked up at the ceiling perhaps he saw mate as taking away something that belonged to him richard likes his possessions was he especially possessive when it came to joanne more than any other alpha male hes a middleaged man alex hes from a certain generation so he saw joanne as his bob sees me as his if youre asking was richard pathologically jealous i never saw it and joanne chose to exclude him from the most important decision of her life she swiped her lips with her napkin meaning meaning i dont understand much about this family judy neither do i she said very softly neither do i the restaurant din nearly blocked out the sound and i realized i was reading her lips have you ever met richards parents no she said they never visited as far as i know and richard never talked about them why grabbing any fact i can eric told me hes greeksicilian i suppose i was aware of thatjoanne mustve said something or one of the kids did but i cant recall richard ever making a thing about it i never saw grape leaves in the house or anything like that she looked and sounded tired as if talking about the doss family drained her i said as friends and neighbors they must have been a challenge what do you mean she said in the same sharp tone id heard her use on an errant lawyer theyre the kind of people to whom things happen when i spoke to bob about joannes diagnosis he sounded pretty frustrated about joannes condition did he she said absently she gazed around the room a few more tables had filled thats just bob being bob he prides himself on being analytic identify the problem cut it out which he couldnt do with joanne no he couldnt she stirred the drink eyes down again stress lines deeper bob seems to feel her illness was all emotional depression i said she looked over at a table to the right two couples seated a few minutes ago laughing drinking she summoned the waiter over ordered another gin and tonic do you agree i said with what that it was all emotional im not a doctor alex i couldnt begin to fathom joannes motivation another glance at the happiness nearby in terms of eric and stacy eric and stacy are going to cope and move on right thats why i sent stacy to you her second drink came we traded courtroom stories and i listened to her go on about municipal politics the das inability to collect child support that enabled me to steer the conversation back where i wanted it they couldnt get mate either she stirred gin nodded im not sure mate was happy about that i said no more prime time yes he was a grandstander wasnt he the interesting thing is judy he never took credit for joannes death never even tried and its the only case i could find where that was true shed been holding the glass in midair lowered it slowly youve been researching the police assumed mate had assisted joanne but they never confirmed it id say its a pretty good assumption alex her body was full of those chemicals mate used our salads arrived big plate of what looked like lawn shavings a few cashews on mine my belly was still filled with steak and nothing had transpired to spark my appetite i pushed leaves around judy aimed her fork at a cherry tomato tried to stab it but it rolled out from under the tines for a split second fury darkened her face talking about the dosses had been an ordeal she speared a speck of lettuce even if richard was stupid enough to give money to that loser the loser backed out im hoping he didnt try again after we spoke i asked around so far nothing beyond solicitation have you heard anything to the contrary no i said passion alex it makes people do crazy things richard was passionate about joanne i suppose he was peeling back her sleeve she glanced at the lady rolex here comes the egg timer i said she smiled im sorry alex im very tirednot hungry either is there anything else id like to know more about eric just what i told you the first time a genius perfectionistic dominant personality stacy said he and ali dated pause yes they did year ago ali said he was a bit of a control freaknothing weird he just proved too intense for her she broke it off stacy had said eric had severed the relationship teenage soap opera did it matter i said he sounds a lot like richard hes richards boy all the way like a little nuclear weapon with legs and stacy youre stacys therapist what do you think was she distant from joanne why do you ask that because it was eric who spent time with joanne during her last days she pushed her plate away alex i think youve gotten the wrong idea about the dosses and us we were friends neighbors lunched at the cliffside but for the most part they kept their problems to themselves and we lived our own life richard told bob that stacy seemed to be drifting from the little i saw she seemed a bit depressed so i sent her to you thats all there is i cant carry any more on my shoulders im sorry i havent been more helpful but thats all there is she got up marched to our waiter who was talking with a colleague stood there for a few seconds then said something that caused his head to retract as if hed been bitten he stalked away and she returned finished her drink while standing snotty little bastard im waiting to tell him were ready for the check hes discussing his latest audition looking off to one side the object of her wrath raced over flung the check at the table and fled judy reached for it but i got there first what she said bribing the judge thanking the judge for her time i said thats all ive given you she said time heat no light her lexus had been left at the curb and i waited for her to drive away as i waited for the seville i tried to make sense out of the last half hour shed arrived at the restaurant looking strained more tense than id ever seen herand each of my questions seemed to yank her psyches drawstring tighter before she left she warned off further inquiry so id opened some kind of wound but had no idea what it was no chance to get to the topic of hospitals no way to work it into the conversation id watched her in court seen her handle the toughest of cases with aplomb so this was something personal the closest shed gotten to autobiography was selfloathing about her teenage obesity i was repugnant but if that related to the dosses i was missing the connection i cant carry any more on my shoulders burdened by the dosses as was her husband bob expressing it as anger because he was a man of a certain generation some kind of intimacy gone terribly bad bob jealous of richard and joanne in the pooldid it all reduce to another sleazy suburban couples swap and had that related in some way to joannes decline something richard couldnt forgive her for guilt and expiation had eric found out eric and allison breaking up becky in therapy eating disorders poor grades joanne quitting as tutor stacy losing focus eric dropping out bob enraged judy on the edge joanne dead put together a certain way i could make it sound like a psychopathology stew even so what did it have to do with mates corpse stretched out in the back of a van geometry on flesh why hadnt mate taken credit for joanne the seville screeched to a halt and the attendant held my door with an expression that said i didnt deserve it driving away i went over it again finally decided id wasted my time and judys most certainly damaged my relationship with the presiding judge of family court another day another triumph the car was low on gas and i filled up at a station on wilshire used the pay phone near the mens room to call my service joseph safer had phoned five minutes earlier from the dosses home number richard answered hoarse quieter than usual doctorhold on a second later safers melodious voice flowed through the receiver doctor thanks so much for getting back promptly whats up richard and the children are home richard arrived four hours ago but i waited until the hubbub died down before i called you press hubbub press police what youd expect as far as i can tell everyones departed with the exception of a single unmarked police car parked down the block occupied by the two gentlemen who accosted richard at your home as a matter of fact korn and demetri on buttnumbing duty so milo had regained at least some of the upper hand not too subtle i said weell safer chuckled cossacks arent generally known for subtlety did they search the house they threatened to said safer were disputing their contentions urging the judge to exercise some restraint i realize its an imposition at this hourhowever if you could find time to come over to chat with richard and the children that would be marvelous at the house i could bring them to your office but with all theyve been through no thats fine i said ill be right over chapter safer gave me directions to the house west on sunset past the pacific palisades shopping district a mile beyond the old will rogers estate then a quick turn north twenty minutes or so from the village just as close to my home in all the time id spent with the dosses id never seen them in their natural surroundings back when i was an intern at western peds i found time to make house calls school visits after i got licensed i rarely ventured from the comfort of my own furniture was i nothing more than a primatologist deluding himself that he understood chimps because hed observed them scratching and swinging behind the bars of zoo cages house calls were impractical practicality could be confining now id have the chance to stretch i found the turnoff easily enough and sped up a very dark street that climbed into the palisades no sidewalks front lawns the size of small parks walls and gates and talkboxes nightblack shrubbery towering cascades of oldgrowth trees close enough to the ocean to feel the breeze and smell the brine were ugly september mornings better up here i caught glimmers of moonblanched water between the bulk of big houses as i continued the properties got wider offered broader glimpses of pacific now i was high enough to see all of the moon gravid and low the sky was a cloudless indigo comforter very few cars were parked on the street and the unmarked fifty yards up was as inconspicuous as a roach on a fridge i sped by vaguely aware of two heads in front not bothering to notice if korn or demetri made me assuming they had now i was a notation in the murder book i cruised looked for the address safer had given me wondered which neighboring structure housed the manitows dreams and nightmares richards monument to success turned out to be a twostory monterey colonial pale and ambitious above a hillock of ryegrass spacious enough to host several clusters of trees coconut palms canary island pines lemon eucalyptus pittosporum all prettified by clean white lighting that created herbal sculpture meticulous flower beds kissed the front of the house lights from within turned curtained windows amber the lack of wall and gate implied openness welcome so much for architectural cues stacys mustang sat in the driveway in front of a silver cadillac fleetwood of a size no longer manufactured no sign of richards black bmw perhaps the auto warrant had gone through and the vehicle was being raked and combed and vacuumed and luminoled in some forensic garage i pulled in behind the caddy its plates read shyster a bouquet canyon rock pathway snaked to a heavy door banded with handforged iron before i got to the entrance the door opened and a rabbi gazed out at me a tall rangy blacksuited yarmulked graybearded rabbi in his sixties the beard was clipped square and blocked the knot of his silvergray tie the suit was doublebreasted and tailored he stood with his hands behind his back and rocked his presence threw me the dosses were greeksicilian not jewish the rabbi said doctor joe safer one hand appeared we shook and safer motioned me into a chandeliered entry hall guarded by a pair of blueandwhite vases as high as my shoulder an ironrailed staircase swept upward to the second story safer and i walked under it and continued to another vestibule bottomed by a crimson persian runner that fed into a wide bright hallway to the left was a dining room papered in blue and set up with plumcolored rosewood furniture that looked old across the foyer was a highceilinged living room ivory ceiling cream silk sofas cherrywood floors if the neutral tones had been designed to show off what was on the walls they worked case after case of brassframed mirrorbacked glassedin etageres customfit to the crown molding glass shelves so clear they were rendered nearly invisible what rested upon them appeared suspended in midair just as milo had described hundreds of bowls chargers ewers jars shapes i couldnt identify each piece spotlit and gleaming one side wall of more blue and white the other filled with simplelooking graygreen pieces the widest expanse populated by a porcelain bestiary horses and camels and dogs and fantastic bateared creatures that resembled the spawn of a dragon with a monkey all dappled in beautifully dripping mixtures of blue green and chartreuse human figurines rode some of the horses on a sevenfoot coffee table sat what looked like a miniature temple glazed with the same multicolored splotch something eh said safer richard informs me that those animals are all tang dynasty over a thousand years old they pull them up out of graves in china beautifully preserved quite remarkable wouldnt you say quite brave keeping them here i said given the seismic risks safer stroked his beard and pushed his yarmulke back on his head his hair was an iron gray crew cut specked with red i still couldnt get rid of the rabbinical image remembered his comment about the death of his gay son his diagnosis sped my learning curve his eyes were graygreen borderline warm like many tall men he stooped richards a courageous man he said the children are courageous lets go see them we continued through the center hallway black carpeting muffled our steps as we passed more brass cases monochrome bowls of every color the mirror backs reflecting chinese inscriptions on white bases tiny mudcolored figurines shelves of potters creations in white and cream and gray more of that pale clean green that i decided i liked best a row of closed doors two more at the rear safer beckoned me through the one that was open cathedral ceiling black leather sofas and chairs black grand piano filling a corner through a wall of french doors an aqua pool and greenlit foliage beyond the chlorinated water palm fringes and the hint of ocean the seating faced rosewood bookshelves filled with hardcovers a bang olufsen stereo system a seventyinch tv laserdisc machine other amusements on an upper shelf four family photos three of richard and the kids a single portrait of joanne as a smiling young woman richard sat upright on the largest of the sofas unshaven sleeves rolled to the elbows kinky hair ragged pulledat as if birds had attacked seeking nesting material he wore the usual allblack and blended so thoroughly with the couch that his body contours were obscured it made him seem very smalllike a growth that had sprouted from the upholstery youre here he said sounding half asleep thanks i took an armchair and richard gazed up at joe safer safer said ill go see how the kids are doing and left richard picked something out of the corner of his mouth sweat beads ringed his hairline when safers footsteps had faded completely he said they say hes the best staring past me this is our family room beautiful house i said so ive been told what happened i said any way he took that would be fine he didnt answer kept his gaze above mefocused on the blank tv as if waiting for the set to come on by itself and feed him some form of enlightenment so he said finally here we are what can i do for you richard safer says anything i tell you is confidential unless you think im a direct threat to someone else thats true im no threat to anyone good he jammed his fingers in his hair tugged at the wiry strands still lets keep it hypothetical for the sake of all concerned keep what hypothetical i said the situation say a persona man by no means a stupid man but not infalliblesay he falls prey to an impulse and does something stupid what impulse the drive to attain closure not a smart move in fact its the single stupidest most insane thing hes ever done in his life but hes not in his right mind because events have changed him in the past hes lived a life full of expectations thats not to say hes wedded to optimism of all people he knows things dont always work out according to plan hes earned a living understanding that but still after all these years of building establishing hes done very well gotten sucked in by the trap of rising expectations feels he has a right to some degree of comfort then he learns differently he shrugged whats done is done his acting on impulse i said he sucked in breath gave a sick smile hes not in his right mind lets leave it at that crossing his legs he sat back as if giving me time to digest i had a pretty good idea what he was up to working on a diminishedcapacity defense safers advice or his own idea temporary insanity i said if it comes to that the only problem is because hes so screwed up in the process he may have upset his kids his own peccadilloes he can deal with but his kids he needs help with that murderforhire as a peccadillo i said do the kids know what hes done he hasnt told them but theyre smart kids they may have figured it out may have he nodded i said does he intend to tell them he doesnt see the point of that so he wants someone else to tell them no he said suddenly raising his voice a splash of rose seeped from under his shirt collar and climbed to his earlobes vivid as a portwine stain he definitely does not want that that is not the issue helping them through the process is ihe needs someone to tide them over until things settle down he expects things to settle down i said he smiled circumstances dictate optimism so do we have an understanding of the issues at hand no knowledge provided to the kids holding their hands until their father is out of trouble sounds like highpriced babysitting the flush darkened his entire face his chest heaved and his eyes began to bulge the surge of color made me draw back defensively its the kind of thing you see in people who have a serious problem with anger i thought of erics outburst in the victims room at the station new side of richard before this hed been unfailingly contentious sometimes irritable but always cool he worked at cooling off now placing one hand on the arm of the sofa cupping a knee with the other as if hastening selfrestraint ticking off the seconds with his index finger ten ticks later he said all right in the tone youd use with a slow learner well call it babysitting welltrained wellpaid babysitting the main thing is the kids get what they need until things settle down dont worry he said they will the funny thing is despite his poor judgment he didnt actually do anything soliciting murders not nothinghypothetically speaking his eyelids drooped he got up stepped closer to my chair i smelled mint on his breath cologne putrid sweat nothing happened okay i said nothing this person learned from his mistake and didnt try again he aimed a finger gun down at me bingo easy tone but the flush had lingered he stood there finally returned to the sofa okay then we have a meeting of the minds what exactly do you want me to tell your kids richard that everythings going to be fine making no attempt to steer it back to thirdperson theoretical that i may be indisposed for a while but only temporarily they need to know that im the only parent they have left they need me and i need you to facilitate all right i said but we should also be looking for other sources of support are there any family members who could no he said no one my mothers dead and my fathers ninetytwo and living in a home in new jersey what about joannes side nothing he said both of her parents are gone and she was an only child besides i dont need meddling laymen i need a professional not a bad deal for you ill start paying you the way i pay saferdriving time thinking time every billable second i didnt answer he said why do we have this thing you and i everything turns into a pushandpull lots of answers to that one none good i said richard we have a meeting of the minds on one point my role is helping stacy and eric but i need to be honest with you i have no magic to offer them informations my armament i need to be equipped oh for gods sake he said what do you want from me confession expiation expiation i said eric used that word too his mouth opened shut the flush drained from his face now hed paled eric has a good vocabulary its not a topic you and he have discussed why the hell would it be i was just wondering if eric had some reason to feel guilty what the hell about thats what im asking i said feeling more like a lawyer crossexamining than a therapist easing pain he was right this was our script and i was as much a player as he no he said erics fine erics a great kid he slumped rubbed his eyes half disappeared into the couch and i began to feel sorry for him then i thought of him passing cash to quentin goad in the name of closure so theres nothing particular on erics mind his mother destroyed herself his father got hauled in by the gestapo now what could be on his mind he resumed staring at the tv screen whats the problem here do you resent us because weve made it did you grow up poor do you resent rich kids does having to deal with them day in and day out because theyre the ones who pay your bills piss you off is that the reason you wont help us my sigh was involuntary he said okay okay sorry that was out of line its been a rough time all im asking for is some help with eric and stacy if i wasnt so close to the situation i could deal with it myself at least i have the insight to know my limitations right how many parents can you say that of footsteps sounded from above someone walking pacing stopping the kids on the second floor i said no stonewall richard im here for eric and stacy are you in any state to answer a few questions about joanne what about joanne basic history at what hospital did she take her medical tests st michaels why i may want to look at her medical records same question im still trying to understand what was wrong with her her medical records wont tell you a damn thing he said thats the point the doctors didnt know and what does joannes illness have to do with the current situation it may have something to do with eric and stacy i said as i said i run on information may i have a release from you to look at her records sure sure safer can give it to you i signed over power of attorney to him while i was indisposed now how about going up to talk to my kids please bear with me i said after joanne died you called mate but he never called you back did i tell you that no judy did when she made the referral judy he swiped at his brow with the back of his hand well judys correct i did try not once several times the bastard never gave me the courtesy he didnt throw a press conference regarding joanne either his eyes slitted so publicity seemed to be a motive for him youve got that right he said he was a scumsucking publicity hound but dont ask me to explain what he did and didnt do to me he was a name in the papers easy to erase i said one other discrepancy by the time joanne contacted mate hed already shifted from motels to vans yet joanne died in a motel would there have been some reason for her to insist upon that some reason for her to travel to lancaster she was never there he said never at the motel never in lancaster he laughed sudden bitter incongruous laughter not till that night it was a thing between us i was out there all the time did several projects there building shopping centers turning shit into gold used to copter from the municipal bank building to palmdale drive the rest of the way spent so many goddamn hours there i used to feel i was made of sand joanne never saw any of it i used to ask herbeg her to drive out just once in a while join me for lunch see what we were accomplishing i told her the desert could be beautiful when you looked at it a certain way we could find some good cheap eats go casualgoddamn pizza hut or something like when we were broke and dating no way she always turned me down said it was too far to drive too much traffic too dry too hot too busy there was always a reason he laughed again but she ended up there turning to stare at me for once not a combative glare sad pitiful seeking an answer oh jesus he said an abrupt suppressed sob made him choke he bounced once in the sofa as if levitated by pain and slammed back down by fate goddamn her he whispered then he lost the fight and the tears gushed he punched air punched his knees attacked his own chest his shoulder knuckled his eyes hid his face from me fuckin lancaster for that she goes out there oh jesus oh jesus christ he lowered his head between his legs as if about to vomit found no comfort in that position and sprang up running to the wall of french doors where he turned his back on me and cried silently while facing his swimming pool and his land and the faraway ocean she mustve really hated me he said why would she hate you richard for not forgiving her what did she do no he said no more of this dont strip off my skin just let me get through this with my skin on okay i wont try to tell you how to do your job just let it be help my kids please sure i said of course chapter the footsteps from above resumed moments later joe safer knocked on the doorjamb richard was still staring through the glass he turned safer said everything all right joe im really bushed think ill lie down trudging to the sofa richard removed his shoes lined them up at the base of the couch stretched out why dont you go upstairs to bed said safer nah ill just sack out here this is my relaxation spot richard reached for a remote control clicked on seventy inches of the home garden channel someone wearing a plaid shirt and a massive tool belt building a redwood deck making it look as easy as licking an envelope the way those types always do within seconds richard seemed hypnotized ready for the children safer asked me ready i followed him up a rear staircase arranging the file cards in my head guilt expiation i didnt forgive her joanne transgressingprobably exactly what id guessed an affair eric close to his father aligned with his father had joannes transgression led her son to despise her spending time with her as she destroyed herself loving her but also hating her could that explain the polaroids documenting her descenther punishmentthen passing the pictures to richard that level of filial contempt was hard to imagine but eric was explosive and impulsive and he had the genes for it now months later was he coming to grips with what hed done seeking his own expiation richard had just admitted paying quentin goad to murder the death doctor make it look bloody the wrong guy to cheat on with richards need for control how could joanne have expected anything but rejection and retribution attempted murder as closure and if mate hadnt helped joanne die a grand mistake if he hadnt who had doityourself job as a microbiologist joanne had access to lethal chemicals the skills for selfinjection but given her physical condition i couldnt see driving to lancaster by herself she hated me now i had a reason shed died in the happy trails motel so maybe mate had been there agreeing to revert back to rented rooms in order to respect joannes wishes same for the lack of publicity perhaps joanne had requested he keep it quiet for the sake of the kids no that made no sense if shed wanted to shield eric why choose such a conspicuous suicide why kill herself by any means one thing seemed clear mr and mrs doss had suffered through a troubled relationship mrs had sinned and mr had refused to forgive her joanne had bought into richards rage hating herself enough to selfdestruct but she hadnt gone out without a parting shot taking control of the last day of her life contacting mateor someone elseon the sly dying on her own terms lancaster the ultimate screwyou to richard because she knew richard well knew hed try to direct his anger everywhere else and a corpse in a cheap motel would be something he couldnt escape or so shed hoped if funneling richard toward crushing introspection had been joannes goal shed failed miserably as judy had said richard was a blamer and richard liked to crush his adversaries a few minutes before spinning his hypothetical tale hed brushed off the deal with quentin goad as an act of folly denied hed made a second attempt yet hed come prepared with an alibi was already talking about temporary insanity milo would laugh all that off you didnt have to be a detective to laugh it off because richard was a ruthless selfcentered control freak whod believed himself aggrieved and as id just seen richard had a very bad temper now here i was in his house on his terms safer reached the top of the stairs and paused at a small back landing that faced a closed door theyre both in erics room he said would you like to see them together or separately lets see how it goes but together would be okay why he frowned to be frank doctor neither of them wants to be alone with you they still think i betrayed them safer righted his yarmulke im sorry richard talked to them and so did i but you know adolescents i hope this doesnt turn out to be a complete waste of your time or worse i thought safer touched the doorknob but didnt turn it so how did it go with richard richard seems to feel rosy about the future i said rosy the moment i said it i realized it was the same word id thought of upon seeing richards angerflush poor old dr freud wasnt getting enough respect in the age of prozac weell said safer a positive attitude is a good thing wouldnt you say in richards case is it justified one big gnarled hand came forward and smoothed the beard lets put it this way doctor i cant promise to bring everything to a close immediately but im feeling positive as well because when you get down to it what do the police have the johnnycomelately accusations of a habitual felon facing a threestrikes life sentence allegedly corroborative eyewitness testimony about some sort of envelope being handed over to someone by someone else in a poorly lit bar for who knows what purpose i smiled richard just happened to be there safer shrugged richard has no specific memory of that particular meeting but he says if it did occur it was to pay mr goad its customary for him to pay his workers in cash when theyre short of funds altruism i said or good commerce when you deal with excons safer smiled richard employs people no one else wants to hire sometimes helps them out when theyre down i have a long list of other employees wholl testify to his goodwill so the eyewitnesses are a wash i said eyewitnesses he said as if it were a diagnosis im sure youre familiar with the psychological research on the unreliability of eyewitness testimony i wouldnt be surprised if a careful check into the backgrounds of these particular eyewitnesses reveals histories of alcoholism drug abuse criminal behavior and poor lighting that as well sounds openandshut i said overconfidence is dangerous doctor but unless i receive an unpleasant surprise safers green eyes narrowed are there any contingencies i should be aware of none that i know of good thats very good now ill continue to do my job and ill let you do yours the door opened to a long central hallway that mirrored the corridor downstairs bare beige walls outlet to the front steps at the far end closets and alcoves to the left bedrooms to the right the tinge of dirty laundry in the air safer led me past double doors that framed a huge whitecarpeted chamber goldupholstered chairs arboreal wallpaperthe paper id seen in erics snapshots of joanne i peeked in saw the sleigh bed made up with a silk comforter had no trouble picturing a disembodied head bloated body swaddled to the neck the other bedroom doors were shut safer skipped the first and knocked on the second no answer he opened the door a crack then all the way the dirtylaundry smell intensified faded blue paperrepeating print of tiny athletes in combative poses a poster on the facing wall said welcome to the comfort of chaos other posters on two other walls mostly concert mementos pearl jam third eye blind everclear barenaked ladies a cartoon of albert einstein with his pants down and his genitals dangling looking confused the caption who the fuck says youre so smart academic certificates hung crookedly national merit scholarship bank of america award general studies award science achievement award valedictorian two curtained windows doors to a private bathroom and a closet a chromeandglass storage unit stuffed with paperbacks spiral notebooks threering binders loose paper a cheap tijuana plaster statue of a bull on a top shelf a collection of gold plastic men proclaimed the joys of athletic accomplishment double bed its sheet tangled wrinkled half off the mattress behind the sleeping platform stereo equipment computers printers the floor was littered with wadded underwear shirts jeans socks a pair of dirty sneakers empty blue nylon backpack food wrappers snapple bottles crushed cans of surge eric sat near the headboard stacy was perched at the foot their backs to each other she had on a yellow tshirt over white capris he wore black jeans and a black sweatshirt like father both of them barefoot both of them redeyed eric slid one fingernail under another flicked something here it comes he said son said joe safer erics upper lip curled yes dad stacy shuddered and hugged herself raw cuticles on her fingers her hair was unbound wild and ragged like her fathers safer said dr delaware was kind enough to come here at this hour your father would like you to talk to him talk talk talk said eric haphapppy talk stacy shuddered again she managed to look at me aiming but pulling off scared eric said safer im asking you to be courteous your father and i are both asking you how is dad said stacy where is he whats he doing hes downstairs resting dear does he want something to eat no hes fine dear said safer i made him a sandwich a while back was it kosher said eric silence in the stale room safer stroked his beard and smiled sadly nice kosher pickle said eric nize leetle piece of corned beef stacy said stop it eric nize little matzo ball shut up eric stop what what the fuck am i doing you know what youre doing stop being rude they glared at each other stacy turned away first gave a small furious wave showed eric her back stood up enough of this im out of hereim sorry dr delaware i just cant talk to you or anyone else right now if i need you ill call youi really will mr safer safer muttered eric dads writing him huge checks and are any of us any safer stacy shouted you are so im what another dismissive wave stacy moved toward the door eric said im what smartgirl stacy kept going go ahead leave but dont think youre out of it eric called after her were never really out of our misery unless we put ourselves out of it stacy stopped another shudder took hold of her body her face convulsed and white foam bubbled at the corners of her mouth turning she canted forward tiny hands compressed into hard little fists for a moment i thought shed charge him flushed herself the doss flush you she said you are evil she ran out i followed caught up with her at the door to the last bedroom no please i know you want to help but stacy she rushed into the bedroom but left the door open i walked in smaller room than erics pink and babyblue paper ribbons and leaves and flowers white iron bed with brass accents pink comforter stuffed animals piled into an upholstered armchair clothes and books strewn about but not the calculated entropy of erics personal space she walked to a window touched shuttered blinds this is so humiliating you seeing us like this these are tough times i said house calls how much didnt i know about thousands of other patients theres no excuse she said were just she trailed off hunched her back like an old woman and tore at a cuticle im here to help stacy no answer then its secret right whatever we talk about nothing changes that nothing i said unless youre planning to kill someone i waited for her to talk she didnt whats on your mind stacy he is eric nod he scares me how does he scare you stacy byhethe way he talksthe things he says no no forget it forget i just said that please just forget it hes fine everythings fine she slipped a finger between the blades of the blinds and peered out at the night i said what did eric say that scared you she spun around nothing i said forget it i stood there what she said if youre scared let me help you canttheres nothing you canitsi just hehelenwe were sitting there after we got back from the police station and he started talking about helen your dog whats the difference please please dont make me get into it i cant make you do anything stacy but if erics in some kind of danger no no thats not what i meanheyou remember what i told you about helen she was sick eric took her up to the mountains and you never saw her again whats he saying about her nothing she said nothing really besides whats the big deal it was the right thing to doshe was sick she was a dog for gods sake people do that all the time its the humane thing to do putting her out of her misery eric told you he did it yesnever before not till now i mean i knew but he never mentioned before not once then tonight after we got back dad and mr safer were downstairs and we were up here and all of a sudden he starts getting into it laughing about it she sat down on the edge of the armchair crushing stuffed animals reaching behind she took one in her armsa small frayed elephant he laughed about helen i said and now hes talking about people being put out of their misery nojust forget it weak voice lacking conviction youre worried i went on if eric could do that to helen maybe he could do it to a human being maybe he had something to do with your mothers death no she shouted yes thats whathe basically told me i mean he didnt come out and say it but he kept hinting around at it talking about helen how her eyes lookedhow she was okay with it peaceful she looked up at him and licked his face and he hit her over the head with a rock one time he said thats all it took then he buried herit was brave of him right i couldnt have done it it needed to be done she was so sick she rocked in the chair held the elephant to her breast then he got a creepy smile said sometimes you have to take matters into your own hands how no one knows whats right or wrong unless theyre in your shoes how maybe there really is no right or wrong just rules that people take on because theyre too scared to make their own decisions he said helping helen was the noblest thing hed ever done she squeezed the elephant harder and its tiny face compressed to something grotesque im so scared what if he did another helen no reason to believe that i said lying because now i had an explanation for why mate hadnt claimed joanne i went on in my best therapist voice hes upset just as you are things will settle down eric will settle down my voice and my brain diverged as i continued to comfort thinking all the while mother and son guilt expiation joanne and eric planning eric taking pictures because he knew shed be leaving soon wanted to grasp every opportunity for memorial too sickening to contemplate but i couldnt stop contemplating i hoped the revulsion hadnt found its way into my voice must have faked it okay because stacy stopped crying everything will be fine she said in a little girls voice just hang in there she smiled then the smile turned into something fearful and ugly no it wont it will never be fine i know it seems like that right now hey she said erics right nothings complicated youre born life sucks you die she ripped a cuticle bloody licked the wound picked some more stacy words she said they sound nice theyre true stacy i wish things will be better more need than challenge yes i said lord help me new kind of smile im definitely not going to stanford i have to find my own place thank you dr delaware this has been her words were cut off by sounds from below from the front of the house loud enough to filter upstairs and through the door to her bedroom screams and percussion frantic footsteps more screamsbellows the pretty music of shattering glass chapter i ran out rushed down the stairs followed the noise the living room figures in black two figures crouched combatively richard shouted what the fuck have you done and advanced on his son eric waved a baseball bat behind the boy stood what remained of the display cases ravaged the brass dented glass doors splintered and ragged glass spikes and shards on the carpet glittery dust like raw diamonds broken pottery within the cases and on the floor horses and camels and little human figurines turned to rubble richard got closer his mouth was open his breath rasped eric panted also he gripped the bat with both hands dont even think about it put it down richard commanded eric didnt move put it the fuck down eric laughed and took another swing at the porcelain richard rushed forward threw himself at the bat managed to get hold of it as eric grunted and struggled to wrestle control the two of them fell to the floor entwined black clothes coating with glass and dust i dived in mindful of the bat aiming for the bat reaching it feeling hardwood sweaty and gritty the crunch underneath as fragments bit into my knees i tugged at the bat some give then resistance a fist landed on my jaw but i kept my grip eric and richard kept growling and spitting flailing at each other me anyone anything another pair of hands entered the fray stop i extricated myself joe safer stood there hands pressed to his cheeks eyes aflame eric and richard were concentrating on ownership of the bat stop you idiots or im walking out permanently and leaving you all to your misery richard stopped first eric kept growling but his hands loosened and safer and i both rushed forward and pulled the bat away from him richard sat down on the floor letting the ruins of his collection fall through his fingers he looked stunned anesthetized tiny cuts flecked his face and his hands one eye was swollen a few feet away eric was down on his knees looking out at nothing other than a split lip he showed no obvious injury my jaw was throbbing and i touched it hot starting to swell but i could move it nothing broken for gods sake said safer look what youve done to the doctor whats the matter with you people are you savages eric smiled were the elite pathetic huh safer pointed a finger at him you be quiet my friend you keep that mouth of yours shutdont you dare interrupt me why should eheh dont test me young man one more problem and im calling the police and having you hauled into jail and i can keep you there youd better believe i can who ca youll care within an hour youll be anally raped and worse now zip the lip erics hands began to shake he glanced at the havoc hed created smiled started to cry no one talked safer took in the ruin and shook his head im so sorry he said to me are you all right ill be fine eric richard pleaded why what have i done to you eric looked at safer requesting permission to talk safer said why indeed eric eric faced richard mumbled something what said richard sorry sorry richard echoed thats it louder mumble speak up for gods sake said richard what the hell led you to he shook his head let it drop sorry daddy said eric sorry sorry sorry eric began to sob richard moved to comfort him thought better of it plopped back down why son he said forgiveness said eric forgiveness is all richard had turned pale again a badlooking pale green around the edges he picked up a pottery fragment green and blue and chartreuse part of a horses face oh my god said a voice from behind us stacy stood at the entrance to the living room hands at her side eyes so bugged they seemed ready to take off in orbit just moments ago hearing talk about finding her own way id allowed myself a small hit of selfcongratulation now any victory was a joke demolished as surely as thousandyearold pottery drawn from the grave no said stacy dear said safer when she didnt answer he said no what she didnt seem to hear him had turned to me no she said i dont want any more of this and you dont have to take any more dear said safer youre certain that jaws okay doctor ill survive richard he said is your maid in the house no muttered richard night off stacy please get the doctor an ice pack stacy said absolutely and left safer faced richard and eric now the two of you will clean up this terrible mess and ill figure out if you deserve my further involvement in your case richard please said richard just clean it up ordered safer do something useful do something together he shepherded me out of the room through the dining room and into the kitchen one of those vast white lacquer and black granite setupswhat realtors call catering kitchens another la pretense upscale isolates staking claim to sociability stacy was wrapping ice cubes in a towel one second thank you dear said safer as she brought it over i pressed the cloth to my face im so sorry she told me so so sorry no big deal i said its really nothing the three of us stood there listening no sound through the kitchen door safer said please go up to your room stacy i need to confer with the doctor she complied safer said at least one of them seems normal he pushed back his yarmulke removed his suit jacket and folded it over a chair sat down at the kitchen table what just happened out there he said i wouldnt even guess not that thats going to change my strategy visavis richard ill get him past the immediate threat but that boy hes seriously disturbed isnt he very angry i said youd be angry too if youd helped your mother die couldnt talk about it to anyone do you see him as a danger to himself and others because if he is ill get a seventytwohour hold possibly but dont ask me to go there get someone else for that he massaged the tabletop i understand conflict of interest yet another speaking of which he said lets discuss detective sturgis i know weve talked about this and please dont be offended but i believe in an ounce of prevention what you saw tonightnothing gets repeated of course good he said taken care of and again i apologize now as far as stacys concerned you do agree she needs to be out of here at least for tonight do you have a place for her to go my house i live in hancock park have plenty of room and my wife wont be put out shes used to entertaining entertaining clients clients guests shes a very social person tomorrow nights our sabbath stacy can have a multicultural experience shall i call mrs safer if you can get stacy to agree i think i can he said stacy impresses me as a very reasonable young woman quite possibly the one sane person in this museum of psychopathology he went upstairs and i sat in the kitchen nursing my jaw thinking about erics rage forgiveness is all and richard hadnt forgiven so now he was paying for it he and eric two kegs of explosives not my concern not unless it affected stacy i had to focus on stacy safer was right she needed to be out of here a night or two at his house might work out but after that safer returned i convinced her shes packing a bag let me go tell richard i accompanied him into the living room the mess was partially cleaneddust and fragments swept into piles brooms leaning against the shattered cases richard and eric sat on the floor their backs to a sofa richards arm around erics shoulder erics head against richards chest his eyes closed his face tearstreaked pieta in the palisades richard looked different not flushed not pale expressionless crushed dragged to the edge and dropped off he didnt seem to notice as safer and i approached but when we got within two feet of the case he turned slowly and held eric tighter erics body flopped the boys eyes remained shut hes tired said richard i need to put him to bed i used to do that when he was little tell him stories and put him to bed safer gave a start remembering his own son do that he said take care of him im bringing stacy to my house richards eyebrows arched your house why to keep things simple richard i promise to take good care of her ill get her to school on time tomorrow and shell spend the weekend with us or with friends if she so prefers not the manitows i thought richard said she wants to go my idea said safer she agreed richard licked his lips turned to me i nodded okay he said i guess tell her to come in before she leaves let me give her a kiss chapter i climbed the stairs nursing my jaw stacy sat on her bed her voice came out small and wounded im tired please dont make me talk i stayed with her for a while when i returned to the kitchen joe safer was talking on the phone elbow resting on the counter near a blackandchrome coffee machine from germany i found a jar of espresso in one of the refrigerators packed enough for six cups and sat listening to the drip and thinking about what guilt and expiation really meant to eric safer left the room and kept talking i drank by myself a while later the doorbell rang and safer came back in the kitchen accompanied by a tall husky young man with wavy blond hair and a briefcase this is byron hell be staying here tonight byron winked and inspected the appliances he wore a blue oxford shirt khakis and penny loafers had hyphens for eyes and facial muscles that looked paralyzed when we shook hands his felt like a bone carving safer went upstairs byron and i didnt talk no sound from the living room the entire house was too damn quiet then i heard footsteps from above and a few seconds later stacy entered followed by the lawyer safer was carrying a small floral overnight bag stacy looked tiny shriveled much too old i followed the two of them outside and watched him help her into his cadillac byron remained in the doorway hands on hips what is he exactly i said someone who helps me richard and eric seem calm but just in case were you an oldest child joe oldest of seven why you like to take care of things his smile was weary dont think im paying for that bit of analysis he drove away and i watched the cadillacs taillights disappear down the block the unmarked hadnt moved the night had turned dank redolent of fermenting seaweed my jaw ached and my clothes had sweated through i trudged to the seville instead of turning around and heading south i drove farther north till i found it six houses up big tudor thing behind brick walls and iron gates vines encircling the brick the tipoff judys white lexus visible through the rails another vanity plate hcdj here come da judge the first time id seen it was when id accompanied her from her courtroom to her parking space one of the many times wed worked together all those referrals this would be the last wouldnt it i stopped in front of her house looking for what light glowed behind a couple of curtained mullioned windows movement flashed on the second story central window just a smudge of a silhouette shifting then freezing then moving again human but thats about all i could say hooking a threepointer my headlights aimed through the manitow gate i paused half hoping someone would notice and show themselves no one did and i headed back toward sunset passing the unmarked movement there too but the drab sedan remained in place i drove east trying not to think about anything on the way home i stopped at a twentyfourhour drugstore in brentwood and bought the strongest advil i could find friday morning i woke up before robin just as the sun whitened the curtains my jaw felt tender but the swelling wasnt too bad i drew the covers over my face pretended to sleep waited till robin had risen showered and left not wanting to explain eventually id have to using the bedroom phone i called safers office good morning doctor hows your battle wound healing hows stacy she slept soundly he said i had to wake her to get her to school on time lovely girl she even tried to make breakfast for my wife and me i hope she survives her family psychologically speaking i thought about stacys little speech about selfdetermination wondered if it would stick what she needs i said is to separate from her family achieve her own identity richard expects her to go to stanford because he and joanne did she shouldgo anywhere but there and erics at stanford he said exactly the boy hasnt separated adequately dont know i said dont know enough about him to pontificate dont want to know if he sat by a bed in a cheap motel and inserted a needle into his mothers vein if you have any influence with richard you might guide him toward allowing stacy some choice makes sense he said but he sounded distracted i understand the boys not your primary patient but he continues to bother me that level of anger any new thoughts on why hed explode like that none how was he last night byron reports that father and son cleaned up then went to sleep erics still sleeping and richard richards up richards full of ideas ill bet he is listen joe i need to take a look at joanne dosss medical records whys that to try to understand her death if im going to help stacy i need as much information as possible the medical tests were conducted at st michaels richard said youve got power of attorney so please sign a release and fax it over to their medical records office done of course youll notify me if you learn something i should know such as i said such as anything i should know his voice had hardened agreed i thought of all i hadnt told him knew there was plenty he hadnt told me sure joe i said no problem popping more advil i iced my jaw took a short run cleaned up walked over to robins studio stuck my head in and got an earful of noise my beloved suited and goggled standing behind the plastic walls of the spray booth as she wielded a lacquer gun knowing she couldnt be interrupted and doubting she could see me i waved and left for st michaels medical center sunset to barrington barrington to wilshire driving too fast to santa monica no reason to hurry my reason for checking out the hospital was to look for michael ferris burke or whatever he was calling himself now but my fresh suspicions about eric dimmed any prospects of finding a michael burke connection to joannes final trip not an evil stranger family but what else was there for me to do and maybe i would find something that made me laugh out loud shrinks denial i wanted anyone in that motel room other than eric the boys rage came back to me in a bitter surge and the facts spat in my face helen the dog guilt and expiation that level of anger the noblest thing hed ever done mates death had stirred up erics guilt richards attempt at vengeance had fueled it further eric knowing an innocent man had been targeted because mate hadnt brought about joannes death wondering what his father would have done to him had he known then reversing the angerturning it on his father because richard had caused it all by not forgiving blaming like father i thought about the way the death plan mightve gone down weeks maybe months of planning between eric and joanne easy collusion or had eric tried to talk his mother out of it finally given up and settled for immortalizing her with polaroids how had she convinced him telling him it was noble or had he needed little convincingenraged at her too one of those terrifying kids who are missing that little secret shred of brain tissue that inhibits evil the scheme then the night of judgment surreptitious motherson outing on one of the many nights when richard was out of town eric driving joanne riding along the long dark trip to the edge of the desert lancaster because mom was adamant about that obscene how could a mother do that to a son what transgression had she committed that couldve been worse than that i was unlikely to find the answer in her hospital chart but one did what one could one did what was right and hoped for some final day of judgment transcendence absolution the limestone and mirrored mass of st michaels filled several square blocks on wilshire in santa monica half a mile east of the beach id lectured there a few years earlier teaching familypractice residents about divorce and child abuse and bedwetting but i had no idea how to find medical records and the personnel office i got directions from a kid with a skimpy blond beard and a badge alleging he was an md north side of the complex adjoining buildings i hit personnel firsthuman resources most companies call it that nowwarm fuzzy twist on the lexicon does it ease the pain when they fire you the office was small stark sterile occupied by an imperiouslooking black woman in an orange suit who sat entering columns of data into a pc i was wearing my western pediatrics badge had my id card from the med school crosstown ready as backup but she smiled when i told her i was in charge of arranging a faculty party and needed some office addresses and handed over a phonebooksize volume marked staff roster her openness felt fresh and clean and odd id been hanging around too long with cops lawyers psychopaths other evasive creatures she returned to her desk and i thumbed through the book the professional staff was listed at the front pages of doctors names office addresses photos no personal data no one who resembled the various faces of the man leimert fusco claimed was the real dr death the same went for the rear sections listing social workers physical therapists occupational therapists respiratory therapists when i brought the book back the woman in orange said hope its a good party medical records was a bit more complicated the receptionist was one of those puckermouthed types weaned on skepticism and she hadnt seen joe safers faxed authorization finally the paperwork materialized and she produced joanne dosss inchthick chart you need to read it here that fax doesnt authorize photocopying no problem thats what they all say who doctors who work for lawyers i took the file across the room multicolored pages of lab reports numbers in boxes motley samples of physician scrawl bob manitows name appeared only on the referral form fifteen other doctors had attempted to discern the cause of joannes misery

refused of course she had too late for confession on the way out i stopped at a pay phone and checked in with my service last guy in la with no cell phone it had taken me years to buy a vcr a good deal longer to get cable hookup id stalled at getting a computer even after the libraries at the u abandoned their card catalogs then my electric typewriter broke and i couldnt find replacement parts my father had been a machinist i stayed away from machines lived with a woman who loved them no sense introspecting the operator said only one it just came in a detective connor thats not the one who usually calls you is it no i said what did she want no message just to call petra had left her number at hollywood division another detective answered and said shes out want her mobile i got through petra said milo asked me to let you know that we found eldon salcido he thought you might want to take a look at him milo sending a message through her rather than calling himself knowing he and i were firmly planted on opposite sides of the doss investigation had safer warned him off or was he opting for discretion on his own either way it felt weird did he say why i should take a look no she said i assumed youd know it was a short conversation milo sounded pretty hassled still fighting to get warrants on that fat cat whered salcido show up on the street literally messed upbeat up looks like he ran into the wrong bunch of buttkickers a resident coming out to collect the morning paper found him salcido was lying in the gutter his pockets were empty but that doesnt mean he was robbed he might not have carried a wallet one of our cars got the call recognized him from a picture i hung up in the squad room hes at hollywood mercy conscious i said yes but uncooperative i left your name with the nurses she gave me a room number thanks i said if you have any problems call me if you learn anything interesting from salcido you can call me too because milos busy seems to be isnt everyone better than the alternative i said you said it by the way im seeing billy tomorrow were going over to see the new science center at exposition park anything you want to pass along best regards and continue doing what hes doing and keep busy not that he needs me to tell him that she laughed yes hes a wonder isnt he chapter it took forty minutes on the east and surface streets to get to the shabby section of east hollywood where beverly meets temple second hospital of the day hollywood mercy was five stories of earthquakestressed puttycolored stucco teetering atop a scrubby knoll that overlooked downtown the building had an inadequate parking lot a cracked tile roof some nice ornate moldings from the days when labor was cheap most with chunks missing city ambulances ringed the entry the front vestibule was crowded with long lines of sadlooking people waiting for approval from clerks in glass cages cat scans pet scans mris the same hightech alphabet id seen at st michaels but this place looked like something out of a blackandwhite movie and it smelled like an old mans bedroom mates bedroom his son was recuperating on the fourth floor in something called the special care unit an unarmed security guard was posted at the swinging doors that led to the ward and my id badge got me waved through on the other side was a chunky corridor five doors long with a nurses station at the end a black man with a shaved head sat near a stack of charts writing and a lanternjawed strawhaired woman in her sixties tapped her finger to soft reggae thumping from an unseen radio i announced myself in there said the female nurse hows he doing hell survive she pulled out a chart a lot thinner than joanne dosss encyclopedia of confusion a hollywood division police report was stapled to the inside front cover eldon salcido had been found beaten and semiconscious at am in the gutter of a residential block of poinsettia place north of sunset three blocks from his fathers apartment on vista paramedics had transported him and an er resident had admitted him for repair and observation contusions abrasions possible concussion later ruled absent no broken bones extreme mental agitation and confusion possibly related to preexisting alcoholism drug abuse mental illness or some combination of all three the patient had refused to identify himself but police at the scene had supplied the vitals the fact that salcido was an excon with a felony record was duly noted restraints ordered after the patient assaulted staff whod he hit i said one of our predecessors last shift said the male nurse her big crime was offering him orange juice he knocked it out of her hand tried to punch her she managed to lock him in and called security another day in paradise said the woman probably a candidate for detox but our detox unit shut down last month you here to evaluate him for transfer just to see him i said basic consult well you might end up doing it for free we cant find a medical card on him and he isnt talking thats okay hey if you dont care i sure dont room she came out from behind the counter and unlocked the door the room was cellsize and green with a lone grilled window that framed an air shaft a single bed and an iv bottle on a stand not hooked up the vitalsigns monitor above the headboard was switched off and so was the tiny tv bracketed to the far wall a low industrial buzz seeped through the window donny salcido mate lay on his back barechested shackled with leather cuffs staring at the ceiling a tight sweatstained top sheet bound him from the waist down his trunk was hairless undernourished offwhite where it wasnt blueblack blue coils squirmed all over him skin art continuing around his back and down both arms pictorial arms striped by bandages dried blood crusted the edges of the dressings a swatch of gauze banded his forehead a smaller square bottomed his chin purpling bruises cupped both eyes and his lower lip was a slab of liver other dermal images peeked out from within the coils the leering face of a nightmarishly fanged cobra a flabby naked woman with a sad mouth one wideopen eye emitting a single tear gothic lettering spelling out donny mamacita big boy technically welldone tattoos but the jumble made me want to rearrange his skin a walking canvas opined the strawhaired nurse like that book by the martian chronicles guy visitor mr salcido aint that grand she walked out and the door hissed shut donny salcido mate didnt budge his hair was long stringy the burnt bronze of old motor oil an untrimmed beard two shades darker blanketed his face from cheekbone to jowl no resemblance to the mug shot id seen that made me think of the beard michael burke had grown when adopting his huey mitchell persona in ann arbor in fact donnys hirsute face bore a resemblance to mitchells but not the same man none of that cold blank stagnancy in the eyes these rheumy browns were bouncy heated hyperactive hundred percent scared prey not predator i stepped closer to the bed donny salcido moaned and twisted away from me a tattoo tendril climbed up his carotid disappearing into the beard thatch like a vining rose yellowing crust flecked the edges of his mustache his lips were cracked his nose had been broken but not recently probably more than once the cartilage between his eyes was sunken as if scooped by a dull blade the flesh below a nest of gaping black pores orange splotches remained on his skin where hed been disinfected with betadine but whoever had cleaned him up hadnt gotten rid of the street stink mr salcido im dr delaware his eyes jammed shut howre you doing let me out of here clear enunciation no slur i waited got caught up in the skin mural subtle shadings good composition i got past that searched for an image that would tie in with his father nothing obvious the tattoos seemed to encroach on one another this was the junction of talent and chaos bumps in the crook of his arm caught my eye fibrosed needle marks his eyes opened get these things off he said rattling the cuffs the nurses got a little upset when you tried to hit one of them never happened you didnt try to hit a nurse headshake she aggressed on me tried to force juice down my windpipe not my esophagus my windpipe get it nasopharynx epiglottisknow what happens when you do that you choke you aspirate fluid straight into the lungs even if you dont suffocate it creates a pleural cesspool perfect culture for bacteria she was out to drown meif she couldnt accomplish that infect me a tongue gray and fuzzed caressed his lips he gulped thirsty i said strangling get these things off of me howd you get hurt you tell me how would i know youre the doctor the police say someone hit you not someone ones i got jumped right there on poinsettia no san francisco i walked all the way here because this glorious place is where i wanted to be treated his head rolled toward me better get me outta here or give me my tegretol when im out of my tegretol i get interesting you suffer from seizures no stupid cognitive dysfunction affective scrambling inability to regulate emotional outbursts im yes she said he claims he needs it to maintain internal stability he played that tune for me too im waiting to talk to the attending hes selfmedicating for assaultiveness and mood swings if hes already on tegretol hes probably gone through lithium and the neuroleptics maybe in prison maybe but i cant get anything out of him resembling a clinical history tegretols okay but theres the issue of side effects i need blood levels on him did you have a chance to talk to him he didnt talk hes a bit more verbal now i said theres some iq there he knows how it feels before the assaultiveness comes on is fighting to maintain control so whatre you saying im suggesting that at least in one respect he may know whats best for him did you see that skin of his she said hard to miss pretty disorganized for someone who knows whats best for him true but i get it she said the police sent you to see him and you want him coherent so hell talk to you thats part of it the other part is hes already been assaultive and if something works for him maybe it should be considered im not trying to tell you how to do your job no actually you are she laughed but sure why not everyone else does okay no sense having him freak out and me getting a three am call ill try to get hold of the attending again if she okays it he gets dosed he says hes been taking three hundred milligrams daily he says the lunatics run the asylum look at washington dc she laughed harder what do the police want with him information on what a homicide oh great a murderer cant wait to see him again hes not a suspect i said hes a potential witness a witness guy like that what kind of witness could he be hard to say right now im trying to get some rapport were talking about his family his family what good oldfashioned psychoanalysis the stuff you read about in books i returned to donnys room he was facing the door waiting no promises i said but the residents calling the supervising doctor how long till i get my tegretol if she gets the okay soon an eternity what bullshit youre welcome mr salcido he drew back his lips half his teeth were missing the stragglers were cracked and discolored i pulled a chair next to the bed and sat down why were you on your way to your fathers place he never came to my place why should i go to his place but you did i know that stupid its rhetoricalciceronian im questioning my own motivesengaging in introspection isnt that good a sign of progress he spat and i had to move away to avoid being the target i dont know why i do what i do he said if i did would l be here i said nothing i hope this happens to you one day he said feeling this passive weak you think my skins so weird whats weird about it every shrink i talked to told me skin wasnt important the thing was to look within get past the surface how many shrinks have you talked to too many all assholes like you he closed his eyes talking faces little crushing rooms just like this get past the skin the skin look inside man i like the skin the skin is all the skin holds it all in the eyes opened cmon man get these things off let me touch my skin when i cant touch it i feel like im not there in timedonny he moaned and rolled his head away from me your skin i said did you do all that yourself idiot how could i do the back what about the rest of it what do you think i think you did its good work youre talented ive seen your other artwork silence the anatomy lesson i said all those other masterpieces zero tollrance his body jerked i waited for him to speak nothing i think i understand why you chose that name donny you have zero tolerance for stupidity you dont suffer fools like father he whispered something whats that i said patience is not a virtue why not donny you wait nothing happens you wait long enough you choke rot time dies people die time goes on you dont get it he said a bit louder people dying is nothingworm food time dies everything freezes when you paint i said what happens to time a tiny smile showed itself amid the beard eternity and when youre not painting im too late too late for what responses being there everythingmy timings off ive got a sick brain maybe the limbic system maybe the prefrontal lobes the temporals the thalamus nothing moves at the right pace do you have a place where you can paint now he stared at me screw you get me out of here you offered your art to your father but he wouldnt accept it i said after he was gone you tried to give it to the world to show them what you were capable of his lips folded inward and he chewed on them did you kill him donny i bent closer close enough for him to bite my nose he didnt just stayed in place prone staring at the ceiling did you i said no he finally said too late as usual after that he shut up tight ten minutes into the impasse the strawhaired nurse came in carrying a metal tray that held a plastic cup of water and two pills one oblong and pink the other a white disc breakfast in bed she announced twohundredmilligram morsel with a onehundred chaser donny was panting he forgot his restraints tried to sit up the cuffs snapped against his wrists and he slammed back down breathing even faster no water he said i wont be drowned the nurse frowned at me as if i was to blame suit yourself senor salcido but if you cant swallow it dry im not going back to the doctor to authorize an injection dry is good dry is safe she handed me the tray here you give it to him im not getting my fingers bit off she watched as i took the pink pill and brought it close to donnys face his mouth was already wide open his molars and most of his bicuspids were missing putrid breath streamed up at me i dropped in the pink lozenge he caught it on his gray tongue flipped it backward gulped said delicious in went the white pill he grinned burped the nurse snatched the tray and left looking disgusted i sat back down there you go i said now you go he said i had enough of you i tried awhile longer asking him if hed ever actually gotten into the apartment what did he think of his fathers library had he read beowulf mention of the book drew no response from him the closest i got to conversation was when i let him know id met his mother yeah hows she doing shes concerned about you go fuck yourself i pressed him about novelty shop gags phony books broken stethoscopes he said what in the ripe rotten fuck are you talking about you dont know hell no but go ahead talk all you want im coasting now getting smooth then he closed his eyes curled as fetally as the cuffs allowed and went to sleep not faking real slumber chest rising and falling in a slow easy beat the rhythmic snores of one at peace i left hollywood mercy trying to classify him assaultive and deeply disturbed but bright and manipulative combative and pigheaded too eldon mate had rejected his son unceasingly but genetics couldnt be denied zero tollrance hed turned himself into a walking canvas drifting from squat to squat numbed his pain with dope and anticonvulsants and anger and art painting his fathers portrait over and over offering his best to his father getting rejected over and over as good a motive for patricide as any and donny had considered it hed definitely considered it did you kill him too late as usual denying hed followed through as did richard brilliant bloody production and no one was willing to take credit despite donnys slyness i found myself believing him the mental impairment was real tegretol was powerful stuff endstage medication for mood disorders when lithium failed no fun not an addicts choice if donny craved it hed suffered hed dissected his father on canvas but the reallife murder reeked of a mix of calculation and brutality that seemed beyond him i tried to picture him organizing what had happened up on mulholland stalking enticing writing a mocking note hiding a broken stethoscope in a box cleaning up perfectly sufficiently meticulous not to leave a speck of dna this was a guy who got mugged and left in the gutter who got yelled at by an elderly landlady and fled my mention of the book and the scope had elicited nothing from him his clumsy attempt to enter his fathers apartment in full view of mrs krohnfeld was miles from that degree of sophistication his entire life pattern was a series of failed attempts i doubted hed ever gotten past eldon mates front door no someone a lot more intact than donny salcido mate had planted that toy the personality combination id suggested at the beginningthe same mixture suggested by fusco smarts and rage outwardly coherent but with a bad temper problem someone like richard and his son i thought of how the boy had pulverized six figures worth of treasure it kept coming back to eric dispirited i headed west on beverly and considered how eric mightve lured mate to mulholland wanting to talk about his mother to talk about what hed done to his motherfor his mother claiming to mate that hed been inspired by the death doctor the appeal to mates vanity might have worked but if eric had been the one in that motel room why butcher mate covering for himself thin so perhaps mate had been involved and eric knowing of his fathers hatred for the death doctor perhaps even knowing about the failed contract with quentin goad had taken it upon himself to act blood orgy to please the old man happy traveling you sick bastard the phrasing had an adolescent flavor to it i could hear the sentence tumbling from erics lips but if eric had slaughtered mate why was he now striking out against his father had he finally come to grips with what hed done turned his anger on richardblaming just as the old man was wont to do father and son rolling wrestling snorting on the floor tearing at each other only to embrace ambivalence apparent reconciliation but if what i suspected was true the boy was unpredictable and dangerous joe safer had sensed that asked my opinion id avoided an answer claiming i needed to focus upon stacy but also wanting to avoid additional complications now i had to wonder if erics presence in the house put stacyand richardin danger id call safer as soon as i got home hold back my suspicions and keep my comments generalerics bad temper the effects of stress the need to be careful the afternoon traffic had sludged to chrome cholesterol cars lurching forward in fits and starts tempers flaring i allowed myself to be drawn into it oblivious to petty resentments thinking about real rage eric and mate on mulholland bluntforce injury to mates head as in baseball bat perhaps the boy had gotten mate up there with a simple lie misrepresenting himself as a terminally ill patient pining for the love bite of the humanitron a young male traveler mate defensive about too many females those nasty feminist jibes about his sexuality would have liked that the meet the kill then weeks later eric sneaks into mates apartment and hides the stethoscope out of business doc high intelligence savage anger the boy had plenty of both and sneaking out in the middle of the night was erics habit hed done it for years helen the dog a look at the boys phone records and creditcard log would be instructive had he booked a flight from palo alto to la on or around the day of mates murder made a second trip to pull off the breakin taking all those risks simply to taunt mates ghosts or was it the cops he was out to humiliate because after shedding blood he learned that he liked it the juxtaposition of blood and pleasure thats the way it had started for michael burke thats the way it always started someone that young and smart warping so severely terrifying i wanted to bounce it all off milo intriguing hed say but all theory and theory was where it would freeze because i couldntdidnt want toprobe further a horn honked someone screeched to a stop someone cursed the air outside looked heavy and milky and poisonous i sat in my steel box one among thousands pretending to navigate chapter four pm cornedbeef sandwiches and beer in the fridge a note from robin pinned to a carton of coleslaw she and spike had gone to a m studios to sit in on a recording session the bassist was debuting an eightstring shed created rhythmandblues tracks spike loved that kind of thing the studio was on la brea near sunset id been only a few blocks away ships passing mail was piled up on the dining room table from the looks of it mostly bills and hucksters promising immortality i phoned safer he was in court unavailable so i tried the dosses richard answered doctor so you got the packet what packet pause doesnt matter what can i do for you i was calling to see how youre doing stacys fine went to school shes staying away for the weekend his voice dropped i suppose thats best and eric on his way back to stanford i got him a plane out of vannuys you think hes ready for that why not last night last night was an aberration doctor with all hes gone through he shouldve blown a long time ago tell the truth im glad he finally did its just pottery im fully insured well tell the carrier it was an accident the bolts on the cases came loose is he going to get some help at stanford we discussed that he said hes considering it i think you should be more directive look doctor i appreciate all youve done but frankly eric doesnt he doesnt feel comfortable with you not your fault everyone relates differently youre fine for stacy not eric probably all for the best avoiding sibling rivalry so why dont you concentrate on stacy and ill handle eric i think he needs help richard your opinion has been duly noted what about you richard how are you doing im alone guess id better get used to that anything i can do no im fineno thanks to your buddy the detective he keeps trying to search every square inch i own and hounding safer asking for an interview talk about euphemism but thats okay everyone has to do their job safer tells me ill be free of all this crap soon enough gotta go doctor call coming in on the other line if stacy needs you ill be in touch she doesnt want an appointment ill ask her thanks bye i found the packet in the middle of the mail stack courierdelivered envelope the return address rtd properties folded into a sheet of rtd stationery was a check written on rtd business account iv fifteen thousand dollars a typed note mr d thanks you for your time he trusts this will cover everything to date terri accounting ill be in touch not likely i knew severance pay when i saw it i couldnt talk to milo so i called petra to let her know my impressions of donny salcido mate she was at her desk courteous enough but she sounded busy and i asked her if it was a bad time its fine she said i just have to run over to hollywood pres in a few minutes start some paper on a new one boy meets girl boy beds girl boy kills girl then tries to kill himself guys hooked up to life support some people cant do anything right whats up i summarized my bedside chat with donny she said is this guy dangerous if he doesnt get medicated maybe i cant promise you he didnt kill his father but i wouldnt bet on it i explained my reasoning she said makes sense ill pass it on see if milo wants me to hold him on anything listen i know im a pest about billy but kid care isnt my thing im the youngest in my family tomorrow when i see him i was thinking of bringing him some books anything in particular youd suggest hes always liked history ive already gotten him plenty of history books i thought fiction might be a nice switchmaybe the classics do you see him as able to handle les miserablest or the count of monte cristo something like that sure i said either good i wasnt sure because of the themes abandonment poverty you dont think its too close to home no hell be fine with it petra i can see books like that appealing to his moral core hes sure got one of those doesnt he she said im still trying to figure out where it came from if you knew you could sell it and do something else for a living such as i said she laughed such as nothing i love my job saturday morning i awoke thinking about eric as a murderer it stayed on my mind during the breakfast that robin and i shared out near the pond then i looked around saw how beautiful the world was and wondered if i was just letting my imagination run wild because i couldnt stand nice after all not a shred of evidence pointed to the boyor his mothereven talking to mate mates records might shed some light on that and i was certain that records existed because mate had regarded his work as historically significant would have wanted every detail recorded for posterity milo had guessed roy haiselden had them and he might be right now that he had richard as a suspect and haiseldens motive for disappearing had become clear he was unlikely to pursue the attorney no criminal charges had been lodged against haiselden yet but domestic violence and childabuse allegations meant that other detectives would be looking for him meaning someone might get a warrant but the breckenham civil suit had been filed in baldwin park sheriffs jurisdiction my only sheriffs contact was ron banks a downtown homicide investigator and petra connors boyfriend id met him once not exactly foundation for a favor after we cleaned up robin and i went shopping for groceries then walked in the hills with the pooch then she retired for a nap and i went into my office ignited the computer and gave the internet another try nothing new on mate except for a couple of cybergossips in a righttodie chat room exercising their constitutional right to be paranoid am i being too imaginative wondered whiteknight to suggest that following the death of dr mate further attempts are being made to silence those with the courage to face off against the powers that be not at all responded funnigirl ive heard the police from various cities have gotten together to create a taskforce on euthanasia the plan is to kill people then make it look as if the righttodie folks are behind it shades of grassy knoll screenplays were everywhere i logged off mates records time to give the everamiable alice zoghbie another try for all i knew haiselden had never had the files theyd been stored at the pretty little vanilla house on glenmont no reason for her to be any more forthcoming unless i pointed out the discrepancies between joannes assisted suicide and mates other travelers suggested mate hadnt helped joanne that richard had killed zoghbies mentor for nothinghad turned mate into the sacrificial lamb shed claimed if she knew that already hearing about richards arrest would have sent her reeling she might even be contemplating coming forth if so maybe i could tip the scalesturn her grief to my advantage manipulative but she was someone who believed the infirm should be encouraged not to exist at worst shed slam the door in my face nothing lost as things stood i was pretty useless i made the drive to glendale in thirtyfive minutes in the morning light alice zoghbies house was even cuter flower beds crayon bright the copper rooster weather vane vibrating in a breeze i couldnt feel the same white audi sat in the cobblestone driveway dust on the windshield a bit more humanity on the street this time an old man sweeping his front porch a young couple pulling out of their carport i tapped the goatshead knocker lightly no answer my second attempt more energetic was also met with silence making my way back to the driveway i walked past the audi to a green wooden gate bees buzzed butterflies fluttered i called out hello then alice zoghbies name got no reply flowers kissed the side of the house lights on in the kitchen the gate was latched but not locked i reached around popped it open continued along a cobblestone path shaded by the arthritic boughs of an old scarred sycamore a small stoop led up to the kitchen door four panes of glass gave me something to look through lights on but unoccupied dishes in the sink a carton of milk and half an orange on the counter the fruit slightly withered i knocked nothing climbing down the stoop i moved along the side of the house peeking in windows listening just the bee buzz the backyard was small charmingly landscaped with hedges of italian cypress on two sides that blocked the neighbors views and a tall wooden fence at the back victorian lawn furniture more flower beds the kind of flowers that bloom in shade a dark yard shrouded by a second sycamore even larger stout branches supporting a macrame hammock trunk as thick as two people two people propped against the trunk the buzzing loudernot bees flies a storm of flies both of the bodies were tied to the tree with thick rope fastened tight at chest level and around the waist the hemp was crusted maroon and brown and black barefoot corpses insects reconnoitering between fingers and toes the woman slumped to the right she had on a blue floral housedress with an elastic neckband the elastic had allowed the garment to be yanked down without ripping exposing what had once been her breasts the killer had hiked it above her waist too raised her knees spread her legs wounds everywhere that same redblack splotching her skin and her clothing running down her thighs filthying the grass her flesh was greentinged where the blood hadnt settled triangles sliced into her abdomen three of them her head drooped to her chest so that i couldnt see her face a black gaping necklace was visible along her jawline a helmet of white hair sparkling where it wasnt flycrowded said shed once been alice zoghbie the mans khaki shorts had been removed and folded next to his left thigh his blue polo shirt remained on but had been rolled up to his nipples big man heavy flabby stiff reddish toupeea hairpiece id seen on tv triangles danced along the swell of roy haiseldens abdomen too distorted by his paunch his head lolled to the right toward alice zoghbie as if straining to listen to some secret she was imparting not much remained of his face his genitals had been removed and placed on the grass between his legs theyd shriveled and shrunk and bugs congregated there with special enthusiasm the fingers of his left hand were entwined with alice zoghbies the two of them holding hands id broken into frosty sweat wasnt breathing but my brain was racing my eyes shifted from the bodies to something else off to the left a few feet away a wicker picnic basket propped against it a tall green bottle foiltopped champagne atop the basket a pair of tiny goldlidded jars too far for me to read the labels and i knew better than to disturb the crime scene red jar black jar caviar champagne and caviar an upscale picnic bare feet and her housedress said alice and the man had no intention of going anywhere posed the irony a bluebottle fly alighted on alice zoghbies left breast scuttled paused explored some more before taking off in flightheading toward me i backed away retreated through the gate knowing my prints were on the handle it wouldnt be long before someone would want to talk to me leaving it open i retraced my steps down the driveway past the audi to the curb the old man had gone inside the street had reverted to torpor so many perfect lawns sparrows skittered how long before the vultures arrived inside the seville i breathed last guy in la without a damn cell phone i got out of there drove to a gas station on verdugo road sweatdrenched collar tight i parked near the pay phone composed myself got out other people pumped gas as i tried to look any way other than how i felt the killings were in glendale pd jurisdiction but to hell with that i called milo chapter any idea when hell be back i think he went downtown to do some paperwork said the clerk a woman one i didnt know i can transfer you to detective korn he works with detective sturgis your name sir no thanks i said youre sure she sounded nice so i gave her the ugly details and hung up before she could respond i drove back to la hoping for an empty house wanting time to breathe to sort things out repulsed still shaken sweat came gushing out of my pores as the image of the bodies kept smacking me across the brain milo and i had visited alice zoghbie five days ago no skin sloughing no maggots the beginnings of the green tinge i was no forensic pathologist but id seen enough corpses to guess that not more than a couple of days had passed since the murder alices mail and phone records could clear that up propped holding hands a picnic someone canny enough to overpower a big man like haiselden and a woman who hiked the himalayas someone they knew a confederate had to be the feelings of disgust didnt subside but a new sensation joined themstrange juvenile glee not eric not richard no motive and both their whereabouts were well accounted for during the past two or three days same for donny salcido propped against a tree geometry michael burkes trademarks time to give leimert fuscos big black book another review time to call fuscobut milo deserved to know first i was on the driving much too fast hoping for an empty house thinking about haiselden hiding from the civil suit only to encounter something much worse hed probably been hiding out with alice all alongi recalled the phone call shed taken when milo and i had visited afterward she couldnt wait to get rid of us probably from her pal wanting to know if the coast was clear the two of them waylaid right there in alices house someone they knew someone respectable trusted a bright young doctor whod apprenticed to mate no doubt glendale police had already been dispatched to the scene soon my prints on the gate would be lifted and within days theyd be matched to the medical board files in sacramento milo needed to know soon if i couldnt reach him should i go straight to fusco the fbi man had said he was flying up to seattle wanting to check on the unsolvedssomething specific about the seattle unsolveds the last seattle victimmarissa bonpaine plastic hypodermic found on the forest floor cataloged and forgotten not a coincidence couldnt be a coincidence fusco had left me his beeper number and his local exchange but both were back home in the burke file i pushed the seville up to ninety i unlocked my front door robins truck was gone prayers answered i raced to my office feeling guilty about being quite so pleased i tried milo again got no answer decided sooner was better than later and phoned fuscos beeper and routing number no callback from him either i was starting to feel like the last man on earth after another futile attempt to reach milo i punched in fbi headquarters at the federal building in westwood and asked for special agent fusco the receptionist put me on hold then transferred me to another woman with the throaty voice of a lounge singer who took my name and number may i tell him what this is about sir hell know hes out of the office ill give him the message i pulled out the big black accordion file flung it open stared at pictures of corpses against trees geometrical wounds the parallels inescapable all my theories about family breakdown the dosses the manitows and it had come down to just another psychopath i paged through police reports found the seattle cases the data on marissa bonpaine was halfway through the small print when the doorbell rang leaving the file on the desk i trotted to the front door the peephole offered a fisheye view of two peoplea man and a woman white early thirties expressionless cleancut duo missionaries i could use some faith but was in no mood to be preached to yes i said through the door i watched the womans mouth move dr delaware fbi may we please speak with you throaty voice of a lounge singer before i could answer a badge filled the peephole i opened the door the womans lips were turned upward but the smile appeared painful her badge was still out special agent mary donovan this is special agent mark bratz may we please come in dr delaware donovan was fivesix or so with short lightbrown hair a strong jaw and a firm busty lowwaisted body packed into a charcoal gray suit rosy complexion an aura of confidence bratz was a half head taller with dark hair starting to thin sleepy eyes and a round vulnerable face the skin around his jowls was raw and a small bandaid was stuck under one ear he wore a navy blue suit white shirt grayandnavy tie i stepped back to let them enter they stood in the entry hall checking out the house until i invited them to sit thanks for your time doctor said donovan still smiling as she took the most comfortable chair she carried a huge black cloth purse which she placed on the floor bratz waited until id settled then positioned himself so the two of them flanked me i tried to look casual thinking about the open file on the desk trying not to think about what id just seen in glendale nice house said bratz bright thanks may i ask what this is about very nice said donovan care to guess doctor something to do with agent fusco something to do with mr fusco hes not with the fbi not any longer said bratz his voice was high tentative like that of a bashful kid asking for a date mr fusco retired from the bureau a while backwas asked to retire because of personal issues said donovan she took a pad and a sony minirecorder out of her bag set them on the coffee table mind if i record record what your impressions of mr fusco sir youre saying he was mustered out because of personal issues i said are we talking criminal issues is he dangerous donovan glanced at bratz may i record sir after you tell me whats going on maybe donovans fingernails tapped the sony surprisingly long nails french tips her lipstick was subtle her expression wasnt she had no use for civilians who didnt fall in line sir she said its in your best interests i need to know is fusco a criminal suspect as in multiple murder at this point sir were simply trying to find him to help him her index finger touched the sonys rec button i shook my head sir we could arrange for you to be questioned at bureau headquarters that would take time paperwork and something tells me times of the essence i said on the other hand you could tell me whats going on and i could cooperate and we could all try to have something of a weekend she looked at bratz no signal for him that i saw but she turned back to me and her expression had softened heres a summary doctor all you need to know and more leimert fusco was a highly admired member of the bureaui assume youve heard of the bsu the original behavioral science unit at quantico mr fusco was a member of the freshman class actually hes dr fusco has a phd in psychology same as you so he informed me why was he asked to leave the bureau bratz leaned across and clicked on the recorder said howd you meet him sir sorry im not comfortable with this i said sorry about a lot more moments ago id been ready to focus on michael burke as the real dr death if fusco had lied what happened to that scenario whats the problem sir said donovan talking to you going on record without knowing the full picture i spent time with fusco i need to know who i was dealing with another looked passed between them donovans mouth turned up again and she crossed her legs setting off little scratchy sounds short legs but shapely runners calves in sheer stockings bratz snuck a peek at them as if they were still a novelty i wondered how long theyd been partnered fair enough sir she said suddenly sunny she tossed her hair but it didnt move much leg recross she inched closer to me i could imagine some fbi seminar achieve rapport with the subject by any appropriate means but first let me take a stab at how you met him he contacted detective sturgis and asked to meet with you to discuss a homicidemost likely that of dr mate because youre the psychological consultant on the case he told you he knows who the murderer is lots of teeth howm i doing so far very well i said michael burke said bratz he wanted you to believe in dr michael burke is burke fiction bratz shrugged lets just say dr fuscos obsessed with burke with the idea of burke said donovan are you telling me he made burke up she glanced at the recorder switched it off okay heres the whole story but we insist you keep it confidential agent fusco had an honorable career with the bureau for several years he was assigned to the midtown manhattan office as director of behavioral sciences five years ago his wife diedbreast cancerand he was left sole parent of his child a daughter fourteen years old named victoria what made mrs fuscos death especially traumatic for agent fusco was that victoria had also been diagnosed with cancer several years before as a toddler a bone tumor she was treated at sloankettering apparently cured shortly after his wife passed away fusco requested a transfer said he wanted to raise victoria in a quieter environment an administrative position was found for him in the buffalo office and he purchased a home near lake erie not a career move i said he was devoted to the girl donovan nodded everything seemed fine for a couple of years then the girl got sick again at sixteen leukemia apparently the radiation shed received for her bone tumor years ago had caused it secondary tumor i said rare but tragic id seen it at western peds exactly agent fusco began bringing victoria down to new york to be retreated at sloankettering she went into one remission relapsed received more chemo achieved only a partial remission started to weaken tried some experimental drugs and got better but even weaker agent fusco decided to continue her treatment closer to home at a hospital in buffalo the goal was to increase her strength until she was able to tolerate a bonemarrow transplant back in new york she improved for a while then came down with pneumonia because chemotherapy had weakened her immune system her doctors hospitalized her and unfortunately she passed away was that expected from what we can gather it wasnt unexpected but neither was it inevitable one of those fiftyfifty situations said bratz a hospital in buffalo i said was she cared for by a respiratory tech named roger sharveneau donovan frowned looked at bratz he shook his head but she said possibly possibly roger sharveneau was on duty during victorias final hospitalization whether he was ever her therapist is unclear missing records i said whats the difference said bratz was michael burke also working there during that period bratzs eyes narrowed donovan said theres no record of burke caring for her but he was circulating through at the time probably freelancing at the er i said silence from both of them i went on when did fusco become convinced that someonesharveneau or burke or both of themhad murdered his daughter months later said donovan after sharveneau began confessing fusco claimed he recognized him from the ward had seen him in victorias room when he had no good reason to be there he tried to interview sharveneau in jail was refused permission by the buffalo police because the bureau had no standing in the case and he certainly didntit was obviously a personal issue agent fusco didnt react well to that after sharveneau was released he persisted harassing sharveneaus lawyer he became increasingly irate even after sharveneau committed suicide he didnt cease was fusco considered a suspect in sharveneaus supposed suicide i said seconds hesitation no never sharveneau had been in hiding theres no evidence fusco ever found him meanwhile agent fuscos work product deteriorated and the bureau sent him back to quantico for several months had him teach seminars to beginning profilers as a coolingoff measure it seemed to be working fusco looked calm more content but that turned out to be a ruse he was utilizing the bulk of his energies researching burke accessing data banks without permission he was brought back to new york for a meeting with his superiors during which he was let go on disability pension emotional disability said bratz you see him as seriously disturbed i said out of touch with reality bratz exhaled looked uncomfortable youve met him said donovan what do you think doctor to me he seemed pretty focused thats the problem doctor too much focus hes already committed a score of felonies violent felonies mostly multiple thefts of what dataofficial police records from various jurisdictions and he continues to represent himself as a special agent if all that got out doctor the bureau has sympathy for his misfortune the bureau respects him respects what he once was no one wants to see him end up in jail is he off base on burke i said burkes not the issue said bratz why not burkes not the issue for ms donovan clarified we handle only internal investigations not external criminal matters sa fuscos been identified as an internal issue is anyone in the bureau looking into michael burke we wouldnt have access to that information sir our goal is simple take custody of leimert fusco for his own good what happens to him if you find him i said hell be cared for committed donovan frowned cared for humanely forget all the movies youve seen dr fuscos a private citizen now due the same rights as anyone else hell be cared for until such a time as hes judged competentits for his own good doctor no one wants to see a man of his fortitude and experience end up in jail bratz said weve been looking for him for a while finally traced him to la he covers his tracks pretty well got himself a cell phone account under another name but we found it and it led us to an apartment in culver city by the time we got there he was gone packed up then an hour ago you called and we just happened to be there lucky break for you i said where is he doctor dont know his hand clenched why were you attempting to call him sir to discuss michael burke im sure you know im a psychological consultant to lapd ive been asked to interface with sa fusco i shrugged thats it come on doctor said bratz you dont want to be putting yourself in an awkward position well be contacting detective sturgis soon enough hell tell us the truth be my guests bratz hemmed me closer and i sniffed mentholated cologne his jaw was set no more vulnerability why would you care about dr burke a suspects already in custody on mate being thorough i said thorough bratz repeated just like fusco you know doctor said donovan some people say youre kind of obsessive i smiled how long before the prints on alice zoghbies gate got decoded and they found out about it sounds like youve been researching me we can be thorough too if only everyone was i said better world the trains would run on time bratz rubbed a patch of raw skin and looked at the recorder nothing of substance had been recorded you think this is a joke my friend you think we want to sit around with you bullshitting i turned and looked into his eyes i doubt youre enjoying this any more than i am but that doesnt change the facts you asked me if i knew where fusco was i told you the truth i dont he said hed be out of town left the cellphone number i tried it and he didnt answer so i phoned the federal building obviously thats something he didnt instruct me to do so were obviously not colluding on anything what cell number did he give you hold on and ill get it for you you do that said bratz barely opening his mouth i went into my office stashed the accordion file in a drawer copied down the number and returned bratz was on his feet studying prints on the wall donovans nylonglossed knees were pressed together i handed her the slip same one weve got mark she said bratz said lets get out of here i said even if fusco had left me a detailed itinerary why would it be any more credible than anything else he told me youre saying fusco just told you about burke then dropped out of sight told detective sturgis and myself we met with him together just as you said where morts deli sturgis didnt buy the burke theory basically shunted it to me as you said hes got a suspect and your opinion about what burke i need more data thats exactly why i tried to reach fusco if id known it was going to get this complicated bratz turned toward me understand this if fusco keeps improvising it could get real complicated makes sense i said rogue agent running wild psychological expert goes haywire public relations nightmare for you guys something wrong with that protecting the bureaus integrity so it can do its job not at all nothing wrong with integrity true doctor said donovan just make sure youre holding on to yours i watched them drive away in a dark blue sedan theyd labeled fusco obsessive but hadnt dismissed the core of his investigation an internal issue not their problem meaning someone else in the bureau might very well be looking into michael burke or they werent when news of the zoghbiehaiselden murder broke fuscos nose would twitch harder hed probably try to contact milo even fly back down to la get snagged by his former comrades taken into custody for his own good hed had a tragic life but right now worrying about his welfare wasnt my job either i went back inside gave milo yet another try daring another attempt at the west la station ready to disguise my voice if the same clerk answered this time it was a boredsounding man who patched me up to the robberyhomicide room a familiar voice picked up milos extension del hardy a long time ago the veteran detective and milo had worked together del was black which hadnt mattered much and married to a second wife who was a devout baptist which hadshed kiboshed the partnership i knew del was a year from retirement planning something down in florida working saturday del long as its not sunday doc hows the guitarplaying not doing enough of it seen the big guy recently happened to see him about an hour ago he said he was going over to judge maclntyres house try for some warrants pasadenai can give you the number if its important but judge maclntyre gets cranky about being bugged on the weekend so why dont you try milos mobile i did he didnt answer maybe he shut it off didnt want to annoy judge maclntyre scary guy huh maclntyre yeah but law and order if he thinks youre righteous hell give all sorts of leewayokay here it is a frostyvoiced woman said whats this about im a police consultant working on a homicide case its important that i reach detective sturgis is he there one minute four minutes later she came back on hes on his way out said hell call you it took another quarter hour for milo to ring in whats so important alex how the hell did you get maclntyres numberyou almost messed me up i was in the middle of getting paper on doss got some too sorry but you were wasting your time i told him what id seen in alice zoghbies backyard the way id reported it to the police clerk my prints on the gate this is a joke right he said ha ha ha long silence whyd you go out there in the first place alex boredom overachievementwhats the difference this changes everything where are you right now home just finished with some visitors i began to tell him about donovan and bratz stop he said im coming overno better if we meet somewhere just in case theyre still watching you i just got on the lets make it somewhere central picorobertson the parking lot behind the millers outpost southeast corner if im late buy yourself some jeans and try to figure out if the feebies are tailing you if they are i doubt theyll be using more than one car which will make it damn near impossible for them to pull it off if youre looking out for them did you happen to notice what kind of car they were driving blue sedan check for it three four car lengths behind you if you see it drive back home and wait high intrigue low intrigue he said bureaucracys big toes getting stepped on zoghbie and haiseldendid you notice any overt putrefaction green tinge no maggots lots of flies probably a day or two at most and youre saying the positioning was similar to the stuff in fuscos file identical geometrical wounds as well oh my he said every day brings new thrills i wrote a note to robin and left drove more slowly than usual looked out for the blue sedan or anything else that spelled governmentissue no sign of a tail as far as i could tell i reached the millers outpost lot before milo parked where hed instructed got out of the car and stood against the drivers door still no blue car the lot was half full shoppers streamed in and out of the store business at a nearby newsstand was brisk cars roared by on robertson i waited and thought about putrefaction milo showed up ten minutes later surprisingly wellputtogether in a gray suit white shirt maroon tie warrantbegging duds no string tie for judge maclntyre he motioned me into the unmarked lit up the cold stub of a panatela as i eased into the passenger seat he scanned the lot fondled his cell phone let his eyes drift to the jeans store time to get myself some easyfit glendales at the scenetheyve pegged it to an anonymous caller how does it feel to be an archetype glorious but i wont be anonymous long the gate yeah terrific im waiting to hear back from their detectives news jackals picked it up too its only a matter of time before they tie zoghbie and haiselden to mate and were back on page one thats exactly what burke wants i said but maybe he had another motive for killing zoghbie and haiselden to get hold of any records that incriminated him he might very well have been planning it for a while but richards arrest might have sped things up he wouldnt like someone else getting credit for his handiwork like mate hes after the attention is eliminating the old guard telling the world hes the new dr death he chewed the cigars wooden tip blew out acrid smoke you buy the whole burke thing even though fusco misrepresented himself when will you be going over to the zoghbie crime scene soon wait till you see it everything fits and donovan and bratz never dismissed fuscos findings theyre just worried hell do something that makes the bureau look bad fuscos convinced sharveneau andor burke murdered his daughter personal motivation can get in the way but sometimes its potent fuel he sucked in smoke held it in his lungs for a long time drew a lazy circle on the windshield fog so ive been spinning my wheels on doss who from what ive been told by business associates has very complicated financial recordsmaybe ill send my files to the fraud boys he faced me alex you know damn well he solicited goad to kill mate were not talking mother teresa just because goad didnt go all the way doesnt put doss in the clear i realize that but it doesnt change what i saw in glendale right he said back to square goddamn one burke or whatever the hell hes calling himself youre saying he craves center stage but he cant go public the way mate did so what does that mean more nasties against trees his laugh was thick with affliction and anger gee thats a terrific lead lets go check out every bit of bark in the goddamn countywhere the hell do i go with this alex back to fuscos files i said youve already been through them okay ill accept the fact that burke is evil personified now where the hell do i find him ill go over them again you never know youre right about that he said i never do know spend half my damn life in blissless ignorance okay lets handle some shortterm matters like keeping you out of jail once those prints crossreference to the medical board did you touch anything but the gate the front door knocker i also knocked on the side door but just with my knuckles the old goats head he said when i first saw it i wondered if alice was into witchcraft or something that combined with all her talk of mate being a sacrifice so she ends up tied up all right look im going to run interference for you with glendale pd but at some point youll have to talk to them itll take days for the prints to be analyzed maybe a good week for the crossreference even longer if the med files arent on printrak but i need to work with them so im telling them about you soonerfigure on tomorrow ill try to have them interview you on friendly territory thanks yeah thanks too he inhaled made the cigar tip glow created another quarter inch of ash for what being such a persistent bastard whats next i said for you keeping out of trouble for me anguish want fuscos file later he said theres still dosss paper to deal with i cant let warrants lapse on an attempted murder case i do that and judge maclntyre puts me on his naughty list ill sic korn and demetri on dosss office have them shlep the financial records to the station so i can get moving at glendale maybe the scene will tell me something maybe burkewhatever missed something in alices house and we can get a lead on him he crushed the cigar in the ashtray fat chance of that right anythings possible everythings possible he said thats the problem by the time i got back robin was home we had a takeout chinese dinner and i fed slivers of peking duck to spike acting like a regular domestic guy with nothing heavier on my mind than taxes and prostate problems this time i went to sleep when robin did and drifted off easily at am i woke up with a stiff neck and a stubborn brain cold air had settled in during the night and my hands felt like freezerburned steaks i put on sweats athletic socks and slippers shuffled to my office removed fuscos file from the drawer where id concealed it from donovan and bratz starting again with marissa bonpaine finding nothing out of the ordinary but the plastic hypodermic an hour in i got drowsy the smart decision would have been to crawl back in bed instead i lurched to the kitchen spike was curled up on his mattress in the adjacent laundry room flat little bulldog face compressed against the foam movement beneath his eyelids said he was dreaming his expression said they were sweet dreamsa beautiful woman drives you around in her truck and feeds you kibble why not i headed for the pantry generally thats a stimulus for him to hurry over assume the squat wait for food this time he raised an eyelid shot me a youve got to be kidding look and resumed snoring i chewed on some dry cereal made a tall mug of strong instant coffee drank half trying to dispel the chill the kitchen windows were blue with night the suggestion of foliage was a distant black haze i checked the clock forty minutes before daybreak i carried the mug back to my office time for more tilting mr quixote i returned to my desk ten minutes later i saw it wondered why i hadnt seen it before a notation made by the first seattle officer on the bonpaine murder scenea detective named robert elias called in by the forest rangers whod actually found the body very small print bottom of the page crossreferenced to a footnote easy to missno excuses delaware now it screamed at me the victim wrote elias was discovered by a hiker walking with his dog see ref that led me to the rear of the bonpaine file a listing of over three hundred events enumerated by the meticulous detective elias number read hiker tourist from michigan mr ferris grant number was an address and phone number in flint michigan number dog black labr retriev mr f grant states she has great nose thinks shes a drug dog id heard that before word for word paul ulrich describing duchess the golden retriever ferris grant michael ferris burke grant rushton flint michigan huey grant mitchell had worked in michiganann arbor i phoned the number ferris grant had left as his home exchange got a recorded message from the flint museum of art no sign elias had followed up why would he bother ferns grant had been nothing more than a helpful citizen whod aided a major investigation by discovering the body just as paul ulrich had discovered mate how burke must have loved that orchestrating providing himself with a legitimate reason to show up at the crime scene proud of his handiwork watching the cops stumble psychopaths private joke games always games his internal laughter must have been deafening hiker with a dog paul ulrich tanya stratton i paged hurriedly to the photo gallery leimert fusco had assembled tried to reconcile any of the more recent portraits of burke with my memory of ulrich but ulrichs face wouldnt take shape in my head all i recalled was the handlebar mustache which was exactly the point facial hair changed things id been struck by that when trying to reconcile the various photos of burke the beard burke had grown as huey mitchell hospital security guard as effective as any mask hed gone on to use another michigan identity ferris grant the flint museum another ha ha im an artist reverting to michiganto familiar patterns because at heart psychopaths were rigid there always had to be a script of sorts i studied mitchells picture the dead eyes the flat expression luxuriant mask of a beard heavy enough to nurture a giant mustache when i tried to picture ulrichs face all i saw was the mustache i strained to recall his other physical characteristics mediumsize man late thirties to forty perfect match to burke on both counts shorter thinner hair than any of burkes pictures balding to a fuzzy crew cut each picture of burke revealed a steady sequential loss so that fit too the mustache stretching wider than ulrichs face as good a mask as any id thought it an unusual flamboyance contrasting especially with ulrichs conservative dress financial consultant mr respectable something else ulrich had saidone of the first things hed said came back to me so far our names havent been in the paper were going to be able to keep it that way arent we detective sturgis concerned about publicity craving publicity milo had answered that the two of them would probably be safe from media scrutiny but ukich had stuck with the topic talked about fifteen minutes of fame andy warhol coined that phrase and look what happened to him checked into a hospital went out in a bag celebrity stinks look at princess di look at dr mate letting milo know that fame was what he was after playing with milo the way hed toyed with the seattle cops getting as close as he could to criminal celebrity without confessing outright it had been no coincidence that he and tanya stratton had chosen mulholland for a morning walk that monday stratton had come out and said so we rarely come up here except on sundays resentful about the change in routine about pauls insistence shed complained to milo that everything had been pauls idea including the decision to talk to milo up at the site rather than at home ulrich had claimed to be attempting a kind of therapy for tanya but his real motivemultiple motiveshad been something quite different keep milo off ulrichs home territory and get another chance at deja vu ulrich had talked about the horror of discovering mate but i realized now that emotion had been lacking not so tanya stratton shed been clearly upset eager to leave but ulrich had come across amiable helpful relaxed too relaxed for someone whod encountered a bloodbath an outdoorsy guyfusco had said michael burke skied fancied himself an outdoorsmanulrich had chatted about staying fit the beauty of the site once you get past the gate its like being in another world oh yeah his world amiable guy but the charm was wearing thin with stratton was she edgy because shed begun to sense something about her boyfriend or just a relationship gone stagnant i recalled her pallor the unsteady gait wispy hair dark glasseshiding something a fragile girl not a well girl then i understood and my heart beat faster one of michael burkes patterns was to hook up with sick women befriend them nurture them then guide them out of this world he enjoyed killing on so many levels the consummate dr death and one way or the other the world was going to know it how eldon mates famethe legitimacy mate had obtained while dispatching fifty lives must have eaten at burke all those years in medical school and burke still couldnt practice openly the way mate did had to serve as mates apprentice had to masquerade as a layman because since arriving in la he hadnt found a way to bogus his medical credentials had to represent himself as a financial consultant mostly realestate work century city address nice and ambiguous home base encino just over the hill respectable neighborhood for an upstanding guy in l a you could live off a smile and a zip code the business card ulrich had given milo was sitting in a drawer at the west la station i phoned information and asked for ulrichs century city business listing was only half surprised when i got one but when i tried the number a recording told me the line had been disconnected no encino exchange for either him or tanya stratton nothing anywhere in the valley or the city tanya not a well girl a relationship on the wane with ulrich could prove lethal i looked at the clock just after six light through the office curtains said the sun had risen if milo had been up all night at the glendale crime scene hed be home now getting some welldeserved rest some things could wait i phoned him rick answered on the first ring up early alex did i wake you not hardly i was just about to leave for the er milos already gone gone where he didnt say probably back to glendale that double murder he was out there until midnight came home slept for four hours woke in a foul mood showered without singing and left the house with his hair still wet the joys of domestic life i said oh yeah he said give me a nice freeway pileup and i know im being useful milo picked up his mobile barking sturgis its me where are you up on mulholland he said in an odd detached voice staring at dirt trying to figure out if i missed something son im going to bring some joy into your wretched life i told him about ulrich i expected shock profanity but his voice remained remote funny you should mention that you figured it out no but i was just wondering about ulrich because i positioned my car where the van was walked myself through the scene when the sun came up it hit the rear window and gave off glare blinding glare i couldnt see a thing inside ulrich claimed he and the girl discovered mate right after sunrise said he could see mates body through the rear window now that was a week ago and the vans windows were higher than mine but i dont calculate that much of a difference and i dont imagine the suns angle has shifted that radically i was waiting around to see if the visibility changed over the next quarter hour or so by itself it wasnt any big deal maybe the guy didnt remember every detail but now youre telling me left the bastards address back at the station ill run a dmv on him and the stratton girl time for a dropin the stratton girl may be in danger i told him why sick he said yeah she didnt look too healthy did she all the more reason to visit howre you going to handle ulrich i dont exactly have grounds for an arrest alex at the moment all i can do is scope him out in his natural habitatmy story will be that im dropping in for a followup has he thought of anything else cause were stumpedhed like that right the cops being stupid my coming to him for wisdom hed love it i said if he believed it but this is a smart man hed have to wonder why after richards arrest youre knocking on his door on a sunday morning silence how about i imply there are complications with the current investigationstuff i cant talk about hell know i mean zoghbie but i wont come out and say it well tango around i can watch his eyes and his feet maybe stratton will give off some kind of vibe maybe ill get her alone later on in the day sounds good want me there silence static finally he said yes when i walked into the bedroom robin was sitting up and rubbing her eyes morning i kissed her forehead and began to get dressed what time is it how long have you been up early just a bit have to run and meet milo up on mulholland oh she said sleepily something come up maybe i said that opened her eyes wide a possible lead i said nothing dangerous brain work she held out her arms we embraced take good care of it she said your brain i love your brain chapter milo was parked on the road below the murder site engine running fingers tapping the steering wheel i left the seville a few yards away and got in the unmarked he was wearing the same gray suit but it looked ten years older driving east on mulholland he reached the glen headed north into the valley whered you get the address i said dmv no listings for ulrichs bmw or any other vehicle in his name but the stratton girl owns a twoyearold saturn has an address on milbank sherman oaks not encino too far east by two blocks why tell the truth when you can lie setting up the scene he just loves this doesnt he every detail i said remember what you said about the only footprints being his and strattons he cleaned up after himself but just in case he missed something he gave himself a legitimate reason to leave behind trace evidence all these years orchestrating goddamn conductor he took one hand off the wheel raised it toward the roof lord grant me the opportunity to shove his baton up his ass anything else you think i should know before i approach him act friendly but authoritative dont go overboard on either while youre listening to him let your eyes roam let him try to figure out if its cop curiosity or youre looking for something lets see how he reacts to the uncertainty ask him lots of questions but keep it general outofsequence questions like you do so well dropping in on him without warning is good youll be the one orchestrating if he gets nervous he may do something impulsive like pack up and leave once he thinks youre gone or try to hide somethinga storage locker hes likely to have one cant afford to have tanya come across his souvenirs youre sure he keeps them ill bet on it once you leave can you get surveillance in place pretty quickly one way or the other hell be watched alex if i have to do it myself hell be watched okay so youre talking a oneman goodcopbadcop show but keep it subtle yeah i can do subtle even without the benefit of alcohol whatll you be concentrating on playing impassive shrink if i can get tanya alone ill take a closer look at her why you suspect her too no but shes tiring of him maybe shell say something revealing he bared his teeth in what i assumed was a smile fine weve got our plan all that accomplished then can i shove it up his ass his gas foot was heavy and the ride took fifteen minutes whipping us past canyon beauty and the barbered anxiety of hillside suburbia accelerating into a toofast left turn across ventura the valley was ten degrees warmer encino appeared just past sepulveda and the lowrise shops of sherman oaks gave way to mirrored office buildings and car lots very little traffic this early on a sleepy sunday the freeway ribboned across the intersection parallel with the western flank of the white carcass that had once been the sherman oaks galleria the shopping center was shuttered now all the more pathetic in death because of its size someone had plans for the space someone always had plans milo drove a block turned right on orion stayed parallel with the freeway headed west on camarillo circling around to the mouth of milbank a shady street with no sidewalks singlestory houses wellmaintained dimmed by the luxuriance of untrimmed camphor trees off to the east the freeway thundered tanya strattons address matched a white gibill dream box with blue trim carefully tended lawn but less landscaping than its neighbors no cars in the driveway two throwaway papers on the oil spot shuttered windows whitepainted iron security grate across the front door mailbox mounted on the steel mesh another white metal door blocked access to the rear yard someone likes their privacy i said milo frowned we got out walked to the security door a button was mounted on the front wall of the house near the jamb of the security door milo pushed it and i could hear the buzzer sound inside the house no answer no barking i remarked on that said maybe they took duchess on one of their earlymorning walks on sunday he said hey hes a fit guy he lifted the lid of the mailbox inside were four envelopes and two circulars from fastfood restaurants he inspected the postmarks yesterdays he toed the grate i watched his lips form a silent curse as he stared at the jewelbright brass dead bolt who knows what the hells in there but ulrich finding the body aint exactly grounds for a warrant hell i dont even exercise the warrants i do get you didnt end up serving richard he shook his head so much for any future relationship with maclntyre spent all night with my glendale colleagues who by the way will not arrest you for trespassing a crime scene they wouldnt know it was a crime scene unless i trespassed technicalities technicalities he punched the button again rubbed his face loosened his tie glanced over at the door barring the yard lets go back to the car try to figure something out meanwhile ill run searches on ulrichs aliases he repeated the hiker mo used michigan twice so maybe hes recycled an identity he tried dmv again inquiring about michael ferris burke grant rushton huey mitchell hank spreen with no success wed been sitting for a few minutes alternating between silence and deadend suggestions when a small red car drove up and parked across the street nissan sentra darkhaired woman at the wheel she turned off her engine started to get out when she saw us then she flashed a nervous stare and up went the drivers window milo was out in a second jogging over flashing the badge the nissans window stayed up he produced his business card i saw his lips move finally the glass lowered as if in appreciation milo backed away gave the woman space she exited the red car looked at me then at milo he had his hands in his pockets was making himself a bit smaller the way he does when hes trying to put someone at ease i joined them the woman was in her thirties slightly heavy brown hair highlighted with rust sooty shadows under her brightblue eyes and a speck of mascara under one of them she wore a bulky white cowlneck tshirt black leggings black flats the rear of the car was filled with fabric samples in binders whats wrong she said eyeing the white house do you live in the neighborhood maam my sister does across the street ms stratton yes her voice strained half an octave higher whats going on we came to ask your sister and mr ulrich some questions maam about what happenedabout their finding dr mate your sister talked to you about that ms lamplear kris lamplear sure we talked about it it wasnt exactly an everyday thing not in detail tanya was grossed out she called me to tell me they found it him is there some problem tanyas already been through a lot how so maam said milo she was sick a year and a half ago thats why im here she was sick and im overprotective she doesnt like me to be but i cant help it i try to give her space usually we talk only two three times a week but i havent heard from her in a few days so i called her at work friday and they said shed taken some vacation time i held off yesterday but today she frowned shes entitled to her vacation but she shouldve told me where she was going does she usually i said sheepish smile honestly not always but i dont let that stop me what can i say i decided to stop by this morning early cause my kids have little league in an hour just to make sure everythings okay so theres no problem you just want to talk to her right just following up maam said milo he eyed the fabric samples interiordesign work fabric sales i work for a jobber downtown another glance at the house milo said looks like theyve been gone for only a day or so do they travel a lot from time to time kris lamplears eyes jumped around paul probably took her somewhere on one of his impulsive romantic things hes a romantic fellow he thinks he is she rolled her eyes mr spontaneous hell come in and announce theyre going to arrowhead or santa barbara for a couple of days tells tanya to pack call in sick tanyas ultraresponsible she takes her job seriously but she goes along with him usually he works for himself so taking off like thats no big deal he likes nature stuff loves to drive nature stuff said milo the great outdoors hes a member of the tree people the sierra club watches birds actually reads the autoclub magazine it was his idea to be up there on mulholland at that hour hes always pushing tanya to rise and shine exercise all that stuff as if thats going to do the trick do what trick heal her up she said make sure she stays in remissionshe had cancer hodgkins disease the doctors said it was curable shes got a good chance of being cured but the treatment knocked her out radiation chemo heavyduty the whole thing changed her she is fine i know shell be okay but im sorry im still the protective older sister so sue me she should at least tell me where shes going dont you think our parents are gone the two of us are it she knows i worry she tugged her shirt down stared at the house i know im being neurotic ill get home and therell be a message from herdont tell her you met me here okay shell get pod deal said milo so you dont keep a house key for her you mean like some people do that would be nice wouldnt it but no id never ask for one tanya wouldnt take well to that wanting to be independent kris lamplear nodded her having a key to my house would be fine and im married have kids i wouldnt mind but shed be all sensitive even when she was going through her treatments she was that way telling everyone she could do things for herself not to treat her like a cripple so pauls a handsoff guy i said what do you mean to get along with tanya hed have to respect her independence i guess she said to be honest i dont know why she stays with him maybe cause he was there for her when she was down when she was sick i said she nodded thats how they met tanya was in the hospital for her chemo and he was volunteering there he ended up spending a lot of time with her when she couldnt hold food down hed be there feeding her ice chips describing an altruistic act but she sounded disapproving i said nice guy i guessi used to wonder why he was doing all that to be honest he doesnt seem like the volunteering typebut whats the difference she makes her own decisions you dont like him i said if tanya likes him no to be honest i think hes a pompous jerk i think tanya may be seeing it too finally her smile was reluctant mischievous maybe its wishful thinking but she doesnt defend him as much when i tell her hes a pompous jerk i smiled back which hospital did they meet at valley comprehensive over in reseda a dump as far as im concerned but thats where her hmo said she had to go why all these questions about paul milo said he and your sister are important witnesses in a homicide case we need to be extra thorough does paul still volunteer at the hospital nope soon as tanya was discharged and they were dating he quit thats what made me wonder about what about if it was just a technique to hit on women shes recuperating and all of a sudden theyre dating couple of months later both of them move out of their apartments and they rent this place how long ago was that over a year she said i shouldnt put him down if she likes him he treats her well enough does the cooking the cleaningall the cleaning now thats a good deal doesnt leave clothes on the floorhes real neat a neat freak i never saw tanya live so organized he even grooms duchesstanyas dogcan spend a half hour brushing her duchess likes him now at first she didnt and im thinking yes animals have a sense but then she took to him and im thinking what do i know or maybe dogs arent that smart after all it was duchess who got them into this mess by findingbut you know that dont you what else did tanya tell you about finding dr mate not much like i said she was grossed outtanya isnt much of a talker anyway paul was really into it though im sure hell be jazzed that youre back to ask him more questions whys that said milo he thought it was neatfascinating he called it learning about police procedure after tanya called me i came over to give her support paul had the tv on waiting to see if he and tanya would be on so hell be jazzed at more attention happy to oblige said milo any idea where we can find him no like i said it could be anywhere he announces to tanya theyre going somewhere and most of the time she agrees he drives and she sleeps in the car most of the time i said sometimes she puts her foot down she doesnt like when her work piles up when she turns him down paul gets all pouty and usually he stays home and keeps pouting but sometimes he goes off by himself for a day or so i have no idea where they are but you could try malibu thats the one place tanya likes to go where in malibu said milo keeping his voice casual not the beach weve gottanya and i own some land up in the malibu mountains western malibu its more like agoura across the ventura county line and up into the hills five six acres i dont even know the exact size our parents bought it years ago dad was going to build a house but he never got around to it i never go there because theres really nothing there and its kind of a messdinky little cabin no phone gross bathroom tiny little septic tank half the time the electricity lines are down the roads always washing out my kids would go crazy from boredom there but tanya likes it tanya likes things quiet when she was recuperating from chemo she went there or maybe it was to show she was tough she can be stubborn the place is probably worth some money now i wouldve sold it a long time ago does paul like it i said being a tree person probably what paul really likes is to drive just for the sake of drivinglike gas is free and hes got all the time in the world working for himself in real estate i dont know what he does in real estatehe doesnt seem to work much but he must be doing okay she said he always has money isnt stingy with tanya ill grant him that buys her jewelry clothes whatever plus he cooks and cleans so what am i complaining about right milo copied down directions to the cabin promised to let her know if her sister was there great she said then she frowned that means shell know i was here checking up on her cause im the only one who knows about malibu do the people at her job know your number he said maybe she listed you as her emergency contact kris lamplear brightened thats true she did great well just tell her thats how we reached you okay thankstheres nothing wrong is there with tanya and paul what would be wrong maam i dont know you just seem awfully eager to talk to them just what i said maam followup its a highprofile case weve got to do everything we can to avoid looking stupid that i understand she smiled no one likes looking stupid chapter he sped onto the the intersection with the west was nearly immediate the heavy traffic was flowing east and soon we were sailing malibu he said sounds familiar oh yeah a few years ago robin and i had rented a beach house just over the county line the mouth of the canyon road kris lamplear had described was less than a half mile away id gone hiking up there myself passing campgrounds the occasional private property mostly state land walled by mountainside i remembered long stretches of solitude silence broken by birdcalls coyote howls the occasional roar of a toofast truck brainfeeding silence but sometimes it had seemed too quiet up there paul likes to drive he went on your basic prerequisite for serial killer school a neat freak and the bastard likes to drive now why didnt i think of that couldve arrested him the first time i met him saved the city a lot of overtime tsk tsk and dont forget his generosity i said gives his girlfriend jewelry i wonder how much of it was previously owned he gave a dispirited laugh trophies lord knows what else he hangs on to he exited at kanan took it down to pch and raced north along the beach the coast highway was virtually empty past trancas canyon the ocean was serene low tide breaking lazily too blue to be real we crossed the county line at mulholland highway just past leo carrillo beach where a handful of beachcombers walked the tide pools back to mulholland end of the trail no way to travel mulholland from start to finish the road was thirtyplus miles of blacktop girding la from east hollywood to the pacific choked off in several places by wilderness nothing important comes easy had michael burkepaul ulrich thought of that when selecting his killspot a mile into ventura milo hooked right veering toward the land side i caught a peek of my rented house on the private beach just ahead a wedge of weathered wood visible beyond a sharp curve of the highway robin and i had liked it out there watching the pelicans and dolphins not minding the rust that seemed to settle in daily wed stayed there nearly a year while our house in the glen was being rebuilt the moment the lease was up the landlord had handed the place over to his brilliant aspiringscreenwriter son in hopes of spurring junior to creativity the only time id met junior hed been drunk id never seen anything with his name on it at the multiplex kids today the car climbed into the mountains neither of us talked as we searched for the unmarked road that led to the property address on the mailbox kris lamplear had said the first time milo overshot and had to circle back finally we found it nearly five miles from the ocean well past its nearest neighbor preceded by a good mile of state land the mailbox was ten feet up the entrance concealed by a cloud of plumbago vine rusty box on a weathered post its door missing most of the goldfoil address numerals gone too the three digits that remained were withered and curling nothing in the box the air was cool sweet and the unmarkeds idling engine seemed deafening milo backed out parked on the road turned off the motor and we returned to the mailbox on foot ahead of us the dirt roadmore of a pathswept to the left and flattened in an s that snaked through the greenery nothing in the immediate distance but more vines shrubbery trees lots of trees milo said no sense announcing ourselves giving him a chance to orchestrate lets see if we can get a view of the cabin watch it for a while we walked a thousand feet before it came into view graying clapboard barely discernible through a thickening colonnade of pine and gum trees and sycamores old twisted sycamores just like the one where alice zoghbie and roy haiselden had been propped had ulrichburke noticed that i thought he had he would have liked that the symmetry neatness the irony frosting on the old murder cake if milo was thinking that he wasnt putting it into words he trudged steadily but very slowly mouth set eyes swiveling from side to side one arm loose the other at his belt inches from his service revolver more tension than readiness for battle hed stashed his shotgun in the trunk of the unmarked the path finally ended at an eggshaped parking area partially edged by large circular rocks the border looked like someones primitive attempt at hardscape long disrupted by the elements two cars ulrichs navy bmw and tanya strattons coppercolored saturn ulrich had told us a tale of another dark bmw stationed on mulholland bmw like ours id agonized over whether the car had been richards richard or eric at the wheel but it had existed only in ulrichs lie orchestrating the building was just beyond the cars at the rear of the property and we approached trying to shield ourselves behind trees straining for a better look finally we had a view of the front door open but blocked by a dirtylooking screen ugly little thing not much more than a shed shoved up against a mountain wall and surrounded by brush tarpaper roof the browngreen of a stagnant pond the clapboard once white now murky as laundry water nearly hidden by low branchesone bough swooped within a foot of the dooras if yielding itself to green strangulation up above barely visible through the sycamores was a mountain ridge crowned by a thick black coiffure of pines more state land no prying neighbors we advanced to within twenty yards of the cabin before milo stopped ducked off the path and into the brush motioning me quickly to do the same a second later the screen door opened and tanya stratton stepped out letting it slam shut with a snaredrum rattle she wore a longsleeved tan shirt blue jeans white sneakers had her hair tucked into a red bandanna no dark glasses this time but she was too far away for us to see her eyes she stretched yawned went to her car and popped the trunk the cabin door opened again exposing a stretch of arm tan arm male arm but ulrich didnt appear holding the screen ajar a goodlooking golden retriever bounded out and raced to tanya strattons side duchess great nose thinks shes a drug dog great milo whispered so much for surveillance speaking so softly i had to read his lips but the dogs ears perked and she pivoted toward us began nosing the ground walking picking up speed tanya stratton said duchess treat and the dog froze in her tracks shook herself off turned and ran toward her mistress stratton had pulled a bag out of the trunk now she opened it reached inside dangled something in front of duchesss nose sit wait the dog settled on her haunches watched the milkbone that tanya waved near her nose tanya said good girl gave her the bone ruffled the fur around the retrievers neck duchess stayed by tanyas side waited till tanya let her back into the cabin good dog muttered milo he looked at his timex separate cars what do you make of that maybe tanyas planning on leaving before him work obligations like her sister said he thought about that nodded leaving him alone to do his thing which could be sticking close to base or taking another drive maybe hes got stuff stashed here buried here meaning i cant afford to mess up any of the search rules gonna have to coordinate with malibu sheriffs to keep it kosher maybe the best thing is back off find somewhere to watch the road see if tanya leaves then what he doesif shes not in immediate danger his pattern with his women friends is to wait until theyve gotten ill again minister to them then take it all the way then again he may have hastened the process along poison hed know how so what are you saying forget waiting waltz right in let me think i never got around to it the door opened yet again and this time paul ulrich showed himself fit and wellfed in a white polo shirt khaki pants brown loafers no socks muscular arms ruddy complexion mug of something in one hand he drank placed the cup on the ground took a few steps forward showed us his face two alert sparkling eyes a smudge of rosy skin behind flaring mustaches twin propellers of hair so huge so flamboyant that despite my attempt to get past them to seize upon somethingthe merest grace note of recognitionthat would tie his face into one of the photos in leimert fuscos file my brain processed only mustache facial hair could do that he retrieved his coffee strutted around flexed a bicep and inspected the bulge of muscle another sip big stretch so content top of the morning the mustache made him look like a keystone kop nothing funny about him milos hand was square on his gun ringers white against the walnut grip scrambling toward the trigger then as if realizing what he was doing he drew it away wiped his hand on his jacket rubbed his face stared at ulrich suddenly ulrich dropped to the ground as if avoiding gunfire we watched him peel off fifty lightning pushups perfect form when he bounced back to his feet he stretched again showing no signs of exertion he ran a hand over his thinning hair rotated his neck flexed his arms worked on the neck some more even killers get stiff all those hours behind the wheel smoothing one mustache he reached behind and picked at his seat even killers untangle their shorts watching itthe banalityi felt let down human they shouldnt be but they always are ulrich finished his coffee placed the mug on the ground once more walked to his own car popped his trunk out came something black small leather case the polished surface reflected the filtered sunlight leaking down through the trees doctors bag ulrich stroked it i whispered there you go milo said what the hell does he need that for right now the cabin door opened again as tanya stepped outside ulrich moved quickly shifting the bag behind his back inching toward his car she took only a few steps was looking away from him up at the treetops ulrich slipped the bag into the trunk lowered the lid sauntered over to tanya not acknowledging him she started to turn was about to reenter the cabin when he reached her slipping one hand around her waist he kissed the back of her neck she was rigid unresponsive ulrich remained behind her maintained his grip around her waist kissed her again and she twisted away from his lips he stroked her cheek but his face unseen by her bore no affection immobile eyes hard and focused face slightly flushed tanya said something broke away from him disappeared back into the cabin ulrich stroked his mustache spit in the dirt walked back to the car quickly face still expressionless flushed scarlet he popped the trunk and retrieved the black bag milo said not good his hand shot back to his gun and now he was stepping out from behind the tree hed barely taken a step when the shot rang out hard and sharp like hands clapping once from behind ulrich above the growth of pine at the ridge milo ran back to his hiding spot gun out but no one to shoot at ulrich didnt drop not right away he stood there as the red spot formed on his chest got redder largerblossoming like a rose captured in timelapse exit wound shot from the back the leather bag remained in his hand the mustache blocked out expression another handclap sounded then another two more roses decorated ulrichs white shirt red shirt hard to believe it had ever been white milos gun hand was rigid still his eyes bounced from ulrich to the pine ridge more applause when the fourth shot sheared off the top of ulrichs head he let the black bag drop to the ground fell on top of it the whole thing had taken less than ten seconds screams from inside the house but no sign of tanya duchess was barking milos gun was still out aimed at the silence the distance the trees that big mustache of trees chapter it took a while for the sheriffs to arrive from the malibu substation even longer to assemble a squad to travel up to the ridge a small army of nervous itchyfingered men in tan uniforms each deputy assuming the shooter was still around wouldnt hesitate to fire as we waited for the group to assemble milo hung out with the coroner did his best to let the sheriffs feel they were in charge while managing to inspect everything he asked me to comfort tanya stratton but i ended up doing nothing of the sort she shut me out refused to talk obtained whatever solace she desired by muttering to her sister over a cell phone and stroking her dog i watched her from a distance the deputies had shunted her away from the crime scene and she sat on the ground beneath a silverdollar tree knees drawn up occasionally pummeling herself softly on the jaw her sunglasses were back on so i couldnt read her eyes the rest of her face said she was shocked furious wondering how many other mistakes shed make over the rest of her life while wed waited for sheriffs milo had inspected the cabin no obvious trophies not much of anything in there a careful search carried out later in the day revealed nothing of an evidentiary nature other than the doctors bag old burnished leather gold initials over the clasp ehm tanya stratton claimed shed never seen it i believed her ulrich would have hidden it from her produced it only when he was ready to use it a while longer and she mightve lost the opportunity to make any mistakes at all inside the bag were scalpels scissors other shiny things a coil of iv tubing sterilepacked hollow needles in various gauges rolls of gauze disposable hypodermic injectors little ampules with smallprint labels thiopental potassium chloride the bag was taken into custody by a sheriffs detective but he never bothered to ask what the gold initials stood for and milo didnt volunteer the information when the search party was ready he and i rode along sitting in back of a squad car listening to nervoustalk from the two deputies in front the woundsthe way theyd passed through ulrich at that distance the size of the exitsindicated a highvelocity bullet probably a military rifle a goodquality scope someone who knew what he was doing how hard it would be to see the shooter if hed chosen to barricade himself among the pines i knew he hadnt hed done his job no reason to stick around gaining access to the pines wasnt very difficult the same road that had swept us past the property with the broken mailbox continued its climb for another mile before forking the right fork reversed direction descending back down toward the coast but never completing the journey as it deadended at a forest preserve named after a longdead california settler a stateprinted sign said scenic views were up ahead but no path was provided the curious were proceeding at their own risk the party fanned out weapons ready an hour later it reconvened roadside no sign of the shooter one of the deputies an experienced backpacker who let us know hed walked the john muir trail twice and could navigate without a compass estimated where the shooter had stationed himself thought he probably had the exact spot we followed him to the far end of the forest where the outermost trees granted the best light grew tallest and thickest nice clear view of the ugly little cabin and adjoining acreage nice view of the ocean too as the cops talked my eyes drifted toward blue i spotted a steamer gliding across the horizon dust specks in the sky that were probably gulls waiting up here wouldnt have been that bad how long had the shooter been waiting how had he figured it out coming across the same detail i had his copy of the filethe original file the case of marissa bonpaine hed claimed to be flying up to seattle just a few hours ago id taken him at his word figured he wanted to review the details of marissas murder crossreference with michael burkes medschool schedule what he knew about mates murder discovery by hikers had he flown back to la to trail the hiker gotten here a wee bit faster than milo and me or had seattle been a lie and hed never left figuring it out by doing exactly what id done harnessing the power of obsession then watching stalking waiting he was a patient man had persisted so many years another few days wouldnt matter killspot with a view had he laid his rifle down lovingly on a rectangle of oilcloth while he ate a sandwich drank something from a thermos made sure the lens of the scope was clean his own little picnic the irony the cops kept talking convincing themselves they neednt search any further no one else was going to get shot today i turned away from the ocean looked down at the cabin now fronted by coroners vans and squad cars tried to see it as leimert fusco had seen it yeah this has got to be it the angles perfect said the muir walker look how it gets flat and theres that rock he could prop his gear against maybe he left some trace evidence lets get the techies up here the techies came milo told me later they found nothing not even a tire track that didnt surprise me i knew fusco couldnt have parked too far from his vantage point and been able to make his escape that quickly driving to the lefthand fork and disappearing into hills laced with side roads most of which ended in box canyons a few feeding to the valley the freeway alleged civilization hed known which road to take because he was a planner too the main risk had been leaving his car at the side of the road but even if someone had seen it recorded the license plate for some reason no big deal it would end up traced back to a rented vehicle hired with false id so sure hed parked close no way he couldve hiked far carrying all that gear the military rifle the highgrade scope not with that limp easy shot said another deputy like picking off quail wonder what this guy did that pissed someone off so bad who says he did anything said another cop nowadays it doesnt take anything to get some nut going milo laughed the men in tan stared at him he said long day fellows it aint over yet said muirman weve still got to find the dude milo laughed again chapter november is la s most beautiful month temperatures get considerate the air acquires the squeaky scrubbed flavor of a world without hydrocarbons the lights as sweet and golden as a caramel apple in november you can forget that the chumash indians called the basin la sits in the valley of smoke late in november i drove out to lancaster a month and a half after the slaughter of eldon mate weeks after milo had finished cataloging the contents of four cardboard cartons located in a panorama city storage locker rented by paul ulrich under the name dr l pasteur a key found in ulrichs bedroom nightstand led to the locker nothing very interesting was found in the house itself tanya stratton vacated the premises within days of the shooting in malibu the cartons were beautifully organized the first contained newspaper clippings neatly folded filed in chronological order tagged with the names of victims the details of roger sharveneaus suicide had been preserved meticulously so had the death of a teenage girl named victoria leigh fusco number two held meticulously pressed clothing predominantly womens undergarments but a few dresses blouses and neckties as well in the third box milo found over a hundred pieces of jewelry in plastic sandwich bags most of it junk a few vintage costume pieces some of the baubles could be traced back to dead people others couldnt the fourth and largest carton held a styrofoam cooler layered within were parcels wrapped in butcher paper and preserved by dry ice the attendant at the storage facility remembered dr pasteur coming by every week or so nice man big mustache one of those oldfashioned mustaches you see in silent movies pasteur had only spoken to offer pleasantries talk about athletics hiking hunting it had been a while since his last visit and most of the dry ice had melted the largest carton had started to reek milo left it up to the coroner to unwrap the packages in a corner of the storage locker were several rifles and handguns each oiled and in perfect working order boxes of bullets one set of japanese surgical tools another made in the usa the papers presented it this way victim in police shooting believed responsible for eldon mates murder malibu county sheriff and los angeles police sources report that a physician shot in a policeinvolved shooting in malibu is the prime suspect in the murder of death doctor eldon mate paul nelson ulrich was shot several times last week in circumstances that remain under investigation evidence recovered at the scene and in other locations including surgical tools believed to be the murder weapons in the mate case indicate ulrich acted alone no motive for the slaying of the man known as dr death has been put forth by authorities yet though the same sources indicate that ulrich a licensed physician in new york state under the name of michael ferris burke may have been mentally ill november found me thinking about how wrong id been on so many accounts no doubt rushtonburkeulrich wouldve been amused by all my wrong guesses but teaching me humility wouldve ranked low on his pleasure list i called tanya stratton once got no answer tried her sister kris lamplear was more forthcoming she didnt recognize my voice no reason to wed exchanged only a few words when wed met and shed assumed i was a detective howd you know to call me doctor i consult to the police was trying to follow up with tanya she hasnt called back youre listed as next of kin no tanya wont talk to you wont talk to anyone shes pretty freaked out by all those things theyre saying about paul shed have to be i said itsunbelievable to be honest im freaked too been keeping it from my kids they met him i never liked him but i never thought anyway tanya has a therapist a social worker who helped her back when she was sicklast year the main thing is shes still in remission just had a great checkup good to hear that you bet i just dont want the stress to anyway thanks for trying the police have really been okay through all this dont worry about tanya shell go her own way she always does november got busy lots of new referrals my service seemed to be ringing in constantly i booked myself solid reserved lunchtime for making calls calls that didnt get answered messages left for richard stacy judy manitow a try at joe safers office elicited a written note from the attorneys secretary dear dr delaware mr safer deeply appreciates your time there are no new developments with regard to your common interests should mr safer have anything to report hell definitely call i thought a lot about the trip to lancaster composed a mental list of reasons not to go wrote it all down i sometimes prescribe that kind of thing for patients but it rarely works for me putting it down on paper made me antsier less and less capable of putting it to rest maybe its a brain abnormalitysome kind of chemical imbalance lord knows everything else gets blamed on that or perhaps its just what my midwestern mother used to call pigheadedness to the nth whatever the diagnosis i wasnt sleeping well mornings presented me with headaches and i found myself getting annoyed without good reason working hard at staying pleasant by the twentythird of november id finished a host of courtassigned assessmentsnone referred by judy manitow placing the rest in the todo box i awoke on a particularly glorious morning and set out for the high desert lancaster is sixtyfive miles north of la on three freeways the the then over to the where four lanes compress to three then two cutting through the antelope valley and feeding into the mojave just over an hours ride if you stick to the speed limit the first half mostly arid foothills sparsely decorated with gas stations truck stops billboards the redtile roofs of lowcost housing developments the rest of its nothing but dirt and gravel till you hit palmdale motels in palmdale too but that wouldnt have mattered for joanne doss it had to be lancaster shed made the trip late at night when the view from the car window would have been flatblack nothing to look at lots of time to think i pictured her bloated aching a passenger in her own hearse as someone elseprobably eric it was eric i couldnt stop thinking aboutburned fuel on the empty road riding staring out at the black knowing the expanse of nothingness would be among her final images had she allowed herself to suffer doubt been mindlessly resolute had the two of them talked what do you say to your mother when shes asked you to help her leave you why had she set up her own execution i spotted a county sign advertising a regional airport in palmdale the strip where richards helicopter had landed on all those trips to oversee his construction projects hed never been able to get joanne to witness what hed created but on her last day on earth shed endured an hours trip made sure shed end up in the very spot shed avoided prolonging the agony so she could send him a message you condemn me i spit in your face the happy trails motel was easy to find just a quick turn onto avenue j then a halfmile drive past tenth street west lots of open space out here but not due to any ecological wisdom vacant lots whiskered by weeds alternated with the kind of downscale businesses that doom smalltown proprietors to anxiety in the age of mergers and acquisitions bobs battery repair desert clearance furniture cleanrite janitorial supply yvonnes quick n easy haircutting i passed one newlooking strip mall the usual beige texture coat and phony tile some of the storefronts still vacant a for lease sign prominent at the front of the commodious parking lot one of richards projects if i was right about joannes motives just maybe because the motel was in clear view across the street sandwiched between a liquor store and a boardedup bungalow that bore a faded handpainted sign goodfaith insurance the happy trails motel was a singlestory ushaped collection of a dozen or so rooms with a front office on the lefthand tip of the u and a dead neon sign that pleaded vacancy red doors on each room only two of them fronted by cars the building had bluegray walls and a low white gravel roof over the gravel i saw coils of barbed wire an alley ran along the west side of the motel and i drove around back to see what the wire was all about the coils sat atop a grapestake fence that separated the motel from its rear neighbor a trailer park old sagging mobile homes laundry on lines tv antennae as i cruised closer a dog growled returning to the street i parked nothing crisp about the air here high eighties arid dusty and heavy as unresolved tension i entered the office no reception counter just a card table in a corner behind which sat an old man hairless corpulent with very red lips and wet subjugated eyes he wore a baggy gray tshirt and striped pants in front of him was a stack of paperback spy novels off to the side sat a collection of medicine bottles along with a loose eyedropper and an empty pill counter the room was small murky paneled with pine boards long gone black the air smelled like every kids first booster shot a comb dispenser hung on the rear wall along with another small vending machine that sold maps and a third that offered condoms and the message be healthy to the old mans right was a glass display case filled with photos ten or so pictures of marilyn monroe in blackandwhite scenes from her movies and cheesecake shots below the montage and stretched across the center of the case pinned in place like a butterfly was a pink satin twopiece bathing suit a typed paper label also pinioned said certified genuine mms swimsuit its for sale said the hairless man wearily his voice was half an octave below bassoon clogged and wheezy interesting if you meant that youd buy it i got it from a guy used to work on her pictures its all bona fide i showed him my police consultant badge the small print tells them ive got no real authority when theyre going to be helpful they never bother to check when theyre not a real badge wouldnt impress them the old man barely looked at it his skin was pallid and dull compressed in spots lumped like cooling tallow licking his lips he smiled didnt think you were checking in for a room not with that sport jacket what is it cashmere he stretched a hand toward my sleeve and for a moment i thought hed touch it but he drew back just wool i said just wool he humphed just money so what can i do for you several months ago a woman from la checked in and killed herself so whyre you here now when it happened the police didnt barely want to talk to me not that they shouldve i wasnt working that night my son was and he didnt know much eitheryou read the report you know i didnt deny it where is your son florida he was only visiting doing me a favor cause i was indisposed his fingers brushed against one of the medicine bottles back in tallahassee drives a truck for anheuserbusch so whats up just doing some followup i said for the files did your son ever talk to you about who checked ms doss in that night she checked herself inthe coward barnett said she didnt look too good unsteady on her feet but she did it all paid with a credit cardyou guys took the receipt he smiled not our usual clientele how so his laughter began somewhere in his belly by the time it reached his mouth he was coughing the paroxysm lasted too long to be trivial scuse me he said wiping his mouth with the back of a dimpled hand like you dont know what im talking about he smiled again i smiled back not poor not horny not drunk he said amused just a rich coward a coward because because god grants you your particular share of years you go and laugh in his face she was like that too pointing to the monroe case body like that and she wasted it on politicians and other scum that bikinis worth something you know big money but no one around here appreciates memorabilia i think im gonna get myself a computer list it on the internet did your son mention anyone with ms doss yeah there was someone out in the car waiting behind the wheel barnett never looked to see who it was we look too hard we dont get business right right i said was there anyone else here who mightve noticed maybe maribel the cleaning girl the one who found it she came on at eleven at night was working till seven asked for night work because she had a day job over at the best western in palmdale but you guys already talked to her she didnt tell you much huh i shrugged yeah she was a little she was sick is what she was he said pregnant ready to drop already had a miscarriage after she found what she found she wouldnt stop crying i thought we were gonna have one of those reallife video situations right out there in the parking lotever deliver a baby i shook my head she end up delivering okay yup a boy healthy seems to be any idea where can i find her he crooked a thumb out back unit six shes working days now someone had a party last night in six longhair types nevada plates paid cash shouldve known better than to give pigs like that a room maribelll be cleaning that one for a while i thanked him and headed for the door heres a little secret he said i stopped turned my head he winked got the monroe playboy too dont keep it in the case cause its too valuable one price gets you all of it tell all your friends will do sure you will maribel was young short fraillooking in a pinkandwhite uniform that seemed incongruously proper for the pitted lot and the splintering red doors she was gloved to the elbows her hair was tied back but loose strands were sweatglued to her forehead a wheeled cart pulled up to unit six was piled with cleaning solvents and frayed towels the trash bag slung from the side overflowed with filthy linens empty bottles and stink she gave the badge a bit more attention than her boss had la she said with the faintest accent whyre you coming out here the woman who killed herself joanne doss her face closed up tight no forget it i dont wanna talk about that dont blame you i said and im not interested in making you go through it again her gloves slammed onto her hips then what id like to know anything you can remember about before once ms doss went in the room did she ever come out did she ask for food drinks do anything that caught your attention nope nothing they went in after i got here around midnight i already told them that i didnt see them until you know them i said two people yup how long did the other person stay dont know she said probably a while i was up at the front desk mostly cause barnett milton s son wanted to go out and party and not tell his dad but the car wasnt there in the morning nope who was the other person didnt get a good look tell me what you did see not much i never saw the face her eyes filled with tears it was disgustingits not fair bringing all this up im sorry maribel just tell me what you saw and well be finished i dont wanna get anyone in troublei dont wanna be on tv or nothing you wont be she pulled at the finger of a glove didnt speak then she did and suddenly everything made sense chapter just wool again my best blue suit a blueandwhitestriped shirt yellowprint tie shiny shoes dressed for court i pushed open the double doors to division and walked right in more often than not family sessions are closed witnesses kept out in the corridor but this morning i got lucky judy was hearing motions from a pair of reasonablesounding attorneys scheduling hearings bantering with her bailiff a man named leonard stickney who knew me i sat in the back row the only spectator leonard stickney noticed me first and gave a small salute a second later judy saw me and her eyes opened wide blackrobed and regal behind the bench she turned away got businesslike ordering the lawyers to do something within thirty days time i sat there and waited ten minutes later she dismissed both attorneys called for recess and motioned leonard over covering her mike with one hand she whispered to him behind the other stepped off the bench and exited through the door that led to her chambers leonard marched up to me doctor her honor requests your presence soft lighting carved desk and credenza overstaffed chairs certificates and award plaques on the walls family photos in sterling silver frames i concentrated on one particular snapshot judys younger daughter becky the girl whod gotten too thin needed therapy tried to play therapist with stacy becky whod been tutored by joanne whose grades had dropped after the tutoring had stopped becky whod gotten too thin as joanne grew obese had severed her relationship with stacy judy slipped out of her robe and hung it on a mahogany rack todays suit was banana yellow formfitting trimmed with sandcolored braiding big pearl earrings small diamond brooch every blond hair in place shiny hair she reclined in her desk chair glittery things occupied a good portion of the leather desktop the picture frames a crystal bud vase an assortment of tiny bronze cats millefleur paperweights a walnut gavel with a bronze plate on the handle her bony hands found a weight and rubbed it alex what a surprise we dont have any cases pending do we no i said dont imagine we ever will she squinted past me now why would you say that because i know i said know what i didnt answer not out of any psychological calculation id thought about being here rehearsed it mentally had gotten the first words out i know but the rest of it choked in my chest what is this riddle time she said trying to smile but managing only a peevish twist of her lipstick you were there i said at the motel with joanne someone saw you they dont know who you are but they described you perfectly what maribel had really seen was hair short yellow hair a skinny woman no butt on her i only saw the back of her she was getting into the car when i came out to fill the ice machine she had this hairreal light real shiny a really good color job that hair was shiny from across the parking lot mate had nothing to do with it i said it was just you and joanne judy reclined a bit more youre talking nonsense my dear one way to look at it i said was you were helping a friend joanne had made her decision needed someone to be there with her at the end youd always been a good friend to her the only problem is that friendship had cooled for good reason i waited she wasnt moving then her right eyelid twitched she pushed back from the desk another inch youre starting to sound like one of those psychic idiotstalking obliquely in the hope someone will take it for wisdom have you been under strain alex working too hard i always thought you pushed yourself so friendship would be the charitable interpretation of what brought you out to lancaster with joanne but unfortunately that wasnt it at all joannes motivation for destroying herself was crushing guiltsome sin she couldnt forgive herself for richard never forgave her either and neither did you so when she asked you to be there i dont think you minded one bit about seeing her reach the end her lips folded inward her hand reached out among the objects on her desk and found one walnut gavel brass plaque on the handle an award the walls were paneled with tributes having you there was part of the punishment i said like when family members of victims are invited to attend the execution this is ridiculous she said i dont know whats gotten into you but youre talking gibberishplease leave judy this minute alex or ill call for leonard my leaving wont change things not for you not for becky does bob know probably not all of it id guess because he wouldve expressed his anger more directly immediately wouldnt have let it sit but hes mad about something so he must know something she took hold of the gavel waved it at me alex im giving you one last chance to leave like a gentleman joanne and becky i said when did it happen she shot forward half standing and the gavel slammed down on the desk but instead of making direct contact the wood twisted slipping out of her grip skidding along the leather pushing a paperweight to the carpet the glass landed on the carpet with a feeble thump pathetic sound maybe thats what did it or maybe she really wanted to talk her fingers curled into talons that she placed against her breast as if ready to claw out her own heart suddenly they dropped and she sat back down and her hair was no longer in place hot eyes wet eyes a mouth that shook so badly it took a while for her to speak you bastard she said you goddamn goddamn bastard im calling leonard but she didnt we sat staring at each other i tried to look as sympathetic as i felt id convinced myself this was all for the best but now i wondered if it boiled down to feeding my own obsessiveness a moment more and i mightve gotten up and left but she stood first crossed the big beautiful room locked the door when she sat back down her eyes dropped to the gavel thats when she reminded me of my oath of confidentiality repeated the warning i told her of course id never talk even then she kept it theoretical the way richard had could barely stop herself from slapping me kept drifting into corollary anger what if you were a parent she said why arent you anyway i always meant to ask you that working with other peoples kids but you never had any of your own maybe one day i said so its not a physical problem not shooting blanks i smiled kind of arrogant alex preaching to other people about how to raise their kids when you dont have any direct experience maybe so sure agree with meyou guys all do that another one of those little tricks they teach you in shrink school did you know becky wants to become a psychologist what do you think of that i dont know becky but offhand it sounds fine whys it fine she demanded because people whove dealt with crisis can develop a special kind of empathy can sometimes it goes the other way i dont know becky beckys beautifula beautiful person if youd bothered to father any of your own maybe youd have a clue youre probably right i said i mean that think of it she said as if talking to herself you carry this creature inside you for nine months rip your body up pushing them out and thats when the real work starts do you have any idea what it takes to nurture a child nowadays in this fucking urbanized overfeeding overstimulating world weve created do you have a clue i kept quiet she said think about it you go through all that feeding them with your body waking up in the middle of the night wiping their ass getting them through all the tantrums and the hurt feelings and the bad habits getting them past puberty for christs sake and someone comes alongsomeone you trustand sabotages all that she sprang up paced the space behind her desk im not telling you a damn thing even if i did you couldnt repeat a word of itand believe me if i pick up the merest hint youve let on to anyoneyour wife anyoneill make sure you lose that license of yours racewalking the width of the room back again another circuit picture this doctor you put all that into another human being entrust them to someone theyve known their whole life someone youve done favors for and what are you asking tutoring stupid tutoring because the kids smart but numbers have a waymathjust math not another goddamn thing and then you walk in and find that person withwith your treasure this treasure youve wrought and theyve shattered it by the pool the goddamn pool and where are the math books wheres the tutoring getting wet on the deck next to the pool while theywet swimsuits lying all wrinkledoh that would be just great with you wouldnt it youd let that pass right was it the first time i said joanne claimed it wasbecky did too but they were both lying i cant blame becky for that she was ashamedno it wasnt the first time i could tell it wasnt because it explained all sorts of things a little girl who used to talk to me who after she turned sixteen and started getting tutored didnt talk to me anymore a little girl whod suddenly cry for no good reason leave the house not tell us where she was goingher grades started to drop even with the tutoringshe was sixteen alex and that bitch raped her for all i know it had gone on for years after you found them you never talked to becky about it no point she needed to heal not be shamed more pacing and dont get that accusatory tone i know the law and no i didnt report it to the socalled authorities she said what would that have accomplished the laws an ass believe me i sit out there and listen to it bray every goddamn day and bob bob hates joanne because he thinks she refused to keep on tutoring becky and thats why becky flunked math and wont be able to get into a good college if id told bob joanne mightve been dead sooner and thats all id needmy entire family destroyed you did tell richard i said richards a man of action translation richard would punish her shutting her out forever i said joanne was a woman of action once sentence had been passed she carried out the punishment herself killing herself slowly richards contempt had been part of itexcommunicating her letting her know he had nothing but contempt for her threatening to tell the children but thered been more to the deterioration forcefeeding herself like a goose getting fat because becky had gotten skinny joanne had despised herself stacy the alleged problem child had been kept out of the loop eric dropping out to tend to his mother had probably been privy to more how much had joanne told him not the essence of her sin just that shed done something for which dad couldnt forgive her judy said she finally did something right goddamn her she wanted you to seeher last chance at apology she shrugged drew her finger across her lips leave now alex i mean it i got up and headed for the door despite all she did to your family you cared about hers thats why you referred stacy to me talk about errors in judgment who else knows i said no one not beckys therapist no becky and i agreed she could get help without getting into it and dont tell me i was wrong because i wasnt shes fine now planning to go to community college study psychology were back to where we were before alex becky will take strength from itdevelop a higher level of empathy out of this be a great psychologist i turned toward the door you dont know either alex this conversation never took place i reached for the doorknob youre right she said i dont ever want to see or hear from you again chapter two weeks before christmas i called fbi headquarters at the federal building and not expecting any success asked to speak with special agent mary donovan i was transferred to her immediately hello doctor what can i do for you i was just wondering if youve had any success with dr fusco success she said as measured by finding him helping him youre serious about what helping him as if were a clinic or something well i said theres always the issue of collegiality and respect for what he once was no sign of him at all long silence she said look i took your call because i thought you mightve changed your mind but this is a waste of time changed my mind in what way being willing to cooperate helping us find him helping you i said as if im a clinic or something another silence i guess my questions been answered i said have a nice day doctor click i sat there holding the phone thinking about alice zoghbies claim of being audited by the irs because shed rubbed important noses the wrong way probably a lie covering for a call from roy haiselden but you never knew chapter a week before christmas stacy called im so sorry she said it was rude not answering but things got really busy and dont worry about it hows everything going actually much better did pretty well on a bunch of ap exams and i just found out i got in early to cornell i know its far away and it gets cold but theyve got a veterinary school and i think i might want to do that congratulations stacy architecture seemed too impersonal anyway thanks for all your help thats it hows eric hes okay dads fine too busy all the time he doesnt like visiting that probation officer complains about it constantly but hes lucky thats all he got right eric changed his major psychology so maybe you had an influence on himim sorry about the way he treated you thats okay she laughed thats what he says taking abuse is part of your job guilts not a big part of erics life ah i said knowing how wrong she was did you hear about the manitows she said what about them they put their house up for sale and moved out of the palisades theyre renting a place down in la jolla judge manitows quitting and dr manitows trying to see if he can find work down there no i hadnt heard they didnt exactly advertise it she said one day i was seeing dr manitow drive off to work the next day the sign was up and the moving vans were there beckys moving with them going to some junior college in san diego everyone else cant wait to get out of the house but shes staying with her parents someone told me becky said that she needs to stay close to home some people do need that i said guess so anyway thanks for all your help maybe one day ill get my dvm and ill get a chance to work with that cute
