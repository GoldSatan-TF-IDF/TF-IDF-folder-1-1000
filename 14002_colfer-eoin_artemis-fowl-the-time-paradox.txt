north of dublins fair city lies the fowl estate where the boundaries have changed little in the past five hundred years the manor house is not visible from the main road shrouded by a fan of oak trees and a parallelogram of high stone walls the gates are reinforced steel with cameras perched upon their pillars were you allowed to pass through these discreetly electrified portals you would find yourself on a peagravel avenue meandering gently through what was once a manicured lawn but which has now been encouraged to evolve into a wild garden the trees grow dense as you approach the manor itself soaring oak and horse chestnut intermingled with more delicate ash and willow the only signs of cultivation are a driveway free of weeds and the glowing lamps that float overhead seemingly without tether or cable fowl manor has been the site of many grand adventures over the centuries in recent years the adventures have had more of a magical bent though most of the fowl family have been kept in the dark about this fact they have no idea that the main lobby was completely destroyed when the fairy folk sent a troll to do battle with artemis the familys eldest son and a criminal mastermind he was twelve years old at the time today however fowl activity in the manor is entirely legal there are no fairy special forces storming the battlements no elfin police officers held captive in the cellar nor any sign of a centaur finetuning his listening devices or running thermal scans artemis has made peace with the fairy people and formed solid friendships among their ranks though his criminal activities earned artemis much they cost him more people he loves have been distraught injured and even abducted because of his schemes for the past three years his parents thought him dead while he fought demons in limbo and on his return he was flabbergasted to find that the world had moved on without him and he was now the older brother to twoyearold twin boys beckett and myles chapter espresso and treacle artemis sat on an oxblood leather armchair facing beckett and myles his mother was in bed with a slight case of the flu his father was with the doctor in her room and so artemis was lending a hand in entertaining the toddlers and what better entertainment for youngsters than some lessons he had decided to dress casually in a skyblue silk shirt light grey woollen trousers and gucci loafers his black hair was swept back from his forehead and he was putting on a jolly expression which he had heard appealed to children artemis need toilet wondered beckett who squatted on the tunisian rug wearing only a grassstained vest which he had pulled down over his knees no beckett said artemis brightly i am trying to look jolly and shouldnt you be wearing a nappy nappy snorted myles who had pottytrained himself at the age of fourteen months building a stepladder of encyclopedias to reach the toilet seat no nappy pouted beckett slapping at a stillbuzzing fly trapped in his sticky blond curls beckett hates nappy artemis doubted if the nanny had neglected to put a nappy on beckett and he wondered briefly where that nappy was now very well beckett continued artemis lets shelve the nappy issue for now and move on to todays lesson chocolate on shelves said beckett stretching his fingers high to reach imaginary chocolate yes good there is sometimes chocolate on the shelves and espresso added beckett who had a strange set of favourite tastes which included espresso sachets and treacle in the same cup if he could manage it once beckett had managed to down several spoons of this concoction before it was wrestled away from him the toddler hadnt slept for twentyeight hours can we learn the new words artemis asked myles who wanted to get back to a mould jar in his bedroom i am doing speriments with professor primate professor primate was a stuffed monkey and myless occasional lab partner the cuddly toy spent most of his time stuffed into a borosilicate glass beaker on the speriment table artemis had reprogrammed the monkeys voice box to respond to myless voice with twelve phrases including its alive its alive and history will remember this day professor myles you can go back to your laboratory soon said artemis approvingly myles was cut from the same cloth as himself a naturalborn scientist now boys i thought today we might tackle some restaurant terms sneezes look like worms said beckett who wasnt one for staying on topic artemis was nearly thrown by this remark worms were most definitely not on the menu though snails might well be forget about worms forget worms said beckett horrified just for the moment said artemis reassuringly as soon as we have finished our word game you may think on whatever pleases you and if you are really good then i may take you to see the horses riding was the only form of exercise that artemis had taken to this was mainly because the horse did most of the work beckett pointed to himself beckett he said proudly worms already a distant memory myles sighed simpletoon artemis was beginning to regret scheduling this lesson but having begun he was determined to forge ahead myles dont call your brother a simpleton s ok artemis he likes it youre a simpletoon arent you beckett beckett simpletoon agreed the small boy happily artemis rubbed his hands together right brothers onwards imagine yourself seated at a café table in montmartre in paris said myles smugly straightening the cravat he had borrowed from his father yes paris and try as you will you cannot attract the waiters attention what do you do the infants stared at him blankly and artemis began to wonder if he wasnt pitching his lesson a little high he was relieved if a little surprised to see a spark of comprehension in becketts eyes um tell butler to jumpjumpjump on his head myles was impressed i agree with simpletoon no said artemis you simply raise one finger and say clearly ici garçon itchy what what no beckett not itchy artemis sighed this was impossible impossible and he hadnt even introduced the flashcards yet or his new modified laser pointer which could either highlight a word or burn through several steel plates depending on the setting lets try it together raise one finger and say ici garçon all together now the little boys did as they were told eager to please their deranged brother ici garçon they chorused pudgy fingers raised and then from the corner of his mouth myles whispered to his twin artemis simpletoon artemis raised his hands i surrender you win no more lessons why dont we paint some pictures excellent said myles i shall paint my jar of mould beckett was suspicious i wont learn no said artemis fondly ruffling his brothers hair and immediately regretting it you wont learn a thing good beckett happy now see the boy pointed to himself once more specifically to the broad smile on his face the three brothers were stretched on the floor up to their elbows in poster paint when their father entered the room he looked tired from his nursing duties but otherwise fit and strong moving like a lifelong athlete in spite of his biohybrid artificial leg the leg used lengthened bone titanium prosthetics and implantable sensors to allow artemis seniors brain signals to move it occasionally at the end of the day he would use a microwaveable gel pouch to ease his stiffness but otherwise he behaved as if the new leg were his own artemis climbed to his knees smudged and dripping i abandoned french vocabulary and have joined the twins in play he grinned wiping his hands its quite liberating actually we are fingerpainting instead i did try to sneak in a little lecture on cubism but received a splattering for my troubles artemis noticed then that his father was more than simply tired he was anxious he stepped away from the twins walking with artemis senior to the floortoceiling bookcase what is the matter is mothers influenza worsening artemiss father rested one hand on the rolling ladder lifting his weight from the artificial limb his expression was strange and one that artemis could not recall ever seeing he realized his father was more than anxious artemis fowl senior was afraid father artemis senior gripped the ladders rung with such force that the wood creaked he opened his mouth to speak but then seemed to change his mind now artemis himself grew worried father you must tell me of course said his father with a start as if just remembering where he was i must tell you then a tear fell from his eye dripping on to his shirt deepening the blue i remember when i first saw your mother he said i was in london at a private party in the ivy a room full of scoundrels and i was the biggest one in the bunch she changed me arty broke my heart then put it together again angeline saved my life now artemis felt weak with nerves his blood pounded in his ears like the atlantic surf is mother dying father is this what you are trying to tell me the idea seemed ludicrous impossible his father blinked as if waking from a dream not if the fowl men have something to say about it eh son its time for you to earn that reputation of yours artemis seniors eyes were bright with desperation whatever we have to do son whatever it takes artemis felt panic welling up inside him whatever we have to do be calm he told himself you have the power to fix this artemis did not yet have all the facts but nonetheless he was reasonably confident that whatever was wrong with his mother could be healed with a burst of fairy magic and he was the only human on earth with that magic running through his system father he said gently has the doctor left for a moment the question seemed to puzzle artemis senior then he remembered left no he is in the lobby i thought you might talk to him just in case theres a question i have missed artemis was only mildly surprised to find doctor hans schalke europes leading expert on rare diseases in the lobby and not the usual family practitioner naturally his father would have sent for schalke when angeline fowls condition began to deteriorate schalke waited below the filigreed fowl crest a hardskinned gladstone bag standing sentry by his ankles like a giant beetle he was belting a grey raincoat across his waist and speaking to his assistant in sharp tones everything about the doctor was sharp from the arrowhead of his widows peak to the razor edges of his cheekbones and nose twin ovals of cut glass magnified schalkes blue eyes and his mouth slashed downwards from left to right barely moving as he talked all of the symptoms he said his accent muted german on all of the databases you understand his assistant a petite young lady in an expensively cut grey suit nodded several times tapping the instructions on to the screen of her smartphone universities too she asked all said schalke accompanying the word with an impatient nod did i not say all do you not understand my accent is it because i am from germany coming sorry doctor said the assistant contritely all of course artemis approached doctor schalke hand outstretched the doctor did not return the gesture contamination master fowl he said without a trace of apology or sympathy we have not determined whether your mothers condition is contagious artemis curled his fingers into his palm sliding the hand behind his back the doctor was right of course we have never met doctor would you be so good as to describe my mothers symptoms the doctor huffed irritated very well young man but i am not accustomed to dealing with children so there will be no sugar coating artemis swallowed his throat suddenly dry sugar coating your mothers condition is possibly unique said schalke banishing his assistant to her work with a shake of his fingers from what i can tell her organs seem to be failing which organs all of them said schalke i need to bring equipment here from my laboratory at trinity college obviously your mother cannot be moved my assistant imogen miss book will monitor her until my return miss book is not only my publicist but an excellent nurse too a useful combination wouldnt you say in his peripheral vision artemis saw miss book scurry round a corner stammering into her smartphone he hoped the publicistnurse would display more confidence when caring for his mother i suppose all my mothers organs all of them schalke was not inclined to repeat himself i am reminded of lupus but more aggressive combined with all three stages of lyme disease i did observe an amazonian tribe once with similar symptoms but not so severe at this rate of decline your mother has days left to her frankly i doubt we will have time to complete tests we need a miracle cure and in my considerable experience miracle cures do not exist perhaps they do said artemis absently schalke picked up his bag put your faith in science young man advised the doctor science will serve your mother better than some mysterious force artemis held the door for schalke watching him walk the dozen steps to his vintage mercedesbenz the car was grey like the bruised clouds overhead there is no time for science thought the irish teenager magic is my only option when artemis returned to his study his father was sitting on the rug with beckett crawling along his torso like a monkey may i see mother now artemis asked him yes said artemis senior go now see what you can find out study her symptoms for your search my search thought artemis there are difficult times ahead artemiss hulking bodyguard butler waited for him at the foot of the stairs wearing full kendo armour the helmets faceguard folded away from his weathered features i was in the dojo sparring with the holograph he explained your father called and told me i was needed immediately whats going on its mother said artemis passing him shes very ill im going to see what i can do butler hurried to keep pace his chest plate clanking be careful artemis magic is not science you cant control it you wouldnt want to accidentally make mrs fowls condition worse artemis arrived at the top of the grand stairway tentatively reaching his hand towards the bedroom doors brass knob as though it were electrified i fear that her condition couldnt be worse artemis went inside alone leaving the bodyguard to strip off the kendo headgear and honnuri breastplate underneath he wore a tracksuit instead of the traditional widelegged trousers sweat blossomed across his chest and back but butler ignored his desire to go and shower standing sentry outside the door knowing that he shouldnt strain too hard to listen but wishing that he could butler was the only other human who knew the full truth of artemiss magical escapades he had been at his young charges shoulder throughout their various adventures battling fairies and humans across the continents but artemis had made the journey through time to limbo without him and he had come back changed a part of his young charge was magical now and not just captain holly shorts hazel left eye the time stream had given him in place of his own on the journey from earth to limbo and back artemis had somehow managed to steal a few strands of magic from the fairies whose atoms were mixed with his in the time stream when he had returned home from limbo artemis had suggested to his parents in the compelling magical mesmer that they simply not think about where he had been for the past few years it wasnt a very sophisticated plan as his disappearance had made the news worldwide and the subject was raised at every function the fowls attended but until artemis could get hold of some lep mindwiping equipment or indeed develop his own it would have to suffice he suggested to his parents that if anyone were to ask about him they should simply state it was a family matter and ask that their privacy be respected artemis is a magical human thought butler the only one and now butler just knew artemis was going to use his magic to attempt a healing on his mother it was a dangerous game magic was not a natural part of his makeup the boy could well remove one set of symptoms and replace them with another artemis entered his parents bedroom slowly the twins charged in here at all hours of the day and night flinging themselves on the fourposter bed to wrestle with his protesting mother and father but artemis had never experienced that his childhood had been a time of order and discipline always knock before entering artemis his father had instructed him it shows respect but his father had changed a brush with death seven years earlier had shown him what was really important now he was always ready to hug and roll in the covers with his beloved sons its too late for me thought artemis i am too old for tussles with father mother was different she was never cold apart from during her bouts of depression when his father was missing but fairy magic and the return of her beloved husband had saved her from that and now she was herself again or she had been until now artemis crossed the room slowly afraid of what lay before him he walked cautiously across the carpet careful to tread between the vine patterns in the weave step on a vine count to nine this was a habit from when he was little an old superstition whispered lightly by his father artemis had never forgotten and always counted to nine to ward off the bad luck should so much as a toe touch the carpet vines the fourposter bed stood at the rear of the room swathed in hanging drapes and sunlight a breeze slipped into the room rippling the silks like the sails of a pirate ship one of his mothers hands dangled over the side pale and thin artemis was horrified just yesterday his mother had been fine a slight sniffle but still her warm laughing self mother he blurted on seeing her face feeling as though the word had been punched out of him this was not possible in twentyfour hours his mother had deteriorated to little more than a skeleton her cheekbones were sharp as flint her eyes lost in dark sockets dont worry artemis told himself in a few short seconds mother will be well then i can investigate what happened here angeline fowls beautiful hair was frizzed and brittle broken strands crisscrossing her pillow like a spiders web and there was an odd smell emanating from her pores lilies thought artemis sweet yet tinged with sickness angelines eyes opened abruptly round with panic her back arched as she sucked breath through a constricted windpipe clutching at the air with clawed hands just as suddenly she collapsed and artemis thought for a terrible moment that she was gone but then her eyelids fluttered and she reached out a hand for him arty she said her voice no more than a whisper i am having the strangest dream a short sentence but it took an age to complete with a rasped breath between each word artemis took his mothers hand how slender it was a parcel of bones or perhaps i am awake and my other life is a dream artemis was pained to hear his mother speak like this it reminded him of the turns she used to suffer from youre awake mother and i am here you have a light fever and are a little dehydrated thats all nothing to be concerned about how can i be awake arty said angeline her eyes calm in black circles when i feel myself dying how can i be awake when i feel that artemiss feigned calm was knocked by this iits the fever he stammered youre seeing things a little strangely everything will be fine soon i promise angeline closed her eyes and my son keeps his promises i know where have you been these past years arty we were so worried why are you not seventeen in her delirium angeline fowl saw through a haze of magic to the truth she realized that he had been missing for three years and had come home the same age as when he went away i am fourteen mother almost fifteen now still a boy for another while now close your eyes and when you open them again all will be well what have you done to my thoughts artemis where has your power come from artemis was sweating now the heat of the room the sickly smell his own anxiety she knows mother knows if you heal her will she remember everything it didnt matter that could be dealt with in due course his priority was to mend his parent artemis squeezed the frail hand in his grip feeling the bones grind against each other he was about to use magic on his mother for the second time magic did not belong in artemiss soul and gave him lightningbolt headaches whenever he used it though he was human the fairy rules of magic held a certain sway over him he was forced to chew motionsickness tablets before entering a dwelling uninvited and when the moon was full artemis could often be found in the library listening to music at maximum volume to drown out the voices in his head the great commune of magical creatures the fairies had powerful race memories and they surfaced like a tidal wave of raw emotion bringing migraines with them sometimes artemis wondered if stealing the magic had been a mistake but recently the symptoms had stopped no more migraines or sickness perhaps his brain was adapting to the strain of being a magical creature artemis held his mothers fingers gently closed his eyes and cleared his mind magic only magic the magic was a wild force and needed to be controlled if artemis let his thoughts ramble the magic would ramble too and he could open his eyes to find his mother still sick but with differentcoloured hair heal he thought be well mother the magic responded to his wish spreading along his limbs buzzing tingling blue sparks circled his wrists twitching like shoals of tiny minnows almost as if they were alive artemis thought of his mother in better times he saw her skin radiant her eyes shining with happiness heard her laugh felt her touch on his neck remembered the strength of angeline fowls love for her family that is what i want the sparks sensed his wishes and flowed into angeline fowl sinking into the skin of her hand and wrist twisting in ropes round her gaunt arms artemis pushed harder and a river of magical flickers flowed from his fingers into his mother heal he thought drive out the sickness artemis had used his magic before but this time was different there was resistance as though his mothers body did not wish to be healed and was rejecting the power sparks fizzled on her skin spasmed and winked out more thought artemis more he pushed harder ignoring the sudden blinding headache and rumbling nausea heal mother the magic wrapped his mother like an egyptian mummy snaking underneath her body raising her fifteen centimetres from the mattress she shuddered and moaned steam venting from her pores sizzling as it touched the blue sparks she is in pain thought artemis opening one eye a slit in agony but i cannot stop now artemis dug down deep searching his extremities for the last scraps of magic inside him everything give her every last spark magic was not an intrinsic part of artemis he had stolen it and now he threw it off again stuffing all he had into the attempted healing and yet it wasnt working no more than that her sickness grew stronger repelling each blue wave robbing the sparks of their colour and power sending them skittering to the ceiling something is wrong thought artemis bile in his throat a dagger of pain over his left eye it shouldnt be like this the final drop of magic left his body with a jolt and artemis was thrown from his mothers bedside and sent skidding across the floor then tumbling head over heels until he came to rest sprawled against a chaise longue angeline fowl spasmed a final time then collapsed back on to her mattress her body was soaked with a strange thick clear gel magical sparks flickered and died in the coating which steamed off almost as quickly as it had appeared artemis lay with his head in his hands waiting for the chaos in his brain to stop unable to move or think his own breathing seemed to rasp against his skull eventually the pain faded to echoes and jumbled words formed themselves into sentences the magic is gone spent i am entirely human artemis registered the sound of the bedroom door creaking and he opened his eyes to find butler and his father staring down at him concern large on their faces we heard a crash you must have fallen said artemis senior lifting his son by the elbow i should never have let you in here alone but i thought that perhaps you could do something you have certain talents i know i was hoping he straightened his sons shirt patted his shoulders it was stupid of me artemis shrugged his fathers hands away stumbling to his mothers sickbed it took a mere glance to confirm what he already knew he had not cured his mother there was no bloom on her cheeks or ease in her breathing she is worse what have i done what is it asked his father what the devil is wrong with her at this rate of decline in less than a week my angeline will be butler interrupted brusquely no giving up now gents we all have contacts from our past that might be able to shed some light on mrs fowls condition people we might prefer not to associate with otherwise we find them and bring them back here as fast as we can we ignore nuisances like passports or visas and get it done artemis senior nodded slowly at first then with more vigour yes yes dammit she is not finished yet my angeline is a fighter are you not darling he took her hand gently as though it were made of finest crystal she did not respond to his touch or voice we talked to every alternative practitioner in europe about my phantomlimb pains perhaps one of them can help us with this i know a man in china said butler he worked with madame ko at the bodyguard academy he was a miracle worker with herbs lived up the mountains he has never been outside the province but he would come for me good said artemis senior the more opinions we can call on the better he turned to his son listen arty if you know someone who might be able to help anyone perhaps you have some underworld contacts artemis twisted a rather ostentatious ring on his middle finger so that the front rested against his palm this ring was actually a camouflaged fairy communicator yes he said i have a few underworld contacts chapter the worlds biggest helsinki harbour the baltic sea thegiant sea monster that is the kraken sent its finned tentacles spiralling towards the oceans surface pulling its bloated body behind its single eye rolled manically in its socket and its curved beak the size of a schooners prow was open wide filtering the rushing water through to its rippling gills the kraken was hungry and there was room for only one thought in its tiny brain as it sped towards the holiday ferry above kill kill kill that is such dwarf manure said lower elements police captain holly short muting the sound file in her helmet for one thing the kraken doesnt have tentacles and as for kill kill kill i know said foaly the voice of mission control in her communicator i thought you might enjoy that passage you know have a laugh remember laughing holly was not amused its so typical of humans foaly to take something perfectly natural and demonize it krakens are gentle creatures and the humans turn them into some kind of murderous giant squid kill kill kill give me a break come on holly its just sensational fiction you know those humans and their imaginations relax foaly was right if she got worked up every time the human media misrepresented a mythical creature she would spend half her life in a rage over the centuries mud men had caught glimpses of the fairy folk and had twisted the truth of these glimpses almost beyond recognition let it go there are decent humans remember artemis and butler did you see that human movie with the centaurs she asked the centaur on the other end of her helmet communicator they were noble and sporty my sword for thee majesty then off for a spot of hunting fit centaurs now that did make me laugh thousands of miles away somewhere in the earths mantle below ireland foaly the lower elements police technical adviser rubbed his paunch holly that hurts caballine likes my belly foaly had got married or hitched as centaurs called the ceremony while holly had been away with artemis fowl rescuing demons in limbo a lot had changed in the three years she had been away and sometimes holly found it difficult to keep up foaly had a new bride to occupy his time her old friend trouble kelp had been promoted to lep commander and she was back working at recon with the kraken watch task force apologies friend that was mean said holly i like your belly too im sorry that i wasnt there to see a hitching sash round it me too next time holly smiled sure thats going to happen traditionally male centaurs were expected to take more than one bride but caballine was a modern fairy and holly doubted if she would stand for a new filly in the household dont worry im joking youd better be because im meeting caballine at the spa this weekend hows the new gear said foaly hurriedly changing the subject holly spread her arms wide feeling the wind ripple her fingers seeing the baltic sea flash past below in shards of blue and white its wonderful she said absolutely wonderful captain holly short of leprecon flew in wide lazy circles above helsinki enjoying the brisk scandinavian air filtering through her helmet it was just after am local time and the rising sun had set the uspenski cathedrals golden onion dome shimmering already the citys famed marketplace was strobed with headlights as vendors arrived to open up for the morning trade or eager politicians aides made their way towards the bluegrey façade of city hall hollys target lay away from what would shortly be a bustling centre of commerce she adjusted her fingers and the sensors in her armoured gloves translated the movements to commands for the mechanical wings on her back sending her spiralling down towards the small island of uunisaari half a mile from the port the body sensors are nice she said very intuitive its as close as it gets to being a bird said foaly unless you want to integrate no thank you said holly vehemently she loved flying but not enough to have an lep surgeon sew a few implants into her cerebellum very well captain short said foaly switching to business mode preop check three ws please the three ws were every reconnaissance officers checklist before approaching an operations zone wings weapon and a way home holly checked the transparent readouts on her helmet visor power cell charged weapon on green wings and suit fully functional no red lights excellent said foaly check check and check our screens agree holly heard keys clicking as foaly recorded this information in the mission log the centaur was known for his fondness for oldschool keyboards even though he himself had patented an extremely efficient virtual keyboard the vboard remember holly this is just reconnaissance go down and check the sensor those things are two hundred years old and the problem is more than likely a simple overheat all you need to do is go where i tell you and fix what i tell you no indiscriminate blasting involved understand holly snorted i can see why caballine fell for you foaly youre such a charmer foaly snickered i dont rise to jibes any more holly marriage has mellowed me mellow ill believe that when you last ten minutes in a room with mulch without throwing a hoof the dwarf mulch diggums had been at various times enemy partner and friend to holly and foaly his greatest pleasure in life was stuffing his face and not far behind that was irritating his various enemies partners and friends perhaps i need a few more years of marriage before i get that mellow a few more centuries in fact the island was large in hollys visor now surrounded by a monks fringe of foam time to stop the chitchat and proceed with the mission though holly was tempted to circle in a holding pattern so she could talk some more with her friend it seemed as though this was the first real conversation theyd had since her return from limbo foaly had moved on with life in the past three years but for holly her absence had only lasted a few hours and though she had not aged holly felt cheated of those years the lep psychiatrist would have told her she was suffering from posttimetraveldisplacement depression and offered to prescribe a nice shot to cheer her up holly trusted happyshots just about as much as she trusted brain implants im going in she said tersely this was her first solo mission since debriefing and she did not want anything less than a perfect report even if it was only kraken watch copy said foaly you see the sensor there were four biosensors on the island relaying information back to police plaza three pulsed a gentle green in hollys visor display unit the fourth sensor was red red could mean many things in this case every reading had risen above normal levels temperature heartbeat brain activity all on the danger line it must be a malfunction foaly had explained if not the other sensors would show something i have it strong signal ok shield and approach holly twisted her chin sharply left until her neck bone clicked which was her way of summoning the magic it wasnt a necessary movement since the magic was mostly a brain function but fairies developed their own tics she let a dribble of power into her limbs and vibrated out of the visible spectrum her shimmer suit picked up her frequency and amplified it so that a tiny spark of magic went a long way im out of sight and going in she confirmed understood said the centaur be careful holly commander kelp will be reviewing this video so stick to your orders are you suggesting that i occasionally stray from the rule book said holly apparently horrified by the very notion foaly sniggered i am suggesting that you may not own a copy of the rule book and if you do possess one you certainly have never opened it fair point thought holly swooping down towards the surface of uunisaari whales are thought to be the worlds largest mammals they are not the kraken can stretch to five kilometres in length and have been a staple of scandinavian legend since the thirteenth century when they appeared in the orvar odd saga as the fearsome lyngbakr early descriptions of the kraken are the most accurate describing the sea creature as an animal the size of a floating island whose real danger to ships was not the creature itself but the whirlpool it created when it sank into the ocean but by the middle ages the legend of the kraken had been confused with that of the giant squid and each was credited with the most fearsome attributes of the other the squid was pictured big as a mountain while the peaceful kraken grew tentacles and developed a bloodlust to rival that of the deadliest shark nothing could be further from the truth the kraken is a docile creature whose main defences are its sheer size and the bulk of shell gas and fat cells enclosing a melonsized brain which provides it with just enough intelligence to feed itself and shed its shell underneath the crust of rock weed and coral the kraken resembles nothing more than the common acorn barnacle albeit a barnacle that could easily house an olympic stadium or two the kraken enjoy a lifespan of several thousand years thanks to an incredibly slow metabolism and a huge network of support systems surrounding their soft centres they tend to settle in a foodrich or magical environment and remain there until the food or energy residue runs out nestling in the middle of an archipelago near a human port provides not only camouflage but an abundant source of edible material and so this is where the kraken are found anchored to the seabed like gigantic limpets vacuuming city waste through their gills and fermenting it to methane in their vast stomachs but if human garbage is their salvation it is also their damnation for increasingly high toxin levels have rendered the kraken sterile and now there are only half a dozen or so of the ancient creatures left in the oceans this particular kraken was the oldest of the bunch according to shell scrapings old shelly as the small dedicated kraken watch referred to it was over ten thousand years old and had been masquerading as an island in helsinki harbour since the sixteenth century when the town was known as helsingfors in all that time shelly had done little but feed and sleep feeling no urge to migrate any need he may have felt to move on was dulled by the seepings of a paint factory built on his back more than a hundred years previously to all intents and purposes shelly was catatonic having emitted no more than a couple of methane flashes in over fifty years so there was no reason to believe that this red light on his sensor was anything more than a crossed wire and it was hollys job to uncross it it was a standard first day back on the job kind of mission no danger no deadline and little chance of discovery holly turned her palms into the wind descending till her boots scraped the roof of the islands small restaurant actually there were two islands separated by a small bridge one was a genuine island and the other larger section was shelly nestled into the rock holly ran a quick thermal sweep finding nothing but a few rodents and a blotch of heat from the sauna which was probably on a timer she consulted her visor for the sensors exact location it was four metres underwater tucked below a rocky ledge underwater of course she stowed her wings midair then plunged feet first into the baltic sea corkscrewing to minimize the splash not that there were any humans close enough to hear the sauna and restaurant did not open until eight and the nearest fishermen were on the mainland their rods swaying gently like rows of bare flagpoles holly vented the gas bags in her helmet to reduce buoyancy and sank below the waves her visor informed her that the water temperature was a little over ten degrees but the shimmer suit insulated her from cold shock and even flexed to compensate for the slight pressure increase use the critters said foaly his voice crystal clear through the vibration nodes over her ears get out of my head centaur go on use the critters i dont need a tracer its right there foaly sighed then they shall die unfulfilled the coded radiation tracers were microorganisms bathed in radiation of the same frequency as the object being located if you knew what you were looking for before leaving foalys workshop then the critters would bring you right to it though they were a little redundant when the sensor was a few metres away and beeping on your screen ok moaned holly i wish you would stop using me as a guinea pig she pulled back a watertight flap on her glove releasing a cloud of glowing orange mites into the water they bunched for a moment then sped off in a ragged arrow towards the sensor they swim they fly they burrow said foaly awed by his own achievement god bless their tiny hearts the critters left a glowing orange wake for holly to follow she pulled herself below a sharp ledge to find the critters already excavating the growths covering the sensor now come on that is handy tell me thats not useful to a field officer it was very useful especially since holly only had ten minutes of air left but foalys head was big enough as it was a gill helmet would have been more useful especially since you knew the sensor was underwater you have more than enough air argued foaly especially since the critters are clearing the surrounding area the critters ate away the rock and moss covering the sensor until it gleamed like the day it had come off the assembly line once their mission was completed the critters flickered and died dissolving in the water with a gentle fizz holly switched on her helmet lights focusing both beams on the alloy instrument the sensor was the size and shape of a banana and covered with an electrolytic gel the water is pretty clean thanks to shelly im getting a decent picture holly topped up her suit buoyancy a few notches until she was at neutral and hung in the water as still as she could well what do you see the same as you replied the centaur a sensor with a flashing red light i need to take a few readings if you wouldnt mind touching the screen holly laid her palm on the gel so that the omnisensor on her glove could sync with the ancient instrument nine and a half minutes foaly dont forget please snickered the centaur i could recalibrate a fleet of satellites in nine and a half minutes it was probably true thought holly as her helmet ran a systems check on the sensor hmm sighed foaly thirty seconds later hmm repeated holly nervously dont hmm foaly dazzle me with science but dont hmm there doesnt seem to be anything wrong with this sensor it is remarkably functional which means that the other three sensors are malfunctioning concluded holly so much for your genius i did not design these sensors said foaly wounded theyre old koboi gear holly shuddered her body jerking in the water her old enemy opal koboi had been one of the peoples leading innovators until shed decided that she would prefer to pursue all criminal avenues to crown herself queen of the world instead now she was housed in a specially constructed isolation prison cube suspended in atlantis and spent her time shooting off mails to politicians pleading for early release apologies old friend for doubting your wonderfulness i suppose i should check the other sensors above sea level i do hope hmm said foaly again please stop that surely now i am here i should check the remaining sensors silence for a moment while foaly accessed a few files then he spoke in hitched phrases as the information opened before him the other sensors are not the pressing issue right now what we really need to know is why would shelly be redlining on this sensor let me just see if we have ever had these kinds of readings before holly had no choice but to maintain contact with the sensor legs swaying underneath her watching the air clock on her visor run down ok said foaly finally two reasons for a krakens readings to redline one shelly is having a baby kraken which is impossible since hes a sterile male that leaves two said holly who was certain that she would not like the second reason and two hes shedding holly rolled her eyes in relief shedding that doesnt sound so bad weeeellll its a little worse than it sounds what do you mean a little why dont i explain as you fly away as fast as you can holly did not need to be told twice when foaly advised an officer to leave before he delivered one of his beloved lectures then the situation was serious she spread her arms wide and the action was mimicked by the wings on her back engage she said pointing both arms to the surface and the engines ignited blasting her clear of the baltic boiling the water wake as it hung in the air her suit was instantly dry as moisture slipped from its nonstick material and air resistance tugged at any remaining drops in seconds she had climbed to a hundred metres the anxiety in foalys voice hurrying her along a kraken sheds its shell once and records show that shelly dumped his three thousand years ago so we presumed that was that but now now it seems as though shelly has lived long enough to do it again and why are we concerned about this we are concerned about this because kraken shed very explosively the new shell has already grown and shelly will get rid of the old one by igniting a layer of methane cells and blasting it off holly wanted to be sure she understood what was being said so youre saying that shelly is going to light a fart no shelly is going to light the fart he has stored enough methane to power haven for a year there hasnt been a fart like this since the last dwarf tribal gathering a computer representation of the explosion appeared in her visor to most fairies the image would be little more than a blur but lep officers were forced to develop the double focus necessary to read their screens and watch where they were going at the same time when the simulation put holly clear of the projected blast radius she dropped her boots swinging in a loose ascending arc to face the kraken isnt there something we can do besides take a couple of pictures nope too late for that only a few minutes to go shellys inner shell is already at ignition temperature so put your glare filter down and watch the show holly lowered her shade this is going to make the news all over the world islands dont just explode yes they do volcanic activity gas leaks chemical accidents believe me if theres one thing the mud men do know its how to explain away an explosion the americans invented area fiftyone just because a senator crashed a jet into a mountain the mainland is safe should be a little shrapnel maybe holly relaxed hanging from her wings there was nothing she could do nothing she should do this was a natural process and the kraken had every right to shed its shell methane explosions mulch would love this mulch diggums was currently running a private investigations office in haven with the pixie wheelfairy doodah day mulch had in his time caused some methane disturbances himself something pulsed gently in hollys visor a plasma splodge of red in the thermalsweep windows there was life on the island and not just insect or rodent multiple humans foaly i have something holly resized the window with a series of blink commands to track down the source there were four hot bodies inside the sauna inside the sauna foaly how did we miss them their bodies were at the same temperature as the brick walls replied the centaur im guessing that one of the mud men opened the door holly magnified her visor to plus six and saw that the sauna door was open a crack a wedge of steam pushing through the gap the building was cooling faster than the humans and so now they showed up separately on her scanner what are those mud men doing here you said nothing opens until eight i dont know holly how would i know theyre humans about as reliable as moonmad demons it didnt matter why the humans were there and wondering about it was a waste of time i have to go back foaly foaly put a camera on himself broadcasting his live image to hollys helmet look at my face holly do you see this expression thats my stern face do not do it holly do not return to the island humans die every day and we do not interfere the lep never interferes i know the rules said holly muting the growling centaur there goes my career again she thought angling her wings for a steep dive four men sat in the saunas outer room feeling very smug that they had once again outwitted island authorities and managed to sneak a free sauna before work it did help that one of the men was uunisaaris security guard and had access to the keys and a little fivehorsepower punt that accommodated the four friends and a bucket of karjala beer good temperature in the sauna today said one a second wiped the steam from his glasses a little hot i thought in fact even here it feels hot underfoot go jump in the baltic then said the guard miffed at this lack of appreciation for his efforts that will cool down your poor pinkies dont pay any attention to him said the fourth man fastening his watch he has sensitive feet always some temperature problem the men friends since childhood laughed and swigged their beers the laughing and swigging ceased abruptly when a section of the roof suddenly caught fire and disintegrated the guard coughed out a mouthful of beer was someone smoking i said no smoking even if one of his sauna buddies had answered the guard would not have heard as he had somehow managed to fly through the hole in the roof my toes are really hot said the bespectacled man as if hanging on to old topics of conversation might make new ones go away the others ignored him busy doing what men generally do in dangerous times putting on their trousers there was no time for introductions or doors so holly drew her neutrino sidearm carved a twometre hole in the roof and was treated to the sight of four pale semidressed mud men quivering in sudden fright im not surprised theyre quivering she thought and thats only the beginning as she flew she worked on her problem how to get four humans out of the blast zone in as many minutes until recently she would have had a second problem the building itself according to the fairy book fairies were forbidden to enter human buildings without an invitation this was a tenthousandyearold hex that still had a little sting causing nausea and loss of power to anyone who defied it the law was an anachronism and a serious impediment to lep operations so after a series of public debates and a referendum the hex had been lifted by demon warlock n it had taken the little demon five minutes to unravel a hex that had stumped elfin warlocks for centuries back to the original problem four large humans big explosion imminent the first one was easy enough and the obvious choice he was blocking the others and wore nothing but a towel and a tiny security guards cap which perched on top of his skull like a nut shell on the head of a bear holly grimaced i have to get him out of my sight as soon as possible or i may never forget this image that mud man has more muscles than a troll troll of course there had been several additions to the recon kit while holly had been in limbo most invented and patented by foaly naturally one such addition was a new clip of darts for her neutrino the centaur called them antigravity darts but the officers called them floaters the darts were based on foalys own moonbelt which generated a field around whatever was attached to it reducing the earths gravitational pull to onefifth of normal the moonbelt was useful for transporting heavy equipment field officers quickly adapted the belt to their own specialized needs attaching their prisoners to the pitons which made them much easier to handle foaly had then developed a dart that had the same effect as his moonbelt the dart used the fugitives own flesh to conduct the charge that rendered him almost weightless even a troll seems less threatening when it is bobbing in the breeze like a balloon holly slipped the clip from her belt using the heel of one hand to ram it into the neutrino darts she thought back to the stone age the big security guard was square in her sights his lip wobbling petulantly no need for laser sights with this mud man she thought i could hardly miss and she didnt the tiny dart pricked the mans shoulder and he quivered for a moment until the antigravity field encircled him ooh he said thats a little then holly had landed beside him grasped his pale thigh and hurled him into the sky he went faster than a popped balloon leaving a trail of surprised os in his wake the remaining men hurriedly finished pulling on their trousers two tripped in their haste banging heads before crashing to the ground plates of tomatoandmozzarella rolls were batted aside bottles of beer went spinning across the tiles my sandwiches said one man even as he struggled with his purple jeans no time for panic thought holly silent and invisible among them she ducked low avoiding pale swinging limbs and quickly loosed off three more darts a strange calm descended on the sauna as three grown men found themselves floating towards a hole in the roof my feet are began the bespectacled man shut up about your feet shouted sandwich man swiping at him with a fist the motion sent him spinning and bouncing like a pinball foaly overrode hollys mute darvit holly you have seconds seconds get out of there now even your suit armour will not stop an explosion of this magnitude hollys face was red and sweating in spite of her helmets climate control seconds left how many times have i heard that no time for subtleties she lay flat on her back tapping the readout on her neutrino to select concussion beams and fired a wide pattern blast straight up the beam bore the men aloft as a fastflowing river would bear bubbles bouncing them off the walls and each other before finally popping them through the stillsparking circle in the roof the last man out looked down as he left wondering absently why he was not gibbering in panic surely flying was grounds for hysteria that will probably come later he decided if there is a later for me in the steam of the sauna it seemed to him that there was a small humanoid shape lying on the floor a diminutive figure with wings that leaped to its feet then sped towards the flying men its all true thought the man just like lord of the rings fantasy creatures all true then the island exploded and the man stopped worrying about fantasy creatures and began worrying about his trousers which had just caught fire with all four men in the air holly decided that it was time to get herself as far from the supposed island as possible she jumped from a squatting position engaged her wings in the air and shot into the morning sky very nice said foaly you know theyre calling that move the hollycopter dont you holly drew her weapon urging the weightless men further away from the island with short bursts busy staying alive foaly talk later foaly said sorry friend im worried i talk when im worried caballine thinks its a defence mechanism anyway the hollycopter you did the same takeoff during that rooftop shootout in darmstadt major i mean commander kelp caught it on video theyre using the footage in the academy now you wouldnt believe how many cadets have broken their ankles trying the same trick holly was about to insist that her friend please shut up when shelly ignited his methane cells decimating his old shell and sending tons of debris hurtling skywards the shockwave took holly from below like a giants punch sending her pinwheeling she felt her suit flex to avoid the shock the tiny scales closing ranks against the impact like the shields of a demon battalion there was a slight hiss as her helmet plumped the safety bags protecting her brain and spinal cord the screens in her visor flickered jumped then settled the world spun by her visor in a series of blues and greys the artificial horizon in her helmet did several revolutions end over end though holly realized that in actuality she was the one revolving and not the display alive still alive my odds must be getting short foaly broke in on her thoughts heart rate is up though i dont know why one would think youd be used to these situations by now the four humans made it you will be delighted to know since you risked your life and my technology to save them what if one of my floaters had fallen into human hands holly used a combination of gestures and blinks to fire short bursts from several of her wings twelve engines wrestling back control of her rig she opened her visor to cough and spit then answered his accusation im fine thanks for asking and all lep equipment is fitted with remote destruct even me so the only way your precious floaters were ever going to fall into human hands was if your technology failed which reminds me said foaly i need to get rid of those darts below was pandemonium it seemed as though half of helsinkis inhabitants had already managed to launch themselves in various crafts and a veritable flotilla was heading towards the explosion site led by a coastguard vessel two powerful outboards churning at its stern nose up for speed the kraken itself was obscured by smoke and dust but charred fragments of its shell rained down like volcanic ash coating the decks of the boats below and draping a dark blanket over the baltic sea twenty metres to hollys left the floating men bobbed happily through the air riding the last ripples of explosive shock trousers hanging in tattered ruins from their waists i am surprised said holly zooming in on the men no screaming or wetting themselves a little drop of relaxant in the dart chuckled foaly well i say a little drop enough to have a troll missing his mummy trolls occasionally eat their mothers commented holly exactly foaly waited until the men had dropped to within three metres of the oceans surface then remote detonated the tiny charge in each dart four small pops were followed by four loud splashes the men were in the water no more than a few seconds before the coastguard reached them ok said the centaur obviously relieved potential disaster averted and our good deed done for the day kick up your boots and head back for the shuttle station i have no doubt that commander kelp will want a detailed report just a second i have mail mail mail do you really think this is the time your power levels are down and the rear panels of your suit have taken a severe pasting you need to get out of there before your shield fails altogether i have to read this one foaly its important the mail icon flashing in hollys visor was tagged with artemiss signature artemis and holly colourcoded their mail icons green was social blue was business and red was urgent the mail icon in hollys visor pulsed a bright red she blinked at the icon opening the short message mother dying it read please come at once bring n holly felt a cold dread in her stomach and the world seemed to lurch before her eyes mother dying bring n the situation must be desperate if artemis was asking her to bring the powerful demon warlock she flashed back to the day eighteen years ago when her own mother had passed away almost two decades now and the loss was still as painful as a raw wound a thought struck her its not eighteen years its twentyone ive been away for three coral short had been a doctor with lepmarine which patrolled the atlantic cleaning up after humans protecting endangered species she had been mortally injured when a particularly rancidlooking tanker they were shadowing accidentally doused their submarine with radioactive waste dirty radiation is poison to fairies and it had taken her mother a week to die i will make them pay holly had vowed crying at her mothers bedside in haven clinic i will hunt down every last one of those mud men no her mother had said with surprising force i spent my career saving creatures you must do the same destruction cannot be my legacy it was one of the last things she would ever say three days later holly stood stonyfaced at her mothers recycling ceremony her green dress uniform buttoned to the chin the omnitool that her mother had given her as a graduation present in its holster on her belt saving creatures so holly applied to recon and now artemiss mother was dying holly realized that she didnt think of artemis as a human any more just as a friend i need to go to ireland she said foaly did not bother to argue he had sneaked a peek at the urgent mail on hollys screen go i can cover for you here for a few hours i could say youre completing the ritual as it happens theres a full moon tonight and we still have a few magical sites near dublin ill send a message to section eight maybe qwan will let number one out of the magilab for a few hours thanks old friend youre welcome now go im going to get out of your head for a while and monitor the chatter here maybe i can plant a few ideas in the human media i like the idea of an underground natural gas pocket its almost the truth almost the truth holly couldnt help applying the phrase to artemiss mail so often the irish boy manipulated people by telling them almost the truth she chided herself silently surely not even artemis fowl would not lie about something this serious everyone had their limits didnt they chapter echoes of magic artemis senior assembled his troops in fowl manors conference room which had originally been a banqueting hall until recently the soaring gothic arches were hidden by a false ceiling but angeline fowl had ordered the ceiling to be removed and the hall restored to its original doubleheight glory artemis his father and butler sat in black leather marcel breuer chairs round a glasstopped table with space for ten more people not so long ago there were smugglers seated at this table thought artemis not to mention crime lords hackers insider traders counterfeiters black marketeers and cat burglars the old family businesses artemis senior closed his laptop he was pale and obviously exhausted but the old determination shone brightly in his eyes the plan is a simple one we must seek out not just a second opinion but as many opinions as possible butler will take the jet and go to china no time for official channels so perhaps you could find a strip where immigration is a little lax butler nodded i know just the place i can be there and back in two days all going well artemis senior was satisfied good the jet is fuelled and ready i have already organized a full crew and an extra pilot i just need to pack a few things then i can be on my way artemis could imagine what kinds of things butler would pack especially if there were no officials at the airstrip what will you do father he asked i am going to england said artemis senior i can take the helicopter to london city airport and from there a limousine to harley street there are several specialists i can talk to and it will be far more efficient to send me there than bring them all here if any of them can shed even the most feeble ray of light on your mothers situation then i will pay them whatever it takes to get them back here buy out their practices if necessary artemis nodded wise tactics still he would expect no less from the man who had successfully run a criminal empire for over two decades and a humanitarian one for the past few years everything artemis senior did now was ethical from his fairtrade clothes company to his shares in earthpower a consortium of likeminded businessmen who were building everything from renewablefuel cars to geothermal rods and solar panels hed even had the fowl cars jet and helicopter fitted with advanced emission filters to lighten the familys carbon footprint i shall remain here announced artemis without waiting to be told i can coordinate your efforts set up a web cam so that the harley street specialists can see mother supervise doctor schalke and miss book and also conduct my own internet search for possible cures artemis senior half smiled exactly son i hadnt thought of the web cam butler was anxious to depart but he had a point to make before going i am not comfortable about leaving artemis alone a genius he may be but he is still a habitual meddler and a magnet for trouble the bodyguard winked at artemis no offence young sir but you could turn a sunday picnic into an international incident artemis accepted the accusation graciously none taken that thought has occurred to me said artemis senior scratching his chin but there is nothing for it the nanny has agreed to take the twins to her cottage in howth for a couple of days but arty is needed here and so he will have to fend for himself which will not be a problem said artemis have a little faith please artemis senior reached across the table covering his sons hand with his own faith in each other is all we have now we have to believe that saving your mother is possible do you believe it artemis noticed one of the upper windows swinging slowly ajar a leaf curled into the room riding a swirling breeze then the window seemed to close itself i absolutely believe it father more with every minute holly did not reveal her self until artemis seniors modified sikorsky sc had lifted off from the rooftop heliport artemis was busy rigging a web cam at the foot of his mothers bed when the elf shimmered into view with her hand on his shoulder artemis i am so sorry she said softly thanks for coming holly said artemis you got here quickly i was above ground in finland chasing a kraken ah yes tennysons beast said artemis closing his eyes remembering a few lines from the famous poem below the thunders of the upper deep far far beneath in the abysmal sea his ancient dreamless uninvaded sleep the kraken sleepeth sleepeth not any more watch the news headlines later there was a natural gas explosion apparently i would guess that foaly is up to his old spindoctoring tricks yes not many kraken left now commented artemis seven by my reckoning seven said holly surprised were only tracking six ah yes six i meant six new suit he asked changing the subject a little too quickly three years more advanced than the last one replied holly filing the kraken titbit for investigation at a later time it has autoarmour if the sensors feel something big coming the entire suit flexes to cushion the blow its saved my life once today already a message icon beeped in hollys helmet and she took a moment to read the short text number one is on the way theyre sending the section eight shuttle no way to contain this now so whatever we need to do has to be done fast good i need all the help i can get their conversation petered out as angeline fowls deathly illness completely occupied their thoughts she radiated pallor and the smell of lilies hung yellow in the air artemis fumbled with the web cam and it rolled under the bed hellfire he swore kneeling to reach an arm into the dark space i cant i just cant and suddenly the enormity of the situation struck him hard what kind of son am i he whispered a liar and a thief all my mother has ever done was love me and try to protect me and now she may die holly helped artemis to his feet youre not that person any more artemis and you love your mother dont you artemis huffed embarrassed yes of course then you are a good son and your mother will see that as soon as i cure her holly clicked her neck and magical sparks leaped from her fingertips spinning in an inverted cone no blurted artemis wouldnt it be wise to check the symptoms first holly closed her fist smothering the sparks suspicious she took off her helmet and stepped close to artemis closer than he liked people to be staring hard into his mismatched eyes it was strange to see her own eye looking back at her have you done something artemis artemis met her gaze steadily it seemed that there was nothing in his eyes but sadness no i am more cautious with my mother than i would be with myself that is all hollys suspicion was born of years of experience with artemis and so she wondered why he would be reluctant to allow her to use magic now when it had never bothered him before perhaps he had already tried this route himself perhaps the time stream had not stripped him of his stolen magic as he had claimed she clamped her hands to the side of artemiss head then laid her forehead against his stop this holly objected artemis we have no time holly did not answer closing her eyes concentrating artemis felt heat spread across his skull and the familiar buzz of magic holly was probing him it lasted barely a second nothing she said releasing him echoes of magic but no power artemis stumbled backwards dizzy i understand your suspicion holly i have earned it repeatedly now would you please examine my mother holly realized that up to this point she had avoided doing anything more than take a cursory glance at angeline fowl this entire situation brought back too many painful memories of course artemis im sorry about the probe i had to be sure that i could take all of this on face value my feelings are not important said artemis leading holly by the elbow now my mother please holly had to force herself to examine angeline fowl properly and the moment she did a deeprooted dread sent pins and needles fluttering up and down her limbs i know this she whispered i know it this condition is familiar to you asked artemis his mothers face and arms were coated with a clear gel that oozed from her pores and then steamed away angelines eyes were wide but only the whites were visible and her fingers clutched the sheets as though hanging on to life holly took a medikit from her belt placed it on the bedside table and used a swab to take a sample of the gel this gel that smell it cant be it cant it cant be what asked artemis his fingers tight on her forearm holly ignored him slipping her helmet on and opening a channel to police plaza foaly are you there the centaur responded on the second buzz right here holly chained to the desk commander kelp has sent me a couple of mails asking where you are i fobbed him off with the ritual story i reckon you have about holly interrupted his chatter foaly listen to me artemiss mother i think we have something i think its bad the centaurs mood changed instantly holly suspected that he had been waffling to hide his anxiety after all artemiss message had been very grim ok ill sync with the manor systems ask artemis for his password holly lifted her visor to look artemis in the eye foaly wants your security password of course of course artemis was drifting and it took him a moment to remember his own secret word its centaur all caps below the earths crust foaly stored the compliment in the corner of his brain that held treasured memories he would take that one out later and gloat over a glass of simwine centaur right im in a large plasma television on the wall flickered on and foalys face appeared first in blurred bubbles then in sharp focus the web cam in artemiss hand whirred as the centaur remotely fiddled with its focus motor the more points of view the better eh he said his voice pulsing from the television speakers in surround sound artemis held the camera before his mothers face holding it as still as possible i take it from hollys reaction that this condition is familiar to you holly pointed to the sheen covering angelines face see the gel foaly from the pores and the smell of lilies too there cant be any doubt its impossible muttered the centaur we eradicated this years ago artemis was growing weary of these vague references what is impossible eradicated what no diagnosis just yet artemis it would be premature holly i need to run a scan holly positioned the palm of her hand over angeline fowls forehead and the omnisensor in her glove bathed artemiss mother in a matrix of lasers foalys finger swished like a metronome as the information was fed to his system it was an unconscious movement that seemed too jolly for the situation ok he said after half a minute i have what i need holly closed her fist on the sensor then stood with artemis clasping his hand in hers silently awaiting the results it did not take long especially when foaly had a good idea of his search parameters his face was grim as he read the results the computer has analysed the gel i am afraid its spelltropy artemis noticed hollys grip tightening whatever this spelltropy was it was bad he broke free from holly striding to the wallmounted television i need an explanation foaly now please foaly sighed then nodded very well artemis spelltropy was a plague among the fairy people once contracted it was invariably fatal and progressed to terminal stages in three months from that point the patient has less than a week this disease has everything neurotoxins cell destruction resistance to all conventional therapies incredibly aggressive its amazing really artemiss teeth were clenched thats fabulous foaly at last something even you can admire foaly wiped a bead of sweat from his nose pausing before he spoke there is no cure artemis not any more im afraid your mother is dying judging by the concentration in the gel i would say she has twentyfour hours thirtysix if she fights if its any consolation she wont suffer at the end holly crossed the room reaching up to grasp artemiss shoulder noticing how tall her human friend was becoming artemis there are things we can do to make her comfortable artemis shrugged her off almost violently no i can achieve wonders i have talents information is my weapon he returned his attention to the screen foaly forgive my outburst i am myself now you said that this spelltropy was a plague where did it begin magic said foaly simply then elaborated magic is fuelled by the earth and when the earth could no longer absorb the sheer bulk of pollutants the magic became tainted also spelltropy first appeared about twenty years ago in linfen china artemis nodded it made sense linfen was infamous for its high pollution levels as the centre of chinas coal industry the citys air was laden with fly ash carbon monoxide nitrogen oxides volatile organic compounds arsenic and lead there was a joke among chinese employers if you hold a grudge against an employee send him to work in linfen it is passed on through magic and thus is completely impervious to magic in ten years it had almost decimated the fairy population we lost twentyfive per cent of our numbers atlantis was worst hit but you stopped it artemis insisted you must have found a cure not me said foaly our old friend opal koboi found the antidote it took her ten years then she tried to charge through the nose for it we had to get a court order to confiscate the supply of antidote artemis was growing impatient i dont care about the politics foaly i want to know what the cure was and why we cant administer it to my mother its a long story abbreviate snapped artemis foalys eyes dipped unable to meet artemiss the cure occurred naturally many creatures contain an important pharmacopoeia and act as natural magic enhancers but because of human activities more than twenty thousand of these potentially lifesaving species become extinct every year opal developed a simple syringe gun to extract the cure for spelltropy without killing the donor animal artemis suddenly realized why foaly couldnt look him in the eye he cradled his head in his hands oh no dont say it opal koboi found the antidote in the brain fluid of the silky sifaka lemur of madagascar i always knew moaned artemis that this would come back unfortunately the silky sifaka is now extinct the last one died almost eight years ago artemiss eyes were haunted by guilt i know he whispered i killed it chapter monkeys uncle fowl manor almost eight years ago tenyearold artemis fowl closed the file he was working on put his monitor to sleep then rose from his study desk his father would arrive in a moment for their meeting artemis senior had confirmed the appointment that morning by internal mail and he was never late his time was precious and he expected his son to be ready for their morning talk artemiss father arrived promptly at ten leather greatcoat swishing around his knees minus fifteen in murmansk he explained formally shaking his sons hand artemis was standing on a specific flagstone before the fireplace he was not actually required to stand in this spot but he knew his father would sit in the louis xv chair by the hearth and artemis senior did not like to crane his neck as he spoke his father lowered himself into the period chair and artemis enjoyed a quiet moment of satisfaction the ship is ready i take it ready to sail said his father excitement flashing in his blue eyes this is a new market arty my boy moscow is already one of the most commercial cities in the world northern russia will inevitably follow i gather mother is not very pleased with your latest venture recently artemiss parents had been arguing late into the night the conflict in their otherwise happy marriage was over artemis seniors business interests he controlled a criminal empire that had tentacles from the silver mines of alaska to the shipyards of new zealand angeline was a dedicated conservationist and humanitarian and believed that artemis seniors criminal activities and ruthless exploitation of natural resources set a terrible example to their son he will grow up just like his father artemis had heard her say one evening through a little radio bug hed planted in the aquarium i thought you loved his father artemis heard a rustling of material as his parents embraced i do i love you more than life but i love this planet too my love said artemis senior so gently that it was difficult for the bug to pick up his voice the fowl finances are in a delicate state right now what capital we have is locked up in illegal ventures i need one big deal so that i can begin the transition to completely legitimate businesses once we have some bluechip stock under our belts then we can save the world artemis heard his mother kiss his father very well my pirate prince one big deal then we save the world one big deal a shipload of taxfree cola for the russians but more importantly a pipeline of trade into the arctic artemis suspected that his father would find it hard to abandon this pipeline after a single deal there were billions to be made the fowl star is fully loaded and ready for her voyage artemiss father informed his son later during their scheduled meeting in his study remember the world cannot be saved with good intentions alone leverage is needed and gold is leverage artemis senior pointed to the fowl crest and motto carved into a wooden shield above the fireplace aurum potestas est gold is power never forget that arty until the greens have wealth behind them no one will listen young artemis was torn between his parents his father embodied everything the family stood for the fowl dynasty had flourished for centuries because of their dedication to wealth and artemis had no doubt that his father would find a way first to increase their fortunes and then turn his attention to the environment he loved his mother but the fowls finances must be saved some day control of the family business will fall to you artemis senior told his son standing to button his greatcoat and when that day comes i will rest easy because i know you will put the fowls first absolutely father said artemis fowls first but that day will not come for decades artemis senior laughed lets hope not son now i must be off look after your mother while i am gone and dont let her squander the family fortune eh the words were said in a lighthearted way but a week later artemis fowl senior was missing presumed dead and those words became the code his son would live by look after your mother but dont let her squander the family fortune two months later and artemis was back at his desk staring at the computer display in his study on screen were the gloomy details of the family finances which had dwindled rapidly since the disappearance of his father he was the man of the house now custodian of the fowl empire and must behave as such no sooner had artemis seniors ship been claimed by the black arctic waters than his debtors unanimously defaulted and his cells of forgers musclemen thieves and smugglers allied themselves to other organizations honour among thieves reflected artemis bitterly i think not most of the fowl money simply disappeared overnight and artemis was left with an estate to run and a mother who was heading rapidly towards nervous breakdown it wasnt long before the creditors were closing in eager to claim their slice of the pie before only crumbs were left artemis had been forced to auction a rembrandt sketch just to pay the mortgage on the manor and settle various other debts mother was not making things any easier she refused to believe that artemis senior was missing and forged ahead with her mission to save the world hang the expense artemis meanwhile was trying to mount expeditions to find his father this was difficult when you are ten years old and not taken seriously by the adult world in general in spite of various international art and music prizes not to mention over a dozen lucrative patents and copyrights filed worldwide in time artemis would build a fortune of his own but in time was not soon enough money was needed now artemis wanted to put together a proper situations room to monitor the internet and world news channels that would take twenty computers at least also there was the team of arctic explorers waiting in their moscow hotel for him to wire the next portion of their payment a payment that he didnt have artemis tapped the screen with an elegant finger something must be done he thought angeline fowl was crying on her bed when artemis entered the bedroom his heart lurched at the sight but he clenched his fists and told himself to be strong mother he said waving a bank account statement what is this angeline dried her eyes on a handkerchief then rose to her elbows slowly focusing on her son arty little arty come and sit with me angelines eyes were ringed by black mascara tears and her complexion had faded to a white that was almost translucent be strong no mother no sitting and talking i want you to explain this fiftythousandeuro cheque to a wildlife centre in south africa angeline was bewildered south africa darling whos gone to south africa you sent a cheque for fifty thousand euro to south africa mother i had that money put aside for the arctic expedition fifty thousand that figure is familiar ill ask your father when he gets in he had better not be late for dinner again today or ill artemis lost his patience mother please try to think we do not have spare funds for south african charities all the staff have been let go except butler and he hasnt been paid in a month lemur shouted angeline triumphantly i remember now i bought a silky sifaka lemur impossible snapped artemis the propithecus candidus is extinct his mother was suddenly passionate no no they found little silky in south africa they dont know how it managed to get there from madagascar probably on a poachers boat so i had to save it its the last one arty in a year or two it will die said artemis coldly then our money will have been wasted angeline was horrified you sound just like father good someone has to be rational artemiss face was stern but inside he quailed how could he speak to his mother like this when she was literally driven demented by grief why have i not fallen to pieces he wondered and the answer came to him quickly i am a fowl and fowls have always triumphed in the face of adversity but fifty thousand mother for a lemur they may find a female argued angeline then we will have saved a species there is no point in arguing thought artemis logic cannot prevail here and where is lucky silky now he asked innocently smiling as a tenyearold should when discussing a small furry animal he is safe in rathdown park living like a king tomorrow he is being flown to a special artificial habitat in florida artemis nodded rathdown park was a privately funded nature reserve in wicklow specially constructed to protect endangered species it had tighter security than the average swiss bank thats wonderful perhaps i will visit the fiftythousandeuro monkey now now artemis his mother chided silky is a lemur they predate monkeys as you well know i know but do not care artemis wanted to scream father is missing and you have spent the expedition money on a lemur but he held his tongue mother was delicate at the moment and he did not want to contribute to her instability rathdown dont usually accept visitors continued angeline but i am sure if i made a call they would make an exception for you the fowls did pay for the primate village after all artemis appeared delighted thank you mother that would be a real treat for me and butler too you know how he likes small furry creatures i would love to see the species we have saved angeline smiled with a degree of madness that scared her son terribly well done artemis this is one in the eye for the bigbusiness men mother and son united we shall save the world i shall tease your father terribly when he gets home artemis backed slowly towards the door his heart in his shoes yes mother united we shall save the world once the door had closed behind him artemis stepped briskly downstairs fingers conducting imaginary music as he plotted he detoured to his bedroom and dressed quickly for a trip then continued to the kitchen where he found butler slicing vegetables with a japanese kodachi short sword he was now chef and gardener as well as protector the huge bodyguard was making quick work of a cucumber a summer salad he explained just greens hardboiled egg and some chicken i thought crème brûlée for dessert it will give me a chance to try out my flamethrower he glanced across at artemis and was surprised to see him dressed in one of his two suits the dark blue one he had worn recently to the opera in covent garden artemis had always been a neat dresser but a suit and tie was unusual even for him are we going somewhere formal artemis nowhere formal said artemis with a coldness in his tone that the bodyguard had not heard before but would come to know well just business i am in charge of the family affairs now and so i should dress accordingly ah i detect a distinct echo of your father butler wiped the sword carefully then pulled off his apron we have some typical fowl family business to conduct do we yes replied artemis with a monkeys uncle fowl manor present day holly was aghast so in a fit of childish pique you murdered the lemur artemis had composed himself and sat on a bedside chair holding his mothers hand gently as though it were a bird no i used to suffer from the occasional fit of pique as you well know but they generally did not last an intellect such as mine cannot be overpowered by emotions for long but you said that you killed the animal artemis rubbed his temple yes i did i didnt wield the knife but i killed it make no mistake how exactly i was young younger mumbled artemis uncomfortable with the topic a different person in many ways we know what you were like artemis said foaly in rueful tones you have no idea how much of my budget the fowl manor siege ate up holly pressed for an answer how did you kill the lemur how did you even get hold of it it was ridiculously easy admitted artemis butler and i visited rathdown park and simply disabled the security while we were there later that evening we both popped back and picked up the lemur so butler killed it i am surprised its not his style artemiss eyes were downcast no butler didnt do it i sold the lemur to a group of extinctionists holly was horrified extinctionists artemis you didnt thats horrible it was my first big deal said artemis i delivered it to them in morocco and they paid me a hundred thousand euro it funded the entire arctic expedition holly and foaly were speechless artemis had effectively put a price on life holly backed away from the human she had only moments ago considered a friend i rationalized the whole thing my father for a lemur how could i not go through with it artemis had real regret in his eyes i know it was a terrible thing to do if i could turn back the clock and suddenly he stopped he couldnt turn back the clock but he knew a demon warlock who could it was a chance a chance he laid his mothers hand gently on the bed then stood to pace plotting music he thought i need plotting music he selected beethovens symphony n from his vast selection of mental music and listened to it as he thought good choice sombre yet uplifting inspiring stuff artemis paced the carpet almost unaware of his surroundings lost in ideas and possibilities holly recognized this mood he has a plan she said to foaly the centaur pulled a long face which wasnt difficult why am i not surprised holly took advantage of artemiss distraction to seal her helmet and speak privately to foaly she walked to the window and peered out at the estate through a gap in the curtains the sinking sun wavered behind tree branches and clumps of dahlias flashed red and white like fireworks holly allowed herself time for a sigh of longing then focused on the situation theres more at stake here than artemiss mother she said foaly switched off the television so that artemis could not hear him i know if there is an outbreak it could be disaster for fairies we dont have any antidote left remember we need to interview opal koboi she must have kept records somewhere opal always kept her most valuable formulae in her head i think she was caught offguard by the jungle fire she lost all her donors in one fell swoop koboi industries had attracted the madagascan lemurs by setting a sonix box in the tsingy de bemaraha virtually every lemur in the island had responded to the boxs call and they had all been wiped out by an unfortunate lightning fire luckily they had already treated most of the infected but fifteen more fairies had died in quarantine wards artemis stopped pacing and cleared his throat loudly he was ready to share his plan and he wanted the fairies complete attention there is a relatively simple solution to our problem he said foaly reactivated the television his face filling the flat screen our problem come foaly dont pretend to be obtuse this is a fairy plague that has mutated and spread to humans you have no antidote and no time to synthesize one who knows how many cases of spelltropy are incubating right now including my own thought artemis i used magic on my mother so therefore i probably have the disease we will quarantine the manor responded foaly so long as no one uses magic on your mother we can contain this i seriously doubt that my mother is patient zero that is simply too much of a coincidence there are other cases out there who knows how far along foaly grunted his version of conceding a point so tell me artemis what is this relatively simple solution i go back in time and save the lemur said artemis smiling brightly as though he had suggested a pleasant summer dip silence complete silence for several moments broken eventually by a strangled whinny from foaly go back in time completed holly incredulously artemis sat in a comfortable armchair steepled his fingers and nodded once present your arguments please i am ready how can you be so smug wondered holly after all the tragedy we have seen after all the havoc your plans have wreaked i am determined not smug corrected artemis there is no time for prudence here my mother has hours left and the fairy people dont have much more foaly was still gaping do you have any idea how many constitution committee meetings we would have to sit through just to allow us to bring this issue to a council meeting artemis wagged a finger dismissively irrelevant i have read the peoples constitution it does not govern humans or demons if number one decides to help me technically you have no legal power to stop him holly joined the discussion artemis this is lunacy time travel was outlawed for a reason the potential repercussions from the slightest interference could be catastrophic artemis smiled mirthlessly ah yes the trusty time paradox if i go back in time and kill my grandfather then shall i cease to exist i believe as gorben and berndt did that any repercussions are already being felt we can only change the future not the past or present if i go back then i have already been back holly spoke kindly she felt sorry for artemis angelines illness reminded her painfully of her own mothers final days we cannot interfere artemis humans must be allowed to live their lives artemis knew that to ram home his next argument he should stand and theatrically deliver the accusation but he could not he was about to play the cruellest trick of his life on one of his closest friends and the guilt was almost unbearable you have already interfered holly he said forcing himself to meet her eyes the words made holly shiver she buzzed up her visor what do you mean you healed my mother healed her and damned her holly took a step back raising her palms as though to ward off blows me i what are you saying artemis was committed to the lie now and covered his guilt with a sudden burst of anger you healed my mother after the siege you must have given her spelltropy foaly came to his friends defence not possible that healing was years ago spelltropy has a threemonth incubation period and it never varies by more than a few days and it never affects humans artemis countered this is a new strain you have no idea what youre dealing with hollys face was slack with shock and guilt she believed artemiss words though artemis himself knew that he must have given his mother the disease when he adjusted her memory father must have it too who gave it to me and why am i not sick there were so many puzzles but now was not the time to unravel them now he needed to find the antidote and to ensure fairy aid he must play on their supposed guilt in this matter but im clean protested holly i was tested then you must be a carrier said artemis flatly he turned his gaze on the centaurs image thats possible isnt it foaly was taken aback by artemiss bluntness if this truly is a new strain then yes its possible he admitted but you cant draw any conclusions from supposition normally i would agree normally i would have the luxuries of time and objectivity but my mother is dying and so i have neither i must go back to save the lemur and you are honour bound to help me and if you wont help then at least you must promise not to hinder my efforts the fairies were silent holly was lost in thought about what she might have done foaly was wracking his considerable brain for responses to artemiss arguments he found none holly removed her helmet walking awkwardly to angeline fowls bedside her legs felt strangely numb and the feeling was spreading my mother died poisoned by humans it was an accident but that didnt keep her alive tears dripped from her eyes i wanted to hunt those men down i hated them holly wrung her hands im sorry artemis i didnt know how many others have i infected you must hate me take it back thought artemis tell the truth now or your friendship can never be the same then no be strong mother must live i dont hate you holly said artemis softly i hate myself but the deception must continue of course none of this is your fault but you must let me go back holly nodded then wiped her brimming eyelids i will do more than let you go i will escort you a sharp pair of eyes and a quick gun hand will prove useful no no no shouted foaly increasing the screens volume with each negative we cant simply alter the past whenever we feel like it perhaps holly should save her mother or bring commander julius root back from the dead this is totally unacceptable artemis pointed a finger at him this is a unique situation he said you have a plague about to erupt and we can stop it here not only that but you can reintroduce a species that was thought to be extinct i may have caused one lemur to die but opal koboi gathered the rest together for the lightning fire the people are as guilty as i am you harvested a living creatures brain fluid to save yourselves wwe were desperate argued foaly horrified that he would actually stutter exactly said artemis triumphantly you were willing to do anything remember how that felt and ask yourself if you want to go through it again foaly dropped his gaze thinking back that time had been a waking nightmare for the fairies the use of magic had been suspended and the lemurs were already extinct by the time a court order forced opal to reveal the source of her antidote he had worked sleeplessly to develop an alternative cure but without success we thought we were invincible the only disease left was man the centaur made up his mind the lemur must be alive he stated the brain fluid can be stored for brief periods but once it becomes inert the fluid is useless i was developing a charged container but this time you will succeed artemis assured him you will have a live subject and laboratory conditions you can clone a female cloning is illegal generally mused foaly but in extinction cases exceptions have been made hollys helmet beeped drawing her attention to a craft landing in the driveway she hurried to the window in time to see a slight shimmer cast a shadow on the moonlit driveway it must be a rookie pilot thought holly crossly he hasnt activated his shadowlights the shuttles here she informed artemis tell the pilot to park round the back in one of the stables the doctors assistant is making calls from my fathers office i dont want her going for a walk and bumping into a shielded fairy craft holly relayed the instructions and they waited tensely for the shuttle to manoeuvre to the back of the house it seemed like a long wait silent but for the rasp of angelines laboured breathing number one might not be able to do it said foaly almost to himself he is a young warlock with barely any training time travel is the most difficult of magics artemis did not offer a comment there was no point all his hopes rested on n he does it or mother dies he took angelines hand stroking the rough parchment skin with his thumb hold on mother he whispered i will only be a second chapter i now pronounce you the little demon known as n cut a strange figure waddling down the lep shuttles gangplank a small stocky individual with grey armoured plates and short limbs he looked a little like a miniature upright rhinoceros with fingers and toes except for the head the head was pure gargoyle i wish i had a tail thought n in actual fact he did have a tail but it was stubby and not good for much except making snow fans in haven citys artificial weather park n consoled himself with the observation that at least his tail didnt dangle down the toilet some of the hybras demons had trouble adjusting to the newfangled seats on the recycling lounges in haven he had heard horror stories apparently there had been three emergency reattachments this month alone the transition from limbo to normal time had been difficult for all demons but there were many more positives than negatives restrictions imposed under the old tribal leader were now being lifted demons could eat cooked food if they felt like it family units were taking hold again even the most belligerent demons were a lot more relaxed with their mothers around it was difficult to shake off ten millennia of humanhating and many of the buck demons were undergoing therapy or were on mood pills to stop them hopping a shuttle to the surface and chomping on the first human limb they saw not n though who had no limbchomping ambitions whatsoever he was something of an anomaly among demons n loved everyone even humans especially artemis fowl who had saved them all from the deathly dreariness of limbo not to mention leon abbot the psychopathic extribe leader so when the call came through to section eight that artemis needed him n had strapped himself into the divisions shuttle and demanded to be taken above ground wing commander vinyáya had agreed because disagreeing could lead to all sorts of magical tantrums from the fledgling warlock once in a fit of frustration n had accidentally shattered the magnifying wall of the citys huge aquarium fairies were still finding minnows in their toilet ponds you can go vinyáya had told him but only if you take a squad of guards to hold your hand every step of the way which did not literally mean hold his hand as n had found out when he tried to link with the captain of the guard but commander vinyáya said hed objected stow the hand demon ordered the captain therell be no handholding on my watch and so n appeared to approach fowl manor alone though he was flanked by a dozen shielded fairies halfway up the avenue he remembered to shroud his real appearance with a shapeshifting spell any human who happened to be looking down the driveway would now see a small boy in flowing flowered robes strolling towards the front door this was an image n had seen in a human movie from the last century and he thought it was appropriately nonthreatening miss book happened to appear at the doorway just as n reached it the sight of him stopped the nursepublicist in her tracks she tugged off her glasses as though they were feeding false information to her eyes hello there little boy she said smiling though she probably would not have been so jolly had she been aware of the twelve plasma rifles pointed at her head hi said n cheerily i love everyone so no need to feel threatened miss books smiled faltered threatened of course not are you looking for someone are you playing dressup artemis appeared at the doorway interrupting the conversation ah ferdinand where have you been he said quickly shepherding n past the nurse this is the gardeners boy ferdinand he explained a dramatic type ill summon his father to collect him good idea said miss book doubtfully i know your mothers room is sealed but dont let him upstairs all the same of course not said artemis ill send him out the back way good said the nurse i just need a breath of fresh air then i will come to check on your mother take your time said artemis i can read the instruments i designed a few of them he thought as soon as miss book disappeared round the corner artemis escorted his demon friend up the stairs were going upstairs objected n mildly didnt that young lady tell you not to allow me upstairs artemis sighed how long have you known me number one n nodded craftily ah i see artemis fowl never does what he is told to do holly greeted n on the landing but refused to hug him until he dropped the shapeshifting spell i hate the feel of those things she said its like hugging a wet sponge n pouted but i enjoy being ferdinand humans smile at me artemis assured him that there was no surveillance in his study and so the demon warlock waited until the door was closed behind them then banished the spell with a click of his fingers ferdinand unravelled and fell from n s body in a flurry of sparks leaving the small grey demon warlock wearing nothing but a wide grin holly hugged him tightly i knew you would come we need you desperately n stopped smiling ah yes artemiss mother does she want a magical cure thats the last thing she wants said holly once the situation was explained to n he immediately agreed to help you are in luck artemis said the little demon wiggling his eight fingers i did a module on time travel last week on the warlock diploma course im taking small class i bet commented artemis drily just me admitted n and qwan of course my teacher apparently i am the most powerful warlock qwan has ever seen good said artemis then transporting us all into the past shouldnt pose any problems for you foaly had projected himself on to five of artemiss various monitors all spluttered each image all you cant take number one with you artemis was not in the mood for argument i need him foaly end of discussion foaly looked as though his head would bulge through the screens it is most certainly not end of discussion holly is an adult she can make her own decision but number one is little more than a child you cannot jeopardize him on one of your missions a lot of hopes rest on that little demon the future of the fairy families none of us will have a future if number one doesnt take us to the past please stop said n all this arguing is making me dizzy there is no time for it artemiss face was red but he held his tongue unlike foaly who kept shouting but at least he muted the screens foaly needs to vent explained holly or he gets headaches the three waited until the centaur calmed himself then n spoke in any event i cannot go with you artemis thats not how it works but you transported us from limbo qwan did that he is a master i am but an apprentice and anyway we had no desire to go back to limbo if you wish to return here i need to stay as a marker explain said artemis tersely n spread his arms wide i am a beacon he declared a shining supernova of power any magic i release into the ether will be attracted back to me i send you into the past and you will snap back to me like puppies on a leash n frowned not happy with his simile one of those retractable leashes yes we get it said artemis how long will it take to weave the spell n chewed his lip for a moment about as long as it takes you two to remove your clothing hurkk said artemis halfchoking with surprise darvit swore holly i think we all know what darvit means said n but hurkk is not english unless you meant hark which means to listen or to remember something from the past which i suppose could be relevant or perhaps you were speaking dutch and then hurk would translate as squat n paused for a wink which means squat to me artemis leaned close to the demons cornetshaped ear why do we need to take our clothes off that is a very good question said holly into the other ear its quite simple said n i am not so skilled as qwan and even with qwan overseeing the last transfer you two managed to switch an eye each which was probably because someone was focusing on stealing magic if you take clothes or guns in there they could become a part of you the demon raised a stiff finger lesson number one of time transfers he stated keep it simple its going to take all of your concentration just to reassemble your bodies and you will be thinking for the lemur too n noticed both artemis and hollys awkward expressions and took pity on them i suppose you could keep one thing if you must a small garment but make sure its your colour because you could be wearing it for a really long time though they both knew that this was no time for modesty neither artemis nor holly could suppress a blush holly covered her embarrassment by tearing off her shimmer suit as quickly as possible im keeping the onepiece she said belligerently daring n to argue the onepiece looked similar to a swimsuit but was padded on the shoulders and back to support a wing rig there were also heat and kinetic panels which could absorb energy from the wearer to power the suit ok said n but i would advise you to remove the pads and any other electronics holly nodded tearing the pads from their velcro strips artemis gathered hollys things i will put your helmet and suit in the safe just to be certain they are secure no need to take chances with the peoples technology now youre thinking like a centaur foaly piped up it took only a minute to hide the fairy gear and when he returned from the safe room artemis took off his shirt and trousers carefully hanging them in his wardrobe he placed his loafers on a shoe rack alongside several similar black pairs and one brown for casual days nice underwear snickered foaly from the screen momentarily forgetting the gravity of the situation artemis was wearing a pair of red armani boxer shorts which were pretty much the same colour as his face can we get on with it he snapped where do you need us to stand wherever you need to be replied n simply its far easier for me if you take off and land at the same point its hard enough shooting you off down a wormhole faster than the speed of light without worrying about location too we are in the right location said artemis this is where we need to be you need to know when you want to arrive added n the temporal coordinates are as important as the geographical ones i know when very well said n rubbing his hands together time to send you on your way holly remembered something i havent completed the ritual she said im low on magic and without weapons that could be a problem we dont have an acorn not to mention a bend in the river added artemis n smirked those things could be problems unless a spiral rune on the demons forehead glowed red and spun like a catherine wheel it was hypnotizing wow said holly thats really then a pulsing beam of crimson magic blasted from the centre of the rune enveloping holly in a cocoon of light now youre full to the brim said n bowing low thank you very much im here all week dont forget to tip your goblins and bury those acorns wow said holly again when her fingertips stopped buzzing thats a neat trick more than you know thats my own signature magic the number one cocktail if you like which makes you a beacon in the time stream artemis shuffled selfconsciously how long do we have n gazed at the ceiling while he ran some calculations three hundred years no no three days holly can bring you back at any point before that simply by making herself open to my power but after three days the link grows weaker is there anything we can do about that lets face facts allpowerful i may be but im a novice at this so taking off from where you landed is vital if you go beyond three days then you are stuck in the past if we do get separated couldnt holly come back and get me wondered artemis no she could not said n it would be impossible for you to meet at a point neither of you had experienced this is a onetime deal only it will take everything i have to hold you together for this trip any more and your atoms would lose their memory and simply forget where it is they are supposed to go both of you have already been in the time stream twice i can transport objects forever and a day but living beings break down without a warlock in the stream to shield them holly asked a very pertinent question number one have you done this before of course said the demon several times on a simulator and two of the holograms survived artemiss determination barely flickered two survived the last two no admitted n the last two were trapped in a time wormhole and consumed by quantum zombies holly felt her pointy ears tingle always a bad sign elfin ears could sense danger quantum zombies youre not serious thats what i said to qwan he wrote the program this is irrelevant said artemis sharply we have no option but to go very well said n flexing his fingers he bent his knees resting his entire body weight on the tip of his tail power posture he explained i do some of my best work in this position so does mulch diggums muttered foaly quantum zombies i need to get a copy of that program a red haze blossomed around the demon warlock tiny lightning bolts crackling across his horns hes powering up said foaly from the screens youll be off any second remember try not to touch anything you dont have to dont talk to anyone dont contact me in the past i have no desire not to exist artemis nodded i know make as little impact as possible in case the time paradox theory has some merit holly was impatient to get going enough science just blast us into the past well bring the monkey back lemur said artemis and foaly together n closed his eyes when he opened them again they were pure crimson ok ready to go he said conversationally artemis blinked he was expecting n s voice of power to be a bit less squeaky are you sure n groaned i know its the voice isnt it not enough gravel qwan says i should go for less airy and more fairy trust me im ready now hold hands artemis and holly stood together in their underwear gingerly locking fingers they had crossed space and time together weathered rebellions and tangled with demented despots coughed blood lost digits inhaled dwarf fumes and swapped eyeballs yet they found holding hands awkward n knew he shouldnt but he couldnt resist a parting crack i now pronounce you neither handholder was amused but before they had time to do more than scowl twin bolts of red energy crackled from n s eyes blasting his friends into the time stream man and elf he said finishing his joke then chuckling delightedly on screen foaly snorted im guessing youre laughing to cover your anxiety exactly right said n where artemis and holly had been standing there were flickering copies of them both mouths open to object to ns comment that really freaks me out the ghost images its like theyre dead foaly shuddered dont say that if theyre dead we all could be how soon will they be back in about ten seconds and if theyre not back in ten seconds then never foaly started counting chapter i to i there is a moment of confusion when a land animal enters the water beast human or fairy it doesnt matter the surface is broken and every sense is suddenly shocked the cold stings motion slows and the eyes are filled with smears of colour and the snap of bursting bubbles the time stream is like that moment sustained thats not to say that travelling through the time stream is a consistent experience never the same journey twice the demon warlock qwan who was the planets most experienced timetravelling fairy wrote in his bestselling autobiography qwan my time is now that riding the time stream is like flying through a dwarfs intestine there are very nice freeflowing stretches but then you turn a corner to find the thing backedup and putrid the problem being that the time stream is largely an emotional construct and it absorbs ambient feelings from the real time it flows around if you happen across a stretch of foulsmelling gunk you can bet that the humans are killing something artemis and holly were being dragged through a foulsmelling stretch that corresponded with an entire ecosystem being destroyed in south america they could sense the animals terror and even smell the charred wood artemis felt too that holly was losing herself in the maelstrom of emotions fairies were so much more sensitive to their environments than humans if holly lost concentration her atoms would dissipate and be absorbed by the stream focus holly artemis broadcast into the stream remember who you are and why we are here it was difficult for them both their particle memory had already been weakened by the limbo journeys and the temptation to meld with the stream was strong artemis conjured a picture of his mother in his consciousness to bolster his determination i know when and where i want to be he thought exactly when and where fowl manor nearly eight years ago artemis and holly exited the time stream and entered tenyearold artemiss study physically this was a gentle enough experience like jumping from a low wall on to thick carpet but emotionally this particular trip was like a tenminute blitz of the worst memories of their lives the time stream never the same ride twice holly cried for her mother for a minute but eventually the persistent chiming of a grandfather clock reminded her of where and when she was she stood shakily and looked around her to find artemis lurching towards the wardrobe the sight of him cheered her a little you have really let yourself go she said artemis was rummaging through the clothes on the rail of course nothing will fit he muttered all too small holly elbowed past him not for me she said pulling a dark suit from its hanger my first suit said artemis fondly for the family christmas postcard i had no idea really how to wear it i remember fidgeting throughout the fitting its a zegna bespoke holly tore off a protective polythene wrap so long as it fits it was only then that artemiss emotions settled enough for him to register hollys comment what do you mean i have let myself go holly swung the wardrobes door so that its mirrored side faced artemis see for yourself she said artemis looked in the mirror he saw a tall slender boy his head all but invisible under a wild mop of shoulderlength hair and even some bristles on his chin ah i see im surprised you do said holly through all that hair accelerated ageing a side effect of the time stream artemis hypothesized unconcerned when we return the effects should be reversed he paused catching sight of hollys reflection perhaps you should check yourself in the mirror i am not the only one who has changed holly elbowed him aside certain she was being kidded but the halfsmile died on her lips when she saw the fairy in the looking glass it was her own face but different missing a few scars and a few decades wear and tear i am young she gasped younger dont be upset said artemis briskly it is temporary all this is nothing more than dressup my physical maturity your youth in a moment or two we will be back in the stream but holly was upset she knew how this had happened i was thinking of mother of our last hours together of how i was then and so that was how she had changed look at me just out of the academy in human terms barely older than artemis for some reason this was a disturbing thought get some trousers on she snapped buttoning a crisp white shirt to her neck then we can discuss your theories artemis used his extra inches to reach up and tug a large box from the top of the wardrobe in it were neatly folded layers of clothes destined for one of angeline fowls charity shops he tossed a silver wig to holly seventies fancydress party he explained mother went as a starship trooper i seem to remember now cover those pointy ears a hat would be easier said holly pulling the wig over her auburn crewcut no such luck im afraid sighed artemis selecting an old tracksuit from the box this is not exactly harrods we will have to make do artemiss old loafers fitted holly well enough and there was a pair of his fathers trainers in the box that stayed on his feet when the toes were stuffed always good to be dressed when youre stealing monkeys said holly artemis rolled up the tracksuit sleeves theres no need to dress at all really we simply wait for a few minutes until my mother almost catches butler sneaking upstairs with the lemur i remember him sliding the cage through the doorway then i brought it back upstairs the moment that cage comes in here we grab it take off these ridiculous clothes and wish our way back to number one holly checked herself in the mirror she looked like a presidential bodyguard from another planet that sounds so simple it was simple will be butler never even entered the study all we need to do is stand here and wait and how did you find this particular moment artemis swept a sheaf of black hair back from his brow revealing mismatched sorrowful eyes listen he said pointing upwards towards the ceiling holly tucked strands of silver hair behind one ear cocking her head to one side to focus her considerable sense of hearing she heard the grandfather clock and the time travellers beating hearts but above them there was a strident hysterical voice mother said artemis eyes downcast it was the first time that she did not recognize me she is at this moment threatening to call the police in a moment she runs downstairs to the phone and discovers butler holly understood how could any son forget a moment like that one finding it again must have been easy and painful i remember it clearly we had just returned from rathdown park the private zoo and i thought i should check how she was feeling before flying to morocco in a month from now she wont be able to look after herself any more holly squeezed his forearm its fine artemis this is all in the past in a few minutes your mother will be back on her feet she will love you as she always has artemis nodded glumly he knew it was probably true but he also knew that he would never fully escape the spectre of this bad memory upstairs angeline fowls voice moved from her bedchamber to the upper landing trailing shrill notes behind her artemis pulled holly back against the wall butler will be on the stairs now we should keep to the shadows just in case holly couldnt help a flutter of nerves youre sure he stays outside the last time i faced butler as an enemy i had the entire lep on my side i dont relish the thought of meeting him armed with nothing more than a silver wig calm yourself captain said artemis unconsciously patronizing he stays outside i saw it with my own eyes saw what with your own eyes asked butler who had appeared in the archway behind them having let himself in through the adjoining bedroom door artemis felt his pulse throb in his fingertips how could this be this was not the way it happened artemis had never been on the receiving end of butlers glare before and understood for the first time just how terrifying his bodyguard could be you two kids have been helping yourselves to the fowl wardrobe i see continued butler without waiting for an answer to his question now are you going to cause a fuss or are you going to come quietly let me give you a hint the correct answer is come quietly magic is the only way out holly realized she twisted her chin sharply to call on her fairy power if she couldnt stun butler she would mesmerize him stand down human she intoned voice loaded with hypnotic magic but the mesmer is a twopronged attack audio and visual butler could hear the magical words but eye contact was not consistent in the shadows what he said surprised how did you the hulking bodyguard had been drugged enough times to realize that his will was being sapped somehow these kids were putting him under he staggered backwards his shoulder bashing against the arch sleep butler said the little one in the starshiptrooper wig she knows me this was serious these two had done some surveillance and decided to break in anyway i have to neutralize them before i pass out thought butler if i go down master artemis and mrs fowl are defenceless he had two options fall on the midget burglars or shoot them with the tranquillizer pistol he was carrying for the planned animal abduction at rathdown park he chose the second option at least tranquillizer darts would not smother these two or crush their bones butler felt mildly guilty about his decision to trank a couple of kids but not overly so after all he worked for artemis fowl and knew exactly how dangerous children could be the starship trooper came out of the shadows and butler could see her eyes clearly one blue one tawny sleep butler she said again in that melodious layered voice arent your eyelids heavy sleep shes hypnotizing me butler realized he dragged out the pistol with fingers that felt as though they had been dipped in molten rubber then sprinkled with ball bearings you sleep he mumbled then shot the girl in the hip holly stared in disbelief at the hypodermic dart sticking out of her leg not again she moaned then collapsed to the floor butlers head cleared immediately the other intruder did not move an inch the little girl is the professional of the two thought butler climbing to his feet i wonder what this scruffy individual contributes to the partnership artemis quickly saw that he had no choice but to reveal his identity and enlist butler as an ally this will be difficult i have nothing more than a passing resemblance to my younger self as proof still he had to try before his plan unravelled utterly listen butler he began i have something to tell you butler didnt entertain another word no no no he said briskly shooting artemis in the shoulder no more talking from either of you artemis pulled out the dart but it was too late the tiny reservoir of sedative was empty butler he gasped dropping to his knees you shot me everyone knows my name sighed the bodyguard bending to sling the intruders over his shoulders i am intrigued said tenyearold artemis fowl studying the two individuals in the bentleys boot something extraordinary has happened here hardly extraordinary said butler checking the girls pulse two thieves somehow broke into the manor they bypassed all the security not so much as a blip on the motion sensors nothing i just happened on them during a routine sweep hiding in the shadows wearing castoffs from the wardrobe artemis tapped his chin hmm so you didnt find their clothes not a stitch which would mean that they broke in here and bypassed security in their underwear that is extraordinary admitted butler artemis took a penlight from his jacket pocket shining it on holly setting the strands of her silver wig sparkling like a disco ball theres something about this one her bone structure is very unusual the cheekbones are high slavic perhaps and the brow is wide and childlike but the proportion of skull to torso is adult not infant butler chuckled low in his throat so theyre aliens the young man is human but shes something else said artemis thoughtfully genetically enhanced perhaps he moved the beam of light along her cheekbone see here the ears are pointed amazing artemis felt an excitement buzzing on his forehead something was happening here something important there were surely serious amounts of money to be earned from this situation he rubbed his palms briskly very well i cannot be distracted by this now longterm this strange creature could make our fortune but right now we need to get that lemur butler was crestfallen but covered it by slamming the boot i had hoped we could forget the monkey i was trained in several forms of martial arts none of them had a monkey defence its a lemur butler and i am aware that you believe this operation is beneath us but my fathers life is at stake of course artemis whatever you say exactly so here is the plan we will proceed to rathdown park as planned and after we have done the deal with the extinctionists then i can decide what to do with our two guests i presume they will be safe in the boot butler snorted are you kidding artemis did not smile perhaps you have not noticed butler i rarely kid as you say young master you are not a kidder maybe some day eh perhaps when i find my father yes perhaps then anyway to answer your question this is your fathers car and there have been more prisoners in this boot than youve had birthdays mafiya triad yakuza tijuana cartel hells angels you name the gang and a couple of them have spent a night in this boot in fact your father had it specially modified theres airconditioning a staycool light soft suspension and even drinking water is it secure remember our captives already broke into the manor butler closed the boot titanium lock reinforced door no way out whatsoever those two are staying in there until we let them out excellent said artemis sliding into the bentleys rear seat just give me a moment to do this one little thing then lets forget about them and concentrate on the lemur excellent echoed butler and then under his breath monkey business my favourite rathdown park county wicklow ireland even though holly was five kilograms lighter than artemis she came to her senses before him she was glad to be awake as her dream had been terrible while asleep her knees and elbows had struck the metal walls of the bentleys boot and shed imagined herself in an lep submarine holly lay huddled in the dark swallowing and blinking to conquer the phobia her mother had been mortally injured in a metal box and now she was inside one and it was thoughts of her mother that finally calmed holly she opened her eyes and explored the confined space with her vision and fingertips it didnt take long to find the bubble light set into the steel wall she snapped it on to find artemis stretched out beside her and the sloping metal sheeting of a boot door curling down past his arm her own borrowed shoes rested on the shining curve of a wheel arch they were inside a vehicle artemis groaned twitched and opened his eyes sell the phonetix shares he blurted then remembered butler and the darts holly holly holly patted his leg its ok artemis she said in gnommish in case the car was bugged im here where else could i be artemis shifted on to his side flicking back the dense black hair obscuring his features and spoke in the fairy tongue we received the same dosage of tranquillizer and yet you the lighter person are awake first magic the side of hollys face was thrown into deep shadow by the bubble light yes number ones signature magic is powerful stuff powerful enough to get us out of here holly spent a minute exploring the boots surface running her fingertips along each weld in the metal finally she shook her head silver wig sparkling not a weak spot i can find even the airconditioning vent is completely flush no way out of course not said artemis were inside the bentley the boot is a steel box with a titanium lock he breathed the cool air deeply how can this have happened everything is different butler was supposed to have deposited the cage in my study instead he creeps in through the bedroom and sedates us both now we dont know where we are or indeed where the lemur is do they have it already holly pressed one ear to the boot door i can tell you where we are outside the sounds of snuffling and snoring animals drifted on the air were close to animals a park i would guess or a zoo rathdown park exclaimed artemis and that fact tells us they do not in fact have the lemur the schedule and situation have changed holly was thoughtful we are not in control of this situation any more artemis perhaps its time to admit defeat and return home when your younger self brings us back to the manor perhaps you can discover a cure in the future artemis had been expecting this suggestion i considered that the lemur is still our best option and we are metres away from it just give me five minutes to get us out of here holly was understandably dubious five minutes even the great artemis fowl might have trouble breaking out of a steel box in five minutes artemis closed his eyes concentrating trying to ignore his cramped surroundings and the sheaves of hair brushing his cheeks and the itch of bristles on his chin face it artemis said holly impatiently were stuck even mulch diggums would probably struggle with a lock like that if he happened to stroll by artemiss brow flickered irritated by this interruption but then a smile spread across his face made eerie by the stark lighting mulch diggums strolling by he whispered what are the chances of that zero said holly absolutely none i would bet my pension on it at that moment something or someone tapped on the boot door from the outside holly rolled her eyes no not even you artemiss smile was smug beyond belief just how large is your pension i do not believe it i refuse to believe it it is impossible more taps on the door now followed by a delicate scraping and a muted swear word what a guttural voice said artemis very like a dwarfs it could be butler argued holly irritated by artemiss selfsatisfied expression swearing in gnommish hardly more metallic noises from the outside world shhhnick chunk clackack and the boots lid swung upwards revealing a slice of starry night with the glinting silhouette of a gigantic pylon behind it a bedraggled head popped into the space features smeared with mud and worse this was a face that only a mother could love and then perhaps only if her sight were failing dark closeset eyes peered out from above a dense beard that shivered slightly like seaweed in a current the creatures teeth were large square and not made any more appealing by the large insect wriggling between two molars it was of course mulch diggums the dwarf snagged the unfortunate insect with his tongue then chewed it delicately ground beetle he said with relish leistus montanus nice bouquet solid earthy shell then once the carapace cracks a veritable explosion of flavours on the palate he swallowed the unfortunate creature then funnelled a mighty burp though his flapping lips never burp when youre tunnelling he advised artemis and holly as casually as though they were sitting round a café table dirt coming down air coming up not a good idea holly knew mulch well this chitchat was simply for distraction while he took a peek around and now to business said the dwarf finally discarding the dead beard hair he had used to pick the lock i seem to have a human and an elf trapped in a car so i ask myself should i let em out and what do you answer yourself asked artemis with barely contained impatience mulchs black pebble eyes danced in the moonlight so the mud boy understands gnommish interesting well understand this human i let you out as soon as i get my money ah thought holly there is money involved somehow these two have set up a deal holly had endured her prison for long enough mulch is not yet my friend she thought so theres no need to be polite she drew a knee to her chin tugging on it with both hands for an extra pound of elastic force mulch realized what she was about to do hey elf no which was as far as he got before his face was batted with the boot door the dwarf tumbled backwards into the hole he had climbed out of sending up an oof of wind and dirt holly clambered over artemis to the fresh air she gulped down great gasps chest out face to the sky sorry she said between breaths that space is tiny i dont like tiny claustrophobic asked artemis rolling from the boot holly nodded i used to be i thought i had overcome it lately though there was a commotion in the dwarf hole a blue riot of swearing and a scuffling in the earth holly quickly recovered herself and leaped into the pit tackling mulch before he could unhinge his jaw and disappear he could be useful she grunted bundling the protesting dwarf up the incline and he has already seen us so the damage has been done thats a pincer hold exclaimed mulch youre lep he twisted round snagging hollys wig with his beard hair i know you holly short captain holly short one of julius roots pet rottweilers suddenly the dwarfs already creased brow wrinkled further in confusion but this is impossible before artemis could instruct holly not to ask she went ahead and did it why is it impossible mulch mulch did not reply but his eyes betrayed him glancing guiltily over his shoulder at a scuffed tekfab backpack holly deftly spun the dwarf round opening the bags main compartment quite a treasure trove we have here she said rummaging in the backpack medikit rations adhesive compads and look an old omnitool then she recognized the inscription laseretched into the base its my old omnitool in spite of their years of friendship holly turned the full force of her anger on mulch where did you get this she shouted how did you get it a present offered mulch lamely from my eh he squinted to read the writing on the base from my mother she always called me holly because of my erm prickly personality holly was angrier than artemis had ever seen her tell me diggums the truth mulch thought about fighting it was in the curve of his fingers and the baring of his teeth but the moment passed quickly and the dwarfs natural passive nature surfaced i stole all this stuff from tara he admitted im a thief arent i but in my defence i had a difficult childhood which led to low selfesteem which i projected on to others and punished them by stealing their possessions so in a very real way i am the victim here and i forgive me mulchs trademark waffle reminded holly of the friend he would become and her anger evaporated as quickly as it had appeared she traced the laser inscription with a fingertip my mother gave me this she said quietly most reliable omnitool i ever had then one night in hamburg my fugitive locked himself in a car so i reached for my omnitool and it was gone the target was apprehended by humans i lost my first fugitive and commander root had to send in an entire team of techies to clean up it was a disaster and all this time it was you mulch was puzzled all this time i stole this from a belt in a locker in tara an hour ago i saw you there whats going on here then mulch blinked and clapped his hairy palms oh bless my bumflap youre time travellers holly realized that she had said too much thats ridiculous the dwarf was actually doing a little jig now no no it all adds up youre talking about future events in the past tense you sent back a note so that i would come and rescue you here and now mulch clapped his hands to his cheeks in mock horror what youre doing is so much more illegal than anything i could ever do imagine the reward i would get for turning you over to julius root sent back a note scoffed holly thats absurd isnt it artemis most certainly said artemis but if someone were to send back a note from the future where and when would they send it to mulch jerked a thumb towards holly theres a junction box beside her locker looked like it hadnt been touched for years i was checking it out because sometimes they have some valuable tech in em not this one though just an envelope addressed to me and inside a note asking me to come to this place and set you free artemis smiled satisfied i imagine there was an incentive offered for our rescue mulchs beard hair crackled a large incentive no a stupendous incentive stupendous eh very well you shall have it when asked mulch hungrily soon i just need you to do me one more favour i knew it said the dwarf through grinding teeth never do the job until you see the cash why should i trust you artemis took a step forward eyes narrow behind a curtain of dark hair you dont need to trust me mulch you need to be afraid of me i am a mud boy from your future and i could be in your past too if you choose not to cooperate i found you once i could certainly do it again the next time you break into a car boot there could be a gun and a badge waiting for you mulch felt apprehension tingling in his beard hair and his beard hair was rarely wrong as his grandmother used to say trust the hair mulch trust the hair this human was dangerous and he had enough trouble in his life already ok mud boy he said grudgingly one more favour and then youd better have a stupendous amount of gold for me i will fear not my pungent friend the dwarf was deeply offended dont call me friend just tell me what you want done simply follow your nature and dig us a tunnel i need to steal a lemur mulch nodded as though lemurnapping was the most natural thing in the world and from whom are we stealing it from me mulch frowned then the penny dropped ah time travel throws up all sorts of twists doesnt it holly slipped the omnitool into her pocket tell me about it she said chapter talk to the animals rathdown park the fowl bentley was protected by a fingerprint scanner and a keypad that required an eightdigit code the code was changed every month and so it took artemis a few seconds to mentally rewind almost eight years and remember the right set of numbers he slid across the front seats tan leather upholstery and pressed his thumb to a second scanner tucked behind the steering wheel a springloaded compartment slid smoothly from the dash it was not a large compartment but big enough to hold a clip of cash platinum credit cards and a spare mobile phone in its cradle no gun asked holly when artemis emerged from the car though one of butlers guns would be clunky in her fingers no gun confirmed artemis i wouldnt be able to hit an elephant with one of butlers pistols even if i had one elephants are not the quarry this evening said artemis speaking in english now that they were out of the boot lemurs are at any rate as we could hardly shoot at our opponent on this particular adventure perhaps its better that we are unarmed not really said holly i may not be able to shoot you or the lemur but i bet that more opponents will turn up you have a knack of making enemies artemis shrugged genius inspires resentment a sad fact of life genius and robbing stuff mulch chimed from his perch on the lip of the car boot take it from one who knows nobody likes a smart thief artemis drummed his fingers on the fender we have certain advantages elfin magic digging talents i have almost eight years experience in the art of mischief making that the other artemis does not have mischief making scoffed holly i think youre being a little gentle on yourself grand larceny is closer to the mark artemis stopped drumming one of your fairy powers is speaking in tongues correct im talking to you arent i responded holly just how many tongues can you speak in holly smiled she knew artemiss devious mind well enough to realize exactly where he was going with this as many as you want good said artemis we need to split up you take the overground route into rathdown park mulch and i travel underground if we need a distraction use your gift it would be a pleasure said holly and immediately turned translucent as though she were a creature of purest water the last thing to go was her smile just like the cheshire cat he remembered a few lines from alices adventures in wonderland but i dont want to go among mad people said alice oh you cant help that said the cat were all mad here artemis glanced at the pungent dwarf searching his living beard for stored insects were all mad here too he thought holly approached the main door of rathdown park with care even though she was shielded the people had thought themselves invisible to butler once before and had paid with trauma and bruises she would not underestimate the bodyguard and the fact that he was once again her enemy set her stomach churning with nervous acid the human clothes jumped and scratched along her frame they were not built for shielding and in a matter of minutes they would shake to pieces i miss my neutrino she thought looking at the reinforcedsteel door with the dark unknown beyond it and i miss foaly and his satellite linkups but at heart holly was an adventurer so the idea of quitting never even occurred to her it was difficult to operate mechanisms while shielded so holly powered down for the few seconds necessary to jimmy the door with her omnitool it was an old model but hollys mother had paid an extra few ingots for upgrades the standard omnitool would open any door operating on a simple mechanical lockandkey system this one could short electronic locks too and even deactivate simple alarms but that shouldnt be necessary she thought as far as artemis remembers he turned off all the alarms the thought didnt give her much comfort artemis had been wrong about this trip already in less than five seconds the omnitool had done its job and vibrated gently like a cat purring at its own cleverness the heavy door swung open silently under the lightest touch and holly buzzed up her shield again stepping into rathdown park holly felt more mission anxiety than she had in years im a rookie again some kid straight out of the academy she realized my mind is experienced but my body is overruling it and then i better get this monkey quick before adolescence kicks in young artemis had turned off the security on his way into the institute it had been an easy thing to bypass all the alarms with the directors key card earlier in the day when he had been given the guided tour he had posed several complicated questions on the validity of the theory of evolution the director a committed evolutionist had allowed his arguments to distract him long enough to have his pocket picked by butler once the key card was in the bodyguards possession he simply slotted it into a batterypowered card cloner in his breast pocket and whistled a few bars of mozart to cover the whirr of the machine two minutes later all the information they needed was stored in the cloners memory the directors card was back in his pocket and artemis suddenly decided that maybe evolution wasnt a bad theory after all though there are more holes in it than a dutch dam made of swiss cheese hed confided to butler on the way home from rathdown park butler had been encouraged by this statement it was almost a straightforward joke later that evening young artemis had popped a button camera into the aircon duct at the rear of the bentley all the better to keep an eye on our guests the female was interesting fascinating actually the darts would wear off soon and it would be intriguing to watch her reaction much more so than that of the hirsute teenager even though his broad forehead suggested intelligence and his general features had a lot in common with the fowl familys own in fact he reminded artemis of an old photo he had once seen of his father as a boy working on an archaeological dig in south america perhaps the male captive was a distant cousin hoping to claim some kind of birthright now that father was missing there was much to be investigated here the button camera was broadcasting to his mobile phone and tenyearold artemis checked the screen occasionally as butler guided him through rathdown park towards the lemurs cage focus artemis chided the bodyguard one dastardly crime at a time artemis glanced up from his phone dastardly butler dastardly honestly we are not cartoon characters i do not have a villainous laugh or an eyepatch not yet though youll have an eyepatch soon enough if you dont concentrate on the job at hand they were passing underneath rathdown parks aquarium through a perspex tunnel that allowed scientists and the occasional visitor to observe the species housed in the milliongallon tank the tank mimicked the inhabitants natural environment as far as possible different compartments had different temperatures and different vegetation some were saltwater others were fresh but all housed endangered or rare creatures tiny bulbs dotted the ceiling above simulating stars and the only other light came from the bioluminescence of a lantern shark which shadowed artemis and butler along the tunnel until its snout bumped perspex artemis was more interested in his mobile phone than the sharks eerily glowing photophores events were unfolding on his screen that were close to incredible artemis stopped in his tracks to fully absorb what he was seeing the fowl manor intruders had escaped the bentleys boot with the help of an accomplice another nonhuman i am entering a new world here these creatures are potentially more lucrative than a lemur should i abandon this venture and concentrate on the nonhumans artemis maximized the volume on his handset but the tiny microphone attached to the button camera could only pick up snatches of the conversation it was mostly in some alien tongue but some of the talk was in english and he heard the word lemur more than once perhaps this lemur is more valuable than i realized the animal is the bait that lures these creatures in a minute passed with only the small revolting dwarflike thing in the screen perching its disproportionately large backside on the rim of the boot then the female appeared only to promptly disappear rathdown parks famous pylons filling the screen where she had been artemis tightened his grip on the phone invisibility the energy involved in creating a reflective field or to generate highspeed vibration must be incredible he quickly navigated the phones menu and activated the digital thermal imager a decidedly nonstandard option and was relieved to see the female creatures form blossom on screen in warm tones good not gone just hard to see keeping one eye on his phone artemis called to his bodyguard butler old friend slight change of plan the bodyguard knew better than to hope the lemur hunt was off were still on the trail of a little creature though ill bet creatures said tenyearold artemis plural fourteenyearold artemis was not enjoying the view to distract himself he composed a haiku describing the sight before him pale shuddering globes churn their poisonous cargo bald heads in a bag mulch diggums was not feeling quite so poetic he stopped digging and rehinged his jaw could you please stop shining the torch on my backside i blister easily we dwarves are extremely photosensitive even to artificial light artemis had taken the torch from the bentleys breakdown kit and was following mulch through a fresh tunnel to the lemurs cage the dwarf had assured him that the tunnel was sufficiently short for him to hold in the dirt and air until they reached the other end making it safe for artemis to be directly behind him artemis averted the torch for a few seconds thinking that a bum blister was the last thing he wanted to see but after a while the beam strayed back to the pale wobbling flesh once more just a quick question if you can hold in all the diggings then why does your bumflap need to be open mulch was spitting large wads of dwarf phlegm on to the wall to shore up the tunnel in case of emergency he explained i could swallow a buried lug of metal or strip of old tyre now those i would have to evacuate on the spot annoying mud boy to the rear or not no sense in ruining my trousers too now is there dopey i suppose not said artemis thinking that with such a widebore loaded weapon pointed at him he could bear being called dopey anyway continued the dwarf hawking another wad at the wall you should consider yourself privileged not many humans have seen a dwarf working with spit this is what you might call an ancient art first you i know i know interrupted artemis impatiently first you excavate then you strengthen the walls with your spittle which hardens on contact with the air provided its out of your mouth obviously and its luminous too amazing material mulchs behind wobbled in surprise how do you know these secrets you told me or rather you will tell me time travel remember the dwarf peered over his shoulders eyes red in the glow of his spittle just how close do we become very close we get an apartment together and after a whirlwind courtship you marry my sister and honeymoon in vegas i love vegas said mulch wistfully then such snide wit i can see how we might be friends all the same keep your comments to yourself or we might have to see how funny you are covered in tunnel waste artemis swallowed hard and moved the torch beam away from mulchs behind the plan was a simple one they would tunnel beneath the compound and wait below the lemurs cage for holly to contact them on the shortrange lep adhesive communicator stuck to artemiss cheek part of mulchs stash from that point forward the plan became fluid either they would pop up and grab the lemur while holly caused consternation among the animals or if young artemis had already secured the lemur mulch would dig a hole under butler making it easier for holly to relieve the boy of his prize all very straightforward thought artemis which is unusual for me ok mud boy said mulch scooping a bulbshaped hollow with his flat fingers we are here x marks the monkey lemur corrected artemis automatically are you certain you can distinguish this particular animals scent from all the others mulch held a hand to his heart in mock affront i certain i am a dwarf human a dwarf nose can tell the difference between grass and clover between black hair and brown between dog poo and wolf poo artemis groaned i shall take that as a yes and so you should keep this up and i may choose not to marry your sister if i had a sister im sure she would be inconsolable they crouched in the hollow for several minutes the parks nighttime growls and snores drifting down through the clay by some curious anomaly once the sounds penetrated the tunnels coating of dwarf spittle they were trapped inside and bounced off the walls in conflicting waves artemis felt as though he were literally in the lions den as if this wasnt disturbing enough he noticed that mulchs cheeks were glowing bright pink all of them problems he asked unable to mask a nervous tremor ive been holding in this gas for a long time replied the dwarf through clenched teeth its coming out soon you got any sinus problems artemis shook his head pity said mulch this would have cleared them right up if it wasnt for artemiss determination to save his mother he would have bolted right then luckily for artemiss nasal passages holly beeped him on the adcom the communicator was a basic vibration model that sent signals directly to artemiss ear without any external noise artemis heard hollys words but not her voice the adcom was only sophisticated enough to produce robotic tones in position over artemis placed a finger on the communicator completing the circuit that allowed him to speak received we are directly below the targets cage can you see the opposition negative no visual but i do see the lemur he seems to be asleep on a low branch i can reach him easily negative holly hold your position we will secure the target you watch for my younger self understood dont hang around arty get up get down and back to the car arty artemis was surprised that holly would call him that it was his mothers pet name for him got it up down and back arty mulch tapped him urgently on the shoulder whenever youre ready mud boy now would be great very well proceed try to be quiet mulch changed position pointing the crown of his head at the tunnel roof squatting low on his haunches too late for quiet he grunted pull your jacket over your face artemis barely had time to do what hed been asked when mulch released a thundering cylinder of gas and earth spraying the boy with undigested clods the shell of dwarf spittle cracked in a thousand places and mulch was borne aloft by a churning pillar of force easily punching through to the surface once the dust had settled somewhat artemis scrambled after him into the cage mulch had pinballed off a low ceiling and was unconscious blood matting his already tangled hair his bumflap fluttering like a windsock while the remainder of the tunnel waste escaped low cage ceiling the lemur in the next cage seemed highly amused by all the commotion and hopped up and down on a truncated branch wedged between the bars the next cage realized artemis we are not in the lemurs cage what cage are we in before he could had time to investigate his cheek beeped and an emotionless robotic voice droned into his ear get mulch out of there arty get back down now what is it wondered artemis whats in this cage then a twohundredkilo ugandan mountain gorilla crashed into him leaving the thought behind like a speech bubble young artemis and butler were watching all of this through the slot windows of a camouflaged hide that sat in front of the cages the hide had been built inside a rockery and water feature and allowed close study of the various animals without disturbing the natural rhythms of their day the director had been kind enough to let artemis sit in the observers chair earlier that day some day you could run the hides thermalimaging camera and all this equipment from that chair he had said perhaps sooner than that artemis had replied oh dear said butler the phrase sounding overdelicate in his gravelly voice that must have really hurt he reached into his pocket for the dart gun i better lend a hand or at least a dart butler had been busy with his darts two night workers lay unconscious on cots at the rear of the hide through the slot window they had a clear view of the male intruder being shaken like a rag doll by an enormous gorilla the cages third occupant had collapsed and appeared to be wracked by an energetic bout of flatulence incredible thought artemis this day is full of surprises he tapped a few keys on the computer keyboard before him redirecting the compounds thermalimaging camera i dont think a dart will be necessary he said help is already on the way sure enough a redhearted glow bounced across the cobbled walkway hovering before the gorilla cage now this should be interesting mused tenyearold artemis holly was forced into action she had been discreetly tucked away behind the broad trunk of an imported baobab tree shield off conserving magic keeping an eye out for young artemis when mulch blew a hole in the earth into the wrong cage he exploded from the ground in a minicyclone of debris bounced off a few surfaces like a cartoon pinball and collapsed on to the cage floor the cages resident a blackandgrey bull gorilla shot straight up woken from deep sleep its eyes were wide but blurred its teeth yellow and bared stay down artemis she thought stay in the hole no such luck artemis clambered to the surface carefully navigating the simple climb the time stream had not granted him any agility as artemis often said the physical was not his area holly thumbed her adcom get mulch out of there arty she shouted get back down now it was too late the gorilla had decided these newcomers were a threat to be dealt with it rolled from its nest of leaves and bark landing on eight knuckles the impact sending a jarring wave along its arm hair holly buzzed up her shield as she ran silver strands floating behind her as the wig fell apart marking her trail the gorilla attacked grabbing a surprised artemis fowl by the shoulders roaring in his face head back teeth like a bear trap holly was at the gate powering down pulling the omnitool from her pocket jabbing the business end into the lock she surveyed the scene inside the cage while she waited for the tool to work mulch was up and on his elbows now shaking a groggy head it would be a moment or two before he was in any shape to help if he deigned to help a human stranger anyway it was immaterial a moment or two would be too late for artemis the omnitool beeped and the cage door swung open a narrow walkway extended from the footpath crossing a moat and slotting into grooves on the habitat floor holly charged across without hesitation waving her arms shouting making herself a target the gorilla huffed and snorted gathering artemis close to its chest warning holly to stay back artemiss head flopped on his shoulders and his eyes were half closed holly stopped three metres from the animal lowering her arms and gaze a nonthreatening stance the gorilla made a few fake attacks thundering to within half a metre of holly then contemptuously turning its back all the while grunting and barking pressing artemis to its chest artemiss hair was slicked back with blood and a crimson trickle leaked from the corner of his left eye one arm was broken and blood pouched the sleeve of his tracksuit holly was shocked appalled she felt like crying and running away her friend was injured possibly dead get a grip she told herself you are older than you look one of the fairy magical powers was the gift of tongues and this encompassed a rudimentary grasp of some of the more sophisticated animal tongues she would never be discussing global warming with a dolphin but she knew enough for basic communication with gorillas it was as much about body language as what was actually said holly squatted low elbows crooked knuckles on the earth spine curved forward the posture of a friend then funnelled her lips and hooted several times danger the hoots said danger is near the gorilla did a comical doubletake amazed to hear gorillaspeak coming from this creature it sensed a trick but was not sure what that trick might be and when in doubt beat your chest the gorilla dropped artemis stood tall on two feet thrusting forward chin and pectorals and began beating its chest with open palms i am king here do not trifle with me was the clear message a wise sentiment indeed but holly had no choice she darted forward hooting all the time throwing in the odd terrified screech and then against the advice of every wildlife expert who ever held a steadicam she looked directly into the animals eyes leopard she hooted layering her voice with the fairy mesmer leopard the gorillas fury was replaced by dull confusion which was in turn pushed aside by terror leopard holly hooted climb moving with less than its customary grace the gorilla stumbled towards the rear of the cage moving as though underwater senses dulled by the mesmer trees and foliage were batted aside leaving a wake of sapcrowned trunks and flattened grass in moments the animal had disappeared deep into the dark recesses of its artificial habitat fearful gibberings floated from the upper canopy holly would feel bad later for putting the beast under a spell but now there was not a heartbeat to waste on guilt artemis was grievously injured perhaps mortally so the gorilla had dropped artemis like a carcass that had been picked clean he lay there still as the dead no dont think that holly raced to her friends side skidding the final metre on her knees too far gone hes too far gone artemiss face was pale as bone his long black hair was matted with blood and the whites of his eyes were twin crescents through hooded lids mother he said the word riding on a breath holly reached out her hands magic already dancing on her fingertips shooting off in arcs like tiny sun flares she froze before the magic could make the jump to artemiss body if i heal artemis will i also damn him is my magic tainted with spelltropy artemis thrashed weakly and holly could actually hear bones grating in his sleeve there was blood on his lips now too he will die if i dont help at least if i heal him there is a chance hollys hands were shaking and her eyes were blurred with tears pull yourself together you are a professional she didnt feel very professional she felt like a girl out of her depth your body is playing tricks on your mind ignore it holly cupped artemiss face gently in both hands heal she whispered almost sobbed the magical sparks leaped like dogs unleashed sinking into artemiss pores knitting bones healing skin staunching internal bleeding the sudden transition from deaths door to hale and hearty was rough on artemis he shuddered and bucked teeth chattering hair frizzing in an electric halo come on artemis said holly bending over him like a mourner wake up there was no reaction for several seconds artemis looked like a healthy corpse but then that was how he usually looked then his mismatched eyes opened lids flickering like hummingbird wings as his system rebooted he coughed and shuddered flexing fingers and toes holly he said when his vision cleared his smile was sincere and grateful you saved me again holly was laughing and crying at the same time tears spilling on to artemiss chest of course i saved you she said i couldnt do without you and because she was happy and flushed with magic holly leaned down and kissed artemis magic sparking around the contact like tiny fireworks tenyearold artemis fowl was keeping one eye on the drama unfolding in the gorilla cage troglodytes gorilla he commented to butler given the name by doctor thomas s savage an american missionary to western africa who first scientifically described the gorilla in you dont say murmured the bodyguard who was more interested in the brutes bite radius than its proper name they had used the commotion as cover to slip out from the artificial hide and across the small courtyard to the lemurs cage which was beside the gorillas cage the strange newcomers were far too busy to notice them swipe the cages keycard lock and open the gate door look at those two wasting time you wouldnt catch me doing that butler snorted as he usually did immediately before delivering a deadpan line most people never catch you doing anything artemis artemis allowed himself a chuckle this was an interesting day and he was enjoying the challenges that it presented and there we are said artemis quietly the last silky sifaka lemur in the world the hundredthousandeuro primate the lemur was perched high in a madagascar palm clinging to the branches with its long grasping toes and opposable thumb digits its coat was snow white with a brown patch on the chest artemis pointed at the animal that colouring results from chest scent marking with the sternalgular gland uhhuh said butler who cared slightly less about this than he did about the gorillas scientific name lets just get the animal and get out of here before our friends next door regroup i think we have a moment or two said artemis butler studied the strangers in the adjacent cage it was surprising that the male was not in pieces by now but somehow the female had appeared from nowhere and chased the gorilla off impressive that one had a few tricks up her sleeve there was serious technology behind her perhaps some kind of camouflage software in the clothing which could explain the sparks the americans he knew were developing an allterrain camouflage suit one of his military contacts had sent him a link to a leaked video on the internet there was another creature in the cage the hairy individual who had released the first two from the bentley picking what was supposed to be an unpickable lock in the process the creature was neither man nor beast a rough stumpy character who had been propelled through the earth by some force and was now suffering from a debilitating attack of gas somehow this thing had managed to dig a thirtymetre tunnel in a matter of minutes if it hadnt been for the fact that the cages were modular with overlapping walls then the creature would have been in the same cage as the lemur as it was while it emerged directly below the lemur it was one cage over butler knew that artemis would be just itching to study these strange creatures but now was not the time they were in a position of total ignorance and people in that position often died without being enlightened the bodyguard drew his dart pistol but artemis recognized the sound of a gun sliding from a holster and waved his index finger thats our last option i dont want our little friend breaking his neck on the way down first we try gentle persuasion from his pocket artemis tugged a small ziplock bag containing an amber gel flecked with black and green my own concoction he explained the sifakas are from the indriidae family of primates which as you know is a strictly vegetarian family who wouldnt know that wondered butler who had not exactly put away his pistol artemis unzipped the bag releasing a sweet thick aroma that wound its way up towards the lemur sap concentrate with a potpourri of african vegetation no lemur could resist this but if this particular primates brain is stronger than his stomach fire away one shot if you please and avoid the head the needle alone would probably be enough to crack that tiny skull butler would have snorted but the lemur was moving it crawled along the branch dipping its pointed nose to catch the odour touching the smell with a darting pink tongue hmm said the bodyguard that concoction wont work on humans i suppose ask me again in six months said artemis i am doing some pheromone experiments the lemur scampered forward now hypnotized by the glorious aroma when the branch ran out it dropped to the ground and hopped forward on two legs fingers outstretched towards the bag artemis grinned this game is over maybe not said butler in the cage beside them the longhaired boy was on his feet and the female was making a very strange noise the corona of magic around fourteenyearold artemis and holly faded and along with it went the dreamlike trance insulating artemiss mind he was instantly alert holly had kissed him artemis backpedalled jumping to his feet spreading his arms wide to counteract the sudden dizziness eh thanks he said awkwardly that was unexpected holly smiled feeling a little embarrassed artemis youre ok any more healings and youll be nothing but scar tissue held together by magic thread artemis thought that it would be nice to stay here and talk like this but one cage over his future was escaping with his past he understood immediately what had happened mulchs nose had led them to the right place but the cages were built like interlocking blocks and so the lemur had been above them but also in the next cage he should have remembered that if he had been here before but artemis had no memory of visiting the central compound as far as he was aware the park director had brought the lemur into a special viewing room this was confusing very well he said i see where we are he was thinking aloud steadying his mind trying to forget the kiss for now think about it later artemis rubbed the red sparks from his eyes then turned as quickly as the posthealing vertigo would allow there he was his younger self enticing the silky sifaka lemur with a bag of amber paste sap i bet perhaps with a few twigs and leaves wasnt i a clever boy an immediate solution was needed a fluid quickfire plan artemis rubbed his eye sockets as if that could sharpen his mind mulch can you tunnel the dwarf opened his mouth to answer but threw up instead i dunno he said finally my heads a bit flippyfloppy stomach too that bash really shook me his belly made a sound like an outboard motor scuse me i think i gotta he did indeed gotta mulch crawled into a fern patch and let fly with the remainder of his stomach contents several leaves wilted on the spot no use thought artemis i need a miracle or that lemur is gone and dead he grabbed hollys shoulders do you have any magic left a little artemis a few sparks maybe can you talk to the animals holly twisted her chin to the left until her neck bone clicked checking the tank i could do that anything except trolls they dont fall for that trick artemis nodded muttering to himself thinking ok ok i want you to scare that lemur away from me the younger me and i need confusion can you do that i can try holly closed her eyes breathed deeply through her nose filling her lungs then threw her head back and howled it was a fantastic noise lions apes wolves and eagles they were all in there the howl was punctuated by the staccato chatter of monkeys and the hiss of a thousand snakes artemis the elder stepped back instinctively terrified some primal part of his brain interpreted this message as fear and pain his skin crawled and he had to fight his every instinct not to run and hide artemis the younger reached down to the lemur dangling the ziplock bag in front of his twitching nose the lemur laid the pads of its fingers on artemiss wrist i have him thought the irish boy the money for the expedition is mine then a wall of unholy sound blasted him like a forceten wind young artemis staggered back dropping the bag of paste suddenly irrationally terrified something wants to kill me but what every animal in the world it sounds like the parks residents were thoroughly spooked too they screeched and chattered rattling their cages hurling themselves against the bars monkeys tried repeatedly to leap across the moats surrounding their islands an eighthundredkilo sumatran rhino charged the heavy doors to its compound rattling the hinges with each attack a red wolf snarled and snapped an iberian lynx hissed slashing the air and a snow leopard chased its tail flicking its head and mewling anxiously butler could not help but shift his focus its the female creature he stated making some kind of sound its riling these animals up im a bit disturbed myself artemis did not take his gaze from the lemur you know what to do he said butler knew if there is an obstacle preventing the completion of a mission remove the obstacle he strode quickly to the bars poked the pistols muzzle through the mesh and put a dart into the females shoulder she stumbled backwards her fantastic orchestra of animal sounds squawking to a halt butler felt a shudder of guilt which almost caused him to misstep on his way to artemiss side twice now he had tranked this girl or whatever she was without having any idea what the chemicals were doing to her nonhuman system his only consolation was that he had loaded smalldosage darts as soon as he had secured the night watchman she shouldnt be out too long a few minutes tops the lemur was spooked now tiny hands tickling the space before him the sap cocktail was tempting but there was danger here of the worst kind and the urge to live was overriding the desire for a tasty treat no said artemis seeing fear cloud the creatures eyes its not real there is no danger the little simian was not convinced as if it could read the boys intention in the sharp angles of his face the silky sifaka squeaked once as though pinpricked then scampered along artemiss arm over his shoulder and out through the cage door butler lunged for the tail but missed by a hair he closed his fingers into a fist perhaps its time to admit defeat on this one we are dangerously unprepared and our adversaries have abilities we know nothing about his charges reply was to hurry after the lemur artemis wait sighed butler if we must proceed then i will take the lead they want the lemur artemis panted as he ran and so it becomes more valuable than it was when we catch the animal then we are in a position of power catching the animal was easier said than done the lemur was incredibly agile and found purchase on the smoothest of surfaces it darted without a wobble along a metal railing leaping three metres to the lower branches of a potted palm and from there jumping to the compound wall shoot hissed artemis it occurred to butler briefly that he did not care for artemiss expression almost cruel his brow creased where a tenyearolds brow should not have creases but he would worry about that later for now he had an animal to sedate butler was quick but the silky sifaka was quicker in a flash of fur it scaled the wall and dropped outside into the night leaving a blurred white jet stream in its wake wow said butler almost in admiration that was fast artemis was not impressed by his bodyguards choice of words wow i think this merits more than a wow our quarry has escaped and with it the funds for my arctic expedition at this point butler was fast losing interest in the lemur there were other less ignoble ways to raise funds butler shuddered to think of the ribbing he would have to endure if an account of this night somehow made it to farmers bar in la which was owned by one exbluediamond bodyguard and frequented by many more but in spite of his distaste for the mission butlers sense of loyalty forced him to share a fact that the park director had mentioned earlier when artemis was busy studying the alarm system there is something that i know which you may not know he said archly artemis was not in the mood for games oh really and what would that be lemurs are tree creatures replied butler that little guy is spooked and hes going to climb the biggest tree he can find even if it isnt actually a tree if you see what i mean artemis saw immediately which wasnt difficult as the huge structures cast a lattice of moon shadows over the entire compound of course old friend he said his frown crease disappearing the pylons things were going disastrously wrong for artemis the elder mulch was injured holly was unconscious again feet sticking out of the dwarfs hole and he himself was fast running out of ideas the deafening clamour of a hundred endangered species going berserk was not helping his concentration the animals are going ape he thought then what a time to develop a sense of humour all he could do was prioritize i need to get holly out of here he realized that is the most important thing mulch moaned rolling on to his back and artemis saw that there was a bleeding gash on his forehead he stumbled to the dwarfs side i imagine youre in great pain he said its to be expected with such a laceration bedside manner was not one of artemiss strong suits you will have a rather large scar but then looks are not really important to you mulch squinted at artemis through a narrowed eye are you trying to be funny oh my god youre not that was actually the nicest thing you could think of to say he dabbed at his bloody forehead with a finger ow that hurts of course i will have to seal it you know all about this dwarf talent i suppose naturally said artemis keeping a straight face ive seen it a dozen times i doubt it grunted mulch plucking a wiggling beard hair from his chin but i dont have much choice now do i with the lep elf in dreamland i wont be getting any magical help from that quarter artemis heard a rustling in the undergrowth at the rear of the cage youd better hurry it up i think the gorilla is overcoming its fear of fairies wincing mulch introduced the beard hair to his gash it took off like a tadpole poking through the skin stitching the flaps together though he groaned and shuddered mulch managed to stay conscious when the hair had finished its work and the wound was tied up tighter than a fly in a ball of spiders web mulch spat on his hand and rubbed the gooey mess on to the wound all sealed he proclaimed then upon seeing the glint in artemiss eye dont get any ideas mud boy this only works on dwarfs and whats more my beard hair only works on me you poke one of my lovelies into your skin and all youll get is an infection the rustling in the undergrowth grew louder and artemis fowl decided to forego further information which was almost unheard of for him time we were off can you seal the tunnel behind us i can bring the whole lot down easy as pie youd better take the lead though there are better ways to go than being buried alive in shall we say recyclings need i say more there was no need to say another syllable artemis jumped into the hole grabbed hollys shoulders and began dragging her down the tunnel past the blobs of luminous spittle towards the proverbial light at the end it was like travelling through space towards the milky way the sounds of his own body were amplified gulping breath drumming heartbeat the bend and creak of muscle and sinew holly rolled along easily her suit hissing on the rough surface like a nest of vipers or maybe there were snakes down here the way artemiss luck was going i am trying to do something good for a change he reminded himself and this is how the fates reward me a life of crime was infinitely easier surface noise was amplified by the tunnels acoustics the gorilla sounded furious now artemis could hear the slap of fists on chest and an enraged huffing he realizes he has been tricked his theorizing was cut short by mulchs appearance in the tunnel the spittle bandage on his forehead casting a zombie glow on his face gorilla coming he said as he gulped down lungfuls of air gotta go artemis heard twin thumps as the gorilla landed on the tunnel floor the huge simian roared a challenge down the hole and the noise grew in ferocity with every metre it travelled holly moaned and artemis pulled harder on her shoulders mulch sucked down air as fast as he could bundling artemis and holly deeper into the tunnel twenty metres to go they would never make it the gorilla was advancing pulverizing each spittle lantern as he passed it roaring with bloodlust artemis swore he saw a flash of teeth the tunnel seemed to shudder with each blow large sections collapsed mud and rock clattered down on artemiss head and shoulders dirt pooled in hollys eye sockets mulchs cheeks ballooned and he opened his lips the merest fraction to speak ok he said in a helium voice the tank is full the dwarf gathered artemis and holly in his burly popeye arms and vented every bubble of air in his body the resulting jet stream propelled the group down the length of the tunnel the trip was short jarring and confusing the breath was driven from artemiss lungs and his fingers were stretched to cracking but he would not let go of holly he could not let her die the unfortunate gorilla was blown headoverrump by the windstorm yanked back up the tunnel as though tethered to an elastic cable it whooped as it went digging its fingers into the tunnel wall artemis holly and mulch popped from the tunnel mouth bouncing and skittering along the ditch in a tangle of limbs and torsos the stars above them were speedstreaked and the moon was a smear of yellow light an old famine wall halted their progress crumbling under the impact of three bodies for more than a hundred and fifty years this wall stood coughed artemis then we come along he lay on his back feeling thoroughly defeated his mother would die and holly would soon hate him when she worked out the truth all is lost i have no idea what to do then one of the notorious rathdown pylons sharpened in his vision more specifically the figures clambering along its service ladder the lemur has escaped thought artemis and is climbing as high as it can a reprieve there was still a chance what i need to save this situation is a full lep surveillance and assault kit perhaps i will have number one send one back for me artemis disentangled himself from the others and decided that underneath the pillars cornerstone would be a secure spot he pulled off the remaining stones stacked on top wiggled his fingers under the final boulder and heaved it came away easily revealing nothing but worms and damp earth no package from the future for whatever reason that particular trick would only work once so no help i must make do with what is available artemis returned to where holly and mulch lay both were moaning i think i split a gut getting rid of that wind said mulch there was a bit too much fear in the mix artemiss nose wrinkled will you be ok give me a minute and ill be plenty strong enough to carry that huge amount of gold you promised me holly was groggy her eyes fluttered as she tried to pull herself out of it and her arms flopped like fish out of water artemis did a quick pulse and temperature check slight fever but steady heartbeat holly was recovering but it would be several minutes before she could control her mind or body i must do this on my own artemis realized no holly no butler just artemis versus artemis and perhaps an omnitool he thought reaching into hollys pocket the rathdown electricity pylons had been featured in irish news headlines several times since their erection environmentalists protested vehemently that the appearance of the gigantic pylons blighted an otherwise beautiful valley not to mention the possible detrimental effect the uninsulated power lines could have on the health of anyone or anything living below their arcs the national electricity board had countered these arguments by pleading that the lines were too high to harm anything and that constructing smaller pylons around the valley would blight ten times more land and so a half a dozen of these metal giants bridged rathdown valley reaching a height of one hundred metres at their zenith the pylon bases were often ringed by protesters so much so that the power company had taken to servicing the lines by helicopter on this night as artemis raced across the moonlit meadow kicking up diamond dewdrops there were no protesters ringing the pylons but they had planted their signs like moon flags artemis slalomed through this obstacle course while simultaneously craning his neck to track the figures above the lemur was on the wire now silhouetted by the moon scampering easily along the metal cable while artemis the younger and butler were stranded on the small platform at the pylons base unable to venture any further finally thought artemis a stroke or two of luck stroke one was that the lemur was suddenly up for grabs stroke the second was that while his young nemesis had chosen to follow the silky sifaka directly up the pylon the animal was scaling he himself could go up the adjacent pole which just happened to be the service pylon artemis reached the pylons base which was secured by a cage the heavy padlock submitted instantly to a quick jab from the omnitool as did the steel equipment locker inside were various tools walkietalkies and a faraday suit artemis tugged on the heavy overalls wiggling his fingers into the attached gloves tucking his long hair inside the hood the flameretardant and steelthread suit had to enclose him completely to act as a protective faraday cage otherwise he could not venture out on the wires without being burned to a criminalmastermind cinder more luck an elevator platform ran up the side of the pylon it was locked and keycoded but locks quailed when faced with an omnitool and a key code was of little value when it was a simple matter to unscrew the control panel and activate the pulley manually artemis held tight to the safety rail as the tiny elevator shuddered and whined its way into the night sky the valley spread out below him as he rose and a westerly wind crept over the hills tugging a strand of hair from his hood artemis gazed north and for a fanciful moment imagined he could see the lights of fowl manor mother is there he thought unwell now and unwell in the future perhaps i can just talk to my younger self explain the situation this thought was even more fanciful than the last artemis had no illusions about what he had been like at the age of ten he had trusted no one completely but himself not his parents not even butler at the first mention of time travel his younger self would have his bodyguard shoot a dart first and ask questions later a lot of questions and at great length there was no time for explanations and debate this battle would have to be won by wits and guile the elevator grated into its brackets at the top of the pylon a skull and crossbones sign was riveted to the tall safety gate even if artemis had not been a genius the sign would have been difficult to misinterpret and just in case a total idiot did manage to scale the pylon there was a second sign depicting a cartoon man being zapped by electricity from a cartoon pylon the mans skeleton was clearly visible xray style apparently electricity is dangerous artemis might have commented had butler been by his side there was yet another lock on the safety gate which delayed artemis about as long as the first two outside the safety gate was a small platform covered with wire mesh with twin power lines humming directly beneath there are half a million volts running through those lines thought artemis i do hope there are no rips in this suit artemis squatted low peering along the line the lemur had paused halfway between the two pylons and was chattering to itself as if weighing up its options luckily for the small creature it was only touching one line so no current flowed through its body if it put so much as a toe on the second line the shock would spin it thirty metres into the air and it would be stone dead before it stopped revolving on the far pylon artemis the younger scowled at the animal while simultaneously trying to tempt it back with his bag of paste there is nothing to do but go out on the wires and bring the lemur back yourself the hot suit was equipped for moving across the wires there was a safety cord wrapped round his waist and a lightning rod in a long pocket on his thigh below the platform was a small sledge on insulated runners that the engineers used to handcrank themselves between pylons brains count for little now he realized what i need is balance artemis groaned balance was not his forte taking a deep breath he crouched low drawing the lightning rod from his pocket almost as soon as it cleared the material jets of whitehot sparks jumped from the power lines connecting with the tip of the rod the stream buzzed and hissed like a neon snake you are equalizing voltage thats all the electricity cannot hurt you perhaps not but artemis could already feel the hair standing on his neck was that anxiety or were a couple of volts sneaking in somewhere dont be absurd if there is a hole all the volts will worm inside not just a couple artemis was vaguely familiar with the technique for wirewalking as the national broadcasting service had done a news special on the highwire daredevils who risked their lives to keep the lights of dublin burning it wasnt so much wirewalking as wirecrawling the cables were extremely taut and the maintenance engineers clipped on their safety lines lay on the sledge then turned the winch until they reached the maintenance site simple in theory for a professional on a calm morning not so easy for an amateur in the dead of night with only the stars and the ambient light of nearby dublin to guide him artemis sheathed his lightning rod and gingerly clipped his safety line to one of the cables he held his breath as though that could possibly make a difference and laid his gloved hands on the metal sledge still alive a good start artemis inched forward the metal warm under his clumsy gloved hands until he was lying flat on the sledge with the doublehandled winch in front of his face it was a delicate manoeuvre and would have been impossible had the cables not been tethered together at regular intervals he began to twist and almost immediately the strain on his arms was tremendous as he moved his own body weight the gym butler you were right ill do weights anything just get me off these cables with that lemur under my arm artemis slid forward feeling the runners scrape the rough metal of the cables their intense hum setting his teeth on edge and sending constant shivers coursing along his arched spine the wind was low but still threatened to topple him from his lofty perch and the ground seemed like another planet distant and uninviting ten metres later his arms ached and he was noticed by the opposition a voice floated across from the other pylon i advise you to stay where you are young man if that suit has the tiniest rip then one slip and those cables will liquefy your skin and melt your bones artemis scowled young man had he really been so obnoxious so patronizing it would take less than a second for you to die continued tenyearold artemis but thats quite long enough to be in mortal agony dont you think and all for nothing as the lemur will obviously return for this treat yes he had been smug as well as obnoxious and patronizing artemis chose not to reply concentrating his energy on staying alive and enticing the silky sifaka towards him from his considerable reservoir of knowledge on just about everything artemis plucked the fact that smaller simians were comforted by a purring noise thank you jane goodall so he began to purr much to the amusement of his younger self listen butler theres a cat on the wire a big tom i would say perhaps you should throw him a fish but the mocking tone was undercut with tension young artemis knew exactly what was going on more purring and it seemed to be working the ghostly sifaka took a few cautious steps towards the elder artemis his beady black eyes glittering with starlight and perhaps curiosity holly would be proud i am talking to an animal even as he purred artemis winced at how ludicrous the situation had become it was a typical fowlesque melodrama two parties hunting for a lemur on the highest power lines in ireland artemis looked along the dip of the lines across to the other pylon where butler stood jacket tail flapping around his thighs the bodyguard leaned into the wind and the intensity of his stare seemed to pierce the darkness honing in on artemis the elder like a laser i miss my bodyguard thought artemis the lemur scampered closer encouraged by the purring and perhaps fooled by the steelgrey hot suit thats right i am another lemur artemiss arms were shaking from the strain of turning the handles at such an awkward angle every muscle in his body was stretched to its limit including several he had never used before his head was dizzy from keeping his balance all this and animal impersonations too one metre now that was the distance between artemis and the lemur there were no more taunts from the other side artemis glanced across and found his nemesis had his eyes closed and was breathing deeply trying to come up with a plan the lemur jumped on to the sledge and touched artemiss gloved hand tentatively contact artemis stayed stock still apart from his lips which burbled out a comforting purr thats it little fellow climb on to my arm artemis looked into the lemurs eyes and for perhaps the first time realized that it had emotions there was fear in those eyes but also a mischievous confidence how could i have sold you to those madmen he wondered the lemur suddenly committed itself scampering on to artemiss shoulder it seemed content to sit there while artemis ferried it back to the service pylon as artemis retreated he kept his eye fixed on his younger self he would never simply accept defeat like this neither of them would young artemiss eyes suddenly snapped open and met his nemesiss stare shoot the animal he said coldly butler was surprised shoot the monkey its a never mind just shoot it the man is protected by his suit but the lemur is an easy target but the fall if it dies it dies i will not be thwarted here butler if i cannot have that lemur then no one will have it butler frowned killing animals was not in his job description but he knew from experience that there was no point in arguing with the young master at any rate it was a bit late to protest now perched atop a pylon he should have spoken up more forcefully earlier whenever youre ready butler the target is not getting any closer out on the cables artemis the elder could scarcely believe what he was hearing butler had drawn his pistol and was climbing over the rails to get a better shot artemis had not intended to speak as interaction with his younger self could have serious repercussions for the future but the words were out before he could stop them stay back you dont know what youre dealing with oh the irony ah he speaks called young artemis across the abyss how fortunate that we can understand each other well understand this stranger i will have that silky sifaka or it will die make no mistake you must not do this theres too much at stake i must do it i have no choice now send the animal over or butler will shoot through all of this the lemur sat perched on fourteenyearold artemiss head scratching the stitching of his hood so the two boys who were one boy locked eyes for a long tense moment i would have done it thought artemis the elder shocked by the cruel determination in his own blue eyes and so he gingerly reached up one hand and plucked the silky sifaka from his head you have to go back he said softly go back for the nice treat and if i were you id stick close to the big human the little one isnt very nice the lemur reached out and tweaked artemiss nose much as beckett might have done then turned and trotted along the cable towards butler nose sniffing the air nostrils flaring as they located the sweet scent of artemiss goodie bag in a matter of seconds it sat curled in the crook of young artemiss elbow contentedly dipping its long fingers into the sap the young boys face glowed with victory now he said i think it best that you stay exactly where you are until we leave i think fifteen minutes should be fine after that i advise you to be on your way and count yourself fortunate that i did not have butler sedate you remember the pain that you are feeling now the ache of utter defeat and hopelessness and if you ever consider crossing swords with me again review your memory of this pain and perhaps you will think twice artemis the elder was forced to watch as butler stuffed the lemur into a duffel bag and boy and bodyguard commenced their climb down the service ladder several minutes later the bentleys headlights scythed the darkness as the car pulled away from rathdown park and on to the motorway straight to the airport no doubt artemis reached up and gripped the winch handles he was not beaten yet far from it he intended to cross swords with his tenyearold self again just as soon as he possibly could if anything the boys mocking speech had fuelled his determination remember the pain thought artemis i hate myself i really do chapter a blob of phlegm by the time artemis had made his way down rom the pylon holly had disappeared hed eft her by the tunnel mouth but there was nothing in the spot now except mud and footprints footprints he thought now i suppose i need to track holly i really must read the last of the mohicans dont bother following those said a voice from the ditch false trail i laid it in case the big human took our lep friend along for a snack that was good thinking said artemis squinting through the foliage a shaggy shadow detached itself from a hillock and became mulch diggums but why did you bother i thought the lep were your enemy mulch pointed a stubby mudcrusted finger you are my enemy human you are the planets enemy and yet you are willing to help me for gold a stupendous amount of gold said mulch and possibly some fried chicken with barbecue sauce and a large pepsi and maybe more chicken hungry always a dwarf can only eat so much dirt artemis didnt know whether to giggle or groan mulch would always have trouble grasping the gravity of situations or perhaps he liked to give that impression wheres holly mulch nodded towards a graveshaped mound of earth i buried the captain she was moaning quite loudly arty this and arty that with a few mothers thrown in buried holly was claustrophobic artemis dropped to his knees scooping the earth from the mount with his bare hands mulch let him at it for a minute then sighed dramatically let me do it mud boy youll be there all night he strolled over and casually thrust his hand into the mound chewing his lip as he searched for a specific spot here we go grunted the dwarf yanking out a short branch the mound vibrated then collapsed into small heaps of pebbles and clay holly was unhurt underneath its a complex structure called a nana said mulch brandishing the twig as in as in nananenana you cant see me said the dwarf then slapped himself on the knee exploding in a fit of giggles artemis scowled shaking hollys shoulders gently holly can you hear me holly short opened bleary eyes rolled them around for a while then focused artemis i oh gods its ok i dont have the lemur well actually i do the other me but dont worry i know where im going holly dragged at her cheeks with delicate fingers i mean oh gods i think i kissed you artemiss head pounded and hollys mismatched eyes seemed to hypnotize him she still had a blue eye even though her body had rejuvenated itself in the tunnel another paradox but though artemis felt hypnotized even slightly dazed he knew he was not mesmerized there was no fairy magic here artemis looked into those elfin eyes and he knew that this younger somehow more vulnerable holly felt the same way at this particular tangle of time and space as he did after all we have been through or maybe because of it a memory smashed the delicate moment like a rock thrown through a spiders web i lied to her artemis rocked backwards with the strength of the thought holly believes that she infected mother i blackmailed her he knew at that instant there was no recovering from such a brutal fact if he confessed she would hate him if he did not he would hate himself there must be something i can do nothing came to mind i need to think artemis took hollys hand and elbow helping her to stand and step from the shallow gravelike hole reborn she quipped then punched mulch on the shoulder oww whyfore miss dost thou torment me dont quote gerd flambough at me mulch diggums there was no need to bury me a simple broadleaf across my mouth would have done mulch rubbed his shoulder a broadleaf desnt have the same artistry anyway do i look like a fern type of guy i am a dwarf and we deal in mud artemis was glad of the banter it gave him a minute to compose himself forget your adolescent confusion about holly remember mother wasting away in her bed there are less than three days left very well troops he said with forced joviality lets move it out as an old friend of mine would say we have a lemur to catch what about my gold asked mulch i shall put this as simply as possible no lemur no gold mulch tapped his lips with eight fingers and his beard hairs vibrated like the tendrils of a sea anemone thinking how much is stupendous exactly in bucket terms how many buckets do you have mulch took this as a serious question i have a lot of buckets most of them are full of stuff though i could empty them i suppose artemis almost gnashed his teeth it was a rhetorical question a lot of buckets as many as you like if you want me to go any further down this monkey road i need some kind of down payment a goodfaith deposit artemis slapped his empty pockets he had nothing holly straightened her silver wig i have something for you mulch diggums something better than a stupendous amount of gold six numbers which i will reveal when we get there get where asked mulch who suspected that holly was being melodramatic the lep equipment lockup at tara mulchs eyes glowed with dreams of sky skis and dive bubbles laser cubes and fat vacuums the motherload hed been trying to crack an lep lockup for years i can have anything i want whatever you can get on to a hover trolley one trolley mulch spat a marbled blob of phlegm into his palm shake on it he said artemis and holly looked at each other its your lockup said artemis stuffing his hands into his pockets its your mission countered holly i dont know the combination and then the trump were here for your mother artemis smiled ruefully you captain short are getting as bad as me he said and sealed the deal with a sopping handshake chapter the prince frog young artemis made a video call from his powerbook to the the ancient town of fez in morocco even as he waited for the connection artemis silently fumed that it was necessary to make this intercontinental trip at all even casablanca would have been more convenient morocco was hot enough without having to drive across country to fez on screen a window popped open barely containing the huge head of doctor damon kronski one of the most hated men in the world but revered too in certain circles damon kronski was the current president of the extinctionists organization or as kronski said in his most notorious interview the extinctionists are not just an organization we are a religion not a statement that endeared him to the peaceloving churches of the world the interview had run for months on internet news sites and was sampled every time the extinctionists made the headlines artemis had viewed it himself that very morning and was repulsed by the man he was about to do business with i am swimming with sharks he realized and i am prepared to become one of them damon kronski was an enormous man whose head began its slope into his shoulders just below the ears his skin was translucent redhead white with a scattershot of penny freckles and he wore violet sunglasses clamped in place by the folds of his brow and cheeks his smile was broad shining and insincere little ahtemis fowl he said with a pronounced new orleans drawl you find your daddy yet artemis gripped the armrest of his chair squeezing dents in the leather but his smile was as shiny and fake as kronskis no not yet well now thats a pity anything i can do to help you be sure to let your uncle damon know artemis wondered if kronskis amiableuncle act would fool a drunken halfwit perhaps it was not supposed to thank you for the offer in a few hours we may be able to help each other kronski clapped his hands delightedly you have located my silky sifaka i have quite a specimen male three years old more than a metre in length from head to tail easily worth a hundred thousand kronski feigned surprise a hundred did we really say a hundred thousand euro there was steel in artemiss eyes you know we did doctor plus expenses jet fuel is not cheap as you are aware i would like to hear you confirm it or i will turn this plane round kronski leaned close to the camera his face ballooning on the screen im generally a good judge of character ahtemis he said i know what people are capable of but you i have no idea what you might do i think its because you havent reached your limit yet kronski leaned back in his chair the leather creaking under his weight so very well one hundred thousand euro as we agreed but a word of warning yees said artemis stretching the word to two syllables in the new orleans fashion to demonstrate his lack of awe you lose my lemur my little silky then youd better be ready to cover my expenses the trial is all set up and my people dont like to be disappointed the word expenses sounded a lot more sinister when kronski used it dont worry snapped artemis you will get your lemur just have my money ready kronski spread his arms wide ive got rivers of gold here ahtemis ive got mountains of diamonds the only thing i dont have is a silky sifaka lemur so hurry down here boy and make my life complete and he hung up a second before artemis could click the terminatecall button psychologically that puts kronski in the power seat thought artemis i must learn to be quicker on the mouse he closed the powerbooks lid and reclined his chair outside in the sky sunlight was burning through the lower layers of mist and jet trails drew tictactoe patterns in the sky still in busy airspace not for long once we hit africa the jet streams will thin out considerably i need a few hours sleep tomorrow will be a long and distasteful day he frowned distasteful yes but necessary artemis hit the recline button and closed his eyes most boys his age were swapping football cards or wearing out their thumbs on games consoles he was in a jet six thousand metres over europe planning the destruction of a species with a deranged extinctionist perhaps i am too young for all this age was immaterial without his efforts artemis fowl senior would be lost forever in russia and that was simply not going to happen butlers voice came over the jets intercom all quiet up front artemis once we get out over the mediterranean im going to put her on autopilot for an hour and try to wind down artemis stared at the speaker he could sense that butler had more to say nothing but static and the beep of instruments for a moment then today artemis when you told me to shoot the lemur you were bluffing you were bluffing werent you it was no bluff said artemis his voice unwavering i will do whatever it takes tara shuttle port ireland access to the tara shuttle port was hindered by several steel doors various scans and codes tamperproof biolocks and a degree surveillance network at the entrance which is not as easy to set up as it is to say of course all of this could be bypassed if one knew a secret way in how did you know i have a secret way in pouted mulch in response artemis and holly simply looked at him as though he were an idiot waiting for the penny to drop stupid time travel muttered the dwarf told you all about it myself i suppose you will confirmed holly and i dont see what youre so upset about its not as if i can report you to anyone true admitted mulch and there is all that lovely loot the three sat in a stolen mini cooper outside the boundary fence of the mcgraney farm underneath which was concealed the tara shuttle port ten thousand cubic metres of terminal hidden by a dairy farm the first light of dawn was diluting the darkness and the lumpy silhouettes of grazing cows ambled across the meadow in a year or two tara would become a bustling tourist hub for the fairies but for the moment all tourism had been suspended since the spelltropy outbreak mulch squinted at the nearest beast through the back window you know something im a tad peckish i couldnt eat a whole cow but id put a fair dent in one mulch diggums hungry stop the presses commented artemis drily he opened the drivers door stepping on to the grassy verge a light mist clung to his face and the clean smell of country air ran through his system like a stimulant we need to get going i have no doubt that the lemur is already six thousand metres in the air thats a nimble lemur sniggered the dwarf he climbed over the front seat and tumbled out on to the verge nice clay he said giving the ground a lick tastes like profit holly stepped from the passenger seat and sideswiped mulchs behind with her loafer there will be no profit for you if we cant get into the terminal unseen the dwarf picked himself up i thought we were supposed to be friends easy with the kicking and the punching are you always this aggressive can you do it or not of course i can i said so didnt i ive been running around this terminal for years ever since my cousin artemis butted in on the conversation ever since your cousin nord if im not mistaken ever since nord was arrested on pollution charges and you broke him out we know we know everything about you now lets move on with the plan mulch turned his back to artemis casually unbuttoning his bumflap this action was among the worst insults in a dwarfs arsenal second only to what was known as the tuba which involves a cleaning of the pipes in someones direction wars have been fought over the tuba moving on chief stay here for fifteen minutes then make your way to the main entrance i would take you with me but this tunnel is too long to hold things in if you catch my drift he paused for a wink and if you stand too close thats exactly what youll be catching artemis smiled through gritted teeth very well most amusing fifteen minutes it is mister diggums the clock is ticking ticking said mulch fairy clocks havent ticked for centuries then he unhinged his jaw and leaped with astonishing grace diving into the earth like a dolphin slicing through a wave but without the sunny disposition or cute grin though artemis had seen this a dozen times he could not help being impressed what a species he commented if they could take their minds off their stomachs for a few minutes they could rule the world holly climbed on to the bonnet resting her back against the windscreen feeling the sun on her cheeks maybe they dont want to rule the world maybe thats just you arty arty guilt gnawed at artemiss stomach he gazed at hollys familiar fine features and realized that he couldnt keep lying to her any longer its a pity we had to steal this car continued holly eyes closed but the note we left was clear enough the owner should find it without a problem artemis didnt feel so bad about the car he had bigger nails in his coffin yes the car he said absently i need to tell her i have to tell her artemis put a toe on the minis front tyre and climbed on to the bonnet beside holly he sat there for a few minutes concentrating on the experience storing it away holly glanced at him sitting next to her sorry about earlier you know the thing the kiss holly closed her eyes yes i dont know whats happening to me were not even the same species and when we go back we will be ourselves again holly covered her face with her free hand listen to me babbling the leps first female captain that time stream has turned me into what you would call a teenager again it was true holly was different the time stream had brought them closer together what if im stuck like this that wouldnt be so bad would it the question hung in the air between them a question heavy with insecurity and hope if you answer this question it will be the worst thing you have ever done it wasnt you holly artemis blurted his forehead hot his calm cracked hollys smile froze still there but puzzled what wasnt me you didnt infect my mother i did it it was me i had a few sparks left over from the tunnel and i made my parents forget id been missing for three years hollys smile was gone now i didnt but you told me she stopped in midsentence the truth washing across her face like a disease artemis pressed on determined to explain himself i had to do it holly mother is dying will be dying i needed to be certain of your help please understand he trailed off realizing that there was no explaining away his actions artemis allowed holly several minutes to fume then spoke again if there had been another way holly believe me no reaction hollys face was carved in stone please holly say something holly slid from the bonnet her feet connecting solidly with the earth fifteen minutes are up she said time to move out she strode across the mcgraney boundary without a backward glance legs cutting twin swathes in the greenblack grass dawn sunlight shimmered on the tip of each blade and hollys passage set a surging ripple of light flashing across the meadow extraordinary thought artemis what have i lost there was nothing to do but trudge after her mulch diggums was waiting for them inside the holographic bush at the shuttle ports concealed entrance in spite of a thick coating of mud his smug expression was easy to read you wont be needing an omintool captain he said i got the door open all on my lonesome holly was more than surprised the shuttle ports main door needed a twentydigit code plus palmprint scan and she knew that mulch was about as technologically minded as a stink worm not that holly wasnt relieved as she had anticipated a thirtyminute slog resetting the log once shed opened the door herself so tell me mulch pointed down the corridor towards the subterranean escalator a small figure was spreadeagled on the ramp his head covered in a blob of shining goo commander root and his heavy mob have cleared out only one security guard left holly nodded she knew where julius root had gone back to haven to wait for her report from hamburg he was on his rounds up here when i tunnelled in so i swallowed him briefly and gave him a lick of dwarf spit everyone reacts differently to the phlegm helmet this little pixie tried to escape slapped the sensor spouted the code then staggered around a bit before the sedative got him artemis pressed past into the access tunnel perhaps our luck is finally turning he said certain he could feel holly staring daggers into the back of his head a pity he didnt open the lockup sighed mulch then i could have doublecrossed you two and made off with the shuttle artemis froze shuttle he braved hollys hostile gaze to ask a shuttle holly do you think we could still beat my younger self to morocco hollys eyes were flat and her tone was neutral its possible it depends on how long it takes me to cover our tracks the shuttle was what lep pilots would call a snowgood as in snowgood for anything but the recycling smelter butler artemis knew would have been more straightforward in his assessment of the vehicle he could hear the big bodyguards voice in his head i have driven some heaps in my time artemis but this pig is is barely out of the stone age murmured artemis then chuckled ruefully another joke mud boy asked holly youre really on fine form today what is it this time did you tell some poor trusting fool that they caused a plague artemis hung his head wearily this could go on for years mulch had stumbled across the shuttle when hed tunnelled to the port wall and windblasted a sheet of metal cladding from a servicetunnel wall he knew the panel would be loose because he had utilized this point of entry on previous visits the shuttle had been up on blocks and under a lubetent and so mulch could not resist a little peek lo and behold a tunnel scraper in for refitting just the thing for hopping around the peoples network of subterannean access tunnels it had been a simple matter for holly to reverse the clunky shuttle back down the monorail to the tunnel access hatch meanwhile artemis had been covering their tracks removing all traces of their visit to the shuttle port wiping video crystals and replacing the lost time with loops there wasnt much he could do about the unconscious sprite or the loaders worth of lep hardware they had helped themselves to from the lockup but mulch had had no problem taking credit for those hey im already public enemy number one he had said its not as if i can go any higher on the list so now they were seated inside the tunnel scraper which was slotted into a launching bracket drawing a few minutes charge from the coupling dock before they dropped into the abyss holly spent the time falsifying a report for the tunnel authorities im telling them that this shuttles paddle has been upgraded as per the service order and that the ship has been requested by the north african shuttle port to do a supply artery declogging its a drone flight so they wont be looking for any personnel on board artemis was determined to give the mission every chance of success in spite of the bridges he had burned so if a question had to be asked he would ask it will that work holly shrugged i doubt it theres probably a smart missile waiting for us on the other side of that door really no im lying not nice is it artemis shook his head miserably he would have to think of some way to make it up to holly at least partially of course it will work for now at least by the time police plaza puts all of this together we should have returned to the future and we can fly without a paddle holly and mulch shared a guffaw and a few words in gnommish that were too fast for artemis to catch he did think he heard the word cowpóg which translated as moron yes mud boy we can fly without a paddle unless youre planning to scrape some residue from the tunnel walls usually we leave that to the robots artemis had forgotten how cutting holly could be with people she wasnt fond of mulch sang a few bars of the old human song youve lost that lovin feelin he crooned at holly clutching an imaginary microphone in his fist holly was not smiling now youre about to lose all feeling in your legs diggums if you dont shut it mulch noticed hollys expression and realized that now was not the best time to be needling her holly decided it was time to terminate the conversation she remoteopened the access hatch and withdrew the docking clamps buckle up boys she said and dropped the small craft into a steep dive down an enormous hole like dropping a peanut into the mouth of a hungry hippo chapter a fowl mood fez morocco tenyearold artemis was about as miserable as butler could remember seeing him except for perhaps the time he had lost a science prize to an australian postgraduate the bodyguard glanced in the mirror of the rented land rover and saw that his young charge was sitting in a puddle of perspiration his expensive suit virtually dissolving on his spare frame a perforated box sat belted on the seat beside artemis three black fingers poked from one of the holes as the captured lemur explored his prison artemis has barely looked at the creature he is trying to objectify it it is no small thing to cause the extinction of a species even to save ones father artemis meanwhile was cataloguing the causes of his misery a missing father and a mother teetering on the brink of nervous collapse were numbers one and two followed by a team of arctic explorers running up expenses in a moscow hotel room doubtless living on room service caviar with everything damon kronski figured high on the list too a repulsive man with repellent ideals the local airport fez saïss had been closed and so butler had been forced to detour the learjet to mohammed v international in casablanca and rent a land rover there and not a modern land rover either this one belonged in the last millennium and had more holes than a block of gruyère cheese the airconditioning had spluttered its last over a hundred miles ago and the seat padding was worn so thin that artemis felt like he was sitting on a jackhammer if the heat didnt bake him the vibration would shake him to death still in spite of all these things a thought struck artemis causing the corner of his mouth to twitch in a half smile that strange creature and her human companion are utterly fascinating they were desperate to have this lemur and they would not give up he was certain of it artemis turned his attention to the city suburbs bouncing past his window the desert highway was suddenly thick with traffic as they neared the city centre giant trucks thundered past tyres taller than a grown man their flatbeds stuffed with sullen human cargo harried donkeys hooves clicked on the broken tarmac their backs piled high with sticks laundry or even furniture thousands of dusty mopeds slalomed through the lanes often bearing entire families on their rusting frames the roadside buildings shimmered in the late afternoon sun like mirages ghost houses with teadrinking spectres seated out at the front closer to the city centre the buildings were denser with no tracts of desert in between dwellings were interspersed with garages and video stores tea shops and pizza parlours all were the same sandblasted orange colour with patches of original paint poking through below the lintels artemis felt as he always did when visiting developing nations mild surprise at the coexistence of ancient and modern goat herders toted ipods on spangled chains and wore manchester united shirts shacks had satellite dishes bolted to their corrugated roofs until recent times fez had been a place of real importance being the depot for the caravan trade from the south and east it was known as a centre of arab wisdom a holy city and a place of pilgrimage when the route to mecca was closed by weather conditions or overrun with bandits now it had become a place where outlawed extinctionists did deals with desperate irish criminals the world is changing more rapidly now than it ever has before thought artemis and i am helping to change it for the worst not a comforting thought but comfort was not a luxury he expected to enjoy in the near future artemiss mobile phone buzzed as an incoming text message arrived having made its way from fez to ireland and back to morocco he checked the screen and a mirthless smile exposed his incisors the leather souq two hours read the message kronski wished to make the exchange in a public place apparently the doctor trusts me about as much as i trust him smart man holly piloted the shuttle as though she were angry with it slamming the mining craft round bends until its air brakes screamed and its readout needles shot into the red she wore a flight helmet hardwired directly into the shuttles cameras so a wraparound view of the shuttle was available to her at all times she could even choose a remote view beamed to the shuttle from the tunnels various cameras this particular stretch of tunnel saw little traffic and so the motionsensitive lights would pop on barely five miles before the shuttle entered a stretch holly tried hard to enjoy the experience of flying and forget everything else being a pilot for the lep was what she had dreamed of since childhood as she cut yet another corner with a millimetre to spare and felt the shuttle strain to its limits in her hands the tension drained from her body as though absorbed by the craft artemis lied to me and blackmailed me but he did it for his mother a good reason whos to say that i would not have done the same thing myself if i could have saved my mother i would have done whatever i needed to do including manipulate my friends and so she could understand what artemis had done even though she felt it was unnecessary but that did not mean she could forgive him just yet and how could she forget it it felt as though she had completely misjudged their friendship that wont happen again one thing that holly was certain of the most she and artemis could ever have now was what theyd always had grudging respect holly patched into the passengerseat bubblecam on the shuttle ceiling and was gratified to see artemis clutching the armrests on his seat perhaps it was the camera feed or perhaps his face was actually green you blew it mud boy thought holly and then i hope its your face and not the feed there was a natural vent in the moroccan desert south of agadir where tunnel gas filtered up through half a mile of sand the only evidence of this was a slight discoloration of the sand above the vent which was quickly dispersed by the winds as soon as it reached the surface nevertheless a thousand years of the process had left the dunes with curious red streaks which the local villagers swore was blood from the victims of raisuli a famous twentiethcentury bandit it was highly unlikely that anyone swallowed these claims least of all the villagers themselves but it made good reading in the guidebooks and drew visitors to the otherwise unremarkable area holly drilled the craft through the vent sealing the shuttles own air filters against the tiny sand particles she was flying virtually blind with only a threedimensional model of the vent to navigate by luckily it was a short leg of the trip and it took mere seconds for the shuttle to punch through to the african sky in spite of the crafts insulated skin its passengers soon began to feel the heat especially mulch diggums unlike the other fairy families dwarfs were not surface creatures and did not dream of golden sun on their upturned faces anything higher than sea level gave them vertigo mulch burped wetly this is too high i dont like this hot too darned hot i need to go to the bathroom for what im not sure exactly just dont follow me in there whatever you hear dont come in when a dwarf gave this sort of advice it was wise not to ignore it holly sent a charge through the windscreen to clear it then pointed the shuttles nose northeast towards fez with a bit of luck they could still beat little artemis to the rendezvous point she set the autopilot and swivelled her seat to face artemis whose face was just returning to its normal pallor youre sure about the rendezvous point she asked artemis wasnt sure about anything and this uncertainty fogged his brain not sure holly but i clearly remember making the exchange at the leather souq in fez at the very least it is a place to start if kronski and my younger self do not show up then we proceed to the extinctionists compound holly frowned hmm this scheme is not up to your usual standards and our time is running out we dont have a couple of days to play around with time is the enemy yes agreed artemis time is the crux of this entire misadventure holly took a nutriblock from the tiny refrigerator and returned to her controls artemis studied his friends back trying to read her body language hunched rounded shoulders and arms crossed in front of her body she was cutting herself off hostile to communication he needed to produce some masterstroke to get himself back in her good books artemis pressed his nose to the porthole watching the moroccan desert flash past in streaks of ochre and gold there must be something that holly wanted something she regretted not doing that in some way he could facilitate after a moments concentrated thought it came to him hadnt he seen a field holograph pack on one of the storage rails and wasnt there someone to whom holly had never said goodbye police plaza haven city the lower elements commander julius root was up to the quivering tip of his fungus cigar in paperwork not that it was actual paperwork there hadnt been any lep files written on real paper in a centaurs age it was all saved on a crystal and kept in a central core somewhere in infospace and apparently now foalys people were trying to grow memory plants which meant that some day information could be stored in plants or dungheaps or even the cigar sticking out of roots mouth the commander did not understand any of this nor did he want to let foaly have the worlds of nano and cyber technologies he would take the world of everyday lep problems and there were plenty of those first his old enemy mulch diggums was running riot above ground it was almost as if the dwarf were taunting him his latest crime spree involved breaking into shuttle ports then selling his booty on to exiled fairies living among the humans at each site he would leave a nice pyramid of recycled earth in the middle of the floor like a calling card then there were those blasted swear toads a couple of college graduate warlocks had granted the power of speech to the common bloated tunnel toad naturally being college graduates they had only granted the toads the power of bad language now thanks to an unforeseen side effect namely fertility there was a virtual epidemic of these toads running around haven offending every citizen they hopped into the goblin gangs were growing in strength and audacity only last week they had fireballed a patrol car on its route through goblin town julius root leaned back in his swivel chair allowing the smoke from his cigar to form a cloud around his head there were days when he felt like hanging up his holster for good days when it felt as though there was nothing to keep him in the job the hologram ring buzzed on the ceiling like a disco ball incoming call root checked the caller id captain holly short root allowed himself a rare grin then there were days when he knew exactly what he had to do i have to groom the best people to take over when i am gone people like captain kelp foaly gods help me and captain holly short root had handpicked holly from the ranks promoted her to captain the first female to hold the title in the leps history and she had done him proud every recon so far had been successful without a single mindwipe or timestop shes the one julius said roots inner voice smart fearless compassionate holly short will make a splendid captain who knows maybe a great commander root wiped the smile from his face captain short did not need to see him smiling proudly like a doting grandfather she needed discipline order and a healthy dollop of respectfear for her commanding officer he tapped the accept pad on his desktop screen and the hologram ring blasted a milky way of stars from its projectors that swirled and solidified into the flickering form of captain holly short wearing a human suit undercover obviously he could see her exactly as she was but she could not see him until he stepped into the footprint of the holographic ring which he did captain short all is well in hamburg i trust holly seemed speechless for a moment her mouth hung open and her hands reached out as if to touch the commander in her time he was dead murdered by opal koboi but here and now julius root was as vital as she remembered root cleared his throat all is well captain yes of course commander all is well for the moment though it might be an idea to have retrieval on standby root dismissed this idea with a wave of his cigar nonsense your record so far speaks for itself you have never needed backup before holly smiled always a first time root blinked something on the hologram rings floating gaseous readout had caught his eye are you calling me from africa what are you doing in africa holly slapped her palm against the instrument panel on her end no im in hamburg in the observation hide stupid machine the projectors are all wrong too i look about ten years old on the monitor im going to strangle foaly when i get back root couldnt help but smile at that but he tucked it away quickly why the hologram short whats wrong with a plain old communicator do you know how expensive it is to beam sound and vision through the earths crust hollys image flickered and stared at its feet then up again i i just wanted to thank you jul commander root was surprised thank him for months of impossible tasks and double shifts thank me captain this is most irregular im not sure im doing my job right if fairies are thanking me yes yes you are blurted hollys image you do a fine job more than fine no one appreciated appreciates you enough but i do now i know what you were are trying to do for me so thank you and i wont let you down root was surprised to find that he was actually touched it wasnt every day he was faced with such genuine emotion look at me he thought blubbering at a hologram wouldnt foaly love this i em i accept your thanks and i believe them to be heartfelt although i dont expect an expensive hologram call during every mission just the once will be fine understood commander and be careful in hamburg make sure to check your equipment i will commander said holly and root could have sworn she rolled her eyes but it could have been another glitch in the program anything else captain holly reached out her hand it shimmered and wavered slightly with the motion root was not sure what he was supposed to do hologram etiquette was very clear hugging and shaking were not encouraged after all who wants to embrace a pixellated image but still the hand was there wish me luck commander one officer to another root grunted with any other subordinate he would have suspected toadying but captain short had always impressed him with her candour he reached out his hand and felt a slight tingle as it touched hollys virtual digits good luck captain he said gruffly and try to tone down that maverick streak some day i wont be around to help you will do commander goodbye said holly and then she was gone but in the seconds before her holographic image fizzled out julius root could have sworn he saw rough holographic tears glint on her cheeks stupid machine he thought i will demand that foaly recalibrate the lot of them holly stepped out of the holobooth which resembled an ancient shower unit with rubber curtain with the touch of a button it collapsed and selfsealed into the portable briefcase there were tears in her eyes as she strapped herself into the pilots chair and flicked off autopilot artemis squirmed slightly in the copilots chair so are we even holly nodded yes were even but your elfkissing days are over i see said artemis its not a challenge artemis over is over i know said artemis neutrally they sat in silence for a while watching low mountains speed across the desert towards them then holly leaned across and punched artemis gently on the shoulder thanks arty you are most welcome all i did was have an idea mulch emerged noisily from the bathroom scratching and grunting wooooh thats better thank the gods for soundproofing eh holly winced close the door and let the extractor fan do its work mulch slammed the door with a flick of his heel i was thinking in there you know rooominating i dont think i want to hear this mulch ploughed on regardless that little lemur the silky whatever you know who he reminds me of with that buzzcut hairdo they had all been thinking it commander root said holly smiling yep a miniature commander root julius junior said artemis they crested the foothills of the atlas mountains and fez was revealed like the heart of the land its arteries clogged with vehicles jayjay said holly thats his name now lets go get him she switched on the shuttles shield and initiated their descent into fez chapter pigeon droppings the leather souq fez medina holly inflated a cham pod and suckered it to the shadowy underside of the stone balcony overlooking fezs leather souq when the coast was clear she and artemis climbed through the tiny access portal wiggling into the blowup seats artemiss knees knocked against his chin clicking his teeth like i said youre getting tall said holly artemis blew a raven lock from his eye and hairy your hair was the only thing that stopped little arty recognizing himself so be glad of it holly had liberated the champod duffel bag from the tara lockup along with a single neutrino handgun and suitable disguises artemis wore a kneelength brown shirt and thong sandals while hollys fairy characteristics were hidden by a headscarf and an abaya the cham pod was an old portable model and was basically a ball with a transparent outer layer that was inflated by a tank of chromovariable gas that could change colour to imitate the background that was about as hightech as it got no directional equipment no onboard weaponry just a oneway touch screen and two cramped seats no air filters wondered artemis unfortunately not said holly pulling her scarf across her nose what is that smell diluted pigeon droppings replied artemis highly acidic and of course plentiful the tannery workers use it to soften the hides before dyeing them the leather souq spread out below them was a spectacular sight huge stone vats were arranged across the courtyard in honeycomb patterns each filled with either acidic softeners or vegetable dyes such as saffron and henna the leather workers stood in the dye vats soaking each skin thoroughly including their own and when the hide had attained the desired hue it was stretched on a nearby rooftop to dry people say that henry ford invented the production line said artemis this place has been going for six hundred years the souq was enclosed by high walls painted white but mottled by dye and dust ochre stains spread across the ancient brick like the faded map of some exotic archipelago why did kronski choose the souq wondered holly the stink is almost unbearable and i say that as a friend of mulch diggums since birth kronski has suffered from anosmia artemis explained he has no sense of smell it amuses him to conduct his business here as whoever he happens to be meeting will be virtually assaulted by the smell from the acid vats their concentration is shattered and his is unaffected clever fiendishly so the area is a tourist attraction so many people will pass through but none hang around for too long plenty of spectators but not many witnesses apart from the locals and kronski doubtless has a dozen of those on his payroll and they will see what he wants them to see artemis leaned forward his nose brushing the plastic portal and here is our fiendish extinctionist now right on cue the souq below was thronged with leather workers and merchants long since inured to the sharp odour of the vats groups of diehard tourists flitted through determined to capture the scene on their cameras but unwilling to suffer the heat and smells for longer than a few shutter clicks and among them all serene and smiling strode doctor damon kronski dressed in a preposterous tailored camouflage suit complete with a generals peaked hat holly was sickened by the man and how he obviously relished his surroundings look at him he loves this artemis did not comment he had sold the lemur and he judged that a crime worse than kronskis instead he searched the souq for a smaller version of himself there i am west corner holly switched her gaze to locate young artemis he stood almost hidden by a huge tiled urn brimming with mintgreen dye the sinking sun was a chopped silver disc on its surface artemis smiled i remember standing in that exact spot so the glare would distract kronski it is the only vat touched by the sun at this time a little payback for the smell childish perhaps but then i was a child it looks like your memory is accurate on this occasion said holly artemis couldnt help but be relieved his recollection had been hitandmiss up to now he straightened suddenly hitandmiss how could he not have seen it these memory malfunctions could mean only one thing no time to pursue that thought now the exchange was afoot artemis tapped the touchscreen with his index finger expanding a section closing in on a plinth at the centre of the souq the low stone tabletop was grooved and curved from centuries of being piled high with hides wet henna glistened on its surface and dribbled down its sides like blood from a head injury there said artemis thats where we agreed to make the exchange kronski lays the suitcase on the rock i hand it over him hes a male and his name is jayjay said holly making it real i hand over jayjay then we go our separate ways simple as that there were no complications perhaps we should wait until after the handover no what happens afterwards is an unknown quantity at least now we have some foreknowledge holly studied the scene with a veterans eye wheres butler artemis touched another point on the screen it rippled slightly flexed and enlarged his selection in that window watching over everything the window was a high rectangle in the flaking white wall painted black by shade and depth you think youre invisible dont you my friend holly whispered then highlighted the window with a thumb and activated a nightvision filter in the sudden glow of body heat a hulking figure appeared in the window still as stone except for a beating heart i remember that butler wanted to make the exchange but i talked him out of it hes up there right now fuming butler fuming is not something i want to see up close artemis laid a hand on her shoulder then dont get too close a distraction is all we need i wish there had been an lep jumpsuit in that lockup if you were invisible to man and machine i would be more comfortable with this holly twisted her chin calling her magic and blobs of her disappeared until there was nothing left in the seat but haze dont worry artemis she said her voice sounding almost robotic because of the vibration i have been on missions before you are not the only smart one in the souq artemis was not in the least cheered by this all the more reason to be careful i wish thered been a set of wings in the terminal what sort of lockup doesnt have wings pot luck said holly her voice floating through the expandable seal of the portal we got what we got we got what we got repeated artemis following hollys progress down the steps and across the courtyard with the infrared filter terrible grammar tenyearold artemis felt as though he had been dipped in a jar of honey and left to bake on the surface of the sun his garments had moulded themselves to his skin and a tornado of flies revolved round his head artemiss throat was sandpaper dry and he could hear his breath and pulse as though he were wearing a helmet and the stench the stench was a hot wind gusting in his nose and eyes i must persevere he thought with a focused determination beyond his years father needs me also i refuse to be cowed by this odious man the souq was a confusing kaleidoscope of pumping limbs splashing dye and evening shadows and from artemiss point of view things were even more confusing elbows flashed past urns rang like bells and the air was shattered by sharp bolts of french and arabic above his head artemis allowed himself a moment to meditate he closed his eyes taking shallow breaths through his mouth very well he thought to business doctor kronski luckily the doctor was enormous and as artemis made his way through the souq he quickly spotted kronski on the opposite diagonal look at that poseur a camouflage suit does he honestly believe himself a general in some war against the animal kingdom artemis himself drew surprised stares from the locals tourists were not unusual in the souq but lone tenyearold boys in formal suits carrying monkey cages were rare in any part of the world it is a simple matter walk to the centre and set down the cage but even walking through this souq was not simple workers bustled through the lanes between vats laden with dozens of sopping hides strings of dye flew through the air striping the clothes of tourists and other workers artemis was forced to tread carefully and give way several times before he eventually reached the small clearing at the centre kronski was there before him perched on the tiny stool that folded out from the top of his hunting cane puffing on a thin cigar apparently im missing out on half the experience he said as though they were simply continuing a conversation the best part of a cigar is the aroma and i cant smell a thing artemis was silently infuriated the man looked completely comfortable with barely a drop of sweat on his brow he forced himself to smile do you have the money damon at least he could annoy the good doctor by neglecting his title kronski did not seem annoyed got it right here ahtemis he said patting his breast pocket a hundred thousand is such a trifling amount i managed to stuff every last note into my suit pocket artemis could not resist a jibe and what a lovely suit it is kronskis violetcoloured glasses flashed in the last rays of the sun unlike your own my boy which appears to be losing its character in this heat it was true artemis felt that the only thing holding him upright was the dried sweat on his spine he was hungry tired and irritable focus the end justifies the sacrifices well obviously i have the lemur so can we please proceed kronskis fingers twitched and artemis could guess what he was thinking take the lemur from the boy just grab it no need to part with the hundred thousand artemis decided to nip this kind of thinking in the bud in case youre entertaining any rash notions of reneging on our agreement let me say just one word to you butler one word was enough kronski knew butlers reputation but not his whereabouts his fingers twitched once more and then were still very well ahtemis lets get this business over with im sure you appreciate that i need to inspect the merchandise of course and im sure you appreciate that i will need to see a sample of your currency why of course kronski wiggled his hand into a pocket and withdrew a fat envelope brimming with purple fivehundredeuro notes he carelessly selected one and passed it across to artemis gonna smell it are you ahtemis not exactly artemis flipped open his mobile phone and selected a uv and magnetic currency scanner from its augmented menu he passed the note in front of the purple light checking for the watermark and metal strip kronski pressed a hand to his heart i am wounded boy injured that you should think i would cheat you why it would cost more than a hundred thousand to forge a hundred thousand a good set of plates costs twice that artemis closed the phone i am not a trusting person damon youll learn that about me he placed the cage on the stone plinth now your turn in that moment kronskis entire attitude changed his offhand nature vanished replaced with a giddiness he smiled and tittered tiptoeing to the cage like a child to the christmas tree perhaps a normal child thought artemis sourly christmas morning holds no surprises for me thanks to the xray scanner on my mobile phone obviously the prospect of extinguishing the life spark of another species excited kronski hugely he leaned over the cage daintily squinting through the airholes yes yes all appears to be in order but i will need to take a closer look one hundred thousand euro buys you all the closer looks you need kronski tossed the envelope to artemis oh take it you tiresome boy you really distress me ahtemis a boy like you cant have many friends ive got one friend retorted artemis pocketing the money and hes bigger than you kronski opened the box just wide enough to grab the lemur by the scruff of the neck he hoisted the animal aloft like a trophy checking him from all angles artemis took a step back casting suspicious glances around the souq perhaps nothing is going to happen he thought perhaps those creatures were not as resourceful as i believed i may have to be content with the hundred thousand for now and then the resourceful creatures arrived holly did not have wings to fly but that did not mean she couldnt cause havoc there had been no weapons in the lep lockup beyond the single neutrino but there had been some mining equipment including a few dozen blaster buttons which holly was now sprinkling into the unattended dye vats around the souq with a double helping underneath butlers window though she was invisible holly took extra care with her movements as shielding without a suit was wild magic indeed any sudden gestures or collisions could cause her body to vent magical fireworks which would look strange igniting out of thin air so softly softly was the way to move holly dropped the last of the buttons feeling totally vulnerable in spite of her invisibility i miss foalys guidance she thought its nice to have an allseeing eye as if he could read her mind artemiss voice came from the mikebud in her ear another gift from the lockup kronski is opening the cage get ready to blow the buttons all set im at the northwest corner if jayjay tries to run i see you on the filter detonate at will holly climbed into an empty vat and fixed her gaze on kronski he had the lemur out now holding it away from his body perfect she ran a finger along the small strip in her hand until all the tiny lights turned green a oneword message scrolled across the strip detonate absolutely thought holly and pressed the yes box a vat blew sending a column of red dye shooting six metres into the air several more vats quickly followed suit thumping like mortars hurling their contents into the morocco sky a symphony of colour thought artemis from his perch butlers view is totally obscured below in the souq pandemonium was instantaneous the leather workers roared and shouted oohing like spectators at a fireworks show as each new coloured fountain erupted some realized that their precious leathers were being coated with the wrong hues and began to feverishly gather their wares and tools within seconds it was raining gouts of dye and the spaces between the vats were thronged with frantic workers and spooked tourists young artemis stood stock still ignoring the flying dye his gaze fixed on damon kronski and the lemur in his fist watch the animal they want the animal kronski squealed with each explosion balancing on a single leg like a scared ballet dancer priceless thought artemis and shot a few seconds of video on his phone something else was about to happen he felt sure of it and he was right artemis had a vague impression that the earth exploded in front of kronskis feet mud mushroomed upwards something moved in the curtain of earth and then the lemur was gone doctor kronski was left holding a blob of slime which glowed slightly in the evening shadows the last drops of dye fell and slowly the chaos retreated the leather workers shook their heads in wonder then began to curse their luck a days profit gone kronski squealed for several seconds after the dust had cleared holding the note like an opera singer artemis grinned nastily it isnt over until the fat lady sings so i suppose its over the doctor was snapped out of it by artemiss tones he composed himself standing on two feet and breathing deeply as the red spots retreated from his cheeks it was not until he tried to wipe the gunk from his hand that he realized the lemur was no longer in his grasp as he stared in disbelief at his fingers kronski felt the stuff coating his fingers harden into a glowing gauntlet what have you done artemis ah thought artemis suddenly you can pronounce my name i have done nothing damon i delivered the lemur you lost him the problems here are all yours kronski was livid he tore off his glasses to reveal redrimmed eyes you have tricked me fowl somehow you are a participant in this i cannot host an extinctionist conference without a strong opening the execution of that lemur was my big hello everyone artemiss phone beeped and he glanced at the screen a brief text from butler mission accomplished he pocketed the mobile phone and smiled broadly at kronski a strong opening i may be able to help you with that for a price naturally artemis the elder sat in the cham pod watching events unfurling below everything went exactly to plan with the exception of the dye vats which actually exceeded artemiss expectations butlers view is completely blocked he thought and then he froze suddenly of course i wouldnt have placed butler in that window at all i would have put a decoy there as it is one of the five logical places for a sniper to set up in fact i would have put a decoy in all five spots and then have butler hide himself somewhere on the souqfloor ready to step in if those pesky lemurnappers showed up again which they very well could as they seem to know my every move i artemis fowl have been bamboozled by myself suddenly a horrifying thought struck him holly he shouted into the microphone pad adhered to his thumb abort abort what came the crackly response the noise i think damaged then a few seconds of white noise sharp snaps and silence it was too late artemis could only press his face against the screen and watch helplessly as one of the leather workers shrugged off his shoulder blanket and straightened revealing himself to be far taller than he had previously appeared it was of course butler with a handheld infrared scanner extended before him butler dont do it old friend i know you were never comfortable with my schemes in three quick strides the bodyguard moved to hollys vat and netted the elf in his blanket she struggled and fought but never had a chance against butlers formidable strength in ten seconds holly was hogtied and hoisted over the bodyguards shoulder in five more seconds butler was out of the gate and lost in the gathering crowds of the medina it all happened so quickly that artemiss jaw did not have time to drop one moment he was in control enjoying the smugness that comes with being the smartest person in the metaphorical room the next he was crashing back to earth having sacrificed his queen for a rook realizing he was up against somebody just as smart as he was only twice as ruthless he felt the pallor of desperation creep across his forehead leaving pins and needles in its wake they have holly the extinctionists will put her on trial on charges of breathing human air a thought occurred to him every defendant is entitled to a good lawyer chapter gone forever la domaine des hommes extinctionists compound fez artemis the younger agreed to accompany doctor kronski to his gated compound near the medina kronskis land rover was considerably more luxurious than artemiss rented model complete with powerful airconditioning water cooler and whitetiger upholstery artemis ran a finger through the fur and was not surprised to find that it was real nice seats he commented drily kronski did not answer he hadnt spoken much since losing the lemur except to mutter to himself cursing the unfairness of it all it didnt seem to bother him that his suit was covered in dye which was transferring itself to his expensive upholstery though it took barely five minutes to reach the compound artemis was glad of the thinking space by the time the land rover was cleared through the reinforced gates he had any wrinkles in his strategy straightened out and hed used the spare two minutes to plot one of the romance novels he occasionally wrote under the pseudonym violet tsirblou a guard with bulk to match butlers waved them through underneath a walkway arch in the fourmetrehigh wall artemis kept his eyes open on the way in noting the armed guards patrolling the tenacre compound and the position of the generator hut and the staff quarters information is power the residential chalets were built in the style of californian beachouses flat roofs and plenty of glass clustered around a manmade beach complete with wave machine and lifeguard there was a large conference centre in the middle of the compound with a scaffoldclad spire jutting from its roof two men were perched on the scaffolding putting the finishing touches to a brass icon on the spires tip and even though most of the icon was wrapped in canvas artemis could see enough to know what it was a human arm with the world in its fist the symbol of the extinctionists kronskis driver parked in front of the compounds grandest chalet and the doctor led the way inside wordlessly he flapped a hand towards a hidecovered sofa and disappeared into his bedroom artemis was hoping for a shower and a change of clothes but apparently kronski was too upset for courtesy so artemis was forced to tug at the collar of his itchy shirt and wait for his hosts return kronkis reception lounge was a macabre space one wall was covered with certificates of extinction complete with photographs of the unfortunate animals and the dates on which the extinctionists managed to murder the last one of the particular species artemis browsed the photo wall here was a japanese sea lion and a yangtze river dolphin a guam flying fox and a bali tiger all gone forever the only way to see these creatures was to somehow build up enough momentum to travel faster than the speed of light and go back in time there were further horrors in the room all labelled for educational purposes the sofa was upholstered with the pelts of falkland island wolves the base of a standing lamp was fashioned from the skull of a western black rhinoceros artemis struggled to maintain his composure i need to get out of here as quickly as possible but the faint voice of his conscience reminded him that leaving would not mean that this place no longer existed and selling the strange creature to kronski would only draw more people to it artemis conjured a picture of his father in his mind whatever it takes whatever i have to do kronski entered the room showered and wearing a flowing kaftan his eyes were redrimmed as though hed been crying sit down ahtemis he said gesturing towards the sofa with a hidebound fly swatter artemis eyed the seat no i think ill stand kronski sank into an office chair oh i get it grownup sofa its difficult to be taken seriously when your feet dont touch the ground the doctor rubbed his eyes with stubby thumbs then donned his trademark glasses you have no idea what its been like for me ahtemis hounded from country to country because of my beliefs like some common criminal and now that i have finally found somewhere to call home now that i have persuaded the committee to meet here i lose my trial animal that lemur was the centrepiece of the entire conference kronskis voice was steady and he seemed to have recovered himself since his breakdown at the leather souq the extinctionists committee members are very powerful men ahtemis they are accustomed to comfort and convenience morocco is hardly convenient i had to build this compound to entice them down here and promise a big opening to the conference and now all i have to show is a shining hand kronski brandished his hand which was largely slime free but did seem to glow faintly all is not lost doctor said artemis soothingly i can provide you with something that will rejuvenate your society and make it globally relevant kronskis frown was sceptical but he leaned forward arms slightly outstretched his face says no thought artemis but his body language says yes what are you selling ahtemis artemis opened the gallery on his phone selecting a photograph this he said passing the phone to kronski the doctor studied the photograph and the scepticism in his eyes grew more pronounced what is this photo manipulation no genuine this creature is real come on ahtemis what weve got here are latex and bone implants nothing more artemis nodded thats a fair reaction so you dont pay until youre satisfied i already paid you paid for a lemur artemis countered this is an undiscovered species possibly a threat to mankind this is what the extinctionists are all about imagine how many members will clamour to donate to your church when you uncover this threat kronski nodded you put together a good argument for a tenyearold how much do i pay you pay five million euro nonnegotiable cash diamonds kronski pouted i wont pay a single stone until i verify the authenticity of your product thats fair thats mighty accommodating of you fowl how do you know i wont doublecross you after all im pretty sure that you had a hand in whatever happened back at the souq payback is fair play where i come from you might doublecross me damon but you wont doublecross butler you are not a stupid man kronski grunted impressed i got to hand it to you boy you have all the angles figured you present em well too he stared absently at his glowing hand you ever think it strange ahtemis how a kid like you winds up going eyeball to eyeball with an old crook like me i dont understand the question said artemis truthfully kronski clapped his hands and laughed it delights me ahtemis he said that a boy such as you exists it makes my day the laughter stopped suddenly as though cut off by a guillotine now how soon can i inspect the creature immediately replied artemis good well text your man to come hither lets say it takes him thirty minutes to get here another ten to clear security we can meet him in the grand lodge in one hour i said immediately said artemis clicking his fingers butler stepped out from behind a curtain a kevlar duffel bag under one arm kronski squealed briefly then rolled his eyes in frustration i cant control that ever since the koala in cleveland its so embarassing file and save thought artemis koala in cleveland anyway continued the doctor how did he get in here butler shrugged i came in the same way you did doctor you were in the land rover breathed kronski very clever not really more lax on your part than clever on ours i will remember that do you have the merchandise with you butlers mouth tightened and artemis knew that he was pushed to the limits of his loyalty by this transaction the lemur had been bad enough but this female in the bag was some kind of person wordlessly the bodyguard placed the duffel on the desk artemis tugged on the zipper but butler stopped him she has some kind of hypnotizing skills i once met a guy in laos who could put the whammy on you but nothing like this she tried it on outside the souq and i nearly ran into a camel so i taped her mouth also as we know she can turn invisible when i opened the bag first she wasnt there i think her juice is running out though there could be more stunts who knows what tricks she has hidden in those pointed ears are you prepared to take that risk yes said kronski almost foaming at the mouth absolutely yes open the bag butler removed his hand and artemis unzipped the duffel exposing the figure inside kronski stared into the mismatched eyes ran a hand across the inhumanly wide brow tugged one of the ears then staggered to the office bar pouring himself a glass of water with shaky hands five million at todays market price he said you said five and we agreed no upping the price now artemis smiled the doctor was hooked five million he said plus expenses artemis the elder rode back to the landing site on a collapsible lep scooter designed to resemble a s human lambretta the resemblance was only bumper deep as there were not many lambrettas that came equipped with clean nuclear batteries gnommish satellite navigation and selfdestruct buttons the ifrane road outside the imperial city was part of the fertile fez river basin and was lined with olive groves and golf courses ancient and modern coexisting overhead the stars seemed closer and fiercer than at home in ireland shining down like stadium lights as though africa were somehow closer to the rest of the universe i lost her i lost holly but he did have a plan a halfdecent plan all it needed was a bit of fairy technology to open a few doors and then there was still a chance because without holly all was lost there would be no future for any of them it took almost an hour to find the particular golf course where holly had parked the lep shuttle not that there was much evidence of a craft on the spot besides a slightly flat plane of sand in the bunker holly had nosed the shuttle deep into the dry sand and left the shield powered on artemis only found it himself with the help of the bikes navigation systems he collapsed the scooter into a frisbeesized disc and climbed down through the roof hatch mulch diggums was idly swivelling himself in the pilots chair thats my scooter mud boy he said that came off the trolley so i take it with me artemis shut the hatch behind him wheres the lemur wheres jayjay mulch answered these questions with some of his own wheres holly have you lost her yes artemis admitted miserably the boy outwitted me he knew we would come for the lemur he sacrificed it for holly smart said mulch anyway im off see you see you see you one of your fairy comrades is in danger and youre just going to desert her mulch raised his palms hey calm down mud boy the lep are not my comrades we had a deal i get you the little furry fellow and you get me a trolley of lep tech goodies job done both parties happy at that moment jayjay poked his head round the bathroom door whats he doing in there mulch grinned take two guesses lemurs cannot use advanced plumbing see for yourself whatevers in there im blaming jayjay he clicked his furry fingers and the lemur ran along his arm on to his head see he accepts responsibility mulch frowned youre not going to trade this fellow for captain short are you no point said artemis acccessing the lep central database it would be like trying to trade a hairpin for excalibur mulch chewed his lip im familiar with the excalibur story so i know what youre trying to say there a hairpin is useless excalibur is wonderful and so on but in some instances a hairpin is extremely useful now if you had said a rubber hairpin do you see what im getting at artemis ignored him tapping furiously at the vboard that had appeared in front of him he needed to know everything he could about the extinctionists and foaly had an extensive file on them mulch ticked jayjay under the chin i was getting pretty fond of captain short against my better judgement i suppose i could dig in and rescue her this was a genuine offer and a fair point so artemis spared a moment to address it not possible kronski has seen the tunnel rescue before and he wont fall for it again at any rate you wouldnt survive the temperature during the day even underground you wouldnt be safe the earth is so dry that cracks can penetrate up to fifteen metres in open ground one pinprick of midday sun and you would crisp like an old book in a furnace mulch winced now you see that image works really well so what are you going to do artemis used the advanced fairy technology to print off a leopardprint card with an extinctionists hologram flashing silver and purple in the centre im going to the extinctionists banquet tonight he said flicking the card with his forefinger after all i have been invited all i need is a disguise and some medical supplies mulch was impressed thats very good youre almost as devious as i am artemis turned back to the vboard it would take time to firm up his cover you have no idea he said the night of the extinctionists banquet was upon him and kronskis nerves were frazzled he danced around his chalet wearing nothing but a bath towel anxiously humming his way through the tunes from joseph and the amazing technicolor dreamcoat kronski often dreamed that he was wearing the technicolor coat and it was fashioned from the pelts of all the animals he had hunted to extinction he always awoke smiling everything has to be perfect this is the biggest night of my life thank you little ahtemis there was a lot riding on this conference and the banquet generally set the tone for the entire weekend pull off something big at the banquet trial and the members would be buzzing about it for days the internet would be alive with chatter and it doesnt get any bigger than a brandnew sentient species the extinctionists are about to go global and just in time truth be told the extinctionists were old news subscriptions were dropping off and for the first time since its inception the conference was not a total sellout in the beginning it had been wonderful so many exciting species to hunt and nail to the wall but now countries were protecting their rare animals especially the big ones there was no flying into india for a tiger shoot any more and the subsaharan nations took it extremely badly if a group of wellarmed extinctionists showed up at one of their reserves and began taking pot shots at elephants it was getting to the point where government officials were refusing bribes refusing bribes there was another problem with the extinctionists though kronski would never admit it aloud the group had become a touchstone for the lunatic fringe his heartfelt hatred for the animal kingdom was attracting bloodthirsty crazies who could not see past putting a bullet in a dumb beast they could not grasp the philosophy of the organization man is king and animals survive only so long as they contribute to the comfort of their masters an animal without uses is wasting precious air and should be wiped out but this new creature changed everything everyone would want to see her they would film the entire trial and execution leak the tape and then the world would come to damon kronski one year of donations thought kronski then i retire to enjoy my wealth five million this fairy or whatever it is is worth ten times that a hundred times kronski jiggled in front of the airconditioner blast for a minute then selected a suit from his wardrobe purple he thought tonight i shall be emperor as an afterthought he plucked a matching tasselled caspian tigerskin hat from an upper shelf when in fez he thought brightly the fowl learjet metres over gibraltar tenyearold artemis fowl tried his best to relax in one of the learjets plush leather chairs but there was a tension knot at the base of his skull i need a massage he thought or some herbal tea artemis was perfectly aware what was causing the tension i have sold a creature a person to the extinctionists being as smart as he was artemis was perfectly capable of constructing an argument to justify his actions her friends will free her they almost outsmarted me they can certainly outsmart kronski that fairy creature is probably on her way back to wherever she came from right now with the lemur under her arm artemis distracted himself from this shaky reasoning by concentrating on kronski something really should be done about that man a titanium powerbook hummed gently on artemiss foldout tray he woke the screen and opened his personal internet browser program that he had written as a school project thanks to a powerful and illegal antenna in the jets cargo bay he was able to pick up radio television and internet signals almost anywhere in the world organizations like the extinctionists live and die on their reputations he thought it would be an amusing exercise to destroy kronskis reputation using the power of the web all it would take was some research and the placement of a little video on a few of the nets more popular networking sites twenty minutes later artemis junior was putting the finishing touches to his project when butler ducked through the cockpit door hungry asked the bodyguard theres some hummus in the fridge and i made yoghurt and honey smoothies artemis embedded his video project on to the final website no thank you mumbled artemis im not hungry that will be the guilt gnawing at your soul said butler candidly helping himself from the fridge like a rat on an old bone thank you for the simile butler but whats done is done did we have to leave kronski the weapon please i put remote destruct charges in my hardware do you really think such an advanced race will leave their technology unprotected i wouldnt be surprised if that gun is melting in kronskis hands i had to leave it as a sweetener i doubt the creature is melting stop this butler i made a deal and thats the end of it butler sat opposite him hmm so you are governed by some sort of code now honour among criminals interesting so whats that youre cooking up on your computer artemis rubbed the tense spot on his neck please butler all of this is for my father you know it must be done one question said butler ripping the plastic from a cutlery set would your father want it to be done this way artemis did not answer just sat and rubbed his neck five minutes later butler took pity on the tenyearold i thought we might turn the plane around and give those strange creatures a little help fez saïss airport has reopened so we could be back there in a couple of hours artemis frowned it was the right thing to do but it was not on his agenda returning to fez would not save his father butler folded his paper plate in half trapping the debris from his meal inside artemis i would like to swing the jet around and i intend to do that unless you instruct me not to all you need to do is say the word artemis watched his bodyguard return to the cockpit but said nothing morocco the domaine des hommes was buzzing with limoloads of extinctionists coming in from the airport each one wearing their hatred for animals on their sleeve or on their heads or feet kronski spotted a lady sporting thighlength ibex boots pyrenean if he wasnt mistaken and there was old jeffrey coontzmeyers with his quaggabacked tweed jacket and contessa irina kostovich her pale neck protected from the evening chill by a honshuwolf stole kronski smiled and greeted each one warmly and most by name every year there were fewer newcomers to the ranks but that would all change after the trial tonight he skipped along towards the banquet hall the hall itself had been designed by schillerhaus in munich and was essentially a huge prefabricated kit which had arrived in containers and been erected by german specialists in less than four weeks incredible really it was an impressive structure more formal in appearance than the chalets which was only proper as serious business was conducted inside fair trials and then executions fair trials thought kronski and giggled the main doors were guarded by two burly moroccan gentlemen in evening wear kronski had considered crested jumpsuits for the guards but dismissed the idea as too bond i am not doctor no i am doctor noanimals kronski breezed past the guards down a corridor carpeted with sumptuous local rugs and into a doubleheight banquet hall with a tripleglazed glass roof the stars seemed close enough to reach out and capture the decor was a tasteful blend of classic and modern tasteful except for the gorillapaw ashtrays dotted on each table and the row of elephantfoot champagne coolers on stands outside the kitchen doors kronski squeezed through the double doors past a brushedsteel kitchen to the walkin freezer at the rear the creature sat flanked by three more guards she was cuffed to a plastic baby chair borrowed from the compounds crèche her features were alert and sullen her weapon lay out of reach on a steel trolley if looks were bullets thought kronski picking up the tiny weapon and weighing it on his palm i would be riddled he pointed the weapon at a frozen ham hock hanging on a chain and pulled the tiny trigger there was no kickback and no obvious flash of light but the ham was now steaming and ready to serve kronski raised the violetcoloured sunglasses that he wore day and night to make sure his vision was accurate my goodness he said in wonderment this is quite a toy he stamped on the steel floor sending a bong reverberating through the chamber no tunnelling out this time he announced not like the souq do you speak english creature do you know what i am saying to you the creature rolled her eyes i would answer you her expression said but there is tape across my mouth and for good reason said kronski as though the sentence had been spoken aloud we know all about your hypnotism tricks and the invisibility he pinched her cheek as one would a cute infant your skin feels almost human what are you a fairy is that it another eye roll if eyerolling were a sport this creature would be a goldmedal winner thought the doctor well perhaps silver medal gold would surely go to my exwife whos no slacker in the eyerolling department herself kronski addressed the guards has she moved he asked the men shook their heads it was a stupid question how could she move very well good all proceeds according to my plan now kronski rolled his own eyes listen to me all proceeds according to my plan that is so doctor no i should go and get myself some metal hands what do you think gentlemen metal hands said the newest guard unaccustomed to kronskis rants the other two were well aware that many of the doctors questions were rhetorical especially the ones about andrew lloyd webber or james bond kronski ignored the new guy he placed a finger on pursed lips for a moment to communicate the importance of what he was about to say then took a deep whistling breath through his nose ok gentlemen everyone listening this evening couldnt be more important the future of the entire organization depends on it everything must be totally perfect do not take your eyes off the prisoner and do not remove her restraints or gag no one is to see her until the trial begins i paid five million in diamonds for the privilege of a grand reveal so no one gets in here but me understood this was not a rhetorical question though it took the new guy a moment to realize it yes sir understood he blurted a fraction after the other two if something does go wrong then your final job of the evening will be burial duty kronski winked at the new guard and you know what they say last in first out the atmosphere at the banquet was a little jaded until the food arrived the thing about extinctionists was that they were picky eaters some hated animals so much that they were vegetarians which limited the menu somewhat but this year kronski had managed to poach a chef from a vegetarian restaurant in edinburgh who could do things with a courgette that would make the most hardened carnivore weep they started with a subtle tomatoandpepper soup in baby turtle shells then a light parcel of roast vegetables in pastry with a dollop of greek yoghurt served in a monkeyskull saucer all very tasty and by now the wine was relaxing the guests kronskis stomach was so churned with nerves that he could not eat a single bite which was most unusual for him he hadnt felt this giddy since his very first banquet in austin all those years ago i am on the verge of greatness soon my name will be mentioned in the same sentence as the bobby jo haggard or jo bobby saggart the great evangelist extinctionists damon kronski the man who saved the world two things would make this banquet the greatest ever held the entrée and the trial the entrée would delight everyone meat eaters and vegetarians alike the vegetarians could not eat it but at least they could marvel at the artistry it took to prepare the dish kronski tapped a small gong beside his place setting and stood to introduce the dish as was the custom ladies and gentlemen he began let me tell you a story of extinction in july professor d s jordan visited twin lakes in colorado and published his discoveries in the bulletin of the united states fish commission he found what he declared to be a new species the yellowfin cutthroat in his report jordan described the fish as silvery olive with a broad lemonyellow shade along the sides lower fins bright golden yellow in life and a deep red dash on each side of the throat hence the cutthroat until about yellowfin cutthroats survived in twin lakes the yellowfin died out soon after rainbow trout were introduced to twin lakes other trout interbred with the rainbows but the yellowfins quickly disappeared and are now completely extinct nobody shed a tear in fact there was a smattering of applause for the e word kronski raised a hand no no this is not a cause for joy it is said that the yellowfin was a very tasty fish with a particulary sweet flavour what a pity we shall never taste it he paused dramatically or shall we at the rear of the room a large false wall slid aside to reveal a red velvet curtain with great ceremony kronski pulled a remote control from his jacket and zapped the curtain which drew back with a smooth swish behind it was an enormous trolley bearing what appeared to be a miniature glacier silver and steaming the guests sat forward intrigued what if there was a flash freeze over a hundred years ago in twin lakes a twittering began among the diners no surely not impossible what if a frozen chunk of lake was trapped by a landslide deep in an uncharted crevasse and kept solid by nearzero currents then that would mean inside that chunk what if that chunk surfaced a mere six weeks ago on the land of my good friend tommy kirkenhazard one of our own faithful members tommy stood to take a bow waving his texasgreywolf stetson though his teeth were smiling his eyes were shooting daggers at kronski it was obvious to the entire room that there was bad blood between the two then it would be possible outrageously expensive and difficult but possible to transport that chunk of ice here a chunk that contains a sizeable shoal of yellowfin cutthroat trout kronski drew breath to allow this information to sink in then we dear friends could be the first people to eat yellowfin in a hundred years this prospect even had a few of the vegetarians salivating watch extinctionists watch and be amazed kronski clicked his fingers and a dozen kitchen staff wheeled the ponderous trolley into the centre of the banqueting area where it rested on a steel grille the workers then stripped off their uniforms to reveal monkey costumes underneath have i gone over the top with the monkey rigs kronski wondered is it just too broadway but a quick survey of his guests assured him that they remained enthralled the kitchen staff were actually trained circus acrobats from one of the cirque du soleil knockoffs touring north africa they were only too glad to take a few days out from their schedule to put on this private show for the extinctionists they swarmed up the huge iceblock anchoring themselves on with ropes crampons or grappling hooks and began demolishing it with chainsaws flaming swords and flamethrowers all produced seemingly from nowhere it was a spectacular indulgence ice flew showering the guests and the buzz of machinery was deafening quickly the shoal of yellowfin poked through the blue murk of ice they hung wideeyed and frozen in midturn their bodies caught by the flash freeze what a way to go thought kronski with absolutely no inkling wonderful the performers began carving the fish in blocks from the ice and each one was passed down to one of a dozen line cooks who had appeared from the side doors wheeling gas burners each individual block was slid into a heated colander to steam off excess ice then the fish were expertly filleted and fried in olive oil with a selection of chunkycut vegetables and a crushed clove of garlic for the vegetarians there was a champagne mushroom risotto though kronski did not anticipate many takers the nonmeat eaters would accept the fish just to stab it the meal was a huge success and the level of delighted chatter rose to fill the hall kronski managed to eat half a fillet in spite of his nerves delicious exquisite they think that was the highlight he thought they aint seen nothing yet after coffee when the extinctionists were loosening their cummerbunds or turning fat cigars for an even burn kronski instructed his staff to set up the courtroom they responded with the speed and expertise of a formula one pitteam as well they should after three months of being whipped into shape literally the workers swarmed across the grid where the melted ice sloshed below like a disturbed swimming pool a few stray yellowfins floating on the surface they covered this section of floor and exposed a second pit this one lined with steel and covered with scorch marks two podiums and a dock were wheeled into the centre of the hall taking the place of the icetrolley the podiums had computers on their swivel tops and the wooden dock was occupied by a cage the cages resident was masked by a curtain of leopard skin the diners chatter ceased as they held their breath for the big reveal this was the moment everyone was waiting for these millionaires and billionaires paying through the nose for a few moments of ultimate power holding the fate of an entire species in their hands showing the rest of the planet who was boss the guests did not notice the dozen or so sharpshooters placed discreetly on the upper terrace in case the creature on trial dispayed any new magical powers there was little chance of a subterranean rescue as the entire hall was built on a foundation of steel rods and concrete kronski milked the moment rising slowly from his seat sauntering across to the prosecutors podium he steepled his fingers allowing the tension to build then began his presentation every year we put a rare animal on trial there were a few hoots from the audience which kronski waved away goodnaturedly a real trial where the host prosecutes and one of you lucky people gets to defend the idea is simple if you can convince a jury of your unprejudiced peers more hooting that the creature in this cage contributes positively to human existence on this planet then we will free the creature this believe it or not did happen once in a little before my time but i am assured it actually happened if the defence counsels peers are not convinced of the animals usefulness then i press this button and here kronskis bulbous fingers twiddled playfully with an oversized red button on his remote control and the animal drops from its cage into the pit passing the laser beam that activates the gaspowered flame jets voilà instant cremation allow me to demonstrate indulge me its a new pit ive been testing it all week he nodded at one of the staff who yanked up a section of the grid with a steel hook kronski then picked a melon from a fruit platter and tossed it into the pit there was a beep followed by an eruption of bluewhite flame gouts from nozzles ranged around the pit walls the melon was burned to black floating crisps the display drew an impressed round of applause but not everyone appreciated kronskis grandstanding jeffrey coontzmeyers cupped both hands round his mouth come on damon what have we got tonight not another monkey every year its monkeys generally interruptions would irritate kronski but not tonight on this night all hectoring however witty would be swept from peoples memories the second that curtain was drawn aside no jeffrey not another monkey what if jeffrey coontzmeyers groaned vocally please no more what ifs we had half a dozen with the fish show us the blasted creature kronski bowed as you wish he thumbed a button on his remote control and a largeview screen descended from the rafters covering the back wall another button pushed and the curtain concealing the caged creature swished smoothly to one side holly was revealed cuffed to the baby chair her eyes darting and furious at first the main reaction was puzzlement was it a little girl its just a child has kronski gone mad i knew he sang to himself but this then the extinctionists eyes were drawn to the screen which was displaying a feed from a camera clamped to the cage oh my lord her ears look at her ears shes not human what is that what is it tommy kirkenhazard stood this better not be a hoax damon or well string you up two points said kronski softly first this is no hoax i have unearthed an undiscovered species as a matter of fact i believe it to be a fairy second if this were a hoax you would not be stringing anyone up kirkenhazard my men would cut you down before you could wave that ridiculous hat of yours and shout yeehaw sometimes it was good to send a shiver down peoples spines remind them where the power was of course your scepticism is to be expected welcomed in fact to put your minds at rest i will need a volunteer from the audience how about you tommy hows that backbone of yours tommy kirkenhazard gulped down half a glass of whiskey to bolster his nerves then made his way to the cage good performance tommy thought kronski its almost as if we hadnt arranged this little confrontation to give me a bit more credibility kirkenhazard stood as close to holly as he dared then reached in slowly to tweak her ear my saints its no fake this is the real deal he stood back and the truth of what was happening filled his face with joy we got ourselves a fairy kirkenhazard rushed across to kronskis podium pumping his hand clapping his back and so my biggest critic is converted the rest will follow like sheep useful animals sheep kronski silently congratulated himself i will prosecute the fairy as is the tradition kronski told the crowd but who will defend which unlucky member will draw the black ball who will it be kronski nodded at the mâitre d bring the bag like many ancient organizations the extinctionists were bound by tradition and one of these traditions was that the creature on trial could be defended by any member of the assembly and if no member were willing one would be chosen by lottery a bag of white balls with one black the spherical equivalent of the short straw no need for the bag said a voice i will defend the creature heads turned to locate the speaker it was a slender young man with a goatee and piercing blue eyes he was wearing tinted glasses and a lightweight linen suit kronski had noticed him earlier but could not put a name to the face which disturbed him and you are he asked while swivelling his laptop so that the builtin camera was aimed at this stranger the young man smiled why dont we give your identification software a moment to whisper the answer to you kronski thumbed enter the computer captured an image and five seconds later plucked membership details from the extinctionists file malachy pasteur young frenchirish heir to an abattoir empire made a sizeable donation to the extinctionists coffers his first conference like all the attendees pasteur was thoroughly vetted before his invitation was issued a valuable addition to the ranks kronski was all charm master pasteur we are delighted to welcome you to morocco but tell me why would you wish to defend this creature her fate is almost certainly sealed the young man walked briskly to the podium i enjoy a challenge it is a mental exercise defending vermin is an exercise especially vermin retorted pasteur lifting the lid on his laptop it is easy to defend a servile useful animal like the common cow but this this will be a hardfought battle a pity to be crushed in battle so young said kronski his lower lip hanging with mock sympathy pasteur drummed his fingers on the podium i have always liked your style doctor kronski your commitment to the ideals of extinctionism for years i have followed your career since i was a boy in dublin in fact lately however i feel that the organization has lost its way and i am not the only one with this notion kronski ground his teeth so that was it a naked challenge to his leadership be careful what you say pasteur you tread on dangerous ground pasteur glanced at the floor below him where ice water still sloshed in the pit beneath you mean i could sleep with the fishes you would kill me doctor a mere boy i dont think that would bolster your credibility much hes right fumed kronski i cant kill him i must win this trial the doctor forced his mouth to smile i dont kill humans he said just animals like the animal in this cage kronskis many supporters applauded but that still left many silent i was wrong to come here kronski realized it is too remote nowhere for private jets to land next year i will find somewhere in europe i will announce the move as soon as i crush this whelp allow me to explain the rules continued kronski thinking explaining the rules puts me in charge giving me the upper hand psychologically speaking no need said pasteur brusquely i have read several transcripts the prosecutor puts his case the defender puts his case a few minutes of lively debate then each table votes simple can we please proceed doctor no one here appreciates their time being wasted clever young man putting yourself on the same side as the jury no matter i know these people and they will never acquit a beast no matter how pretty she is very well we shall proceed he selected a document on his desktop his opening statement kronski knew it by heart but it was comforting to have the words easily accessible people say that we extinctionists hate animals began kronski but this is not the case we do not hate poor dumb animals rather we love humans we love humans and will do whatever it takes to ensure that we as a race survive for as long as possible this planet has limited resources and i for one say we should hoard them for ourselves why should humans starve when dumb animals grow fat why should humans freeze when beasts lie toasty warm in their coats of fur malachy pasteur made a noise somewhere between a cough and a chuckle really doctor kronski i have read several variations on this speech every year it seems you trot out the same simplistic arguments can we please focus on the creature before us tonight a tittering ripple spread among the banquet guests and kronski had to struggle to contain his temper it seemed he had a battle on his hands very well then most amusing boy i was going to take it easy on you but now the gloves are off we are delighted to hear it we we pasteur was swinging the extinctionists his way without them even knowing it kronski summoned every last drop of charisma from inside himself flashing back to his youth to those long summer days spent watching his evangelist daddy whip up the crowds inside a canvas tent he raised his arms high each finger bent back until the tendons strained this is not what we are about people he thundered we did not travel all this way for some petty verbal sparring this is what the extinctionists are about kronski pointed a rigid finger at holly ridding our planet of creatures like this kronski shot a sideways glance at pasteur who was leaning chin on hands a bemused look on his face standard opposition behaviour we have a new species here friends a dangerous species it can make itself invisible it can hypnotize through speech it was armed and to much oohing from the crowd kronski drew forth hollys neutrino handgun from his pocket do any of us wish to face a future where this could be pointed in our faces do we the answer i think is clearly no now im not going to pretend that this is the last one of its kind i feel certain that there are thousands of these fairies or aliens or whatever all around us but does that mean we should grovel and release this little creature i say no i say we send a message execute one and the rest will know we mean business the governments of the world despise us now but tomorrow they will come banging down our door for guidance time for the big finish we are extinctionists and our time is now it was a good speech and drew wave after wave of applause which pasteur rode out with the same bemused expression kronski accepted the applause with a boxers rolling of the shoulders then nodded towards the opposite podium the floor is yours boy pasteur straightened and cleared his throat artemis straightened and cleared his throat the fake beard glued to his chin itched like crazy but he resisted the impulse to scratch it in a fair arena he would destroy kronskis arguments in about five seconds but this was not a fair arena or even a sane one these people were bloodthirsty jaded billionaires using their money to buy illicit excitement murder was just another service that could be purchased he needed to handle this crowd carefully push the right buttons first of all he had to establish himself as one of them when i was young and the family wintered in south africa my grandfather would tell me stories of a time when people had the right attitude towards animals we kill em when it suits us he said to me when it serves our purposes this is what the extinctionists used to be about a species was not protected unless we humans benefited from its survival we kill when it benefits us if an animal is using the planets resources and not directly contributing to our health safety and comfort we wipe it out simple as that this was an ideal worth fighting for worth killing for but this artemis pointed at the pit below him and holly in her cage this is a circus this is an insult to the memory of our ancestors who gave their time and gold to the extinctionists cause artemis worked hard on his eye contact connecting with as many people as possible in the audience lingering for a moment with everyone we have an opportunity to learn from this creature we owe it to our predecessors to find out if she can contribute to our coffers if this is in reality a fairy then who knows what magic it possesses magic that could be yours if we kill this fairy we will never know what unimaginable wealth dies with it artemis bowed he had made his point it would not be enough to sway the bloodthirsty extinctionists he knew but it might be enough to make kronski feel a little less cocky the doctor was waving his hands before the echo of artemiss voice faded how many times must we listen to this argument he wondered master pasteur accuses me of repeating myself while he repeats the tired argument of every defence counsel we have ever listened to kronski tapped his lips in horror ooh let us not kill the creature for it is potentially the source of all our power and wealth i remember spending a fortune on a sea slug that was supposed to cure arthritis all we got was very expensive goo this is all supposition but this creature is magical objected artemis banging the podium with a fist we have all heard how she can turn invisible even now her mouth is taped so she cannot hypnotize us imagine the power we could wield if we were to unlock the secrets of these gifts if nothing else they would better prepare us to deal with the rest of her kind kronskis main problem was that he agreed with much of his oppositions argument it made perfect sense to save the creature and tease her secrets from her but he could not afford to lose this argument if he did he might as well hand over the leadership we have tried to interrogate her our best men tried and she told us nothing it is difficult to talk with a taped mouth artemis noted drily kronski drew himself to his full height lowering the timbre of his voice for effect the human race faces its most deadly enemy and you want to cosy up to it that is not how we extinctionists do things if there is a threat we wipe it out that is how it has always been this brought a roar of approval from the crowd bloodlust trumping logic every time several members were on their feet hollering they had had enough of argument and wanted some action kronskis face was flushed with victory he thinks its over thought artemis poor man and then this beard really itches he waited calmly until the furore had trailed away then came out from behind the podium i was hoping to spare you this doctor he said because i respect you so much kronski flapped his lips spare me what master pasteur you know what i think you have pulled the wool over everyones eyes long enough kronski was not in the least worried the boy was beaten and everything else was was just irritating chatter still why not let pasteur dig a hole for himself and what wool would that be are you certain you want me to continue kronskis teeth glittered when he smiled oh absolutely certain as you wish said artemis approaching the dock this creature was not our original defendant up until yesterday we had a lemur not quite a monkey mister kirkenhazard but close enough i say we had a lemur but in truth we almost had a lemur it went missing at the pickup then and this is important then we were sold this creature by the same boy who almost sold us the lemur undoubtedly paid for from extinctionists funds does anyone else think this is a little off i do this boy keeps his lemur and sells us a supposed fairy kronski was not so cocky now this pasteur fellow had a lot of information supposed fairy thats right supposed we have only your word for it and of course that of mister kirkenhazard who apparently is your worst enemy nobody is falling for that ruse i assure you examine the thing yourself blurted kronski glossing over the kirkenhazard accusation this is an easy argument to win thank you doctor said artemis i believe i shall artemis approached the cage this was the tricky part as it required sleight of hand and coordination which were the elements in every plan that he usually left to butler his pocket bulged slightly with a couple of adhesive nuskin bandages taken from mulchs medikit he had told the security guard they were nicotine patches and so he had been allowed bring them through to the banquet the bandages adhesive was activated by skin contact and they moulded themselves to the contours they were applied to assuming the colour and texture of the surrounding skin artemiss fingers hovered over his pocket but it was not yet time to touch a bandage it would simply stick to his own hand instead he reached into his other pocket for the phone he had stolen from the bentley back at rathdown park this phone is invaluable to me he told the extinctionists its a little bulkier than other phones but that is because i have been installing addons for years it is an amazing thing really i can stream television watch movies check my stocks all the standard stuff but i also have an xray camera and display just give me a second artemis pressed a few buttons linking the phone by bluetooth to the laptops and from there to the largeview screen ah here we are artemis said passing the phone in front of his hand on screen an arrangement of phalanges metacarpals and carpals stood out darkly inside a pale foam of flesh you see the bones of my hand quite clearly this is a very good projection system you have doctor kronski i congratulate you kronskis smile was as fake as the congratulations had been do you have a point pasteur or are you just showing us how clever you are oh i have a point doctor and the point is that were it not for the wideness of the brow and the pointed ears this creature would seem remarkably like a little girl kronski snorted a pity about the ears and brow but for them you would have an argument precisely said artemis and passed the phone before hollys face on screen he played a short movie file he had constructed back in the shuttle it showed hollys skull with dark dense shapes on temples and ears implants crowed artemis clearly the result of surgery this fairy is a clever fake you have tried to dupe us kronski kronskis denials were lost in the roar of the crowd the extinctionists surged to their feet decrying this despicable conjob you lied to me damon shouted tommy kirkenhazard with something like anguish to me put him in the pit called contessa irina kostovich her face as feral as that of the honshu wolf on her shoulder make kronski extinct he deserves it for dragging us here kronski upped the volume on his podium mike this is ridiculous if you have been tricked then so have i no i will not believe it this boy this pasteur is lying my fairy is real just give me a chance to prove it i have not finished doctor cried artemis stepping boldly to the dock in both hands he held a nuskin patch slipped into his palms during the confusion he could feel pinpricks of heat on his flesh as the adhesive was activated he had to act quickly or his plans would be reduced to two fleshcoloured pads on his own hands these ears do not seem right to me and your friend mister kirkenhazard was most gentle with them artemis scrunched one nuskin patch into a rough cone sealing the adhesive on itself he thrust the other hand through the bars and make a great show of tugging on the tip while in reality spreading the second bandage over hollys ear covering the entire tip and most of the auricle its coming away he grunted making sure to mask the cages camera with his forearm i have it seconds later the bandage was dry and one of hollys ears was totally obscured artemis looked her in the eye and winked play along the wink said i will get you out of this at least artemis hoped this was what his wink communicated and not something like any chance of another kiss later back to business its a fake called artemis holding high the crumpled fleshcoloured bandage it came off in my hand holly obligingly presented her profile to the web cam no more pointed ear outrage was the dominant reaction from the extinctionists kronski had tricked them all or even worse he had been bamboozled by a boy artemis held the supposed fake ear aloft squeezing it as though he were strangling a poisonous snake is this the man we want to lead us has doctor kronski displayed sound judgement in this case artemis threw the ear to the ground and supposedly this creature can hypnotize us all i rather think her mouth is covered so she cannot speak with one sharp movement he ripped the tape from hollys mouth she winced and shot artemis a dour glare but then quickly dissolved into tears playing the part of human victim to perfection i didnt want to do it she sobbed do what artemis prompted doctor kronski took me from the orphanage artemis raised an eyebrow the orphanage holly was adlibbing he told me if i had the implants then i could live in america after the operation i changed my mind but the doctor wouldnt let me go an orphanage said artemis why thats bordering on the unbelievable hollys chin dropped he said hed kill me if i told artemis was outraged he said hed kill you and this is the man steering our organization a man who hunts humans as well as animals he pointed an accusing finger at a bewildered kronski you sir are worse than the creatures we all despise and i demand you release this poor girl kronski was finished and he knew it but something could still be salvaged from this mess he still had the groups account numbers and he was the only one with the combination to the compound safe he could be out of this place in two hours with enough riches to last a few years all he had to do was somehow stop this pasteur boy hamming it up and then he remembered ham and what about this he shouted brandishing hollys gun i suppose this is fake too the extinctionists drew back cowering behind their seats absolutely sneered artemis a childs toy nothing more would you stake your life on it artemis appeared to hesitate nno need for dramatics doctor your cause is lost accept it no snapped kronski if the gun is real then the creature is real and if she is not real as you insist then you have nothing to fear artemis summoned his courage very well do your worst he stood squarely before the tiny needle barrel offering his chest you are about to die pasteur said kronski without much sympathy perhaps i would be if you could squeeze your chubby finger into the trigger guard said artemis almost as if he were goading the doctor into action to hell with you then barked kronski and pulled the trigger nothing much happened a spark and a slight hum from the inner workings its broken gasped the doctor you dont say said artemis who had remotedestructed the neutrinos charge pack from the shuttle kronski raised his palms ok boy ok give me a moment to think just let the girl go doctor save a shred of dignity we dont execute humans i am in charge here i just need a second to gather myself this wasnt supposed to happen this is not how she said it would go the doctor rested his elbows on the lectern rubbing his eyes beneath the round tinted spectacles how she said it would go thought artemis were there unseen forces at work here while artemis was puzzling and kronskis world collapsed around his ample shoulders mobile phones began to ring in the banqueting hall a lot of people were receiving messages all of a sudden in moments the room rang with a discordant symphony of beeps brrrs and polyphonic tunes kronski ignored this strange development but artemis was anxious he had things under control now and did not need anything to redress the scales or for that matter tip kronski over the edge the reactions to the incoming messages were a mixture of shock and glee oh my god is this true is it real play it again turn up the volume i dont believe this kronski you fool thats the last straw we are a joke the extinctionists are finished artemis realized that all these messages were in fact the same message someone had an extinctionists database and was sending them all a video artemiss own phone trilled gently of course it would he had put his fake identity on every extinctionist database he could find and as his phone was still linked to the giant screen the video mail began to play automatically artemis recognized the scene immediately the leather souq and the main player was kronski standing on one leg squealing with a highpitched rupturedballoon intensity comical was not the word for it ridiculous farcical and pathetic were words that came close one thing was certain having seen the video no one in their right mind could respect this man ever again much less follow his lead while the video played a short message scrolled below the picture here we see doctor damon kronski the president of the extinctionists displaying surprising balance for a man his size this reporter has learned that kronski turned against animals when he was mauled by an escaped koala at one of his politician fathers rallies in cleveland witnesses to the mauling say that young damon squealed so sharp he coulda cut glass a talent the good doctor does not seem to have lost squeal baby squeal artemis sighed i did this he realized its just the kind of thing i would do at another time he would have appreciated this touch but not now not when he was so close to freeing holly speaking of holly artemis get me out of here she hissed yes of course time to go artemis rifled his pockets for a handy wipe inside the wipe were three long coarse hairs donated by mulch diggums dwarf hairs are actually antennae that dwarfs use to navigate in dark tunnels and have been adapted by the resourceful race to serve as skeleton keys no doubt hollys omnitool would have been handier but artemis could not risk losing that to security the wipe had kept the hairs moist and pliable until they were needed artemis removed the first hair blew a speck of moisture from its tip and inserted it into the cage lock working it through the cogs as soon as he felt the hair harden in his fingers he turned the makeshift key and the door sprang open thank you mulch he whispered then went to work on hollys centrally locked cuffs the third hair would not even be needed in seconds holly was free and rubbing her wrists orphanage said artemis you dont think that was overdoing it boo hoo said holly briskly lets just get back to the shuttle it was not to be that straightforward kronski was being herded into a corner by a group of extinctionists they harangued and even prodded and poked the doctor ignoring his arguments while overhead the video message played again and again oops thought artemis closing his phone inevitably perhaps kronski cracked he batted his tormentors aside like bowling pins clearing a circle of breathing space for himself then panting he pulled a walkietalkie from its clip on his belt secure the area he wheezed into the device use all necessary force even though the domaine des hommes security guards were technically working for the extinctionists their loyalties lay with the man who paid their salaries that man was damon kronski he might dress like a demented peacock and have the manners of a desert dog but he knew the combination to the safe and paid the wages on time the sharpshooters on the upper terrace sent a few warning shots over the crowds head which caused utter pandemonium lock the building down said kronski into the walkietalkie i need time to gather my funds ten thousand dollars in cash for every man who stands by me there was no need for further incentive ten thousand dollars was two years wages to these men doors and shutters were slammed down and manned by burly guards each one brandishing a rifle or a custommade moroccan nimcha sword with rhino grip that kronski had had made for the security team the spooked extinctionists bolted towards bathrooms or alcoves anywhere that might have a window they frantically punched numbers into their phones screaming for help from anyone anywhere a few were more resourceful tommy kirkenhazard pulled out a ceramic handgun he had smuggled in under his hat and took a few potshots at the upper terrace from behind a heavy teak bar he was answered by a volley from above with shattered bottles mirrors and glasses sending slivers flying like arrowheads with a straight fingered jab to the solar plexus a tall asian man quickly disarmed a door guard this way he called flinging the fire door wide the portal was quickly jammed with extinctionist torsos artemis and holly sheltered behind the cage watching for a way out can you shield holly twisted her chin and one arm rippled out of sight im low on juice i have just about enough for a minute or two ive been saving it artemis scowled you are always low on juice didnt number one fill you up with his signature magic maybe if your bodyguard hadnt plugged me with a dart twice maybe if i hadnt had to heal you at rathdown park and maybe if i hadnt been shielding in the souq trying to find your monkey lemur said artemis at least we saved jayjay holly ducked as a hail of glass shot over her head my goodness artemis you sound like you actually care about an animal nice beard by the way thank you now do you think you could shield for long enough to disarm those two guards on the kitchen door behind us holly sized the two men up both had shotguns and were radiating enough malevolence to ripple the air shouldnt be a problem good do it quietly we dont want another bottleneck if we do get separated lets meet somewhere close at the souq ok said holly vibrating into invisibility a second later artemis felt a hand on his shoulder and heard a disembodied voice in his ear you came for me whispered holly thank you then the hand was gone all magic has a price when fairies shield they sacrifice fine motor skills and clear thought it is infinitely more difficult to do a jigsaw when your body is vibrating faster than a hummingbirds wings even if your brain could stop rattling for long enough to focus on the puzzle in the lep academy holly had picked up a tip from an atlantean gym coach it really helped to beat the shieldshakes if you sucked your lower abdominals in and up strengthening your core it gave you something to focus on and held your torso a little tighter holly practised the exercise as she crossed the banquet floor towards the kitchen when a frantic butterknifewielding extinctionist missed her by a shade she thought that sometimes being invisible was more dangerous than being in plain sight the two guards on the door were actually growling at anyone who ventured too close they were big even for humans and holly was glad that no fine motor skill would be called for two quick jabs into the nerve cluster above the knee should be plenty to bring these guys down simple thought holly then i shouldnt have thought that whenever you think that something goes wrong of course she was dead right someone started firing on kronskis guards silver darts streaked through the air then punctured skin with a sickening thunk holly knew instinctively who the shooter was then her suspicions were confirmed when she spotted a familiar silhouette anchored in the roof beams butler the bodyguard was draped in a desert blanket but holly identified him from the shape of his head and also from his unmistakable shooting position left elbow cocked out a little more than most marksmen preferred young artemis sent him back to clear a path for us she realized or maybe butler made the decision himself whichever it was butler was not helping as much as he hoped with the guards dropping at the fire exit the extinctionists were piling over their fallen captors desperate to be free of this building caged extinctionists thought holly im sure artemis appreciates that irony just as holly drew back her fists the two guards at the kitchen door clutched their necks and pitched forward unconscious before they hit the floor nice shooting two shots in under a second from eighty metres out with darts too which are about as accurate as wet sponges she was not the only one to notice the unguarded door a dozen hysterical extinctionists rushed the portal screaming like rockband fans we need to exit this building now holly turned towards artemis but he was lost in a clump of advancing extinctionists he must be somewhere in there she thought then she was pinned by the mob borne aloft and into the kitchen artemis she called completely forgetting that she was still invisible artemis but he was nowhere to be seen the world was a melee of elbows and torsos sweat and screams voices were in her ears and ragged breath on her face and by the time she had disentangled herself from the pack the banquet hall was virtually deserted a few stragglers but no artemis the souq she thought i will find him in the souq artemis tensed himself to run as soon as holly took the guards out of commission he would sprint as fast as he could and pray that he didnt trip and fall imagine to endure all of this only to be defeated by a lack of coordination butler would be sure to say i told you so when they met in the afterlife suddenly the pandemonium level jumped a few notches and the screaming of the extinctionists reminded artemis of rathdown parks panicked animals caged extinctionists he thought oh the irony the kitchendoor guards fell clutching their throats nice work captain artemis bent low like a sprinter waiting for the gun then catapulted himself from his hiding place behind the dock kronski hit him broadside with his full weight tumbling them both through the railings into the dock artemis landed heavily on the baby chair and it collapsed underneath him one of its arms raking along his side this is all your fault squealed kronski this was supposed to be the best night of my life artemis felt himself being smothered his mouth and nose were jammed by sweatsoaked purple material he intends to kill me thought artemis i have pushed him too far there was no time for planning and even if there were time this was not one of those situations where a handy mathematical theorem could be found to get artemis out of his predicament there was only only one thing to do lash out so artemis kicked punched and gouged he buried his knee in kronskis ample stomach and blinded him with his fists all very superficial blows which had little lasting effect except one artemiss right heel brushed against kronski chest kronski didnt even feel it but the heel connected briefly with the oversized button on the remote control in the doctors pocket releasing the dock trapdoor the second his brain registered the loss of back support artemis knew what had happened i am dead he realized sorry mother artemis fell bodily into the pit breaking the laser beam with his elbow there was a beep and half a second later the pit was filled with bluewhite flame that blasted black scorch marks in the walls nothing could have survived kronski braced himself against the dock rails perspiration dripping from the tip of his nose into the pit evaporating on the way down do i feel bad about what just happened he asked himself aware that psychologists recommended facing trauma headon in order to avoid stress in later life no he found i dont in fact i feel as though a weight has been lifted from my shoulders kronski raised himself up with a great creaking and cracking of knees now wheres the other one he wondered i still have some weight to lose artemis saw the flames blossom around him he saw his skin glow blue with their light and heard their raw roar then he was through unscathed impossible obviously not obviously these flames had more bark about them than bite holograms the pit floor yielded beneath his weight with a hiss of pneumatics and artemis found himself in a subchamber looking up at heavy steel doors swinging closed above him the view from inside a swingtop bin a very hightech swingtop bin with expanding gel hinges fairy design without a doubt artemis remembered something kronski had said earlier this is not how she said it would go she she fairy design endangered species what fairy had been harvesting lemur brain fluid even before the spelltropy epidemic artemis paled not her please not her what do i have to do he thought how many times must i save the world from this lunatic he scrambled to his knees and saw he had been funnelled on to a padded pallet before he could roll off octobonds sprang from recessed apertures along the pallets steel rim trussing him tighter than a tumbled rodeo cow purple gas hissed from a dozen overhead nozzles shrouding the pallet hold your breath artemis told himself animals dont know to hold their breaths he held on until it felt as though his sternum would split and then just as he was about to exhale and suck in a huge breath a second gas was pumped into the chamber crystallizing the first it fell on to artemiss face like purple snowflakes you are asleep now play possum a small door sank smoothly into the floor with a sound like air being blown through a straw artemis peeked through one halfclosed eye magnetic field he thought dully a band of steel creasing his forehead i know what i will see but i have no wish to see it a pixie stood framed in the doorway her tiny beautiful features twisted with their customary pouting cruelty this squealed opal koboi pointing a vibrating finger is not a lemur chapter the hairy one is dead the leather souq butler jogged from the extinctionists compound to the leather souq artemis was waiting in the building in which they had planned the previous days exchange police presence in fez amounted to no more than a couple of twoman patrols and so it was easy for someone of butlers experience to sneak around without being detected though it was hardly illegal to visit a medina it was certainly frowned on to stroll around a tourist area with a large rifle strapped to ones back butler ducked into a dark corner and quickly broke down his dart rifle into almost a dozen parts slotting them into various rubbish tips it was possible that he could slip the fez saïss airport customs men some baksheesh and simply stow the weapon under his seat but these days it was better to be safe than sorry tenyearold artemis was sitting at a prearranged spot in one of the sniper windows picking nonexistent lint from his jacket sleeve which was his version of nervous pacing well he asked steeling himself for the answer the female got out said butler he thought it better not to mention that the longhaired male had had everything under control until artemiss video arrived artemis caught the implication the female the other one was there too butler nodded the hairy one is dead he attempted a rescue and it didnt work out artemis gasped dead he said dead repeating the word wont change its meaning said butler sharply he tried to rescue his friend and kronski killed him for it but whats done is done eh and at least we have our diamonds butler checked his temper we should move out for the airport i need to run the preflight checks artemis was left stunned and silent unable to take his eyes from the bag of diamonds that winked accusingly from their slouched perch on his lap holly was not having any luck her shield was so weak that she switched it off to save her last spark for a small healing if it was needed and no sooner had her image solidified than one of kronskis goons spotted her and walkietalkied his entire squad now she was running for her life through the medina praying that artemis was at the meeting point and that he had thought to bring the scooter no one was taking potshots at her which was encouraging unless kronski wanted to do the potshotting himself no time to think about that now survival was the priority the medina was quiet this late in the evening with only a few straggling tourists and diehard merchants still walking the streets holly dodged between them pulling down whatever she could reach to get in the way of the stampede of security men behind her she tugged over towers of baskets upended a kebab stand and shouldered a table of spices dashing a white wall with multicoloured arcs the thunder of footsteps behind her did not recede in the least her tactics were not working the security guards were simply too large and were bustling past the obstacles dodge and weave then lose them in the alleyways this tactic was no more succesful than the last her pursuers were familiar with the medinas layout and coordinated their pursuit on handheld radios herding holly towards the leather souq where ill be in the open an easy target holly raced on artemiss loafers cutting into her heels a series of cries and curses arose behind her as she barged without apology through bands of tourists and shoulderslammed tea boys sending trays flying i am corralled she thought desperately youd better be waiting artemis it occurred to holly then that she was leading the posse directly to artemis but there was no other option if he were waiting then he could help if not then she was her own anyway she jinked left but four huffing guards blocked the alleyway all hefting vicious longbladed knives the other way i think right then holly skidded into the leather souq heels throwing up dust fans where are you artemis she cast her gaze upwards towards their observation point but there was nothing there not even the telltale shimmer of a hide hes not here she felt panic scratch at her heart holly short was an excellent field officer but she was way out of her jurisdiction her league and her time the leather souq was quiet now with only a few workers scraping skins on the surrounding rooftops lanterns crackled below the roofline and the giant urns lurked like alien pods the smell was just as bad as it had been the previous day possibly worse as the vats had had longer to cook the stench of droppings hit holly like a soft feverish glove further addling her mind keep running find a nook holly spent half a moment considering which body part she would trade for a weapon then sprinted for a doorway in the adjacent wall a guard appeared dragging his knife from his sheath the blade was red maybe blood maybe rust holly switched direction losing a shoe in the turn there was a window one floor up but the wall was cracked she could make the climb two more guards grinning one held a net like a gladiator holly slid to a halt were in the desert why does he have a fishing net she tried again an alleyway barely broad enough for an adult human she was almost there when a fat guard with a ponytail to his waist and a mouthful of yellowed teeth wedged himself into the avenue blocking it trapped trapped no escape and not enough magic to shield not even enough to mesmerize it was difficult to stay calm in spite of all her training and experience holly could feel her animal instincts bubble in the pit of her stomach survive do what you have to do but what could she do one unarmed childsized fairy against a squadron of armed muscle they formed a ragged circle around her weaving between the urns in a slowmotion slalom every set of greedy glittering eyes focused on her face closer and closer they came spreading their arms wide in case their prey made a dart for freedom holly could see their scars and pockmarks see the desert in their nails and on their cuffs smell their breath and count their fillings she cast her eyes towards the heavens help she cried and it began to rain diamonds below the extinctionists compound that is not a lemur repeated opal koboi drumming a tiny toe on the floor i know it is not a lemur because it has no tail and it seems to be wearing clothes this is a human mervall a mud boy a second pixie appeared in the doorway mervall brill one of the infamous brill brothers who would break opal out of her padded psych cell some years later his expression was a mixture of puzzlement and terror not pretty on any face i dont understand it miss koboi he said twiddling the top button on his crimson lab coat it was all set up for the lemur you mesmerized kronski yourself opals nostrils flared are you suggesting this is somehow my fault she clutched her throat as if the very idea caused her breath to fail no no no said mervall hurriedly it could not be miss kobois fault miss koboi is after all perfection itself perfection does not make mistakes this outrageous statement would be recognized as blatant toadying by rightminded people but opal koboi found it fair and rational exactly well said mervall a pity your brother does not have a tenth of your wisdom mervall smiled and shuddered the smile was in acceptance of the compliment the wince was because the mention of his twin had reminded him that his brother was at this moment locked in a cage with a red river hog as punishment for not complimenting opal on her new boots miss koboi was having a bad day currently two out of seven were bad if things got any worse even though the wages were astronomical the brill brothers might be forced to seek alternative employment mervall decided to distract his boss theyre going crazy up there firing weapons duelling with cutlery those extinctionists are an unstable lot opal leaned over artemis sniffing gently wiggling her fingers to see if the human was awake the lemur was the last one i was this close to being allpowerful how close asked mervall opal squinted at him are you being funny no i sincerely wondered its an expression snapped the pixie striding back towards the main chamber mervall nodded slowly an expression i see what should i do with the human opal did not break her stride oh you might as well harvest him human brain fluid is a good moisturizer then we pack up and find that lemur ourselves should i dump his drained corpse in the animal pit opal threw up her arms oh for heavens sake must i tell you how to do everything cant you show a little initiative mervall wheeled the pallet after his boss the animal pit it is then he thought the leather souq diamonds rained down in glittering showers falling stars twinkling in the lamp light young artemiss fee holly realized he is throwing me a lifeline for a moment the guards were transfixed their faces wore the dazed expression of children who have woken and are surprised to find themselves in a good mood they stretched out their fingers watching the diamonds bounce and tumble then one broke the spell des diamants he cried hearing the word spoken aloud galvanized his companions they dropped to their knees patting the dusky ground for the precious stones more dived into the pungent vats as they registered tiny plops made by stones impacting on liquid mayhem thought holly perfect she glanced upwards just in time to see a small hand withdraw into the black rectangle of a window what made him do it she wondered that was a most unartemislike gesture a guard diving past her leg reminded her that things were still pretty dire in their greed they have forgotten me but perhaps they will remember their duty when the stones are pocketed holly spared a moment to salute up at young artemiss window then raced out of his view towards the nearest alley only to be flattened by a puffing damon kronski two for two he huffed i got both of you this must be my lucky day when will this end thought holly incredulously how can these things continue to happen kronski pressed down on her like an enraged elephant frown lines framing his tinted glasses sweat flowing in sheets down his face dripping from his pouting lip except this is not my lucky day is it he shouted a keen note of hysteria on the edge of his tones you saw to that you and your accomplice well my gas chamber took care of him now i will take care of you holly was stunned artemis dead she would not believe it never how many people had written artemis fowl off and lived to regret it plenty she was one of them holly on the other hand was proving easier to kill her vision was blurring her limbs were treading water and the weight of the world was on her chest the only sense firing on all cylinders was her sense of smell what a way to go inhaling motes of pigeon dropping with your last breath she heard her ribs groan i wish kronski could smell this an idea sparked in her brain the last ember in a dying grate why shouldnt he smell it its the least i can do holly reached deep into her core of magic searching for that last spell there was a flicker deep inside not enough to shield or even mesmerize but perhaps a minor healing usually healing spells were used on recent wounds but kronskis anosmia was a lifelong ailment fixing it now could be dangerous and would almost certainly be painful oh well thought holly if it hurts him it hurts him she reached up a hand past the forearm on her throat inching it along kronskis face willing the magic into her fingertips kronski did not feel threatened whats this are you playing got your nose holly did not answer instead she closed her eyes jammed two fingers up kronskis nostrils and sent her last sparks of magic down those channels heal she said a wish and a prayer kronski was surprised but not initially upset hey what the he said then sneezed the sneeze was powerful enough to pop his ears and roll him off his captive what are you five years old sticking fingers up my nose another sneeze bigger this time blowing a trumpet of steam from each nostril this is pathetic you people are really a third sneeze this one traumatizing the entire body tears streamed down kronskis face his legs jittered and his glasses shattered in their frames oh my said kronski when he had his limbs under control somethings different something has changed then the smell hit him aarrgh said kronski and began to squeal his tendons tightened his toes pointed and his fingers ripped holes in the air wow said holly massaging her throat this was a stronger reaction than expected the smell was bad but kronski acted like he was dying what holly had not fully grasped was the power of the doctors awakened sense of smell imagine the joy of seeing for the first time or the euphoria of a first step then square that feeling and make it negative take a ball of poison dip it in thorns and manure wrap it in a poultice of festering bandages boil the whole lot in a cauldron of unspeakably vile excretions and shove it up your nose this is what kronski could smell and it was driving him out of his mind he lay flat on his back flinching and pawing the sky foul he said repeating the word over and over foul foul fowl fowl holly crawled to her knees coughing and spitting on to the dry sand her entire being felt battered and bruised from back to spirit she looked at kronskis expression and realized that there was no point in asking him questions the president of the extinctionists was beyond logical conversation for the time being possibly for good she thought i dont see him leading any international organizations for a while holly noticed something one of kronskis lenses had completely shattered revealing the eyeball underneath the iris was a strange violet almost the same shade as the spectacles had been but this was not what caught hollys attention the edge of the retina was ragged as though it had been nibbled on by tiny sclera fish this man has been mesmerized holly realized a fairy is controlling him she climbed to her feet and hobbled oneshoed down the nearest alley the voices of squabbling greed fading behind her if a fairy is involved then nothing is as it seems and if nothing is as it seems then perhaps artemis fowl still lives below the extinctionists compound mervall brill winked at himself in the chrome door of a body freezer i am a handsome chap he thought and this lab coat covers the paunch rather well brill called opal from her office how is that brain fluid coming merv jumped just sucking him dry now miss koboi the pixie put his weight behind the trolley with its human cargo trundling it down a short corridor to the lab itself being stuck in this tiny facility with opal koboi was no picnic just the three of them for weeks on end draining the fluids from endangered species opal could afford to hire a thousand lab assistants to work for her but she was überparanoid about secrecy opals level of paranoia was such that she had begun to suspect plants and inanimate objects of spying on her i can grow cameras she had shrieked at the brill brothers during one briefing whos to say that despicable centaur foaly hasnt succeeded in splicing surveillance equipment to plants so get rid of all the flowers rocks too i dont trust them sullen little blëbers so the brill twins had spent an afternoon scouring the facility for anything that might contain a bug even the recycling toiletscent blocks had to go as opal was convinced they were photographing her when she used the facilities still though miss koboi is right to be paranoid merv admitted as he barged through the lab double doors if the lep ever found out what she was doing here they would lock her up forever and a day the double doors led to a long tripleheight laboratory it was a place of misery cages were stacked to the ceiling each one filled with a trapped animal they moaned and keened rattling their bars butting the doors a robot foodpellet dispensing machine whirred along the network spitting grey pellets into the appropriate cages the centre island was a series of operating pallets scores of animals lay sedated on the tables secured like artemis with rigid octobonds artemis caught sight of a siberian tiger paws in the air and bald patches shaved into its skull on each patch there sat what looked like a tiny slice of liver as they passed one of the slices made a squelching sound and a tiny lightemitting diode on its ridge flashed red merv stopped to peel it off and artemis saw to his horror that the things underside was spiked with a dozen dripping spines full to the brim mister super genetically modified leech mosquito thing you are a disgusting abomination yes you are but you sure know how to siphon brain fluid id say youre due a squeezing merv pumped a foot pedal to open a nearby fridge and fingertinkled the beakers inside until he found the right one here we go sibtig bf he placed the beaker on a chrome work surface then squeezed the leech like a sponge until it surrendered its bounty of brain fluid afterwards the leech was casually tossed into the trash love you lots said mervall returning to artemiss pallet miss you loads artemis saw everything through the slit of a closed eye this was a depraved horrible place and he had to get out of here holly will come for me he thought and then no she wont shell think im dead this realization chilled his blood i went into the flames he would have to save himself then it would not be the first time stay alert a chance will come and you must be ready to take it mervall found room on the operating section and parked artemis neatly in it and he squeezes it into an impossible space they said it couldnt be done they were wrong mervall brill is the king of trolley parking the pixie belched which is not the future i had in mind for myself as a younger pixie then somewhat moodily he trawled a lowlevel aquarium with a perforated jug until it was full of convulsing super leeches oh no thought artemis oh please and then he was forced to close his eyes as mervall turned to face him surely he will see my chest heaving he will sedate me and it will all be over but mervall apparently did not notice ooh i hate you guys disgusting i tell you something human if your subconscious can hear me be glad youre asleep because you do not want to go through this awake artemis almost cracked then but he thought of his mother with less than a day left to her and he kept silent he felt his left hand being tugged and heard mervall grunt stuck tight just a tick the grip loosened and artemis tracked mervalls movement with his ears and nose a brush of soft belly on his elbow breath blowing past his ear mervall was at his left shoulder reaching across artemis opened his right eye just enough and rolled his pupil into the slit there was a theatre light directly overhead craned in above the operating table on a thick flat chrome arm chrome reflective artemis watched mervalls actions in the surface the pixie tapped the octobonds touchsensitive control pad revealing a gnommish keyboard then singing a popular pixie pop song he tapped in his password one number with each beat of the chorus pixies rock hard he sang extreme pixie hard rock baby which seemed unlikely to artemis but he was glad of the song as it gave him time to file mervalls passcode mervall released one of the bonds allowing him to extend artemiss forearm even if the human did happen to wake up all he could do was flail now my little leech do your nasty work for aunt opal and i will reward you by squeezing your innards into a bucket he sighed why are all my best lines wasted on annelids then he plucked a leech from the jug pinched it to make the spines stick out and slapped it on to artemiss exposed wrist artemis felt nothing but an immediate sense of wellbeing im being sedated he realized an old troll trick cheer you up before you die its a good ploy and anyway how bad can dying be my life has been one trial after another mervall was checking his chronometer his brother had been in that recycling cage behind the galley for an awfully long time that red river hog might decide to have himself a bite of pixie meat ill just check he decided be back before the leech is full first blood then brain you should have complimented miss opals boots brother and off he toddled down the centre aisle plucking the mesh of each cage as he passed driving the animals wild pixies rock hard he sang extreme pixie hard rock baby artemis was finding it hard to motivate himself it felt so easy lying on the pallet just letting all his troubles run out of his arm when you decide to die artemis thought sluggishly it doesnt matter how many people want to kill you he did wish the animals would calm down their chattering and chirping were interfering with his mood there was even a parrot somewhere squawking a phrase whos your momma it asked over and over again whos your momma my momma is angeline shes dying artemiss eyes opened momma mother he lifted his free arm and bashed the unwelcome leech against one of the octobonds it exploded in a spatter of mucus and blood leaving half a dozen spines jutting from artemiss arms like the spears of tiny soldiers thats going to hurt eventually artemiss throat was dry his neck was twisted and his vision was impaired but even so it took him barely a minute to activate the keypad with mervalls code and retract the bonds if these are alarmed im in trouble but there was no klaxon no pixies came running i have time but not much he picked the spines from his skin wincing not from pain but from the sight of the redrimmed holes in his wrist a rivulet of blood ran from each wound but it was slow and watery he would not bleed to death coagulent in the spines of course artemis zombiewalked across the lab gradually straightening out the kinks there were hundreds of eyes on him the animals were silent now noses beaks or snouts pressed against the wire mesh waiting to see what would develop the only sound came from the foodpellet robot zipping through its routine all i need to do is escape no need for confrontation or saving the world leave opal be and run away but of course in the world of artemis fowl things are rarely straightforward artemis donned network goggles he found hanging from a low peg activated the vboard and used mervalls password to log on to the network he needed to know where he was and how to get out there were design plans to the entire facility stored on a desktop file no security no encryption why would there be it wasnt as if any of the humans above would wander down and even if they did humans could not read gnommish artemis studied the plans with care and growing anxiety the facility consisted of a series of interconnected modules housed in ancient tunnels beneath the extinctionists compound but there were only two ways out he could go out the way he had come in which was not ideal as it led straight back up to kronski or he could choose the shuttle port on the lower level which would mean stealing and piloting a shuttle his chances of overriding complicated theftprevention safeties before opal had him vaporized were minimal he would have to go up do you like my little laboratory said a voice artemis stared past the goggle display opal stood before him hands on hips quite a place isnt it she continued in english all these tunnels were just here waiting for us perfect as soon as i found them i knew i had to have them which is why i persuaded doctor kronski to move here information is power thought artemis dont give her any who are you he asked i am the future queen of this world at the very least you may refer to me as miss koboi for the next five minutes after that you may refer to me as aaaaarrrrgh hold your throat die screaming and so on as pompous as i remember i seem to be bigger than you miss koboi and as far as i can see you have no weapons opal laughed no weapons she cried spreading her arms these creatures have given me all the weapons i need she stroked the sleeping tiger this big kitty augments my mind control those sea slugs focus my energy beams a shot of liquidized dolphin fin mixed with just the right amount of cobra venom turns the clock back a hundred years this is a weapons factory breathed artemis exactly said opal gratified that someone finally understood thanks to these animals and their fluids i have become the most powerful magician since the demon warlocks the extinctionists have been rounding up the creatures i need fools tricked by a cheap blast of holographic flames as if i would kill these wonderful creatures before i drain their juices you humans are such idiots your governments spend their fortunes looking for power when all the time it is cavorting around your jungles thats quite a speech said artemis wiggling his fingers tapping the vboard that only he could see soon i will be dont tell me soon you will be invincible no actually said opal with admirable patience soon i will be able to manipulate time itself all i need is the and suddenly everything fell into place for artemis everything about this whole affair and he knew he would be able to escape the lemur all you need is the lemur opal clapped exactly you bright mud boy that wonderful lemur brain fluid is the last ingredient i need for my magic boosting formula artemis sighed magic boosting formula listen to yourself opal missed the mocking tone possibly because she didnt hear it a lot i had a whole bunch of lemurs before but the lep appropriated them to cure some plague and i lost the rest in a fire all my test subjects gone and their fluids are quite impossible to replicate there is one left and i need him he is my cloning model with that lemur i will control time itself opal stopped speaking for a moment tapping her bow lips with a finger wait a moment human what do you know of my lemur she took the finger away from her mouth and ignited a pulsing sphere of flame at its tip melting her nail varnish i asked you what do you know of my lemur nice boots said artemis then selected an option on the goggle screen with a flick of his finger are you sure you wish to open all the cages asked the computer the extinctionists were sneaking back into the compound led by the intrepid tommy kirkenhazard who brandished his empty pistol with decidedly more bravado than he felt i got stuff in that compound he repeatedly told the mass huddled behind him expensive stuff and i aint leaving it behind most of the rest had expensive stuff too and now that kronski was catatonic in the souq and his guards seemed to have fled with their sparkling booty this would appear to be the best time to reclaim their belongings and head for the airport much to kirkenhazards relief the compound seemed utterly deserted though the gelatinous group was spooked several times by night shadows jumping in the moroccan wind i aint never shot nothing with an empty gun he thought but i dont imagine its too effective they reached the door to the main hall which hung from the frame on a single hinge ok folks said kirkenhazard there aint no porters around to carry our stuff so you got to hump it yourselves oh my lord said contessa irina kostovich and swooned into the arms of a scottish oil baron gather whatever you can and we meet back here in fifteen minutes the contessa was muttering something what was that asked kirkenhazard she said she has a pedicure booked for the morning kirkenhazard held up a hand listening no not that does anyone else hear rumbling the animals charged through the open cage doors with savage glee hopping jumping flying and sliming lions leopards various monkeys parrots gazelles hundreds of creatures all with one idea in mind escape opal was not amused i cannot believe you did that mud person i will wring your brain out like a sponge artemis ducked his head low not caring at all for the brainsponge imagery if he avoided opals regal stare then she could not mesmerize him unless her augmented powers allowed her access to the brain without the conduit of the optic nerve even if he had not ducked he would have been shielded by the tide of creatures that engulfed him snapping buffeting and kicking this is ridiculous he thought as a monkeys elbow drove the air from his lungs if opal does not get me the animals will i need to direct this stampede artemis ducked behind one of the operating tables pulling out the tigers anaesthetic drip as he passed and squinted through the spokes of passing legs for an appropriate animal opal roared at the creatures in an amalgamation of their tongues it was a piercing sound and split the animal phalanx down the centre so that it flowed around her as the herd passed opal took potshots with pulsing blasts of energy that erupted from her fingers and scythed through entire rows of creatures knocking them senseless to the ground cages tumbled like building blocks refrigerators spewed their contents across the tiles my distraction is being chopped down thought artemis time for an exit he spied a set of hooves stomping towards him and steadied himself for a jump its a quagga he realized half horse half zebra and there hasnt been one in captivity for a hundred years not exactly a thoroughbred stallion but it will have to do the ride was a little rougher than artemis was acustomed to on the fowl arabians no steadying stirrups no creaking saddle no snapping reins not to mention the facts that the quagga was unbroken and scared out of its wits artemis patted its neck ludicrous he thought this entire affair a dead boy escaping on an extinct animal artemis grabbed tufts of the quaggas mane and tried to direct it towards the open doorway it bucked and kicked whipping its striped head round to nip at artemis with strong square teeth he dug in his heels and held on opal was busy protecting herself from a wave of animal vengeance some of the larger predators were not as cowed as their cousins and decided that the best way to remove the threat posed by opal koboi was to eat her the tiny pixie twirled like a demonic ballerina shooting blasts of magical energy that ballooned at her shoulders gathered force in roiling spheres at her elbows and shot forth with liquid pulsations artemis had never seen anything like it stricken animals simply froze in midair momentum utterly drained dropping to the ground like statues immobile but for their terrified rolling eyes she is powerful indeed i have never seen a force like this opal must never be allowed to capture jayjay opal was running out of magic her bolts fizzled out or spiralled off target like errant squibs she abandoned them and drew two pistols from her belt one was immediately batted from her hand by the tiger that had lumbered to join the fray but opal did not submit to hysteria she quickly thumbed the other gun to a broadspread setting and slashed the barrel from side to side as she fired releasing a fan of silver energy the tiger was the first to drop with a look on his face that said not again several more followed cut off in midscreech howl or hiss artemis hauled back on the quaggas spiked mane jumping it on to an operating table the beast snorted and complained but did as it was bid skittering the length of one table and leaping across to the next one opal loosed a shot in their direction but it was absorbed by a brace of condors the door was directly before them and artemis feared the quagga would falter but no it butted through to the corridor connecting the lab to the holographicflame chamber artemis quickly opened the control panel in his stolen network goggles and chose the ramp setting it took maddening moments for the platform to extend itself and for those seconds artemis rode the quagga round in circles to take its mind off dislodging the unwelcome rider on its back and to make them both a more difficult target if opal followed them through the corridor an eagle swooped by its feathers raking artemiss cheek a muskrat clambered along his torso hopping to the rising platform there was light above the sickly wavering beams of a faulty strip light but light nevertheless come on girl said artemis feeling very much the cowboy yeehaw the extinctionists gathered around tommy kirkenhazards raised finger listening intently as if the noise emanated from inside the finger ah i dont hear nothing admitted tommy i must have been dreaming after all its been a stressful night for humanlovers then the lodge burst open and the extinctionists were utterly engulfed in a sea of beasts kirkenhazard went down under a couple of chacma baboons vainly pulling the trigger on his empty gun and shouting over and over but we killed you darn it we killed you though there would be no fatalities in the compound that night eighteen people were hospitalized with bites skin burns broken bones and various infestations kirkenhazard fared the worst the baboons ate his gun and the hand holding it and then turned the unfortunate man over to a groggy tiger who found himself waking in a very bad mood not one of the extinctionists noticed a small dark craft rising silently from behind one of the chalets it flew across the central park and scooped up a longhaired youth from the back of what looked like a small stripy donkey the craft spun in a tight arc like a stone in a sling then hurtled into the night sky as though it had to be somewhere in a real hurry pedicures and indeed all spa treatments were cancelled for the next day opal was desolate to find that on top of everything else her boots were ruined what is that stain she demanded of mervall and his recently liberated twin descant dunno muttered descant who was still a bit moody from his time in the cage its a dropping of some kind volunteered mervall quickly judging from the size and texture i would say one of the big cats got a little nervous opal sat on a bench extending the boot pull it off mervall she placed her sole on mervalls forehead and pushed until he tumbled backwards clutching the droppingladen footwear that mud boy he knows about my lemur we must follow him he is tagged i take it oh yes confirmed mervall all the newcomers are sprayed on landing theres a radioactive tracer in his every pore right now harmless but theres nowhere on this planet that he can hide from us good excellent in fact i think of everything do i not you do miss koboi droned descant brilliant you are astounding is your fabulosity why thank you descant said opal as ever oblivious to sarcasm and i thought youd be upset after the pig pen fabulosity isnt a word by the way in case youre thinking of writing how wonderful i am in your diary point taken said descant seriously opal offered her other foot to mervall good now set the selfdestructs on this place and lets get the shuttle prepped i want to find this human and kill him immediately we were too nice last time with the leeches this time immediate death mervall winced he was holding two boots covered in tiger droppings and hed prefer to wear those than be in that humans shoes artemis lay flat on his back in the cargo hold wondering if he could possibly have dreamed the past few minutes superleeches sleeping tigers and a grumpy quagga he felt the floor vibrate beneath him and knew that they were moving at several times the speed of sound suddenly the vibration disappeared to be replaced by a far more sedate hum they were slowing down artemis hurried to the cockpit where holly was glaring at a readout as if she could change the information displayed there jayjay was in the copilots seat and seemed to be in charge of steering artemis pointed at the lemur this may seem like a silly question but is jayjay no autopilot and nice to see you alive by the way youre welcome for the rescue artemis touched her shoulder once again i owe you my life now i hate to move directly from gratitude to petulance but why have we slowed down time is running out we had three days remember there are only hours left holly tapped the readout we were pinged by something at the compound someones computers have downloaded our schematics can you tell me any more about that opal koboi said artemis opal is behind everything shes harvesting animal fluids to increase her own magic if she gets her hands on jayjay shell be invincible holly did not have time to be incredulous thats wonderful opal koboi i knew this little trip was missing a psychotic element if opal pinged us then shell be on our tail in something a little more warworthy than this clunker shields nothing much we might fool human radar but not fairy scanners what can we do i need to keep us up here in the airlanes with all the human traffic we stay subsonic and dont draw attention to ourselves then at the last moment we make a break for fowl manor it wont matter if opal sees us then because by the time she catches us well be back in the time stream mulch diggums poked his head through from the mail box nothing much in here a few gold coins what say i keep them and did i hear someone mention opal koboi dont worry about it everything is under control mulch guffawed under control like rathdown park was under control like the leather souq was under control youre not seeing us at our best artemis admitted but in time you will come to respect captain short and me mulchs expression doubted it id better go and look up respect in the dictionary because it mustnt mean what i think it means eh jayjay the lemur clapped his delicate hands and chattered with what sounded like laughter it looks like youve found an intellectual equal mulch said holly returning to her instruments its a pity he isnt a girl then you could marry him mulch imitated shock romance outside your species now thats disgusting what kind of weirdo would kiss someone when they werent even part of the same species artemis massaged his suddenly pounding temples its a long way to tipperary he thought and then a few more miles to dublin a shuttle said opal a fairy shuttle the koboi craft was hovering at an altitude of thirty miles tipping the border of space starlight winked on the hull of their mattblack shuttle and the earth hung below them wearing a stole of clouds thats what the sensors show said mervall an old mining model not much under the hood and zero firepower we should be able to catch it should said opal stretching an ankle to admire her new red boots why should well we had her for a while then she went subsonic i would guess their pilot is riding the human flight lanes until they feel safe opal smiled devilishly she liked a challenge ok lets give ourselves every advantage we have the speed and we have the weapons all we need is to point ourselves in the right direction what an incrediferous idea smirked descant opal was pained please descant use short words dont force me to vaporize you this was a hollow threat as opal had not been able to produce so much as a spark since the compound she still had the basics mind control levitation that kind of thing but she would need some serious bed rest before she could muster a lightning bolt the brills did not need to know that though heres my idea i ran the lab tapes through voice recognition and got a regional match whoever that mud boy is he lives in central ireland probably dublin i want you to get us down there as fast as you can descant and when that mining shuttle drops out of the air lanes opal closed her tiny fingers round an imaginary ant squeezing the blood from its body we will be waiting fabulicious said descant fowl manor the sun had risen and was sinking again by the time holly dragged the spluttering shuttle over the fowl estate wall were close to the deadline and this piece of junk is close to dead she said to artemis holly placed a hand on her heart i can feel number ones spark dying inside but theres still time artemis nodded the sight of the manor somehow made his mothers plight seem even more urgent i have to go home well done holly you did it set us down in the rear courtyard we can access the house by the kitchen door holly pressed a few buttons around the back it is scanning for alarms found two and a sneaky third motion sensors if im not mistaken only one alarm is being remotely monitored and the other two are selfcontained should i disable the remote alarm yes holly please disable the alarm anybody home holly checked the thermal imaging one warm body top floor artemis sighed relieved good just mother she will have taken her sleeping tablets by now little me cant be back yet holly set the shuttle down as gently as she could but the gears were stripped and the suspension bags were drained there were dents in the stabilizers and the gyroscope was spinning like a weathervane the landing gear stripped a channel of cobblestones from the courtyard surface tumbling them like bricks of turf before the plough artemis gathered jayjay in his arms are you ready for more adventures little man the lemurs round eyes were filled with anxiety and he looked to mulch for reassurance always remember said mulch tickling the creatures chin that you are the smart one the dwarf found an old duffel bag and began stuffing the remaining contents of the fridge inside no need for that said holly the ship is yours take it dig up your booty and fly far away dump this heap in the sea and live off your earnings for a few years just promise me that you wont sell to humans only the junk said mulch and did you say that i could keep the shuttle actually im asking you to scrap it youll be doing me a favour mulch grinned im a generous person i could do you a favour holly smiled back good and remember when we meet again none of this ever happened or it probably wont my lips are sealed artemis squeezed past him now theres something i would pay to see mulch diggums with his mouth closed yes nice meeting you too mud boy i look forward to robbing you in the future artemis shook his hand i look forward to it myself believe it or not we will have some fine times jayjay reached out for a handshake you look after the human jayjay said mulch seriously hes a bit dim but he means well goodbye mister diggums later master fowl opal was on her third round of the gola schweem meditative circle chant when mervall burst into her private chamber we found the shuttle miss koboi he panted clutching a flexiscreen to his chest they went supersonic for barely a minute over the mediterannean but it was enough humm humm haaa rahmumm humm haaaa intoned opal finishing her chant peace be inside me tolerance all around me forgiveness in my path now mervall show me where the filthy human is so that i may feed him his organs mervall proffered the flexiscreen red dot east coast military no surprisingly its a residence no defences whatsoever opal climbed out of her snuggleme chair good run a few scans warm up the cannons and get me down there yes miss koboi and mervall miss koboi i think little descant has a crush on me he told me earlier that i was very phototractive poor little simpleton could you tell him that i am unavailable if you dont i shall have to have him killed merv sighed i shall tell him miss koboi i feel sure he will be disconnipted artemis found himself scratching jayjays head as they moved through the manor be calm little chap no one can hurt you now were safe holly was behind him on the stairs guarding the rear two fingers rigidly extended the fingers were not a loaded weapon but they could break bones with enough momentum behind them come on artemis number one is weaker now so we have to jump soon artemis stepped round a weightsensitive pad on the twelfth step nearly there seconds away his study was exactly as he had left it the wardrobe still open a scarf drooping from the top shelf like an escaping snake good said artemis his confidence growing this is the spot the exact spot holly was panting about time im having trouble holding on to the signal its like running after a smell artemis put an arm round her shoulder a group of three tired hungry but excited hollys shoulders shook with an exhaustion and tension she had kept hidden until now i thought you were dead she said me too admitted artemis then i realized that i couldnt die not in this time i presume youre going to explain that to me later over supper now can we open the time stream friend there was a sudden swish as the baywindow curtain slid back young artemis and butler were there both wearing foil suits butler unzipped his suit to reveal a large gun strapped across his chest what was that about a time stream asked tenyearold artemis mulch diggums was burying a gold coin as a sacrifice to shammy the dwarf god of good fortune when the earth exploded underneath him and he found himself straddling the blade of a shuttle icebreaker prow i never even heard that coming he thought and then so much for shammy before he could gather himself sufficiently to figure up from down mulch found himself tumbled to the base of a silver ash tree with the barrel of a neutrino restricting the movement of his adams apple his beard hairs instinctively realized that the gun was not friendly and twined themselves round the barrel nice shuttle said mulch playing for time until the stars in his vision flickered out whisper engine im guessing three pixies stood before him two males and a female generally pixies were not very threatening creatures but the males were armed and the female had a look in her eyes i bet said mulch that you would set the world on fire just to watch it burn opal tapped the suggestion into a small electronic notepad on her pocket computer thanks for that now tell me everything ill resist for a minute then feed her some misinformation thought mulch ill tell you nothing pixie shedevil he said adams apple knocking nervously against the gun barrel oooh said opal stamping with frustration isnt anyone afraid of me she stripped off a glove placing a thumb on mulchs temple now show me everything and with a few remaining sparks of illgotten magic she sucked every memory of the past few days from mulchs brain it was an extremely unpleasant sensation even for someone used to expelling large amount of material from his person mulch gibbered and bucked as the last few days were vacuumed from his head when opal had what she wanted the dwarf was left unconscious in the mud he would wake up an hour later with the starter chip for an lep shuttle in his pocket and no idea how hed got there opal closed her eyes and flicked through her new memories ah she said smiling a time stream there isnt time for this insisted artemis i think there is argued tenyearold artemis you have broken into my house again the least you can do is explain that time stream comment not to mention the fact that you are alive artemis the elder flicked his hair away from his face you must recognize me now surely this is not a shampoo commercial please stop flicking your hair holly was bent almost double her hand on her heart hurry she groaned or ill have to go without you please artemis pleaded we need to go its a matter of life and death young artemis was unmoved i had a feeling you would be back this is where it all began right on this spot i reviewed the security tapes and you simply appeared in this room then you followed me to africa so i thought if i saved the creatures life you might end up back here with my lemur we simply blocked our heat signatures and waited and here you are thats pretty flimsy reasoning said artemis the elder we were obviously after the lemur once we had the lemur why would we return here i realize the logic was flawed but i had nothing to lose and as we can see a lot to gain holly did not have the patience for a fowl gloating session artemis i know you have a heart youre a good person even if you dont know it yet you sacrificed your diamonds to save my life what will it take for you to let us go young artemis considered this for an infuriating minute and a half the truth he said eventually i need to know the absolute truth about all of this what kind of creature are you why does he look so familiar what makes the lemur so special everything artemis the elder clutched jayjay to his chest get me a pair of scissors he said opal ran into the manor casually squashing the magical nausea that flared upon entering a human dwelling without permission a time stream she thought almost giggling with excitement finally i can test my theories the manipulation of time had long been opals ultimate goal to be able to control ones passage through time was the greatest power but her magic was not strong enough without the lemur it took teams of lep warlocks to slow time down for a few hours the magic required to open a door to the tunnel was stupendous it would be easier to shoot down the moon opal tapped this into her notepad reminder shoot down the moon viable but if she could gain entrance to the tunnel opal felt sure that she would quickly master the science involved its more than likely an intuitive organism and after all i am a genius she scaled the stairs mindless of the scuff marks the high human steps inflicted on her new boots mervall and descant trailed behind surprised at this lack of footwear prudence i got thrown in the pig pen for boots muttered descant now shes scratching those ones on the stairs typical koboi inconsistency i think im getting an ulcer opal reached the upper landing and raced immediately through an open doorway how does she know thats the right room wondered descant oh i dont know said mervall resting his hands on his knees scaling human steps is not easy for pixies big heads short legs tiny lungs maybe its the magical red glow coming from the doorway or perhaps its the deafening howl of the temporal winds descant nodded you could be right brother and dont think i dont know sarcasm when i hear it opal traipsed from the room her expression sour they have gone she announced and the tunnel is about to close also my boots are ruined so boys i am looking for someone to blame the brill brothers took one look at each other then turned and ran as fast as their tiny legs would carry them not fast enough chapter the hole in the ace holly felt herself relax as soon as they entered the stream safe for the moment jayjay was safe soon artemiss mother would be well and when that was accomplished holly decided that she would punch her erstwhile friend in his smug face i did what i had to do artemis had said and i would do it again and she had kissed him kissed him holly understood artemiss motives but it wounded her deeply that he had felt the need to blackmail her i would have helped anyway definitely would you would you have disobeyed orders was artemis right to do it his way these were questions that holly knew would haunt her for years if she had years left to her the journey was more arduous than before the time stream was eroding her sense of self and there was a syrupy temptation to relax her concentration her world seemed less important wrapped in its sparkling waves being part of an eternal river would be a pleasant way to exist and if the fairy races were wiped out by plague what of it ns presence pricked her consciousness bolstering her resolve the little demons power was evident in the stream a shimmering thread of crimson pulling them on through the miasma things moved in the shadows darting sharp things holly sensed teeth and hooked fingers had number one mentioned something about quantum zombies that was probably a joke please let that be a joke concentrate holly told herself or you will be absorbed she could feel other presences travelling with her jayjay was surprisingly calm considering his surroundings somewhere in the periphery was artemis his sense of purpose keen as a blade number one is going to get a shock thought holly when he sees us pop through n didnt seem very shocked when the group tumbled from the stream solidifying on the floor of artemiss study see any zombies he asked with a spooky wiggling of his fingers thank the gods proclaimed foaly from the television screens then exhaled loudly through his broad nostrils that was the longest ten seconds of my life did you get the lemur there was no need for an answer as jayjay decided he liked the sound of foalys voice and gave the nearest screen a lick the little primates tongue crackled and he scampered back shooting foaly a glare one lemur said the centaur no female holly shook the stars from her eyes the fog from her head the stream lingered in her head like the last moments of sleep no no female youll have to clone him foaly peered past holly to the shuddering form on the ground behind her the centaur raised an eyebrow i see we have an lets talk about that later said holly sharply interrupting the centaur for now we have work to do foaly nodded thoughtfully im guessing from the look of things that artemis has a plan of some sort is that going to be a problem for us only if we try to stop it said holly artemis took jayjay into his arms stroking the little lemurs mohican calming him with a rhythmic clicking of his tongue holly felt that she too would be calmed not by artemiss clicking but by the sight of her own face in the mirror she was herself again her onepiece fitted snugly a grown woman no more teenage confusion she would feel even better once she retrieved her gear there was nothing like a neutrino on the hip for a selfconfidence boost time to see mother said artemis grimly selecting a suit from the wardrobe how much fluid should i administer its powerful stuff said foaly entering some calculations on his keyboard two ccs no more there is a syringe gun in hollys medikit bedside table be very careful with the brain drain theres an anaesthetic tab in there too give jayjay a swab and he wont feel a thing very well artemis said pocketing the kit i shall go in alone i do hope mother recognizes me so do i agreed holly or she may object to lemur brain juice being injected into her by a total stranger artemiss hand hovered over the crystal doorknob on his parents bedroom door in its facets he could see a dozen reflections of his own face each one was drawn and worried last chance my last chance to save her i am forever trying to save people he thought im supposed to be a criminal where did it all go wrong no time for drifting there was more at stake here than gold or notoriety his mother was dying and her salvation was perched on artemiss shoulder searching his scalp for ticks artemis closed his fingers over the knob not another moment to waste on thoughts time now for action the room seemed colder than he remembered but this was doubtless his imagination all minds play tricks even mine the perceived cold is a projection of my mood nothing more his parents bedroom was rectangular in shape stretching along the west wing from front to rear it was actually more of an apartment than a room with a lounge area and office corner the large fourposter bed was angled so that tinted light from a medieval stainedglass porthole would fall across the studded headboard in summer artemis placed his feet carefully on the rug like a ballet dancer avoiding the vine pattern in the weave step on a vine count to nine bad luck was the last thing he needed angeline fowl was splayed on the bed as though thrown there her head was angled back so sharply that the line from her neck to chin was almost straight and her skin was pale enough to seem translucent shes not breathing thought artemis panic fluttering in his chest like a caged bird i was wrong i am too late then his mothers entire frame convulsed as she dragged down a painful breath artemiss resolve almost left him then his legs were boneless rubber and his forehead burned this is my mother how can i do what needs to be done but he would do it there wasnt anyone else who could artemis reached his mothers side and gently pushed strands of hair back from her face i am here mother everything will be fine i found a cure somehow angeline fowl heard her sons words and her eyes flickered open even her retinas had lost their colour fading to the ice blue of a winter lake cure she sighed my little arty found the cure thats right said artemis little arty found the cure it was the lemur remember the madagascan lemur from rathdown park angeline raised a bonethin finger tickling the air before jayjays nose little lemur cure jayjay unsettled by the bedridden womans skeletal appearance ducked behind artemiss head nice lemur said angeline a weak smile twitching her lips i am the parent now thought artemis she is the child can i hold him artemis took a halfstep back no mother not yet jayjay is a very important creature this little fellow could save the world angeline spoke through her teeth let me hold him just for a moment jayjay crawled down the back of artemiss jacket as though he understood the request and did not want to be held please arty it would comfort me to hold him artemis nearly handed the lemur over nearly holding him will not cure you mother i need to inject some fluid into one of your veins angeline seemed to be regaining her strength she inched backwards sliding her head up the headboard dont you want to make me happy arty i prefer healthy to happy for the moment said artemis making no move to hand over the lemur dont you love me son crooned angeline dont you love your mummy artemis moved briskly tearing open the medikit closing his fingers round the transfusion gun a single tear rolled down his pale cheek i love you mother i love you more than life if you could only know what i have been through to find little jayjay just be still for five seconds then this nightmare will be over angelines eyes were crafty slits i dont want you to inject me artemis youre not a trained nurse wasnt there a doctor here or was i dreaming that artemis primed the gun waiting for the charge light to flash green i have administered shots before mother i gave you your medicine more than once the last time you were ill artemis snapped angeline the flat of her hand slapping the sheet i demand that you give the lemur to me now this instant and summon the doctor artemis plucked a vial from the medikit you are hysterical mother not yourself i think i should give you a sedative before i administer the antidote he slid the vial into the gun reaching for his mothers arm no angeline virtually screeched slapping him away with surprising strength dont touch me with your lep sedatives you stupid boy artemis froze lep mother what do you know of the lep angeline tugged her lip a guilty child what did i say lep three letters no more they mean nothing to me artemis took another step away from the bed gathering jayjay protectively in his arms tell me the truth mother what is happening here angeline abandoned her innocent act pounding the mattress with delicate fists squealing in frustration i despise you artemis fowl you bothersome human how i loathe you not words one expects to hear from ones mother angeline lay flat on the bed steaming with rage literally steaming her eyeballs rolled in their sockets and tendons stood out like steel cables on her arms and neck all the time she ranted when i have the lemur i will crush you all the lep foaly julius root all of you i will send laser dogs down every tunnel in the earths crust until i flush out that odious dwarf and as for that female captain i will brainwash her and make her my slave she cast a hateful look at artemis fitting revenge dont you agree my son the last two words dripped from her lips like poison from a vipers fangs artemis held jayjay close he could feel the small creature shiver against his chest or perhaps the shivering was his own opal he said you followed us home finally shouted artemiss mother in opals voice the great boy genius sees the truth angelines limbs stiffened and she levitated from the bed surrounded by a roiling mist of steam her pale blue eyes cut through the fog spearing artemis with their mad glare did you think you could win did you believe that the battle was won how charmingly deluded you do not even possess any magic i on the other hand have more magic than any other fairy since the demon warlocks and once i have the lemur i will be immortal artemis rolled his eyes dont forget invincible i haaate you squealed opalangeline when i have the lemur i will i will kill me in some horrible fashion suggested artemis precisely thank you angelines body pivoted stiffly until she hovered upright her halo of charged hair brushing the ceiling now she said pointing a skeletal finger at the cowering jayjay give me that creature artemis wrapped the lemur in his jacket come and get him he said in the study holly was running through artemiss theory thats it said n when holly had finished explaining youre not forgetting some crucial detail like the part that makes sense the whole thing is ridiculous interjected foaly from the monitors come on fairies weve done our bit time to head below ground soon said holly lets just give artemis five minutes to check it out all we need to do is be alert foalys sigh crackled through the speakers well at least let me raise the shuttle the troops are holding at tara waiting for a callback holly thought about this thats good you do that whatever happens we need to be ready to move out and when youre finished do a sweep of the estate see where that nurse is foalys focus shifted left while he put a call in to tara holly pointed at n you just have a little of that signature magic dancing on your fingertips in case we need it i wont feel completely safe until angeline is well and were drinking simcoffee in a haven bar n raised his hands and soon they were enveloped in ripples of red power no problem holly im ready for anything it was a statement that was missing an almost in the same split second the monitors blacked out and the door burst open with a force that actually drove the doorknob into the wall butlers huge frame filled the gap hollys smile slipped when she noticed the pistol in the bodyguards fist and the mirrored sunglasses covering his eyes hes armed and doesnt want to be mesmerized holly was quick but butler was quicker and he had the element of surprise after all he was supposed to be on his way to china holly went for her gun but butler was there before her ripping the neutrino from her hip we have other tricks thought holly we have magic number one will knock your socks off butler dragged something into the room on a trolley a steel barrel with runes etched on the metal whats this whats he doing n managed to get off a single bolt indoor lightning that scorched butlers shirt knocking him back a pace but even as he stumbled backwards the bodyguard swung the trolley past him slingshotting it into the room a thick slime slopped from the barrels open mouth splashing on ns legs it trundled forward knocking holly and n aside like skittles n stared at his fingers as the magic on each tip winked out like candles in a breeze i dont feel so great he groaned then keeled over eyes flickering lips muttering ancient spells which did not one iota of good what is in that barrel wondered holly releasing her suits wings from their sheath butler grabbed hollys ankle as she ascended flipping her ignominiously into the barrel she felt the thick gunk close over her like a wet fist blocking her nose filling her throat the smell was repulsive animal fat she realized with a spasmodic shudder of horror pure rendered fat with a few hexes stirred into it animal fat had been used as a magic suppressor for millennia even the most powerful warlock was helpless when dipped in rendered fat you throw a warlock in a barrel of fat seal it with woven willow bark and bury it in a consecrated human graveyard and that warlock was as helpless as a kitten in a sack the experience would be made even more terrible by the fact that most fairies are devout vegetarians and would be perfectly aware how many animals had to die to produce an entire barrel of fat who told butler about this holly wondered who is controlling him then n was jammed in beside her and the fat level rose to cover their heads holly surged upwards clearing her eyes just in time to see a lid bearing down on the barrel mouth eclipsing the ceiling light no helmet she lamented i wish i had my helmet then the lid was on and sealed the fat found the neckhole in her onepiece and wormed inside probing her face and invading her ears hexes swirled like malevolent snakes keeping her magic at bay lost thought holly the worst death i can imagine sealed in a small space like my mother n convulsed beside her the little warlock must feel like the soul was being sucked right out of him holly panicked she kicked and fought bruising her elbows tearing the skin from her knees where magic tried to heal her wounds the hex snakes zoomed in swallowing the sparks she almost opened her mouth to scream the merest thread of reason stopped her then something brushed against her face a corrugated tube there were two breathing tubes with frantic fingers holly felt her way to the end of the tube she fought her natural instinct to jam the tube into ns mouth in the event of an emergency always take care of yourself first before you attend to civilians so holly used her absolute last puff of air to clear the pipe as a diver would clear his snorkel she imagined blobs of fat spraying the room outside i hope butlers suit is ruined she thought no choice now but to inhale air whistled down to her mixed with wormy slivers of fat holly blew again clearing the last traces of gunk now for n his wriggling grew weaker as his power waned for someone with such power this dunking must be almost intolerable holly blocked her own tube with a thumb then cleared the second one before twisting it into ns slack mouth for a moment there was no reaction and she thought it was too late then n jerked spluttered and started like an old engine on a frosty morning alive thought holly we are both alive if butler wanted us dead then we already would be she braced her feet on the base of the barrel and hugged n tightly calm was needed here calm she broadcast though she knew ns empathy would be muted calm little friend artemis will save us if he is alive she thought but did not broadcast artemis backed away from the nightmare version of his mother that hovered before him jayjay screeched and bucked in his arms but artemis held him tightly automatically scratching the tiny brush of hair on his crown hand over that creature demanded opal you have no choice artemis circled jayjays neck with his thumb and forefinger oh i think i have a choice opal was horrified you wouldnt kill an innocent creature i did it before opal studied his eyes i dont think you would do it again artemis fowl my fairy intuition tells me that you are not as coldhearted as you pretend to be it was true artemis knew he couldnt harm jayjay even to derail opals plans still no reason to tell opal that my heart is cold pixie believe it use some of that magical empathy to search my soul his tone gave opal pause there was steel there and he was hard to read perhaps she should not gamble so recklessly with him very well human hand over the creature and i will spare your friends i have no friends artemis shot back though he knew it was a transparent bluff opal had been here for a few days at least she had doubtless hijacked the manors surveillance and security the angeline opal scratched her chin hmm no friends apart from the lep elf who accompanied you to the past and of course the demon warlock who sent you back not to mention your big burly bodyguard alliteration thought artemis shes toying with me then again mused opalangeline butler is not really your friend any more hes mine this was a worrying statement and perhaps true artemis usually an expert interpreter of body language and telltale tics was flummoxed by this crazed version of his mother butler would never willingly befriend you opal shrugged it was a fair point who said anything about willingly artemis paled uhoh let me explain what happened said opal sweetly i scrambled the brains of my little helpers somewhat so they could not report on me then had them fly the shuttle back to haven then i hitched a ride on your time stream before it closed oh so simple for someone with my skill set you didnt even leave a hex at the hole artemis snapped his fingers i knew i had forgotten something opal smiled thinly amusing anyway it became obvious to me that i was or would be responsible for this entire affair so i dropped out of the stream a few days early and took my time getting to know your group mother father butler where is my mother shouted artemis anger punching through his calm exterior like a hammer through ice why im right here darling said opal in angelines voice i am really sick and i need you to go into the past and fetch a magic monkey for me she laughed mockingly humans are such fools so this is not some kind of shapeshifting spell no idiot i was perfectly aware that angeline would be examined shapeshifting spells are only skin deep and even an adept such as myself can only hold one for short periods this means that my mother is not dying artemis knew the answer but he had to be certain opal ground her teeth torn between impatience and the desire to explain the brilliance of her plan not yet though soon the damage to her systems will be irreversible i have possessed her from a distance an extreme form of the mesmer with power like mine i can manipulate her very organs imitating spelltropy was childs play and once i have little jayjay i can open my own hole in time so you are nearby your real self opal had had enough of questions yes no what does it matter i win you lose accept it or everyone dies artemis edged towards the door this game is not over yet footsteps outside and a strange rhythmic squeaking a wheelbarrow artemis guessed though he did not have much experience with gardening aids oh i think this game is over now said opal slyly the heavy door bounced in fits as it was butted from the outside butler pushed the trolley into the room stumbling after it hunched and shivering he is strong this one said opal almost in admiration i mesmerized him but still he refused to kill your friends the stupid mans heart almost burst it was all i could do to force him to construct the barrel and fill it with fat to smother fairy magic artemis guessed obviously idiot now the game is absolutely over finished butler is my ace in the hole as you humans might say i hold all the aces you are alone give me the lemur and i will go back to my own time nobody has to suffer if opal gets the lemur then the entire planet will suffer thought artemis opal snapped her fingers butler seize the animal butler took a single step towards artemis then stopped shudders racked his broad back and his fingers were claws wringing an invisible neck i said get the animal you stupid human the bodyguard dropped to his knees pounding the floor trying to drive the voice from his head get the lemur now shrieked opal butler had enough strength for three words go to hell then he clutched at his arm and collapsed oops said opal heart attack i broke him stay focused artemis ordered himself opal may hold all the aces but perhaps there is a hole in one of those aces artemis tickled jayjay under the chin hide little friend hide and with that he tossed the lemur towards a chandelier suspended from the ceiling jayjay flailed in the air then latched on to a glass strut he pulled himself nimbly into the light hiding behind sheets of dangling crystal opal immediately lost interest in artemis concentrating on levitating angelines body to the level of the chandalier with a squeal of frustration she realized that such remote elevation was beyond even a being of her power doctor schalke she called and somewhere her real mouth was calling it too into the bedroom schalke artemis filed this information then ducked below opal to his mothers bedside a mobile defibrillator cart was parked among the row of medical equipment ranged around the fourposter and artemis quickly switched it on dragging the entire contraption to the limit of its lead to where butler had collapsed the bodyguard lay face up hands thrown back as though there were an invisible boulder on his chest his face was stretched with the effort of moving the great stone eyes closed sweat sheened teeth clenched he unbuttoned butlers shirt exposing a barrel chest hard with muscle scars and tension a cursory examination told him that there was no heartbeat butlers body was dead only his brain was left alive hold on old friend murmured artemis trying to keep his mind focused he pulled the defibrillator paddles from their holsters peeling back their disposable safety covers leaving a thin coating of conductive gel on the contact surfaces the paddles seemed to grow heavier as he waited for the unit to charge and by the time the go light flashed green they felt like rocks in his hands clear he called to no one in particular then positioned the paddles firmly on butlers chest and hit the shock button under his thumb sending joules of electricity into his bodyguards heart butlers body arched and the sharp smell of burning hair and skin assailed artemiss nostrils gel crisped and sparked burning twin rings where the pads had made contact butlers eyes flew open and his massive hands gripped artemiss shoulders is he still opals slave artemis breathed butler but then frowned in confusion artemis how later old friend said the irish boy brusquely mentally progressing to the next problem just rest for now this was not an order he would have to repeat butler sank immediately into exhausted unconsciousness but his heart beat strongly inside his chest he had not been dead long enough to have suffered brain damage artemiss next problem was opal or more specifically how to get her out of his mothers body if she did not vacate soon artemis had no doubt that his mother would not recover from the ordeal gathering his nerve with several deep breaths artemis switched his full attention to his mothers hovering body she was twirling below the chandelier as though suspended from it clawing at jayjay who appeared to be taunting her by waving his hind quarters in her direction can this situation get any more surreal just then doctor schalke entered the room brandishing a pistol that seemed too large for his delicate hands i am here you creature though i must say i dont like your tone i may be spellbound but i am not an animal do shut up schalke i can see i will have to fry a few more of your brain cells now please fetch that lemur schalke pointed four fingers of his free hand towards the chandelier the lemur is at a considerable height yes how do you suggest i fetch him perhaps i could shoot him dead opal swooshed low arms and legs twirling like a harpy no she shrieked striking him around the head and shoulders i would shoot a hundred of you a thousand before i let you harm one hair of that creatures fur he is the future my future the worlds future indeed said the doctor were i not mesmerized i suspect i should be yawning shoot the humans commanded opal the boy first he is the most dangerous are you certain the man mountain looks more dangerous to me shoot the boy howled opal frustration sending tears streaming down her cheeks then butler and then yourself artemis swallowed this was cutting things a bit fine his accomplice had better get a move on very well said schalke fiddling with the safety on butlers sig sauer anything to escape these theatrics i have seconds before he figures out that catch thought artemis seconds to distract opal nothing to do but reveal the hole in her ace come now opal artemis said with a calmness he did not feel you wouldnt shoot a tenyearold boy would you i absolutely would said opal without a heartbeats hesitation i am considering cloning you so that i can kill you over and over again heaven then all of what artemis had said registered ten did you say you were ten years old artemis forgot all about the danger surrounding him lost in the sweet moment of triumph it was intoxicating yes that is what i said i am ten my real mother would have noticed immediately opal chewed the knuckles of angelines left hand thinking you are the artemis fowl from my time they brought you back obviously opal reared back through the air as though taken by the wind there is another one here somewhere another artemis fowl finally said artemis smirking the great pixie genius sees the truth find him shrieked opal find him immediately at once schalke straightened his glasses at once and immediately this must be important opal watched him go with real hatred in her eyes when this is over i am going to destroy this entire estate just for spite and then when i return to the past i shall dont tell me interrupted tenyearold artemis fowl you will destroy it again almost eight years ago when fourteenyearold artemis had had a moment to consider things sometime in between scaling pylons and outwitting murderous extinctionists he realized that there were a lot of unanswered questions about his mothers illness he had supposedly given her spelltropy but who had passed it to him hollys magic had permeated his body in the past but she herself was hale and hearty why wasnt she sick or for that matter how did butler escape infection he had been healed so many times that he must be half fairy by now and of all the thousands of humans healed mesmerized or wiped every year his mother was the one to fall ill the mother of the only human on earth who could do something about it very coincidental too coincidental by far so either someone had deliberately infected his mother or the symptoms were being magically duplicated either way the result was the same artemis would travel back in time to find the antidote the lemur jayjay and who would want jayjay found as much as artemis did the answer to that question lay in the past opal koboi of course the little primate was the last ingredient in her magical cocktail with his brain fluid in her bloodstream she would be literally the most powerful person on the planet and if opal couldnt nab jayjay in her own time she would get him in the future whatever it took she must have followed them back through the time stream jumped out early and organized this whole affair presumably once she had jayjays brain fluid navigating her way back would not be a problem it was confusing even for artemis opal wouldnt even be in his present if he hadnt gone back in time and he only went back in time because of a situation she created it was artemiss own attempts to cure his mother which had led opal to infect her but one thing he now felt sure of was that opal was behind this she was behind them and in front of them chasing their group into her own clutches a time paradox there are two opals in this equation thought artemis i think there should continue to be two artemis fowls and so a plan had taken shape in his mind once the young artemis had been apprised of all the details and convinced of their accuracy he at once agreed to accompany them to the future in spite of butlers vocal objection its my mother butler he said simply i must save her now i charge you to stay by her side until i return anyway how could they hope to succeed without me how indeed holly short had wondered then taken more pleasure than was necessary in watching that arrogance drain from the boys features when the time stream opened in front of them like the maw of some great computergenerated serpent chin up mud boy shed said as artemis the younger watched his arm dissolve and watch out for quantum zombies the time stream had been difficult for artemis the elder any other human would have been torn apart by such repeated exposure to its particular radiation but artemis held himself together by sheer willpower he focused on the high end of his intellect solving unprovable theorems with large cardinals and composing an ending for schuberts unfinished symphony n as he worked artemis sensed the odd derisive comment from his younger self more b minor do you really think so had he always been this obnoxious how tiresome little wonder people in general did not like him fowl manor the present back in his own time in his own house artemis the elder paused only to grab some clothes from the wardrobe before quickly exiting his study warning foaly and n to keep silent with a simple shhh he moved quickly along the corridor towards the dumbwaiter shaft adjacent to the secondfloor tea room this was not the most direct route to the security centre in fact the route was circuitous and awkward but it was the only way to pass through the house undetected butler believed he had every square inch of the manor apart from the fowls private chambers under surveillance but artemis had long since worked how to travel through the house without being picked up on camera this route involved hiding in corners walking on furniture travelling in dumb waiters and tilting a fulllength mirror to just the right angle it was possible of course that a hostile could figure out the same pathways coordinates and trajectories and also move about the house undetected possible but highly improbable not without an intimate knowledge of nooks and crannies that did not exist on any plans artemis followed a zigzag pattern down the hallway a second behind a security cameras sweep then ducked quickly inside the dumbwaiter shaft luckily the box was on this floor or he would have been forced to shin down the cable and shinning was not one of his strong suits artemis reached outside and pressed the groundfloor button whipping his hand back in before the descending box caught his wrist while it was true that security would register the dumb waiter descending it would not set off any red lights once at kitchen level artemis rolled on to the floor opening the fridge door to shield his movement into the pantry deep shadows concealed him until the camera swung away from the doorway allowing him climb on top of the table and jump outside all the time thinking plotting assume the worst little artemis is helpless and holly and number one are already incapacitated quite possible if someone like butler were mesmerized and doing the incapacitating opal is somewhere near the command centre manipulating my mother it was opal who could see the magic inside me not mother she peeled away the spell i had cast over my parents and of course b minor if one starts in b minor one finishes in b minor any fool knows that a suit of medieval armour stood in the main lobby the same armour that butler had put on to do battle with a troll during the fowl manor seige five years earlier artemis approached it slowly his back flat against an abstract greyblack tapestry that camouflaged him almost perfectly once concealed behind the suit of armour he nudged the base of an adjacent mirror until it reflected a spotlights beam directly into the lens of the lobby camera now his path to the security centre was clear artemis strode purposefully towards the booth this was where opal would be he was certain of it from there she could monitor the entire house and it was directly below angelines bedroom if opal was indeed controlling his mother closer was better it was clear from several metres away that he was right artemis could hear opal ranting from a distance there is another one here somewhere another artemis fowl either the penny had dropped or young artemis had been forced to reveal their plan find him shrieked opal find him immediately at once artemis stepped quietly into the security control booth a boxroom off the main lobby that had served in its time as a cloakroom weapons lockup and holding cell for prisoners now it housed a computer desk similar to those found in editing suites and stacks of monitors displaying live feeds of the manor and grounds huddled before the monitor bank was opal dressed in hollys lep gear she had wasted no time in stealing the fairy suit it was mere minutes since artemis had locked it in the safe the little pixie was multitasking furiously scanning the monitors while maintaining remote control over artemiss mother her dark hair was sweatslicked and her childlike limbs shook with the effort artemis sneaked into the room quickly punching the code into the weapons locker when this is over i am going to destroy this entire estate just for spite and then when i return to the past i shall opal froze something had made a clicking noise she turned to find artemis fowl pointing a weapon of some kind at her she immediately abandoned all other spells throwing her efforts into a desperate mesmer drop that gun she intoned you are my slave artemis felt instantly woozy but he had already pressed the trigger and a dart loaded with a butler special concoction of muscle relaxants and sedatives buried its long needle in opals neck where there was no protection from the suit this was a shot in a million since artemis was not proficient with firearms as butler put it artemis a genius you may be but leave the shooting to me because you couldnt hit the backside of a stationary elephant opal concentrated furiously on the puncture wound dousing it with magical sparks but it was too late the drug was already entering her brain loosening her control on the magic inside her she began to sway and flicker alternating between her real pixie self and miss book miss book thought artemis my suspicions were correct the only stranger in the equation intermittently opal disappeared altogether shield buzzing in and out magical bolts shot from her fingers frying the monitors before artemis could get a look at what was going on upstairs now i can do the bolts she slurred ive been trying to focus enough magic all week the magic shifted and swirled finally etching a picture in the air it was a rough picture of foaly and he was laughing i hate you centaur screamed opal lunging towards and through the insubstantial image then her eyes rolled back in her head and she collapsed snoring on the floor artemis straightened his tie freud he felt certain would have a field day with that artemis hurried upstairs to his parents room the rug was coated in a pool of lumpy fat two sets of fairy footprints led from the turgid pearlescent puddle into the en suite wetroom artemis heard the power shower drilling against the tiles opal used animal fat to suppress number ones magic how despicable how horrible young artemis was studying the spreading mass of goo look he said noticing his older self opal used animal fat to suppress number ones magic how ingenious under the noise of the shower were the sounds of retching and complaining butler was hosing down holly and n and they were not happy or healthy but alive both alive angeline lay on her bed wrapped in a goosedown duvet she was pale and dazed but was it artemiss imagination or had just a tinge of colour crept back into her cheeks she coughed gently and immediately both artemises were at her side artemis the elder raised an eyebrow at his younger self you can see how this might be awkward he said pointedly i can indeed conceded the tenyearold why dont i have a poke around in your in my study see what i come up with this is a problem artemis realized my own inquisitiveness perhaps i should not have promised not to mindwipe my younger self something will have to be done angeline opened her eyes they were blue and calm peering out from tired dark sockets artemis she said her voice the rasp of fingers on tree bark i dreamed i was flying and there was a monkey artemis shook with relief she was safe he had saved her it was a lemur mother mum angeline smiled wanly reaching up to stroke his cheek mum i have waited so long to hear you say that so long and with that smile on her face angeline lay back and drifted off into deep natural sleep just as well artemis realized or she may have noticed the fairies in the bathroom or the contents of a fat barrel on the rug or a second artemis lurking shiftily by the bookcase butler emerged from the wetroom dripping wet shirtless paddle marks scorched into his skin he was paler than usual and had to lean against the doorframe for support welcome back he said to artemis the elder this little one is quite a chip off the old block gave me one hell of a jumpstart he is the old block said artemis wryly butler jerked a thumb over his shoulder those two didnt enjoy their dip in the barrel animal fat is poison to fairies explained artemis blocks the magical flow turns their own power rancid a shadow settled on butlers brow opal made me do it she miss book approached me at the main gates as i left for the airport i was trapped in my own skull artemis laid a gentle hand on his bodyguards forearm i know no apologies are necessary butler remembered that he did not have his weapon and he remembered who did have it what did you do with schalke knockout dart no our paths did not cross butler staggered to the bedroom door artemis hot on his heels opal is controlling him though hes making her work for it we need to secure them both right now it took them several minutes to reach the security booth butler pulling himself along the walls and by that time opal was already gone artemis ran to the window just in time to see the blocky rear end of a vintage mercedes take the bend in the driveway a small figure bounced on the back seat two bounces the first time it was opal the second miss imogen book already her power returns realized artemis butler loomed above him panting this isnt over yet he said artemis did not respond to the comment butler was simply stating the patently obvious then the engine noise increased in volume and pitch gear change said butler shes coming back artemis felt a chill pass over his heart though he had been expecting it of course shes coming back he thought she will never have another chance like this one butler can barely walk holly and number one will be diminished for hours and i am a mere human if she retreats now jayjay will be free of her forever soon foalys squad will arrive from tara and whisk the little lemur underground for perhaps five minutes opal has the upper hand artemis planned quickly i need to take jayjay away from here so long as he is in the manor everyone is in danger opal will kill us all to cover her tracks butler nodded sweat running in rivulets through the lines on his face yes we can make it to the cessna i can make it to the cessna old friend corrected artemis i am charging you with the protection of my mother and friends not to mention keeping my younger self off the internet he is as dangerous as opal it was a sensible tactic and butler knew it was coming before artemis said it he was in such bad shape that he would slow artemis down not only that but the manor would be wide open for any of opals thralls to stroll in and exact her revenge very well dont take her over three thousand metres and watch the flaps theyre a bit sticky artemis nodded as if he didnt know giving instructions comforted butler three thousand flaps got it would you like a gun i have a neat beretta artemis shook his head no guns my aim is so bad that even with hollys eye to help me i would probably only succeed in shooting off a toe or two no all i need is the bait he paused and my sunglasses chapter murder most fowl the fowl family currently had three aircraft a learjet and a sikorsky helicopter were hangared at the nearby airport and a small cessna which lived in a small garage workshop beside the high meadow on the northern border of the estate the cessna was several years old and would have been recycled some time ago had artemis not taken it on as a project his aim was to make it carbonneutral and costeffective a goal which his father heartily approved of i have forty scientists working on the same problem but my money is on you he had confided to his son and so artemis coated the entire body of the craft with lightweight superefficient solar panels like nasas prototype flying wing the helios unlike the helios artemiss cessna could still fly at its normal speeds and take passengers this was because artemis had removed the single engine and installed smaller ones to turn the main propeller the four extra props on the wings and the landing gear most of the metal in the skeleton had been stripped out and replaced with a lightweight polymer where the fuel tank had been now sat a small battery there were still a few adjustments to make but artemis believed his ship was skyworthy he hoped so there was a lot riding on the soundness of the little craft he sprinted from the kitchen door across the courtyard and towards the high meadow with any luck opal would not realize he was gone until she saw the plane taking off of course then he wanted her to see him hopefully he could draw her away long enough for lep reinforcements to arrive artemis felt the tiredness in his legs before he had gone a hundred metres he had never been the athletic type and the recent timestream jaunts had done nothing for his physique even though he had concentrated hard on his muscles during the trips willing himself to tone up a little mindovermatter experiment that sadly had not yielded any results the old farm gate to the meadow was closed so artemis scaled it rather than struggle with the heavy bolt he could feel the heat from the simians body high inside his jacket and its little hands were tight on his neck jayjay must be safe he thought he must be saved the garage doors were sturdier than they looked and protected with a keypad entry system artemis tapped in the code and threw the doors wide flooding the interior with the deep orange rays of the earlyevening sun inside nestled in a horseshoe of benches and tool trolleys was the modified cessna hooked up to a supplementary power cable artemis snapped the cable from its socket on the fuselage and clambered into the cockpit he strapped himself into the pilots seat remembering briefly when he had first flown this plane solo nine years old i needed a booster seat the engines started immediately and virtually silently the only noise came from the whirring of the propellers and the clicks of switches as artemis ran through his preflight check the news was generally good eighty per cent power that gave the small plane a range of several hundred miles easily enough to lead opal on a merry dance along the irish coast but the flaps were sticky and the seals were old dont take her over three thousand metres were going to be fine he said to the passenger inside his jacket absolutely fine was this the truth he could not be certain the high meadow was wide and long and sloped gently upwards to the estate wall artemis nudged the cessna from her hangar swinging the nose in a tight turn to give himself maximum runway under ideal circumstances the fivehundredmetre stretch of grass was more than ample for a takeoff but there was a tailwind and the grass was a few centimetres longer than it should be despite these considerations we should be ok i have flown in worse conditions than these the takeoff was textbook artemis pulled back on the nosewheel at the threehundredmetre mark and comfortably cleared the north wall even at this low altitude he could see the irish sea to the west black with scimitars of sunlight slicing across the wave tips he was tempted for the merest fraction of a moment just to flee but he didnt have i changed utterly artemis asked himself he realized that he was running out of palatable crimes not so long ago nearly all crime had been acceptable to him no he decided there were still people who deserved to be stolen from or exposed or dropped in deep jungle with only flipflops and a spoon he would just have to put more effort into finding them artemis activated the wing cameras there was one such person on the avenue below a megalomaniac coldhearted pixie opal koboi artemis could see her striding towards the manor jamming hollys helmet down over her ears i was afraid of that she thought to take the helmet a most valuable tool still he had no alternative but to attract her attention the lives of his family and friends were at stake artemis took the cessna down thirty metres following opals path to the manor she may not hear the engine but the sensors in hollys helmet would throw up a dozen red lights on cue opal stopped in her tracks throwing her gaze skywards capturing the small plane in her sights come on opal thought artemis take the bait run a thermal opal strode purposefully towards the manor until she snagged the toe of one lep boot under the heel of another stupid tall elf she thought furiously righting herself when i am queen no when i am empress all tall fairies will have their legs modified or better still i will have a human pituitary gland grafted to my brain so that i shall be the tall one a giant among fairies physically and mentally she had other plans too an opalesque cosmetic face mould that could give any of her adoring fans the koboi look in seconds a homeopathic hoverchair covered in massage bars and mood sensors that would read her humour and spray whatever scents were needed to cheer her up but those plans could wait until she was empress for now the lemur was her priority without its brain fluid it could take years to accomplish her plans plus magic was so much easier than science opal slotted hollys helmet on to her head pads inside the helmet automatically inflated to cradle her skull there was some coded security which she contemptuously hacked with a series of blinks and hand movements these lep helmets were not half as advanced as the models in her r ampd department once the hemets functions were open to her the visors display crystals fizzled and turned scarlet red alert something was closing in a d radar sweep revealed a small craft overhead and recogniton software quickly pegged it as a humanbuilt cessna she quickly selected the command sequence for a thermal scan and the helmet infrared detector analysed the electromagnetic radiation coming from inside the aircraft there was some waffle from the solar panels but the scan isolated an orange blob in the pilots seat one passenger only the helmets biometric reader conveniently identified the pilot as artemis fowl and dropped a d icon over his fuzzy figure one passenger murmured opal are you trying to decoy me away from the house artemis fowl is that why you fly so low but artemis fowl knew technology he would anticipate thermalimaging what do you have up your sleeve wondered the pixie or perhaps up your shirt she magnified artemiss heart and discovered a second heat source superimposed over the first distinguishable only by a slightly cooler shade of red even at that desperate moment opal could not help but admire this young human who had attempted to mask the lemurs heat signature with his own clever but not ingenious and he would need to be ingenious to defeat opal koboi bringing back the second artemis had been a neat trick but she should have caught it i was defeated by my own arrogance she realized that will not happen again the helmet automatically tuned into the cessnas radio frequency and so opal sent artemis a little message i am coming for the lemur boy she said a pulse of magic setting the suits wings a flutter and this time there will be no you to save you artemis could not feel or see the various waves that probed the cessna but he guessed that opal would use the helmets thermal imager to see how many hot bodies were on the plane perhaps she would try xray too it would seem as though he was trying to hide jayjays heat signature with his own but that was a transparent ploy and should not fool opal for more than a heartbeat when the pixie was satisified that her prize was escaping then how could she not follow artemis banked starboard to keep opal in the camera eye and was satisfied to see a set of wings sliding from the slots in hollys suit the chase was on time for the bait to pretend it was trying to escape artemis peeled away from the estate heading for the deep purple sea opening the throttle wide satisfied by the planes smooth acceleration the batteries were channelling a steady supply of power to the engines without releasing one gram of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere he checked the tail camera view and was not totally surprised to find the flying pixie in his monitor her control over the magic is addled by sedative he guessed opal may have had barely enough power to jumpstart the suit but soon the darts aftereffects will peter out and then there may be lightning bolts flaring across my wing artemis turned south following the jagged coast the clamour and bustle of dublins highrise apartment blocks belching chimneys and swarm of buzzing helicopters gave way to long stretches of grey rock shadowed by the northsouth railtrack the sea pushed against the shore folding its million fingers over sand scrub and shale fishing boats chugged from buoy to buoy trailing white seaserpent wakes sailors snagging lobster pots with longhandled gaffes fat clouds hung ponderously at four thousand metres rain brewing in their bellies a peaceful evening so long as no one looks up though at this altitude opals blurred flying form could be mistaken for an eagle artemiss plan went smoothly for longer than hed hoped he made sixty miles without interference from opal artemis allowed himself a glimmer of hope soon he thought the lep reinforcements will come soon then his radio crackled into life artemis are you there artemis butler he sounded extremely calm which he always did before he explained just how serious a situation was butler old friend im here tell me the good news the bodyguard sighed into his microphone a breaking wave of static theyre not coming after the cessna you are not the priority number one is said artemis they need to get him below ground i understand yes him and say no more old friend said artemis sharply opal is listening the lep are here artemis i want you to turn round and fly back no said artemis firmly i will not put mother at risk again artemis heard a strange creaking sound and surmised that butler was strangling the microphone stalk ok another location then somewhere we can dig ourselves in very well i am on a southerly heading anyway so why not artemis never completed his veiled suggestion as his channel was blocked by a deafening burst of white noise the squawk left a droning aftershock in his ears and for a moment he allowed the cessna to drift no sooner had he regained control than a thudding blow to the fuselage caused him to lose it again several red lights flashed on the displayplane solarpanel icon at least ten panels had been shattered by the impact artemis spared half a second to check the rear camera opal was no longer trailing behind no surprise there the pixies voice burst through the radio speakers sharp with petulance and evil intent i am strong now mud boy she said your poison is gone flushed from my system my power grows and i am hungry for more artemis did not engage in conversation all his skill and quick thinking would be needed to pilot the cessna opal struck again on the port wing smashing her forearms into the solar panels breaking them as a child would break sheets of ice in a pool windmilling her arms gleefully wings buzzing to keep pace the plane bucked and yawed and artemis fought the stick to pull the craft level shes insane thought artemis utterly insane and those panels are unique and she calls herself a scientist opal scampered along the wing punching an armoured fist into the fuselage itself more panels were obliterated and tiny fistsized dents buckled the polymer over artemiss shoulder tiny cracks ran along the dents slit by the wind opals voice was loud in the speaker land fowl land and i may not return to the manor when i have finished with you land land each order to land was emphasized by another blow on the cockpit the windscreen exploded inwards showering artemis with jagged chunks of plexiglass land land you have the product artemis reminded himself so you have the power opal cannot afford to kill jayjay the wind screamed in artemiss face and the readings from his flight instruments made no sense unless opal was scrambling them with the lep suits field but artemis still had a chance there was fight left in this fowl he pointed the nose downwards banking sharply left opal kept pace easily tearing strips from the fuselage she was a destructive shadow in the dimming dusk light artemis could smell the sea he was too low too soon more red lights on the instrument panel the power supply had been cut the batteries were breached the altimeter whirred and beeped opal was at the side window artemis could see her tiny teeth grinning at him she was saying something shouting but the radio was not operational any more just as well probably she is having the time of her life he realized fun fun fun artemis struggled with the controls the sticky flaps were the least of his worries now if opal decided to snip a few cables then he would lose whatever say he had over the plane though it was too early artemis lowered the tricycle landing gear if opal sabotaged the mechanism now the wheels should stay down they plummeted earthwards locked together a sparrow on an eagles back opal smashed her armoured head through the door windows plexiglass still shouting inside the helmet spittle spraying the visor issuing orders that artemis could not hear and could not spare enough time to lipread he could see that her eyes glowed red with magic and it was clear from her manic expression that any threads connecting her to rationality had been severed more shouting muffled behind the visor artemis cast a sardonic gaze at the radio which sat dead and dark in its cradle opal caught the look and raised her visor shouting over the wind too impatient for the helmet pa give me the lemur and i will save you she said her voice mesmerizing you have my artemis avoided her gaze and pulled the emergency flare gun from under the seat sticking it in her face you leave me no choice but to shoot you he said voice cold and certain this was not a threat it was a statement of fact opal knew the truth when she heard it and for one second her resolve wavered she pulled back but not quickly enough to prevent artemis from firing the flare into her helmet then reaching up to flick down the visor opal spun away from the cessna trailing black smoke red sparks swarming round her head like angry wasps her wing smashed into the cessnas and neither survived intact solarcell splinters flashed like stardust and tail feathers from opals flying rig helicoptered slowly earthwards the aeroplane yawed to starboard moaning like a wounded animal i need to land now artemis didnt feel guilty about what hed done flare burns would not hinder a being of opals regenerative power for long already the magic would be repairing her skin damage at best he had bought himself a few minutes reprieve when opal comes back she will be beyond furious a true maniac perhaps her judgement will be clouded artemis smiled grimly and for a moment he felt like his old conniving self before holly and his mother had introduced him to their pesky moral codes good clouded judgement may give me the advantage i need artemis levelled the craft as much as he could slowing his descent wind slapped his face tugging his skin shielding his eyes with a forearm he peered downwards through the blur of propeller spin hook head peninsula jutted into the blackness of the sea below him like a slategrey arrowhead a cluster of lights winked on the eastern curve this was the village of duncade where butler had awaited his young charges return from limbo a magical inlet which had once sheltered the demon isle of hybras the entire area was a magical hotspot and would set lep spectrometers buzzing dark blue night was falling quickly and it was difficult to tell hard ground from soft artemis knew that a carpet of meadow ran from duncade to the hook head lighthouse but could only see the grass strip once every five seconds when it flashed emerald in the towers beam my runway thought artemis he dragged the cessna into the best possible approach line descending in uneven stomachlurching swoops solar panels frittered away from the nose and wings streaming behind the craft still no sign of opal shes coming make no mistake about it with each flash of green the hard earth rushed up to meet him too fast thought artemis i am coming in too fast i will never get my legal pilots licence flying like this he clenched his jaws and held the stick tightly touchdown was going to be rough and it was though not boneshatteringly so not the first time it was on the second bounce that artemis was shunted forward into the console and heard the left side of his collarbone snap a horrible sound that brought bile to his throat no pain yet just cold i am going into shock the cessnas wheels skidded on the long grass which was coated with seaspray and slicker than ice artemis scowled not because of his injuries but because his fate was in the hands of chance now he had no control opal would be coming for jayjay and he must do his utmost to distract her the outside world continued to intrude most violently on artemiss thoughts the front wheel strut glanced off a sharp rock shearing away completely for several seconds the wheel continued to roll alongside the plane until it veered off into the darkness another bump and the cessna collapsed on to its nose propeller ploughing furrows in the earth sheaves of grass fanned the air and clods of muck rained through the holes in the windscreen artemis tasted earth and thought i dont see what mulch makes all the fuss about its not exactly lobster mousse then he was out of the plane and stumbling towards the rocky shoreline artemis did not call for help and none would have come if he had the rocks were black treacherous and deserted the sea was loud and the wind blew high even if the lighthouse beam had pinned the falling planes image to the sky it would be a long while before unarmed unsuspecting villagers arrived to offer assistance and by then it would be too late artemis stumbled on his left arm hanging low his good hand cupped the furry head poking from the front of his jacket almost there he panted a pair of sea stacks jutted from the waters like the last teeth from the gums of a tobacco chewer thirtymetrehigh hardrock columns that had resisted the erosive power of wind and wave the locals called them the nuns because of their sisterly appearance headtotoe habits the nuns were quite the local attraction and sturdy rope bridges spanned the chasms from shore to little sister and on to mother superior butler once told artemis that he had spent many lonely nights on the second sea stack with nightvision binoculars glassing the ocean for a sign of hybras artemis stepped on to the first span of the bridge it rippled and creaked slightly under his feet but held firm he saw the sea far below through the slats flat rocks pushing through the surface like mushrooms through clay the body of an unlucky dog lay splayed on one of the lower rocks a stark reminder of what could happen if you lost your footing on the nuns i am hurrying towards a dead end he told himself once i reach the second stack there is nowhere to go but down but there was no choice a quick glance over his shoulder told him that opal was coming he did not even need his shieldfiltered sunglasses to see her the pixie had no magic to spare for invisibility she lurched zombielike across the meadow a red haze of magic lighting her face inside the helmet fists clenched balls at her side her wings were outstretched but tattered and battered she would not be flying anywhere on those only the power of jayjay could save opal now he was her last hope for victory if she did not inject his brain fluid soon then surely the lep would arrive to protect the endangered lemur artemis walked across the bridge careful not to bash his dangling arm against the railing miraculously he was in little constant pain but every footstep sent a throb of whitehot agony flashing across his upper chest distract her a while longer then the cavalry will surely arrive the winged invisible cavalry they wouldnt abandon him would they fowl the shriek came from behind him closer than he expected give me the monkey the voice was layered with wasted magic no eye contact no mesmer monkey thought artemis smirking ha ha further across the chasm blackness above and below star points in the sky and sea waves growling like tigers hungry artemis stumbled towards the first nun little sister stepping out on to a rock plateau worn treacherous his foot slipped on the surface and he spun across the diameter of the summit like a ballroom dancer with an unseen partner he heard opals shriek for jayjay to die now would be disaster as she would be stuck in this time with the entire lep on her trail and no ultimate powers artemis did not look back though he ached to he could hear opal clanking across the boards swearing with each breath the words sounded almost comical in her childlike pixie voice nowhere to go but forward artemis almost fell on to the second span of bridge pulling himself along the rope rail until he arrived at mother superior locals said that if you stood at the right point on the coastline at sunrise and squinted a little then you could just make out stern features on the mother superiors face the rock felt stern now bleak and unforgiving even one false step would not be tolerated artemis dropped to his knees on the mushroom curve of the plateau cupping his left elbow in his right palm soon shock and pain will overcome me not yet genius focus artemis glanced down to the v of his jacket the furry head was gone dropped on little sister waiting for opal this was confirmed by a sudden shriek of delight from behind artemis turned slowly and with great effort to face his enemy it seemed as though he had been fighting her forever the pixie stood atop the sea stack almost dancing with delight artemis could see a small furry figure splayed on the plateau i have him opal cackled with all your genius with your big bursting brain you dropped him you simply dropped him artemis felt the throb build in his shoulder in a minute there would be worse coming he was certain of it opal stretched two hands towards her prize he is mine she said reverentially and artemis swore he heard thunder in the distance the ultimate magic is mine i have the lemur artemis spoke clearly so his words would carry across the divide its not a lemur he said its a monkey opals smile froze all tiny teeth and she grabbed what she had thought was jayjay the figure was soft in her hands a toy she gasped this is a toy artemiss triumph was dulled by pain and exhaustion opal meet professor primate my brothers plaything a toy repeated opal dully but there were two heat sources i saw them microwave gel pack stuffed inside the foam explained artemis its over opal jayjay is in haven by now you cant get him turn yourself in and i wont have to hurt you opals features were twisted with rage hurt me hurt me she dashed the toy monkey against the rock surface over and over again until the dented works fell out a metallic voice issued from the speaker history will remember this day history will history will remember this day opal screamed and red sparks boiled round her fingertips i cannot fly and i cannot shoot lightning but i have enough magic to boil your brain opals dreams of supreme power were forgotten at that moment all she wanted to do was kill artemis fowl she stepped on to the second span with murder in her heart artemis stood wearily reaching into his pocket your armour should save you he said to opal his voice calm it will be terrifying but the lep will dig you out opal scoffed more tactics bluff and double bluff not this time artemis dont make me do this opal artemis pleaded just sit down and wait for the lep no one needs to get hurt oh i think someone needs to get hurt said opal artemis took a modified laser pointer from his pocket activating the narrow beam and aiming it at the base of little sister what are you going to do with that thing it would take a hundred years to saw through this rock im not trying to saw through it said artemis keeping the beam steady and its not a rock opal raised her hands sparks laced like barbed wire round her fingers no more talk artemiss laser beam cut deep into the base of little sister until it pierced the outer shell and reached the vast pocket of methane beneath little sister was not a rock it was the seventh kraken attracted by the magical resonance of hybras artemis had been studying it for years not even foaly knew it was there the explosion was huge shooting a column of fire fifteen metres into the air the outer shell collapsed under opal engulfing her in a blizzard of shrapnel artemis heard the dull twang of her lep armour flexing to take the shock foalys armour should save her he threw himself flat on the sea stack suffering the rain of rock weed and even fish on his back and legs luck will save me now only luck and luck did save him the plateau was hammered with several sizeable missiles but none struck artemis he was hailed with smaller objects and would have a hundred bruises and cuts to add to his list of injuries but not a single bone was broken when the world felt as though it had stopped vibrating artemis crawled to the lip of the sea stack and gazed down at the bubbling sea below a pyramid of rubble steamed gently in the waves where the kraken had been the great beast would be moving away silently now to find another magical hotspot of opal there was no sign the lep will find her artemis turned over on his back and watched the stars he did this often and the sight usually caused him to wonder how he could reach the planets orbiting those pinpricks of light and what he would find there on this evening the stars just made him feel tiny and insignificant nature was vast and mighty and would eventually swallow him even the memory of him he lay there cold and alone on the plateau waiting for a feeling of triumph that he realized would never arrive and listening to the distant shouts of the villagers as they made their way across the long meadow holly arrived before the villagers gliding in from the north touching down soundlessly on the sea stack youre flying said artemis as though he had never seen this before i borrowed a suit from number ones bodyguards well i say borrowed how did you find me asked artemis though he could guess oh i saw a huge explosion and wondered now who could that be hmm said artemis a bit of a giveaway also i followed my old suits radiation trail im still following it holly touched a finger to her visor and the filter changed thats quite a pile of rocks you dumped on opal its going to take a retrieval team some time to dig her out shes cursing like a tunnel dwarf down there what did you do to her the seventh kraken explained artemis the one foaly missed because it was tubular rather than conical i would guess i picked it up on a weather satellite holly placed a finger on artemiss forehead typical artemis fowl beaten to a pulp and still he delivers a lecture magical sparks flowed from hollys fingertip engulfing artemis like a cocoon he felt comforted and peaceful like a baby in its blanket his pains were wiped away and his shattered collarbone liquefied then solidified whole nice trick he said smiling his eyes glassy im here till tuesday said holly smiling back number one filled my tank artemis gazed up at his friend through a red haze im sorry i lied to you holly truly youve done so much hollys eyes were distant maybe you made the wrong decision maybe i would have made that decision myself were from different worlds artemis we will always have doubts about each other lets just carry on and leave the past in the past where it should be artemis nodded that was as good as he was going to get and better than he deserved holly pulled a tether from her belt looping it under artemiss arms now lets get you home before the villagers start building a gallows good idea mumbled artemis drowsy with the aftereffects of his magical makeover yes believe it or not other people do have those occasionally occasionally agreed artemis then his head lolled back and he was asleep holly reset her wings for the added weight and launched them both off the lip of the sea stack flying low to avoid the torch beams of the locals that strobed the night sky like searchlights foaly tuned into hollys helmet frequency while she was airborne the seventh kraken im guessing of course i had my suspicions he paused this would be a good opportunity to mindwipe artemis he said save ourselves a lot of grief in the future foaly said holly horrified we dont wipe our friends artemis brought jayjay back to us who knows how many cures lie in that lemurs brain im kidding im kidding and guess what we wont even have to ask jayjay to donate some brain fluid number one synthesized it while he was waiting for the shuttle that kid is one of a kind i seem to run into a lot of those by the way we need to send a team in for opal theyre en route i think youre in for another rake over the coals from ia when you get back here holly snorted whats new foaly fell silent waiting for holly to share the details of her adventures eventually he could wait no more ok you win ill ask what happened back then eight years ago my gods it must have been mayhem holly felt a phantom tingle on her lips where she had kissed artemis nothing nothing happened we went we got the lemur we came back a couple of glitches but obviously nothing we couldnt handle foaly didnt press for details holly would tell him when she had processed it herself do you ever think you might like to go to work and then just come home no drama holly watched the ocean flash by below her and felt the weight of artemis fowl in her arms no she said i never think that chapter a team of hairdressers less than an hour later they landed at fowl manor artemis woke up just as hollys heels hit the gravel and was instantly alert magic is wonderful stuff he said pinwheeling his left arm you should have held on to yours quipped holly ironically if i had not attempted to cure mother opal would have allowed her to recover it was my journey into the past that gave opal the basis for her plan which she instigated by following us to her future i liked you better asleep said holly retrieving her tether my head hurt less its the big time paradox if i had done nothing then nothing would have needed to be done holly touched her helmet let me get foaly on the com you two could both talk at the same time the exterior lights cast a soft glow on the gravel setting the stones shimmering like gems lofty evergreen trees swayed in the gentle breeze rustling with life like tolkiens creatures artemis watched holly stride towards the main doors if only he thought if only n sat on the front step flanked by a squad of lep officers bristling with the latest weaponry artemis knew that his dna was coded into their guns and all they had to do was select his icon from a list and there would be no escape jayjay had wrapped himself around the demons crown like a hunting cap and seemed most comfortable there he roused himself when he saw artemis leaping into the boys arms a dozen lep rifles instantly beeped and artemis guessed that his icon was being selected hello there little fellow how do you like the present n answered for the lemur he likes it fine especially now that no one will be sticking any needles in his head artemis nodded you duplicated the fluid i thought that might be an option where is doctor schalke he collapsed once opal departed butler put him in a guest room and artemis junior technically you are artemis junior replied n but i know what you are trying to ask me your younger self has been transported back to his own time i sent a retrieval captain and stayed here as a marker i thought you would want him out of the way as soon as possible what with your father and the twins on their way home artemis tickled jayjay under the chin it might have proved awkward holly was troubled i know we promised not to wipe him but im not particularly thrilled that theres a little fowl running around with fairy knowledge in his devious skull artemis raised an eyebrow devious skull charming hey if the flap fits n was a little pale with a flex of his tail he lifted his squat rump from the step about this no mindwiping promise the thing is nobody told me holly stared at him so you wiped him n nodded and schalke i also left a residual spell in young artemiss eyeballs so butler will get it too nothing fancy just a blanket memory loss their brains will fill in the gaps invent believable memories holly shuddered you left a spell in his eyeballs that is revolting revolting but ingenious said artemis holly was surprised you dont seem too indignant i was expecting a speech rolling eyes flapping arms the whole fowl thing artemis shrugged i knew it would happen i didnt remember anything so i must have been wiped therefore we must have won you always knew i didnt know what the cost would be n sighed so im off the hook as you humans say absolutely said holly clapping him on the shoulder i feel a lot better now on the positive side i bolstered your atomic structure your atoms were a bit rattled by the time stream im amazed you are still in one piece i can only imagine how hard you were forced to concentrate well you had bolstered my atoms and i have to beg one more favour said artemis i need you to send a note back in time ive been ordered not to open the time stream again but maybe we can squeeze back one more thing said n artemis nodded thats what i thought when and where holly knows you can do it from tara how do you spell stupendous said holly smiling artemis stepped back craning his neck to peer upwards at the front window of his parents room jayjay mimicked the action climbing on to artemiss shoulders and tilting his tiny head back im afraid to go up for some reason he noticed himself wringing his fingers and stuffed both hands in his jacket pockets what she must have been through all because of my meddling what she must have dont forget us interjected n we were submerged in animal fat you have no idea how gross that is eyeball spells are the epitome of good taste compared to animal fat i was turned into an adolescent said holly winking at artemis now that was gross artemiss smile was forced strangely all this guilt tripping is not making me feel any better the dna cannons arent helping either holly gestured at the lep squad to stand down then tilted her head slightly as a message came through theres a chopper coming in your father weve got to fly n wagged a finger and thats not just a figure of speech we actually have to fly i know humans use that expression even when they dont intend to actually fly so just to avoid confusion i get it number one said artemis softly holly raised her forearm and jayjay jumped on to it he will be safer with us i know he turned to holly meeting her gaze blue and hazel eyes she gazed back for a second then activated her wings rising a little from the surface in another time she said and kissed him on the cheek he was at the front door before holly called to him you know something fowl you did a good thing here for its own sake not one penny of profit artemis grimaced i know im appalled he looked down at his feet composing a pithy remark but when he looked up again the avenue was empty goodbye my friends he said take care of jayjay artemis could hear helicopter rotors in the distance by the time he reached his mothers bedroom he would have some explaining to do but he had a feeling that artemis senior would not press him for details once he saw angeline in good health artemis flexed his fingers summoning his courage then pushed through into the bedchamber the bed was empty his mother sat at her dresser despairing at the state of her hair oh dear arty she said in mock horror on spotting her son in the mirror look at me i need a team of hairdressers flown in immediately from london you look fine mother mum wonderful angeline ran a pearlhandled brush through her long hair the lustre returning with each stroke considering what i have been through yes you were ill but you are better now angeline turned on her dresser stool reaching out her arms come here my hero hug your mother artemis was happy to do as he was told a thought struck him hero why did she call him a hero generally victims of the mesmer remembered nothing of their ordeal but butler had remembered what opal had done to him he had even described the experience to artemis schalke had been wiped but what of mother angeline held him tightly you have done so much arty risked everything the rotors were loud now rattling the windows his father was home i didnt do so much mum what any son would do angelines hand cradled his head he could feel her tears on his cheek i know everything arty everything that creature left me her memories i tried to fight her but she was too strong what creature mother it was the fever you had a hallucination thats all angeline held him at arms length i was in the diseased hell of that pixies brain artemis dont you dare lie to me and say that i wasnt i saw your friends almost die to help you i saw butlers heart stop i saw you save us all look me in the eye and tell me these things did not happen artemis found it difficult to meet his mothers stare and when he did it was impossible to lie they happened all of them and more angeline frowned you have a brown eye why did i not notice that i put a spell on you said artemis miserably and on your father him too below the front door crashed open his fathers footsteps raced across the lobby then on to the stairway you saved me artemis said his mother hurriedly but i have a feeling that all your spellcasting in some way put us in this situation so i want to know everything everything do you understand artemis nodded he couldnt see how to escape this he was in a dead end and the only way out was complete honesty now we will give your father and the twins time to hug me and kiss me then you and i are going to have a talk it will be our secret understood understood artemis sat on the bed he felt six years old again when he had been caught hacking into the school computers to make the test questions a little more challenging his father was on the landing now artemis knew that his secret life ended today as soon as his mother got him alone he would be explaining himself starting at the beginning abductions uprisings time jaunts goblin revolutions everything complete honesty he thought artemis fowl shuddered some hours later the master bedroom had been transformed by the whirlwind known as beckett fowl there were pizza boxes on the night table and tomatosauce finger paintings on the wall beckett had stripped off his own clothes and dressed himself in one of his fathers tshirts which he had belted round his waist he had applied a mascara moustache and lipstick scars to his face and was currently fencing with an invisible enemy using one of his fathers old prosthetic legs as a sword artemis was finishing his explanation of angelines miraculous recovery and then i realized that mother had somehow contracted glovers fever which is usually confined to madagascar so i synthesized the natural cure preferred by the locals and administered it relief was immediate beckett noticed that artemis had stopped talking and heaved a dramatic sigh of relief he rode an imaginary horse across the room and poked myles with the prosthetic leg good story he asked his twin myles climbed down from the bed and placed his mouth beside becketts ear artemis simpletoon he confided epilogue hook head ireland commander trouble kelp led the retrieval team to dig opal koboi out of the rubble himself they inflated a distortion bubble over the work zone so they could fire up the shuttles lasers without fear of discovery hurry up furty trouble called over an open channel we have one hour until sunrise lets get that megalomaniacal pixie out of there and back into her own time they were lucky to have a dwarf on the team normally dwarfs were extremely reluctant to work with the authorities but this one had agreed so long as he didnt have to work any of the hundred and ninetyodd dwarf holy days and if the lep paid his exorbitant consultants fees in a situation like this one dwarfs were invaluable they could work rubble like no other species if you wanted to dig something out alive then dwarfs were the ones to do it all they needed to do was let their beard hairs play over a surface and they could tell you more about what was going on under that surface than any amount of seismic or geological equipment currently trouble was monitoring furty pullchains progress through the kraken debris on the feed from his helmet cam the dwarfs limbs were a shade paler than usual in the nightvision filter one hand directed a nozzle of support foam that coated the tunnel wall at stress points and the other reached in under his beard to rehinge his jaw ok commander he said managing to make the rank seem like a insult i made it to the spot its a miracle im alive this thing is as steady as a house of cards in a hurricane yeah whatever furty youre a marvel now pull her out and lets get below ground i have a captain i need to discipline keep yer acorns on commander im readin the beacon loud and clear trouble fumed silently maybe holly short was not the only one who would have to be disciplined he followed the live feed watching furty scoop aside the rock weed and shell fragments covering hollys suit except there was no suit just a helmet with its flashing tracer beacon i come all this way for a helmet said furty aggrieved aint no pixie here just the smell of one trouble sat up straight are you sure could you be in the wrong spot furty snorted yep im at the other buried lep helmet course im sure she was gone opal had disappeared impossible how could she escape beats me said furty maybe she squeezed through a natural tunnel them pixies are slippery little creatures i remember one time when i was a sprog me and kherb my cousin broke into a trouble cut him off this was serious opal koboi was loose in the world he put a video call in to foaly in police plaza dont tell me said the centaur running a hand down his long face shes gone she left the helmet so the beacon would draw us in any vitals from her suit foaly checked his monitor nothing it was loud and clear until five minutes ago i thought it was a suit malfunction trouble took a breath put out an alert priority one i want the guard tripled on our koboi in atlantis it would be just like opal to bust herself out foaly got to it one opal koboi had almost managed to take over the world two would probably shoot for the entire galaxy and call holly continued commander kelp inform the captain that her weekend leave is cancelled fowl manor almost eight years ago artemis fowl awoke in his own bed and for a moment red sparks danced before his eyes they sparkled and twinkled hypnotically before chasing their own tails out of existence red sparks he thought unusual i have seen stars before but never sparks the tenyearold boy stretched grabbing handfuls of his own duvet for some reason he felt more content than usual i feel safe and happy artemis sat bolt upright happy i feel happy he couldnt remember feeling truly happy since his father had disappeared but on this morning his mood was bordering on cheerful perhaps it was the deal with the extinctionists my first major chunk of profit no that wasnt it that particular transaction had left artemis feeling sick to the pit of his stomach so much so that he couldnt think about it and would probably never dwell on the past few days again so what could account for this feeling of optimism something from the dream hed been having a plan a new scheme that would bring enough profit to fund a hundred arctic expeditions that was it the dream what had it been about it was just out of reach the images already fading a crafty smile twitched at the corner of his mouth fairies something about fairies the end
