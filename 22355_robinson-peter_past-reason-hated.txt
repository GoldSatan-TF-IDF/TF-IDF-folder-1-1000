peter robinson past reason hated the fifth book in the inspector banks series this one is for the usual suspects one snow fell on swainsdale for the first time that year a few days before christmas out in the dale among the more remote farms and hamlets the locals would be cursing a heavy snowfall could mean lost sheep and blocked roads in past years some places had been cut off for as long as five weeks but in eastvale most of those crossing the market square on the evening of december felt a surge of joy as the fat flakes drifted down glistening in the gaslight as they fell to form a lumpy white carpet over the cobblestones detective constable susan gay paused on her way back to the station from joplins newsagents outside the norman church stood a tall christmas tree a gift from the norwegian town with which eastvale was twinned the lights winked on and off and its tapered branches bent under the weight of half an inch of snow in front of the tree a group of children in red choirgowns stood singing once in royal davids city their alto voices fragile but clear seemed especially fitting on such a beautiful winters evening susan tilted her head back and let the snowflakes melt on her eyelids two weeks ago she would not have allowed herself to do something so spontaneous and frivolous but now that she was detective constable gay she could afford to relax a little she had finished with courses and exams at least until she tried for sergeant now there would be no more arguing with david craig over who made the coffee there would be no more walking the beat either and no more traffic duty on market day the music followed her as she headed back to the station and he leads his children on to the place where he is gone directly in front of her the new blue lamp hung like a shopsign over the doorway of the tudorfronted police station in an attempt to change the public image of the force tarnished by race riots sex scandals and accusations of highlevel corruption the government had looked to the past more specifically to the fifties the lamp was straight out of dixon of dock green susan had never actually seen the programme but she understood the basic idea the image of the kindly old copper on the beat had caused many a laugh around eastvale regional headquarters would that life were simple they all said her second day on the job and all was well she pushed open the door and headed for the stairs upstairs the inner sanctum of the cid she had envied them all for so long gristhorpe banks richmond even hatchley when she had brought messages or stood by taking notes while they interrogated female suspects no longer she was one of them now and she was about to show them that a woman could do the job every bit as well as a man if not better she didnt have her own office only banks and gristhorpe were allowed such luxuries the hutch she shared with richmond would have to do it looked over the carpark out the back not the market square but at least she had a desk rickety though it was and a filing cabinet of her own she had inherited them from sergeant hatchley now exiled to the coast and the first thing she had had to do was rip down the nude pinups from the cork bulletin board above his desk how anybody could work with those bloated mammaries hanging over them was beyond her about forty minutes later after she had poured herself a cup of coffee to keep her awake while she studied the latest regional crime reports the phone rang it was sergeant rowe calling from the front desk someone just phoned in to report a murder he said susan felt the adrenalin flow she grasped the receiver tighter where oakwood mews you know those tartedup bijou terraces at the back of king street i know them any details not much it was a neighbour who called said the woman next door went rushing into the street screaming she took her in but couldnt get much sense out of her except that her friend had been murdered did the neighbour take a look for herself no she said she thought shed better call us right away can you send pc tolliver down there susan asked tell him to check out the scene without touching anything and tell him to stay by the door and not let anyone in till we get there aye said rowe but shouldnt whats the number eleven right susan hung up her heart beat fast nothing had happened in eastvale for months and now on only her second day on the new job a murder and she was the only member of the cid on duty that evening calm down she told herself follow procedure do it right she reached for her coat still damp with snow then hurried out the back way to the car park shivering she swept the snow off the windscreen of her red golf and drove off as fast as the bad weather allowed two four and twenty virgins came down from inverness and when the ball was over there were four and twenty less i think jims a bit pissed detective chief inspector alan banks leaned over and said to his wife sandra sandra nodded in a corner of the eastvale rugby club banquet room by the christmas tree detective sergeant jim hatchley stood with a group of cronies all as big and brawny as himself they looked like a parody of a group of carol singers banks thought each with a foaming pint in his hand as they sang they swayed the other guests stood by the bar or sat at tables chatting over the noise carol hatchley née ellis the sergeants blushing bride sat beside her mother and fumed the couple had just changed out of their wedding clothes into less formal attire in readiness for their honeymoon but hatchley true to form had insisted on just one more pint before they left that one had quickly turned into two then three the village butcher he was there chopper in his hand every time they played a waltz he circumcised the band it didnt make sense banks thought how many times could you circumcise one band carol managed a weak smile then turned and said something to her mother who shrugged banks leaning against the long bar with sandra superintendent gristhorpe and philip richmond ordered another round of drinks as he waited he looked around the room it was done up for the festive season no doubt about that red and green concertina trimmings hung across the ceiling bedecked with tinsel holly and the occasional sprig of mistletoe the club tree a good seven feet tall sparkled in all its glory it was twenty past eight and the real party was just beginning the wedding had taken place at eastvale congregational church late in the afternoon and it had been followed by a slapup meal at the rugby club at six now the speeches had been made the plates cleared away and the tables moved for a good yorkshire kneesup hatchley had hired a dj for the music but the poor lad was still waiting patiently for a signal to begin singing balls to your father arse against the wall if youve never been shagged on a saturday night youve never been shagged at all four and twenty virgins was coming to a close banks could tell there would be a verse about the village schoolmistress who had unusually large breasts and one about the village cripple who did unspeakable things with his crutch then a rousing finale with a bit of luck that would be the end of the rugby songs they had already performed dinah dinah show us yer leg a yard above your knees the engineers song and a lengthy improvized version of mademoiselle from armentieres the sulky dj who had been pretending to set up his equipment for the past hour would soon get his chance to shine banks passed the drinks along to the others and reached for a cigarette gristhorpe frowned at him but banks was used to that phil richmond was also smoking one of his occasional panatellas so the superintendent was having a particularly hard time of it sandra had stopped smoking completely and banks had agreed not to smoke in the house luckily although most of the police station had been declared a nonsmoking area he was still permitted to light up in his own office things had got so bad though that even alleged criminals brought in for interrogation could legally object to any police officer smoking in the interview rooms it was a sorry state of affairs banks mused you could beat them to your hearts content as long as the bruises didnt show but you couldnt smoke in their presence and get away with it sandra raised her dark eyebrows and breathed a sigh of relief when four and twenty virgins came to an end but her joy was short lived the choir of rugby forwards refused to leave the stage without giving their rendition of good king wenceslas despite groans from the captive audience a dirty look from the dj and a positive flash of fury from carols eyes sergeant hatchley led them off good king wenceslas looked out of his bedroom window silly bugger he fell out gristhorpe looked at his watch i think ill be off after this one i just overheard someone say its snowing pretty heavily out there now is it sandra said banks knew she loved snow they walked over to the window at the far end of the room and glanced out clearly satisfied with what she saw sandra pulled the long curtains open it had been snowing only lightly when they had arrived for predinner drinks at about five but now the high window framed a thick swirl of white flakes falling on the rugby field others turned to look oohing and aahing touching their neighbours on the arm to tell them what was happening as they walked back banks took sandra in his arms and kissed her got you he said then he looked up and sandra followed his gaze to the mistletoe hanging above them sandra took his arm and walked beside him back to the bar i dont mean to be rude or anything she said but whens this racket going to end dont you think someone should have a word with jim after all it is carols wedding day banks looked at hatchley judging by his flushed face and the way he swayed there wouldnt be much of a wedding night for the bride brightly shone his arse that night though the frost was cruel banks was just about to walk across and say something only concerned that he might sound too much like the boss when he was just a wedding guest when he was saved by the dj a long and loud blast of feedback issued from the speakers and stopped hatchley and his mates in their tracks before they could regather their wits for a further onslaught several quickthinking members of the party applauded at once the singers took this as their cue for a bow and the dj as his opportunity to begin the real music he adjusted a couple of dials skipped the patter and before hatchley and his mob even knew what had hit them the hall was filled with the sound of martha and the vandellas singing dancing in the street sandra smiled thats more like it banks glanced over at richmond who looked very pleased with himself and well he might there had just been a big changearound at eastvale regional police headquarters sergeant hatchley had been a problem for some time not suitable material for promotion he had stood in richmonds way even though richmond had passed his sergeants examination with flying colours and shown remarkable aptitude on the job the trouble was there just wasnt room for two detective sergeants in the small station finally after months of trying to find a way out of the dilemma superintendent gristhorpe had seized the first opportunity that came his way official borders had been redrawn and the region had expanded eastwards to take in a section of the north york moors and a small stretch of coastline between scarborough and whitby it seemed a good idea to place a small cid outpost on the coast to deal with the daytoday matters that might arise there and hatchley came to mind as the man to head it he was competent enough just lazy and inattentive to detail surely gristhorpe had reasoned to banks he couldnt do much damage in a sleepy fishing village like saltby bay hatchley had been asked if he fancied living by the seaside and he had said yes after all it was still in yorkshire as the time of the move coincided with his impending marriage it had seemed sensible to combine the two celebrations though hatchley remained a sergeant gristhorpe had managed to wangle him a small pay increase and more important he would be in charge he was to take david craig now a detective constable with him craig soaking up the ale at the other end of the bar didnt look too pleased about it hatchley and his wife were off to saltby bay that night or the way things were going the next morning where he was to take two weeks leave to set up their cottage by the sea his only complaint was that it wouldnt be summer for a long time apart from that hatchley seemed happy enough with the state of affairs in eastvale richmond had got his promotion to detective sergeant at last and susan gay had been brought upstairs as their new detective constable it was too early to know whether the arrangement would work but banks had every confidence in both richmond and gay still he felt sad he had been in eastvale almost three years and during that time he had grown to like and depend on sergeant hatchley despite the mans obvious faults it had taken banks until last summer to call the sergeant by his first name but he felt that hatchley with superintendent gristhorpe had been responsible for helping him adapt to yorkshire ways after his move from london the music slowed down percy sledge started singing when a man loves a woman sandra touched bankss arm dance banks took her hand and they walked towards the dance floor before they got there someone tapped him gently on the shoulder he turned and saw dc susan gay snowflakes still melting on the shoulders of her navy coat and in her short curly blonde hair what is it banks asked can i have a word sir somewhere quiet the only quiet place was the toilets and they could hardly go charging off into the gents or ladies the alternative was the corner opposite the dj which seemed to be deserted banks asked sandra if she minded missing this one she shrugged being used to such privations and went back to the bar gristhorpe banks noticed gallantly offered her his arm and they went onto the dance floor its a murder at least a possible murder dc gay said as soon as they had found a quieter spot i didnt see the superintendent when i came in so i went straight to you any details sketchy how long ago was this about ten minutes i sent pc tolliver to the house and drove straight over here im sorry to spoil the celebrations but i couldnt see what else its all right banks said you did fine she hadnt but that was hardly her fault she was new to the job and a murder report had cropped up what should she have done well she could have gone to check out the scene herself and she might have found as nine times out of ten one did that there had been some mistake or a prank or she might have waited for the pc to call in and let her know the situation before running off and dragging her chief inspector away from his exsergeants wedding celebration but banks didnt blame her she was young yet she would learn and if they really were dealing with a murder the time saved by susans direct action could prove invaluable ive got the address sir she stood there looking at him keen expectant its on oakwood mews number eleven banks sighed wed better go then just give me a minute he went back to the bar and explained the situation to richmond the music speeded up again into the supremes baby love and gristhorpe led sandra back from the dance floor when he heard the news he insisted on accompanying banks to the scene even though it was by no means certain they would find a murder victim there richmond wanted to come along too no lad said gristhorpe theres no point if its serious alan can fill you in later and dont tell sergeant hatchley i dont want it spoiling his wedding day though judging by the look on young carols face he might have already done that himself are you taking the car sandra asked banks id better oakwood mews is a fair distance from here theres no telling how long well be if theres time ill come back and pick you up if not dont worry phil will take good care of you oh im not worried she slipped her arm in richmonds and the new detective sergeant blushed phils a lovely mover banks kissed her quickly and set off with gristhorpe susan gay stood waiting for them by the door before they got to her one of hatchleys rugby club cronies lurched over and tried to kiss her from behind banks saw him put his arms around her then double up and stagger back everyone else was too busy dancing or chatting to notice susan looked flushed when banks and gristhorpe got there she put her hand to her mouth and muttered im sorry while the rugby player pointed with a hurt expression on his face to the sprig of mistletoe over the door three it was no false alarm that much at least was clear from the expression on pc tollivers face when banks and the others reached number eleven oakwood mews after gristhorpe had issued instructions to send for dr glendenning and the sceneofcrime team the three detectives went inside the first thing banks noticed when he entered the hall was the music muffled coming from the front room it sounded familiar a bach cantata perhaps then he opened the livingroom door and paused on the threshold the scene possessed a picturesque quality he felt which even extended at first to masking the ugliness of the corpse on the sofa a log fire crackled in the hearth its flames tossed shadows on the sheepskin rug and over the stucco walls the only other light came from two red candles on the polished oak table in the far corner and from the christmas tree lights in the window banks stepped into the room the flames danced and the beautiful music played on on the wall above the stereo was a print of one of gauguins tahitian scenes a coffeeskinned native woman naked to the waist carrying what looked like a bowl of red berries as she walked beside another woman as he approached the sofa banks noticed that the sheepskin rug was dotted with dark blotches as if the fire had spat sparks which had seared the wool then he became aware of that sickling metallic smell he had come across so often before a log shifted on the fire flames leapt in all directions and their light played over the naked body the woman lay stretched out head propped up on cushions in what would have been a very inviting pose had it not been for the blood that had flowed from the multiple stab wounds in her throat and chest and drenched the whole front of her body it glistened like dark satin in the firelight from what banks could see the victim was young and pretty with smooth olive skin and shoulderlength jetblack hair bending over her he noticed that her eyes were blue the intense kind of blue that makes some darkhaired people all that much more attractive now their stare was cold and lifeless in front of her on the low coffee table stood a halfempty teacup on a coaster and a chocolate layer cake with one slice missing banks covered one fingertip with his handkerchief and touched the cup it was cold the spell broke banks became aware of gristhorpes voice in the background questioning pc tolliver and of susan gay standing silent beside him it was her first corpse he realized and she was handling it well better than he had not only was she not about to vomit or faint but she too was glancing around the room observing the details who found the body gristhorpe asked pc tolliver woman by the name of veronica shildon she lives here where is she now banks asked tolliver nodded towards the stairs up there with the neighbour she didnt want to come back in here i dont blame her said banks do you know who the victim is her names caroline hartley apparently she lived here too gristhorpe raised his bushy eyebrows come on alan lets go and hear what she has to say susan will you stay down here till the sceneofcrime team arrives susan gay nodded and stood aside there were only two rooms and a bathroom upstairs one room had been converted into a sitting room or a study with bookcases covering one wall a small rolltop desk under the window and a couple of wicker armchairs arranged below the tracklighting the bedroom banks noticed from the landing was done out in coral and seagreen with laura ashley wallpaper if two women lived in the house and there was only one bedroom he reasoned then they must share it he took a deep breath and went into the study veronica shildon sat in one of her wicker chairs head in hands the neighbour who introduced herself as christine cooper sat beside her the only other place to sit was the hardbacked chair in front of the desk gristhorpe took it and leaned forward resting his chin on his fists banks stood by the door shes had a terrible shock christine cooper said i dont know if shell be able to tell you much dont worry mrs cooper gristhorpe said the doctor will be here soon hell give her something is there anyone she can stay with she can stay with me if she wants next door weve got a spare room im sure my husband wont mind fine gristhorpe turned towards the crying woman and introduced himself can you tell me what happened veronica shildon looked up she was in her midthirties banks guessed with a neat cap of darkbrown hair streaked with grey handsome rather than pretty her thin face and lips and everything in her bearing spoke of dignity and refinement perhaps even of severity she held a crumpled tissue in her left hand and the fist of her right was clenched so tightly it was white even as he admired her appearance banks looked for any signs of blood on her hands or her clothing he saw none her greygreen eyes red around the rims couldnt quite focus on gristhorpe i just got home she said i thought she was waiting for me what time was this gristhorpe asked eight a few minutes after she didnt look at him when she answered where had you been id been shopping she looked up but her eyes appeared to be staring right through the superintendent thats just it you see i thought for a moment she was wearing the present id bought her the scarlet camisole but she couldnt have been could she i hadnt even given it to her and she was dead what did you do when you found her gristhorpe asked i i ran to christines she took me in and called the police i dont know is caroline really dead gristhorpe nodded why who gristhorpe leaned forward and spoke softly thats what we have to find out love are you sure you didnt touch anything in the room nothing is there anything else you can tell us veronica shildon shook her head she was clearly too distraught to speak they would have to leave their questions until tomorrow christine cooper accompanied banks and gristhorpe to the study door ill stay with her till the doctor comes if you dont mind she said gristhorpe nodded and they went downstairs organize a housetohouse would you gristhorpe asked pc tolliver before they returned to the living room you know the drill anyone seen entering or leaving the house the constable nodded and dashed off back inside the front room banks noticed for the first time how warm it was and took off his raincoat the music stopped then the needle came off the record returned to the edge of the turntable and promptly started on its way again what is that music susan gay asked banks listened the piece elegant stately strings accompanying a soprano soloist singing in latin sounded vaguely familiar it wasnt bach at all italian in style rather than german sounds like vivaldi he said frowning but its not what it is bothers me so much its why its playing and especially why its been set to repeat he walked over to the turntable and knelt by the album cover lying face down on the speaker beside it it was indeed vivaldi laudate pueri sung by magda kalmár banks had never heard of her but she had a beautiful voice more reedy warm and less brittle than many sopranos he had heard the cover looked new should i turn it off susan gay asked no leave it it could be important let the sceneofcrime boys have a look at that moment the front door opened and everyone stood aghast at what walked in to all intents and purposes their visitor was santa claus himself complete with beard and red hat if it hadnt been for the height the twinkling blue eyes the brown bag and the cigarette dangling from the corner of his mouth banks himself wouldnt have known who it was i apologize for my appearance said dr glendenning believe me i have no wish to appear frivolous but i was just about to set off for the childrens ward to give out their christmas presents when i got the call i didnt want to waste any time and he didnt is this the alleged corpse he walked over to the sofa and bent over the body before he had done much more than look it over peter darby the photographer arrived along with vic manson and his team the three cid officers stood in the background while the specialists went to work collecting hair and fabric samples with tiny vacuum cleaners dusting for prints and photographing the scene from every conceivable angle susan gay seemed enthralled she must have read about all this in books banks thought and even taken part in demonstration runs at the police college but there was nothing like the real thing he tapped her on the shoulder it took her a few seconds to pull her eyes away and face him im just nipping back upstairs bank whispered wont be a minute susan nodded and turned to watch glendenning measure the throat wounds upstairs banks knelt in front of the armchair veronica he said gently that music vivaldi was it playing when you got home with difficulty veronica focused on him yes she said with a puzzled look on her face yes that was odd i thought we had company why caroline she doesnt like classical music she says it makes her feel stupid so she wouldnt have put it on herself veronica shook her head never whose record is it is it part of your collection no but you like classical music she nodded do you know the piece i dont think so but i recognize the voice banks stood up and rested his hand on her shoulder the doctor will be up soon he said hell give you something to help you sleep he took christine coopers arm and drew her on to the landing how long have they been living here nearly two years now banks nodded towards the bedroom together yes at least she folded her arms its not my place to judge ever any trouble what do you mean rows threats feuds angry visitors anything christine cooper shook her head not a thing you couldnt wish for quieter more considerate neighbours as i said we didnt know each other very well but weve passed the time of day together now and then my husband yes well he was very fond of caroline i think she reminded him of our corinne she died a few years ago leukaemia she was about carolines age banks looked at christine cooper she seemed to be somewhere in her midfifties a small puzzledlooking woman with grey hair and a wrinkled brow that would make her husband about the same age or a little older perhaps a paternal attachment most likely but he made a mental note to follow it up did you notice anything earlier this evening he asked like what any noise or anyone calling at the house no i cant really say i did the houses are quite solid you know i had my curtains closed and i had the television on until eight oclock when that silly game show came on you heard nothing at all i heard doors close once or twice but i couldnt be sure whose doors can you remember what time when i was watching television between seven and eight im sorry im not more use to you i just didnt pay attention i didnt know it would be important of course not just one more small point banks said what time did mrs shildon arrive at your house ten past eight are you sure yes i was in the kitchen then i looked at the clock when i heard someone shouting and banging on my door i hadnt heard any carol singers and i wondered who could be calling at that time did you hear her arrive home i heard her door open and close what time was that just after eight certainly not more than a minute or two after id just switched the television off and gone to start on charless dinner thats why i heard her it was quiet then i thought it was my door at first so i glanced up at the clock its a habit i have when im in the kitchen theres a nice wallclock a present but you dont want to know about that anyway i wasnt expecting charles back so early so i just a minute what are you getting at surely you cant believe thank you very much mrs cooper thatll be all for now when mrs cooper had gone back into the study banks had a quick look through the bedroom for any signs of bloodstained clothing but found nothing the wardrobe was clearly divided into two halves one for veronicas more conservative clothes and the other for carolines a little more modern in style at the bottom sat a carrier bag full of what looked like unwrapped christmas presents the whole house would have to be searched thoroughly before the night was over but the sceneofcrime team could do that later what bothered banks for the moment was the gap of almost ten minutes between veronica shildons arriving home and her knocking on her neighbours door a lot could be accomplished in ten minutes back downstairs banks led vic manson over to the turntable can you get this record off and dust the whole area for prints i want the cover and the inside sleeve bagged for examination too no problem manson set to it everyone looked up when the music stopped it had cast such a spell over the scene that banks felt like a dancer cut off in the middle of a stately pavane now everyone seemed to notice for the first time exactly what the situation was it was harsh and ugly especially with all the lights on have they found anything interesting yet banks asked gristhorpe the knife it was on their drainingboard in the kitchen all washed but there are still traces of blood it looks like one of their own from a set did you notice that cake on the table in front of the sofa banks nodded its possible shed used the knife to cut herself a slice earlier which would make it the handiest weapon banks said if it was still on the table yes and theres this the superintendent held out a crumpled sheet of green christmas wrapping paper with silver bells and red holly berries on it it was over by the music centre he shrugged it might mean something it could have come from the record banks said and told gristhorpe what veronica had said dr glendenning who had taken off his beard and hat and unbuttoned the top half of his father christmas outfit walked over to them and stuck another cigarette in his mouth dead three or four hours at the most he said bruise on the left cheek consistent with a hard punch or kick it might easily have knocked her out but cause of death was blood loss due to multiple stab wounds at least seven as far as i can count unless she was poisoned first thanks gristhorpe said any way of telling how it happened at this stage no except for the obvious it was a bloody vicious attack aye said gristhorpe was she interfered with sexually on a superficial examination id say no no signs of it at all but i wont be able to tell you any more until after the postmortem which ill conduct first thing tomorrow morning you can have the lads cart her to the mortuary whenever theyre ready can i be off now i hate to keep those poor wee kiddies waiting banks asked him if he would drop in on veronica shildon first and give her a sedative glendenning sighed but agreed the ambulance men who had been waiting outside came in to take away the body glendenning had covered the hands with plastic bags to preserve any skin caught under the fingernails as the ambulance men lifted her on to the stretcher the cuts around her throat gaped open like screaming mouths one of the men had to put his hand under her head so that the flesh didnt rip back as far as the spine that was the only time banks saw susan gay visibly pale and look away with caroline hartleys body gone apart from the blood that had sprayed on to the sheepskin and the sofa cushions there was very little left to indicate what horror had occurred in the cosy room that night the forensic team bundled up the rug and cushions to take with them tor further examination and then there was nothing left to show at all it was after ten thirty pc tolliver and another two uniformed constables were still conducting housetohouse enquiries in the area but there was little else the cid could do until morning they needed to know caroline hartleys movements that evening where she had been who she had seen and who might have had a reason to want her dead veronica shildon could probably tell them but she was in no state to answer questions gristhorpe and susan gay left first then after leaving instructions for the sceneofcrime team to search the house thoroughly for any signs of bloodstained clothing banks returned to the rugby club to see if sandra was still there snow swirled in front of his headlights and the road was slippery when banks pulled up outside the rugby club in the northern part of eastvale it was almost eleven oclock the lights were still on in the foyer he kicked the clinging snow off his shoes brushed it from his hair and the shoulders of his camelhair overcoat which he hung up on the rack provided and went inside he stood in the doorway and looked around the softly lit banquet hall hatchley and carol had finally left but plenty of others remained still holding drinks the dj had taken a break and someone sat at the piano playing christmas carols banks saw sandra and richmond sitting on their stools at the bar he stood and watched them sing for a few moments it was a curiously intimate feeling like watching someone sleep and like sleepers their faces wore innocent tranquil expressions as their lips mouthed the familiar words silent night holy night all is calm all is bright one what have we got so far gristhorpe asked at eight oclock the following morning as banks knew from experience the superintendent liked to call regular conferences in the early stages of an investigation although he had been at the scene the previous evening he would now leave the fieldwork to his team and concentrate on coordinating their tasks and dealing with the press gristhorpe unlike some supers banks had worked with believed in letting his men get on with the job while he handled matters of politics and policy in the conference room the four of them gristhorpe banks richmond and susan gay reviewed the events of the previous evening nothing had come in yet from forensics or from dr glendenning who was just about to start the postmortem the only new information they had obtained had resulted from the housetohouse enquiry three people had been visiting number eleven oakwood mews separately that evening nobody could describe them clearly after all it had been dark and snowing and the street was not well lit but two independent witnesses seemed to agree that one man and two women had called there the man had called first around seven oclock and caroline had admitted him to the house nobody had seen him leave not very long after a woman had arrived talked briefly to caroline on the doorstep then left without entering the house one witness said she thought it might have been someone collecting for charity what with it being christmas and all but then a collector wouldnt have missed the opportunity of knocking on everyone elses door as well would she and no there had been no obvious signs of a quarrel the final visitor according to the sightings called shortly after the other woman left and went inside the house nobody had noticed her leave that as far as they could pin down was the last time caroline hartley had been seen alive by anyone but her killer other visitors may have called between about half past seven and eight but nobody had seen them everybody had been watching coronation street any ideas about the record gristhorpe asked i think it might be important banks said but i dont know why according to veronica shildon it wasnt hers and the hartley girl didnt like classical music so where did it come from susan gay asked tolliver said that one of the witnesses thought the man who called was carrying a shopping bag of some sort it could have been in there a present say that would explain the wrapping paper we found but why would anyone bring a woman a present of something she didnt like banks shrugged could be any number of reasons maybe it was someone who didnt know her tastes well or it might have been intended for veronica shildon all im saying is that its odd and i think we ought to check it out its also strange that someone should put it on the turntable and deliberately leave it to repeat ad infinitum we can be reasonably certain that caroline wouldnt have played it so who did and why we might even be dealing with a psycho the music could be his calling card all right gristhorpe said after a short silence susan why dont you get down to pristine records and see if they know anything about it susan made a note in her book and nodded alan you and detective sergeant richmond here can see what you can get out of veronica shildon he paused what do you make of their relationship banks scratched the little scar by the side of his right eye they were living together and sleeping together as ear as i could tell nobodys spelled it out yet but id say its pretty obvious christine cooper implied much the same could that give us an angle gristhorpe suggested i dont know much about lesbian relationships but anything off the beaten track could be worth looking into a jealous lover something like that banks said gristhorpe shrugged you tell me i just think its worth a bit of scrutiny the meeting broke up and they went their separate ways but not before sergeant rowe came up to them in the corridor with a form in his hand theres been a breakin at the community centre he said waving the sheet any takers not another banks groaned it was the third in two months vandalism was becoming as much of a problem in eastvale as it seemed to be everywhere else in the country aye said rowe dustbin men noticed the back door broken open when they picked up the rubbish half an hour ago ive already notified the people involved with that amateur dramatic society theyre the only ones using the place at the moment except for your wife sir rowe was referring to sandras new parttime job managing eastvales new gallery where she arranged exhibitions of local art sculpture and photography the eastvale arts committee had applied as usual for its grant fully expecting significant cuts if not an outright refusal but that year whether due to some bureaucratic blunder or a generous fiscal whim they had been given twice what they had asked for and found themselves looking for ways to spend the money before someone asked for it back the cheque didnt bounce months passed and they received no letter beginning due to a clerical oversight we are afraid so the large upstairs room in the community centre was set aside and redecorated for gallery space any damage upstairs banks asked we dont know yet sir wheres the caretaker on holiday sir gone to the inlaws in oldham for christmas all right well take care of it susan drop by there before you go to the record shop and see whats going on it shouldnt take too long susan gay nodded and set off banks and richmond turned down by the side of the police station towards king street the snow had stopped early in the morning leaving a covering about six inches thick but the sky was still overcast heavy with more the air was chill and damp on the main streets cars and pedestrians had already churned the snow into brownishgrey slush but in those narrow winding alleys between market street and king street it remained almost untouched except for the odd set of footprints and the patches that shopkeepers had shovelled away from the pavement in front of their doors this was the real tourist eastvale here the antique dealers hung up their signs and antiquarian booksellers advertised their wares alongside numismatists and bespoke tailors these werent like the cheap souvenir shops on york road they were specialty shops with creaking floors and thick mullioned windows where unctuous immaculately dressed shopkeepers called you sir or madam oakwood mews was a short culdesac a renovated terrace with only ten houses on each side blackleaded iron railings separated each small garden from the pavement in summer the street blossomed in a profusion of colours with many houses sporting bright hanging and window boxes it had even won a prettiest street in yorkshire prize several years ago and the plaque to prove it was affixed to the wall of the first house now as banks and richmond approached number nine the street looked positively victorian banks almost expected tiny tim to come running up to them and throw his crutches away banks knocked on the coopers door it was made of light panelled wood and the shiny knocker was a highly polished brass lions head a wealthy little street this obviously banks thought even if it was only a terrace block of small houses they were brick built prewar and had recently been restored to perfection christine cooper answered the door in her dressing gown and invited them in unlike the more cosy feminine elegance of number eleven the cooper place was almost entirely modern in decor assembleityourself scandinavian furniture and offwhite walls the kitchen into which she led them boasted plenty of shelf and surfacespace and every gadget under the sun from microwave to electric tin opener coffee banks and richmond both nodded and sat down at the large pine breakfast table it had been set close to a corner to save space and someone had fixed bench seating to the two adjacent walls both banks and richmond sat on the bench with their backs to the wall banks had no trouble fitting himself in as he was only a little taller than regulation centimetres but richmond had to shift about to accommodate his long legs mrs cooper faced them from a matching chair across the table the electric coffeemaker was already gurgling away and they had to wait only a few moments for their drinks im afraid veronica isnt up yet mrs cooper said your doctor gave her a sleeping pill and she was out like a light as soon as we got her into bed i explained everything to charles hes been very understanding where is your husband banks asked at work what time did he get home last night it must have been after eleven we sat up and talked about you know for a while then we went to bed about midnight he certainly works long hours mrs cooper sighed yes especially at this time of year you see he runs a chain of childrens shops in north yorkshire and hes constantly being called from one crisis to another one place runs out of whatever new doll all the kids want this year and another out of jigsaw puzzles im sure you can imagine the problems where was he yesterday evening mrs cooper seemed surprised at the question but she answered after only a slight hesitation barnard castle apparently the manager of the shop there reported some stock discrepancies there was probably nothing in it banks thought but charles coopers alibi should be easy enough to check maybe you can give us a bit more background on caroline hartley while were waiting for mrs shildon he said richmond took out his notebook and settled back in the corner seat mrs cooper rubbed her chin i dont know if i can tell you much about caroline really i knew her but i didnt feel i really knew her if you know what i mean it was all on the surface she was a real sparkler ill say that for her always full of beans always a smile and a hello for everyone talented too from what i could gather talented how she was an actress oh just amateur like but if you ask me shed got what it takes she could take anybody off you should have seen her impression of maggie thatcher talk about laugh was this theatrical work local oh yes only the eastvale amateur dramatic society was this her first experience with theatre i wouldnt know that it was only a small part but she was excited about it where does she come from do you know i cant say i know nothing about her past she could be from timbuktu for all i know as i said before we werent really close do you know if she had any enemies did she ever tell you about any quarrels she might have had mrs cooper shook her head then blushed what is it banks asked well mrs cooper began its nothing really i dont suppose and i dont want to go getting anybody into trouble but when two women live together like like they did then somebody somewheres got to be unhappy havent they what do you mean veronicas exhusband she was a married woman before she came here i shouldnt think hed be very happy about things would he and ill bet there was someone in carolines life too a woman or a man she didnt seem the kind to be on her own for too long if you know what i mean do you know anything about veronica shildons exhusband only that they sold the big house they used to have outside town and split the money she bought this place and he moved off somewhere the coast i think the whole thing seemed very hushhush to me shes never even told me his name the yorkshire coast yes i think so but veronica can tell you all about him you didnt see him in the neighbourhood yesterday evening did you mrs cooper pulled her robe together at the front looking down and making a double chin as she did so no i told you all i saw or heard last night besides i wouldnt recognize him from adam ive never seen him banks heard stairs creak and looked around to see veronica shildon standing in the doorway she was dressed as she had been the previous evening tight jeans which flattered her slim curved hips trim waist and flat stomach and a highnecked chunkyknit green sweater which brought out the colour in her eyes she was tall about five foot ten and poised banks thought there was something odd about seeing her in such casual wear she looked as if she belonged in a pearl silk blouse and a navy business suit she had taken the time to brush her short hair and put a little makeup on but her face still looked drawn underneath it all and her eyes disarmingly honest and naked were still red from crying banks tried to stand up but he was too closely wedged in by the table im sorry to bother you so soon he said but the quicker we get moving the more chance we have i understand she said please dont worry about me ill be all right she swayed a little as she walked towards the table mrs cooper took her elbow and guided her to a chair then brought her some coffee and disappeared muttering something about things to attend to in cases like this banks began it helps if we know what the person was doing where she was previous to the incident he knew he sounded trite but somehow he couldnt bring himself to say victim and murder veronica nodded of course as far as i know caroline went to work but youll have to check that she runs the garden café on castle hill road i know it banks said it was an elegant little place very upmarket with a stunning view of the formal gardens and the river she usually finishes at three on a weekday after the lunchtime crowd they dont open for tea offseason on a normal day shed come home do some shopping or perhaps drop by at the shop for a while to help out shop i own a flower shop or rather my partner and i do its mostly a matter of his money and my management its just round the corner from here down king street you said on a normal day was yesterday not normal she looked straight at him and her eyes let him know that his choice of words had been inappropriate yesterday indeed had not been normal but she simply said no yesterday after work they had a rehearsal theyre doing twelfth night at the community centre its quite a heavy rehearsal schedule as the directors set on actually opening on twelfth night what time did rehearsals run usually between four and six so she would have been home at about quarter past six if shed come home immediately and was she likely to they often went for a drink after but yesterday she came straight home how do you know i phoned to see if she was there and to tell her id be a bit late because i was doing some shopping what time about seven how did she sound fine she sounded fine was there any special reason for her not going for a drink with the others yesterday no she just said she was tired after rehearsal and she yes weve both been so busy lately she wanted to spend some time with me a quiet evening at home where had you been that evening veronica didnt show a flicker of resentment at being asked for an alibi i closed the shop at five thirty then i went for my six oclock appointment with dr ursula kelly my therapist shes carolines too her office is on kilnsey street just off castle hill i walked we do have a car but we dont use it much in town mostly just for trips away she blew on her coffee and took a sip the session lasted an hour after that i went to the shopping centre to buy a few things christmas presents mostly she faltered a little then i walked home i i got here about eight oclock no doubt it would be possible to check her alibi in the shopping centre banks thought some shopkeepers might remember her but it was a busy time of year for them and he doubted that any would be able to recollect what day and what time they had last seen her he could examine the receipts too sometimes the modern electronic cash registers gave the time of purchase as well as the date can you tell me exactly what happened what you did from the moment you left the shops and walked home last night veronica took a deep breath and closed her eyes i walked home she began in the snow it was a beautiful evening i stopped and listened to the carol singers in the market square for a while they were singing o little town of bethlehem its always been one of my favourites when i got home i i called out hello to caroline but she didnt answer i thought nothing of it she could have been in the kitchen and then there was the music well that was odd so i took the opportunity and crept upstairs to hide the presents in the wardrobe some were for her you see the she paused and banks noticed her eyes fill with tears it seemed so important just to put them out of sight she went on i knew there would be plenty of opportunity to wrap them later while i was up there i washed and changed and went back downstairs the music was still playing i opened the door to the living room and i at first i thought she was wearing the new scarlet camisole she looked so serene and so beautiful lying there like that but it couldnt be i told you last night i hadnt give it to her then id just bought her the camisole for christmas and id put it in the bottom of the wardrobe with everything else then i went closer and the smell her eyes veronica put her mug down and held her head in her hands banks let the silence stretch for a good minute or two all they could hear was the soft ticking of mrs coopers kitchen wall clock and a dog barking in the distance i understand you were married banks said when veronica had wiped her eyes and reached out for her coffee again i still am officially were only separated not divorced he didnt want our personal life splashed all over the newspapers as you may have gathered caroline and i lived together banks nodded why should the newspapers have been interested people get divorced all the time for all kinds of reasons veronica hesitated and turned her mug slowly in a circle on the table she wouldnt met his eyes look banks said i hardly need remind you whats happened how serious this is well find out anyway you can save us a lot of time and trouble veronica looked up at him youre right of course she said though i dont see how it can have anything to do with all this my husband was is claude ivers hes not exactly a household name but enough people have heard of him banks certainly had ivers had once been a brilliant concert pianist but several years ago he had given up performance for composition he had received important commissions from the bbc and a number of his pieces had been recorded banks even had a tape of his two wind quintets they possessed a kind of eerie natural beauty not structured but wandering like the breeze in a deep forest at night veronica shildon was right if the press had got hold of the story she would have had no peace tor weeks news of the world reporters would have been climbing the drainpipes and spying in bedroom windows talking to spiteful neighbours and slighted lovers he could just see the headlines musicians wife in lesbian lovenest where is your husband now banks asked he lives in redburn out on the coast he said the seclusion and the sea would be good for his work he always did care about his work banks noticed the bitterness in her tone do you ever see one another yes she said a smile touched her thin lips it was an acrimonious parting in many ways but there is some affection left we dont seem able to stamp that out whatever we do when did you last see him about a month ago we occasionally have dinner if hes in town i rarely visit the coast but he comes here from time to time to the house hes been here yes though hes always worried someone will see him and know who he is i try to tell him that people dont actually recognize composers in the street any more than they do writers that its only television and film stars have to put up with that but she shrugged did he know caroline he could hardly help knowing her could he theyd met a few times how did they get on veronica shrugged they never seemed to have much to say to one another they were different as chalk and cheese he thought she was a scheming slut and she thought he was a selfish pompous ass they had nothing in common but affection for me was there any open antagonism open good lord no that isnt claudes way he sniped from time to time made sarcastic comments cruel remarks that kind of thing directed towards caroline directed towards both of us but im sure he blamed caroline for leading me astray thats how he saw it was it that way veronica shook her head was caroline ever married not that i know of was she living with anyone before she met you veronica paused and gripped her coffee mug in both hands as if to warm them her fingers were long and tapered and she had freckles on the backs of her hands she wore a silver ring on the middle finger of her right hand as she spoke she looked down at the table she was living with a woman called nancy wood theyd been together about eight months the relationship was going very badly where does nancy wood live in eastvale not too far from here at least she did the last i heard did caroline ever see her after they split up only by accident once or twice in the street so they parted on bad terms doesnt everyone much as i admire shakespeare ive often wondered where the sweetness is in the sorrow and before nancy wood she spent some time in london i dont know how long or who with a few years at least what about her family her mothers dead her father lives in harrogate hes an invalid been one for years her brother gary looks after him i told one of your uniformed men last night will someone have called banks nodded dont worry the harrogate police will have taken care of it is there anything else you can tell me about carolines friends or enemies veronica sighed and shook her head she looked exhausted no she said we didnt have a lot of close friends i suppose we tried to be too much to one another at least thats how it feels now shes gone you could try the people at the theatre they were her acquaintances at least but we didnt socialize very much together i dont think any of them even knew about her living with me were still puzzled about the record banks said are you sure it isnt yours ive told you no but you recognized the singer magda kalmar yes claude and i once saw her in lucia di lammermoor at the budapest opera i was very impressed could the record have been intended as a christmas present from your husband well i suppose it could but that means no i havent seen him in a month he could have called last night while you were out she shook her head no i dont believe it not claude banks looked over at richmond and nodded richmond closed his notebook thats all for now banks said can i go home she asked him if you want banks hadnt imagined she would want to return to the house so soon but there was no official objection forensics had finished with the place just one thing though he said well need to have another good look through carolines belongings perhaps detective sergeant richmond can accompany you back and look over them now she looked apprehensive at first then nodded all right they stood up to leave christine cooper was nowhere in sight so they walked out into the damp overcast day and shut the door behind them without saying goodbye veronica opened her front door and went in banks lingered at the black iron gate with richmond im going to the community centre he said there should be someone from the theatre group there since theyve been notified of the breakin how about we meet up at the queens arms say twelve or twelvethirty and he went on to ask richmond to check veronica shildons purchases and look closely at the receipts for corroboration of her alibi and check on charles coopers movements yesterday he added it might mean a trip to barnard castle but see if you can come up with anything by phone first richmond went into the house and banks set off up the steep part of king street with his collar turned up against the cold the community centre wasnt very far the walk would be good exercise as he trudged through the snow he thought about veronica shildon she presented an odd mixture of reserve and frankness stoical acceptance and bitterness he was sure she was holding something back but he didnt know what it was there was something askew about her even her clothes didnt seem to go with the rather repressed and inhibited essence that she projected prim and proper was the term that sprang to mind yet she had left her husband had gone and set up house with a woman all in all she was an enigma if anything banks thought she seemed like a woman in the process of great change her reference to the analyst indicated that she was at least concerned with selfexamination it seemed to banks as if her entire personality had been dismantled and the various bits and pieces didnt quite fit together some were new or newly discovered and others were old rusted decrepit and she wasnt sure whether she wanted to discard them or not banks had an inkling of what the process felt like from his own readjustment after the move from london but veronicas changes he suspected went far deeper he wondered what she had been like as a wife and what she would become in the future now that caroline hartley had been so viciously excised from her life for the younger woman had had a great influence on veronicas life banks was certain of that was veronica a killer he didnt think so but who could say anything so definite about a personality in such turmoil and transition two on her way to the community centre dc susan gay thought over her behaviour of the previous day and found it distinctly lacking she had felt even more miserable than usual when she went home from oakwood mews that night her small flat off york road always depressed her it was so barren like a hotel room so devoid of any real stamp of her presence and she knew that was because she hardly spent any time there mostly she had been working or off on a course somewhere for years she had paid no attention to her surroundings or to her personal life the flat was for eating in sleeping in and occasionally for watching half an hour of television it seemed like a lifetime since shed last had a boyfriend or anyone more than a casual date anyone who meant something to her she accepted that she wasnt especially attractive but she was no ugly sister either people had asked her out the problem was that she always had something more important to do something related to her career she was beginning to wonder if the normal sexual impulse had somehow drained away over the years of toil that incident with the rugby player last night for example she knew she shouldnt have responded with such obvious revulsion he was only being friendly even if he was a bit rough about it and wasnt that what mistletoe was for but she had to overreact banks and gristhorpe had both noticed she was certain she wondered what they must think of her damn the front doors of the community centre a victorian sandstone building on north market street were still locked that meant susan would have to double back to the narrow street behind the church shivering she hunched up against the cold and turned around it seemed now that the whole of yesterday evening had been a nightmare first she had run off halfcocked out of the station at the first sign of trouble without even bothering to check if the call was genuine or not then she had gone straight to banks she had seen gristhorpe by the bar of course but she hadnt approached him because she was terrified of him she knew he was said to be a softie really but she couldnt help herself he seemed so selfcontained so sure of himself so solid just like her father the only thing she was proud of was her reaction at the scene she hadnt fainted even though it was her first corpse and a messy one at that she had managed to maintain a detached clinical view of the whole affair watching the experts at work getting the feel of the scene there had been only one awkward moment as the body was being carried away but anyone could be forgiven for paling a bit at that no her behaviour at the scene had been exemplary she hoped banks and gristhorpe had noticed that and not only her faults and now she was on her way to investigate a case of vandalism while the others got to work on the murder it wasnt fair she realized she was the new member of the team but that didnt mean she always had to be the one to handle the petty crimes how could she get ahead if she didnt get to work on important cases she had already sacrificed so much for her career that she couldnt bear to contemplate failure finally she got to the back entrance down an alley off the northern part of york road the back door had obviously been jemmied open its meagre lock was bent and the wood around the jamb had cracked susan walked down the long corridor lit only by a couple of bare sixtywatt bulbs to where she could hear voices they came from a room off to her right a highceilinged place with exposed pipes bare brick walls pied with saltpetre and more dim lighting the room smelled of dust and mothballs there she found a man and a woman bent over a large trunk they stood up as she walked in police the man asked susan nodded and showed her new cid identification card i must admit i didnt expect a woman he said susan prepared to say something withering but he held up a hand dont get me wrong im not complaining im not a sexist pig its just a surprise he peered at her in the poor light wait a minute arent you susan gay she said recognizing him now that her eyes had adjusted to the light and youre mr conran she blushed im surprised you remember me i was hardly one of your best students mr conran hadnt changed much in the ten years since he had taught the sixteenyearold susan drama at eastvale comprehensive about ten years older than her he was still handsome in an artsy kind of way in baggy black cords and a dark poloneck sweater with the stitching coming away at the shoulder seam he still had that vulnerable skinny halfstarved look that susan remembered so well but despite it he looked healthy enough his short fair hair was combed forward flat against his skull beneath it intelligent and ironic grey eyes looked out from a pale hollowcheeked face susan had hated drama but she had had a crush on mr conran the other girls said he was a queer but they said that about everyone in the literature and arts departments susan hadnt believed them james he said stretching his hand out to shake hers i think we can dispense with the teacherpupil formalities by now dont you im directing the play and this is marcia cunningham marcia takes care of props and costumes its she you should talk to really as if to emphasise the point conran turned away and began examining the rest of the storage room susan took her notebook out whats the damage she asked marcia a plump roundfaced woman in grey stretch slacks and a threadbare alpaca jacket that looked at least one size too large for her marcia cunningham sniffed and pointed to the wall theres that for a start crudely spraypainted across the bricks were the words fucking wankers but thatll wash off easy enough she went on this is the worst theyve shredded our costumes im not sure if i can salvage any of them or not susan looked into the trunk she agreed it looked like someone had been to work on them with a large pair of scissors snipping the different dresses suits and shirts into pieces and mixing them all together why should anyone do that marcia asked susan shook her head at least they left the shoes and wigs alone she said gesturing towards the other two boxes of costumes has anyone checked upstairs susan asked marcia looked surprised the gallery no susan made her way down the corridor to the stairs cold stone with metal railings there were several rooms upstairs some of them used for various groups such as the philately society or the chess club others for local committee meetings all of them were locked the glass doors to the new gallery were locked too no damage had been done there she went back down to the props room and watched marcia picking up strands of slashed material and moaning all that work all those people who gave us stuff why do they do this marcia asked again what bloody point is there susan knew numerous theories of hooliganism from poor potty training to the heartlessness of modern england but all she said was i dont know people dont want to hear theories when something they value has been destroyed and short of catching them redhanded we cant promise much either but this is the third time marcia said surely by now you must have some kind of lead there are a few people were keeping our eye on susan told her but its not as if theyve stolen anything even that would be more understandable what i mean is wed find no evidence even if we suspected someone theres no stolen property to trace them have you thought of employing a night watchman marcia snorted a night watchman how do you think we can afford that i know we got a bonanza grant this year but we didnt get that much and most of its gone already on costumes and stuff im sorry susan said she realized this was an inadequate response but what else was there to say a constable walked the beat but he couldnt spend his whole night in the alley at the back of the community centre there had been other breakins too and other incidents of vandalism ill make out a report she said and let you know if we come up with anything thanks a lot dont be so rude marcia james conran reappeared and put his hand on marcias shoulder shes only trying to help he smiled at susan arent you susan nodded his smile was so infectious she could hardly keep from responding and the effort to maintain a detached expression made her flush marcia rubbed her face until her plump cheeks shone im sorry love she said i know its not your fault its just so bloody frustrating i know susan put her notebook back in her handbag ill be in touch she said before she could turn to leave they heard footsteps coming along the corridor conran looked surprised theres nobody else supposed to be coming here is there he asked marcia who shook her head then the door creaked open and susan saw a familiar face peep around it was chief inspector banks at first she was relieved to see him then she thought why the hell is he here checking up on me cant he trust me to do a simple job properly three detective sergeant philip richmond was glad that veronica shildon had not wanted to stand over him as he searched the two upper rooms he never could tolerate the feel of someone looking over his shoulder which was one of the reasons he liked working with banks who usually left him to get on with the job his own way the bedroom smelled of expensive cologne or talcum as he looked at the large bed with its satiny coral spread he thought of the two women in there together and the things they did to each other the images embarrassed him and he got back to work richmond took the bag of presents out of veronicas half of the wardrobe and spread them on the bed a sheaffer fountain pen and pencil set a green silk scarf some body shop soaps and shampoos a scarlet camisole the latest booker prize winner all pretty ordinary stuff the receipts were dated but none of them gave the time the purchase had been made richmond made a list of items and shops so the staff could be questioned the dresser drawers contained mostly lingerie richmond picked his way through it methodically but found nothing hidden away nothing that shouldnt be there he moved on to the study in addition to the books none of them inscribed there was also a rolltop desk in the corner under the window there was nothing surprising in it letters to veronica shildon some from her husband about practical and financial matters a few bills veronicas address book mostly empty a house insurance policy receipts and guarantees for the oven the fridge and items of furniture and that was about all none of it any use to richmond just when he was beginning to wonder whether caroline hartley had had any possessions at all he came across a manila envelope with caroline written on the front inside were a pressed flower her birth certificate which showed she had been born in harrogate twentysix years ago an expired passport with no stamps or visas and a black and white photograph of a woman he didnt recognize she had piercing intelligent eyes and her head was slightly tilted to one side her mediumlength hair was swept back revealing a straight hairline and ears with tiny lobes her lips were pressed tight together and there was something about the arrogant intensity of her presence that richmond found disturbing he wouldnt have described her as beautiful but striking certainly across the bottom were the words to carrie love ruth written with a flourish making sure he hadnt missed anything richmond went back downstairs taking the envelope of carolines possessions with him veronica shildon turned on the small electric fire in the front room when he entered im sorry she said i cant be bothered to light a real eire now we use this most of the time anyway it seems to be warm enough some tea yes please if its no trouble its already made richmond sat down avoiding the cushionless sofa in favour of an armchair after veronica had poured he held out the photograph to her whos this woman he asked can you tell me anything about her veronica glanced at the photograph and shook her head its just someone caroline used to know in london surely she must have told you something about her caroline didnt like to talk about her past very much why not i dont know perhaps it was painful for her in what way i told you i dont know ive seen the picture before yes but i dont know who it is or where you can find her is it an old girlfriend richmond felt embarrassed as he asked the question i should think so wouldnt you veronica said evenly mind if i take it with me not at all caroline didnt seem much of a one for possessions richmond mused theres hardly anything of hers but clothes no letters nothing she liked to travel light and she had no sentimental regard for the past caroline always looked ahead it was a simple statement but richmond heard the irony in veronica shildons voice she shrugged a few of the books are hers some of the jewellery all the nonclassical records but she didnt go in much for keepsakes richmond tapped the photograph which makes it all the more odd she should have hung on to this thank you ms shildon id better be off now arent you going to finish your tea best not he said ill have to get back to work or my bossll skin me alive thanks very much anyway richmond could sense her unease she looked around the room before glancing at him again and nodding all right if you must will you be all right he asked you could always go back to mrs coopers if you feel ill be all right she said im still in a bit of a daze i cant believe its really happened is there no one you can go to until youre feeling better theres my therapist she says i can call her any time day or night i might do that well see but do you know the oddest thing richmond shook his head she folded her arms and nodded towards the room in general i can take all this the room where it happened i didnt think id be able to bear it after last night but it doesnt bother me in the slightest to be here it just feels empty isnt that strange its the loneliness carolines absence that hurts i keep expecting her to walk in at any moment richmond who could think of no reply said goodbye and walked out into the snow he still had about an hour before his lunchtime meeting with banks in the queens arms he could use that time to check on charles coopers movements the previous evening and perhaps see if he could find out anything about the mysterious ruth one the gears screeched as susan gay slowed to turn onto the harrogate road luckily the snow hadnt been so heavy south of eastvale it lay piled up against the hedgerows but the roads had been cleared and the temperature hadnt dropped low enough to make the surface icy she was out of the dales now in the gently rolling country south of ripon nothing but the occasional stretch of stone wall or a distant hamlet showed through the thin white veil of snow she still felt angry at herself for being so damn jumpy banks had only dropped by the community centre to break the news of caroline hartleys death and to discover what time she had left the rehearsal the previous evening but susan hadnt known anything about carolines part in the play so how could she help assuming that banks was checking up on her anyway she had kept quiet and matters had soon become clear to her when banks had gone shed walked to pristine records in the shopping centre by the bus station the girl with the whiteface makeup and hair like pink champagne pointed out the small classical section and when pushed leafed idly through the stock cards no they hadnt sold a copy of lousy whatsit lately they hadnt even had a copy in ever using her own initiative susan also checked boots and w h smiths both of which had small record departments but she had no luck there either the record was imported from hungary and whoever had bought it hadnt done so in eastvale over lunch at the queens arms information had been pooled and tasks assigned by superintendent gristhorpe according to banks caroline had left the garden café just after three oclock as usual probably done a bit of shopping then attended rehearsal at four james conran said they had finished at ten to six and everyone had left by five to he himself had been the last to leave he had gone out the back way as usual locked up and strolled over to the crooked billet on north york road for a couple of drinks in the caretakers absence he and marcia cunningham were the only ones in the drama group to have keys to the centre although an extra set had been lodged at the police station in case of emergencies members of the other societies housed in the centre also had keys including sandra banks presumably caroline had gone straight home because a neighbour across the street told one of the constables that she had seen miss hartley enter the house it had happened at the same time the neighbour had gone over to her window to close a chink in the curtains during the commercial break in calendar which would have been about six fifteen richmond had not been able to find out much about charles coopers movements the clerk who had been at the barnard castle shop on the evening in question had the day off today he planned to visit barnard castle and ask around some more after he had talked to veronica shildons therapist and made a start on tracking down ruth banks was off to visit claude ivers veronicas estranged husband and susan herself had drawn the job of talking to carolines family in harrogate in addition to keeping tabs on the breakin she was still on the murder team thank god the harrogate police had at least broken the news of carolines death that was one distasteful task she had been spared she drove up ripon road by the huge victorian hotels the cairn the majestic the st george dark stone mansions set back behind vast walled lawns and croquet greens as she kept an eye on the road susan found herself hoping that the hartley case wouldnt be solved by christmas that way she could legitimately beg off visiting her parents in sheffield home visits were always tense susan found herself regaled with stories about her brother the stockbroker and her sister the lawyer of course neither of them could ever make it home for christmas her brother lived in london and her sister in vancouver but she had to hear all about them nonetheless and whatever susan herself achieved was always belittled by her siblings success stories pieced together from occasional letters and the odd newspaper clipping and by her parents disapproval of the course she had chosen she could make chief constable and they would still look down on her with a bit of luck caroline hartleys murder would keep her busy well into the new year susan had a feeling they might be dealing with a nutter the violence of the wounds and the music left playing seemed to point that way and nutters she remembered from her training were always difficult to catch the town of harrogate soon banished thoughts of psychopaths all formal gardens and elegant victorian buildings it was a spa town like bath a place people retired to or visited to attend business conventions ripon road became parliament as she drove past the royal baths and bettys tea room then its name changed again to west park she turned left onto york place the road that ran by the stray a broad expanse of parkland in the town centre renowned for its vibrant flower displays in spring now it looked cool and serene under its layer of snow the hartleys lived in a large house off wetherby road on the southern outskirts of the town from the outside it looked like something out of edgar allan poe the house of usher susan thought the way it appeared in that roger corman film that used to scare her when she was a little girl the black stone was rough and pitted like coke and the upper oriels seemed to stare out like bulging eyes when susan rang the doorbell she half expected an enormous manservant with a green complexion to answer and say you rang in a deep voice but the boy who came to the door was far from enormous he was in his late teens judging by the pale spotty face the spiky hair and the look of dazed contempt for the world on his face and he was as skinny as a rake what is it he asked in an edgy highpitched voice we dont want anything theres been a death in the family i know susan said thats why im here she showed her card and he stepped back to let her in she followed him down the gloomy hallway to a room that must once have been a study or library the ceiling was high with curlicues at the corners and an ornate fixture at the centre from which the chandelier had once hung dark wainscotting came waist high but the room was a mess much of the fine oak panelling was scratched with graffiti and pitted where darts had been thrown at it the huge windows framed by heavy motheaten drapes were filmed with cobwebs and grime magazines and newspapers lay scattered all over the threadbare carpet beer cans and cigarette ends littered the hearth and the old stone fireplace and the stuffing was coming out of the huge green velvetupholstered settee the room was an elegant victorian sanctuary reduced to a teenagers private wasteland the boy didnt ask susan to sit down but she found a chair that looked in reasonable condition before she sat she began to undo her coat but as she did so she realized that it was freezing in the room as it had been in the hall there was no heat at all the boy didnt seem to notice or care even though he was only wearing jeans and a torn tshirt he lit a cigarette and slumped on the settee more stuffing oozed out like foam from a madmans mouth so he said id like to see your father the boy laughed harshly you must be the first person to say that in five years people dont usually like to see my father hes a very depressing man he makes them think of death the grim reaper the boys thin face only a shade less white than the snow outside certainly made susan think of death he looked in urgent need of a blood transfusion could he really be caroline hartleys brother it was hard to see a resemblance between the boy and his sister caroline when she was alive must have been a beautiful woman even in death she had looked more alive than her brother can i see him be my guest the boy pointed towards the ceiling and flicked his ash towards the littered fireplace susan walked up the broad staircase it must have been wonderful once with thick pile carpeting and guests in evening dress standing around sipping cocktails but now it was just bare creaky wood scuffed and splintered in places and the banister looked like someone had been cutting notches in it there were pale squares on the walls showing where paintings had been removed without a guide or directions it took susan three tries before she opened the right door her first try had led her into a bathroom which seemed clean and modern enough the second revealed the boys room where the curtains were still closed and faint light outlined messy bedsheets and last weeks underwear on the floor and the third took her into a warm stuffy room that smelled of cough lozenges camphor and commodes a oneelement electric fire radiated its heat close to the bed and there in a genuine fourposter with the curtains open a shadow of a man lay propped up on pillows the bags under his eyes were so dark they looked like bruises his complexion was like old paper and the hands that grasped the bedclothes around his chest were more like talons his skin looked as if it would crack like parchment if you touched it as she approached his watery eyes darted towards her who are you his voice was no more than a frightened whisper susan introduced herself and he seemed to relax about caroline he said a faraway look came into his ruined eyes pale yokes floating in glutinous albumen yes susan said can you tell me anything about her what do you want to know susan wasnt sure she had taken statements as a uniformed constable and studied interview techniques at police college but it had never seemed as haphazard as this superintendent gristhorpe hadnt been much help either find out what you can he had told her follow your nose clearly it was a matter of sink or swim in the cid she took a deep breath and wished she hadnt the warmedup smell of terminal illness was overpowering anything that might help us find her killer she said did caroline visit you recently sometimes he muttered were you close he shook his head slowly she ran away you know when did she run away she was only a child and she ran away susan repeated her question and the old man stared at her pardon when did she go when she was sixteen only a child why a look of great sadness came into his eyes i dont know her mother died you know i tried the best i could but she was so hard to manage where did she go london what did she do there he shook his head then she came back thats when she came to see me and again since yes how often when she could when she could get away did she ever tell you anything about her life down in london i was so happy to see her again do you know where she lived who her friends were she wasnt a bad girl not really a bad girl did she write from london the old man shook his head slowly on the pillow but you still loved her yes he was crying now and the tears embarrassed him im sorry could you please he pointed to a box of tissues on the bedside table and susan passed it to him she wasnt bad he repeated when hed settled down again restless angry but not bad i always knew shed come back i never stopped loving her but she never talked about her life either in london or in eastvale no perhaps to gary im tired not a bad girl he repeated softly he seemed to be falling asleep susan had got nowhere and could think of no more questions to ask clearly the old man had not jumped out of bed hurried over to eastvale and murdered his daughter maybe she would get more out of the son at least he seemed angry and bitter enough to give something away if she pushed him hard enough she said goodbye though she doubted that the old man heard and made her way back downstairs the boy was still sprawled on the sofa a can of lager open beside him on the floor despite the cold she could still smell underlying the smoke a faint hint of decay as if pieces of meat lay rotting under the floorboards when did you last see your sister she asked he shrugged i dont know a week two weeks ago she came when she felt like it time doesnt have much meaning around this place but she had visited you recently gary nodded what did she talk about he lit a cigarette and spoke out of the corner of his mouth nothing just the usual whats the usual you know job house relationships the usual crap whats wrong with your father cancer hes had a couple of operations chemotherapy but you know how long has he been like this five years and you look after him the boy tensed forward and points of fire appeared in his pale cheeks yes me all the fucking time its bring me this gary bring me that go get my prescription gary gary i need a bath i even sit him on the fucking toilet yes i take care of him does he never leave his room he sighed and settled back on the sofa i told you only to go to the bathroom he cant manage the stairs besides he doesnt want to hes given up that explained the state of the place susan wondered if the father knew suspected or even cared that his son had taken over the huge cold house to live whatever life of his own he could scrounge from the responsibilities of the sickroom she wanted to ask him how he put up with it but she already knew the scornful answer she would get who else is there to do it instead she asked how old were you when your sister ran away he seemed surprised by the change in direction and had to think for a moment eight theres eight years between us shed been a bitch for years had caroline the atmosphere was always tense people were always rowing or on the verge of rows it was a relief when she went why he turned away so she couldnt see his eyes why i dont know she was just like that full of poison especially towards me right from the start she tormented me when i was a baby they found her trying to drown me in my bath once of course they said she didnt realize what she was doing but she did why should she want to kill you he shrugged she hated me your father says he loved her he cast a scornful glance towards the ceiling and said slowly oh yes she always was the apple of his eye even after she took off to london to become a tramp caroline could do no wrong but who was the one left looking after him why did you say tramp how do you know what else would she do she didnt have any job skills but she was sixteen she had two tits and a cunt like any other bird her age if susan was expected to be shocked by his crudity she was determined not to show it did you ever see her during that period me you must be joking it was all right for a while till mum got sick and died it didnt take her longer than a month or two not five years like that miserable old bastard upstairs i was thirteen then when he started took to his bed like a fish to water and its been the same ever since what about school i went sometimes he sleeps most of the time so im okay unless he has one of his awkward phases i left last year no jobs anyway but what about the health service dont they help they send a nurse to look in every once in a while and if youre going to mention a home dont bother id have him in one before you could say jack robinson if i could but theres no room available unless you can pay he gestured around the crumbling house as you can see we cant weve got his pension and a bit in the bank and thats it ive even sold the bloody paintings not that they were worth much thank god the bloody house is paid for it must be worth a fortune now id sell it and move somewhere cheaper if i could but the old bastard wont hear of it wants to die in his own bed sooner the better i say susan realized that gary was drunk as hed been talking hed finished one can of lager and most of a second and he had obviously drunk a few before she arrived did you know anything at all about carolines life she asked his bright eyes narrowed i knew she was a fucking dyke if thats what you mean how did you know that she told me one of her visits but your father doesnt know no it wouldnt make a scrap of difference if he did though it wouldnt change his opinion as far as hes concerned the sun shone out of her arse and thats all there is to it he tossed the empty can aside and picked up another from the low cigarettescarred table how do you feel about her death gary was silent for a moment then he looked directly at susan i cant say i feel much at all if youd asked me a few years ago id have said i felt glad but now nothing at all i dont really care she made my life a misery then she left and lumbered me with the old man i never had a chance to get out like her and before that she made everyones life miserable at home especially mums drove her to an early grave did you talk to her much when she visited not by choice he said reaching for another cigarette but sometimes she wanted to talk to me explain things like she was taking me into her confidence as if i cared it was funny almost like she was apologizing for everything without ever quite getting round to it do you know what i mean i want you to know gary she says how much i appreciate what youre doing for dad the sacrifices youre making id help if i could you know i would and all that fucking rubbish he imitated her voice again i want you to know gary that im living with a woman in eastvale and im happy for the first time in my life ive really found myself at last i know weve had problems in the past always that i want you to know gary as if i fucking cared what she did the slut so shes dead i cant say i care one way or another susan didnt know whether to believe him there was more pentup passion and rage in his tone than she could handle and she wasnt sure where it was coming from all she knew was that she had to get out of this oppressive house with its vast cold and crumbling spaces she was beginning to feel dizzy and nauseated listening to gary hartleys highpitched vitriol which she suspected had as much to do with selfpity at his own weakness as anything else quickly she muttered her farewell and headed for the door as she walked down the hallway she heard an empty lager can crash against the wainscotting followed by the screech of the top being ripped off another outside she breathed in the cold damp air and leaned against the roof of her car her gaze fixed on the melting snow that dripped from the branches of a tall tree her hands were shaking but not from the cold before she had driven far she realized that she needed a drink she pulled into the car park of the first decentlooking pub she saw outside town there in a comfortable bar lit and warmed by a real coal fire she sipped a small brandy and thought about the hartleys she felt that her visit had barely scraped the surface there was so much bitterness anger and pain festering underneath so many conflicting passions that it would take years of psychoanalysis to sort them out one thing was clear though whatever the reasons for the familys strife and whatever carolines reasons for running away gary hartley certainly had a very good motive for murder his sister had ruined his life he even seemed to blame her for his mothers death had he been a different kind of person he would have handled the burden some other way but because he was weak and felt put upon blood had turned to vinegar in his veins as susan had just seen it didnt take more than a few drinks to bring the acid to the surface it would be very interesting to know what gary hartley had been doing between seven and eight oclock the previous evening as he had told her the old man slept most of the time so it would have been easy for gary to nip out for a while without being missed she hadnt asked him for an alibi and that was an oversight but she thought taking another sip of brandy and warming her hands by the fire before we start to get all paranoid again susan lets just say this was only a preliminary interview it would be a good idea to approach gary hartley again with someone else along someone like banks as she tilted her head back and finished the rest of her drink she noticed the bright christmas decorations hung across the ceiling and the string of cards on the wall above the stone fireplace that was another thing she remembered about the hartley house in addition to the cold and the overwhelming sense of decay there had been nothing at all in the entire huge place to mark the season not a christmas tree not a card not a sprig of holly not a cutout father christmas in that she realized bitterly the place resembled her own flat all too closely she shivered and walked out to the car two banks drove carefully down the hill into redburn as his tape of bartoks third string quartet neared its end the gradient wasnt quite as steep as at staithes where you had to leave your car at the top and walk but it was bad enough luckily the snow had petered out somewhere over the heathered reaches of the north york moors and spared the coast the narrow hill meandered alongside the beck down to the sea and it wasnt until he turned the final corner that banks saw the water a heaving mass of grey sloshing against the sea wall and showering the narrow promenade with silver spray redburn was a small place just the one main street leading down to the sea with a few ginnels and snickets twisting off it where cottages were hidden away half dug into the hillside itself all sheltered in the crescent of the bay in summer the jumble of pastel colours would make a picturesque scene but in this weather they seemed out of place as if a piece of the riviera had been dug up and transported to a harsher climate banks turned left at the front drove to the end of the road and parked outside the lobster inn where the road ended a narrow path led up the hillside providing the only access to the two or three isolated cottages that faced the sea about halfway up ideal places for artists the cold whipped the breath out of him and the air seemed full of sharp needles of moisture but banks finally reached his goal the white cottage with the red pantile roof like the rest of the village it would look pretty in summer with its garden full of flowers he thought but in the dull grey air with the wind curling smoke from the red chimney it took on a desolate aspect banks knocked at the door somewhere the wind was whistling and banging a loose shutter he thought of jim hatchley and wondered how much he was enjoying the seaside not many miles away the woman who answered his knock had the kind of puzzled expression on her face that hed expected there couldnt be many people dropping in on such a day in such an isolated place she raised her dark eyebrows yes banks introduced himself and showed his card she stood aside to let him in the room was a haven from the elements a wood fire crackled in the hearth and the smell of freshbaked bread filled the air the wooden furniture looked primitive and wellused but homely the woman herself was in her midtwenties and the long skirt and blouse she wore outlined her slender figure she had a strong jaw and full red lips beneath her fringe of dark hair two large brown eyes watched him go over and rub his hands in front of the fire banks grinned at her no gloves silly of me she held out her hand im patsy janowski pleased to meet you her grip was firm and strong her accent was american im here to see mr ivers he said is he at home yes but hes working you cant see him now he hates to be disturbed and i would hate to disturb him banks said but its important she gave him a thoughtful look then smiled it was a radiant smile and she knew it she looked at her watch why dont i make us some tea and you can try some of my bread its fresh from the oven claude will be down in twenty minutes or so for a short break banks considered the options either way he would have surprise on his side and if he let ivers finish his session the man would probably be better disposed towards him was that what he wanted at this stage he decided it would be helpful he also felt a great sense of respect for the music the man created and would have been loath to interrupt the creative process in addition he had to admit that the prospect of tea and fresh bread was one that appealed very strongly he smiled back at patsy janowski sounds good to me mind if i smoke go ahead i dont myself but claudes a pipe man im used to it i wont be a minute banks sat in front of the fire and lit up the chair was hard and creaked whenever he shifted position but in an odd way it was comfortable a few minutes later patsy came back in with a plate full of warm bread and a steaming teapot covered with a pink quilted cosy she put them on the low table in front of the fire then fetched butter and strawberry jam that done she sat opposite banks nice place he said buttering the bread yes claude bought it after he split up with his wife they had this enormous mansion near eastvale and you know what prices are like these days this was comparatively cheap needed a bit of work and he always wanted to live by the sea he says it inspires his work you know the seas rhythms its music as she spoke banks noticed her lively eyes flitted from one thing to another his wedding ring the scar by his right eye his left foot the middle button on his shirt it wasnt as if she were avoiding eye contact more as if she were conducting an inventory banks nodded at what she said he had noticed musical imitations of the ebb and flow of waves in iverss previous work perhaps such effects would be even more prevalent in the future certainly between the hiss and crackle of the fire he could hear waves pounding the rough sea wall what about you banks asked what about me what do you do its a bit out of the way here isnt it she shrugged why should you assume id prefer the city do you think i like cruising the bars going to discos taking my credit cards shopping she smiled before he could answer i love it here i can amuse myself i read i draw a little i like to cook and go for long walks and im working on my phd dissertation that keeps me busy consider me suitably chastised banks said thank you she treated him to the radiant smile again then frowned what is it you want with claude its a personal matter we do live together you know its not as if i was just a neighbour dropping in for gossip banks smiled she had at least answered a question before hed had to ask it do you know his exwife veronica shildon ive met her why has anything banks held up a hand dont worry nothings happened to her he said and shes not really his exwife patsy said theyre still married she sounded as if she didnt like that state of affairs wanted to avoid the scandal more bread mmm i think i will banks reached forward a drop more tea as well if there is any sure how did you meet claude ivers patsy looked at the pen in bankss top pocket i was studying at york when he was teaching a music appreciation course i took it and kind of well he noticed me weve been living together here for a year now happily yes how often have you met veronica three or four times they were very civilized about things at least they were by the time i came on to the scene what about caroline hartley her jaw set youll have to ask claude about her ive met her once or twice but i cant say i know her look if its at that moment they heard a cracking on the stairs and both turned in unison to see claude ivers duck under the low lintel and walk into the room he made an imposing figure tall gaunt stooped and there was no doubt about the power of his presence he wore a jersey and baggy jeans and his grey hair stuck up in places as if he had been running his hand through it his skin was reddish and leathery like that of a man who has spent a lot of time in the wind and sun and a deep v of concentration furrowed the bridge of his nose he looked to be in his early fifties an inquisitive glance passed between ivers and patsy before she introduced banks ivers shook hands and sat down patsy went to see to his coffee what do you want to see me about he asked banks repressed a childish urge to tell him he liked his music bad news im afraid he said caroline hartley your wifes companion shes dead ivers lurched forward and gripped the sides of his chair good god what how she was murdered but thats absurd things like that dont happen in real life im sorry its true he shook his head is veronica all right shes very upset obviously but apart from that shes okay i take it you still care of course i do banks heard something crash down heavily in the kitchen if you dont mind my saying so mr ivers he went on i find that very difficult to understand if my wife he waved bankss comparison aside listen i went through everything any normal man would go through everything not just anger and rage but disbelief disgust loss of selfesteem loss of selfconfidence i went through hell christ its bad enough when your wife runs away with another man but another woman you forgave her if thats the right word i could never entirely blame veronica in the first place can you understand that it was as if shed been led astray fallen under someone elses influence caroline hartleys he nodded would you tell me what happened for several moments there was silence but for the fire the sea and muted sounds from the kitchen finally ivers stared at banks then cracked his fingers and stretched back in the chair all right he said youre a stranger somehow that makes it easier and we dont get many people to talk to around here sometimes i get a bit stircrazy as patsy puts it theres not a lot to it really one day everything was tine she was happy we were happy at least i thought so maybe she got a bit bored from time to time got depressed now and then but we had a good solid marriage or so i thought then she started seeing a therapist didnt tell me why i dont think she knew herself but i suspect it was a bit of a trend among bored middleclass housewives it didnt seem to be doing her much harm at first so i didnt object but then out of the blue theres this new friend its all caroline says this and caroline says that my wife starts to change in front of my eyes can you believe that she even started using this other girls language saying things she would never say herself she started calling things she liked neat really neat shed say that wasnt veronica and she started dressing differently shed always been a bit on the formal side but now shed wear jeans and a sweatshirt and there was all that interminable talk about jung and selfactualization i think she once told me i was too much the thinking type or some such rot said my music was too intellectual and not emotional enough and she got interested in stuff shed never cared about when id tried to interest her theatre cinema literature she was never in always around at carolines then she even started suggesting that i should go to therapy too but you didnt he stared into the fire and paused as if he realized he had already given too much away then he said quietly i have my demons mr banks but they also fire me im afraid that if i subjected them to therapy id have no more fuel no more creativity whatever veronica might say my musics born from conflict and feeling not just technical skill he tapped his head i really hear those things and i was afraid if i opened my head to some shrink all the music would escape and i would be condemned to silence i couldnt live like that no i didnt go patsy returned with the coffee ivers took it smiled at her and she sat on the floor beside him with her legs curled under her and her hand resting on his thigh did you know at the start of the friendship that caroline was a lesbian banks asked yes veronica told me caroline was living with a woman called nancy wood fair enough i thought live and let live im a musician not the bohemian type perhaps but ive been around enough oddballs in my time not to worry about them too much and im fairly broadminded so caroline was a lesbian i never for a moment thought that my wife so if you blamed anyone it was caroline yes he hesitated realizing what hed said but i didnt kill her if thats what youre getting at what did you do yesterday evening he sipped his coffee and spoke half into the mug stayed in with patsy we dont go out all that much patsy looked at banks and nodded in agreement he saw shadows behind her eyes he wasnt sure he believed her do you own a car he asked we both do where do you park weve got spots reserved in the village behind the pub obviously theres no parking up here when did you last see your wife he thought for a moment about a month ago i was in eastvale on business and i dropped in to see how veronica was doing i called at the shop first i usually do that to avoid meeting caroline but sometimes if its evening i just have to face it out how did caroline react to these visits shed leave the room so you never spoke to her not much no and veronica would be tense id never end up staying long if caroline was around are you sure that was the last time you visited the house a month ago yes of course i am you didnt go there yesterday evening i told you we stayed in youre a musician banks said you must know vivaldis work i of course i do do you know the laudate pueri ivers turned aside and reached for some bread and butter which one he wrote four you know four what four settings for the same liturgical piece i think its psalm but i cant be sure why do you ask have you heard of a singer called magda kalmar yes but i did you usually buy your wife a christmas present i did last year and this year he buttered his bread as he spoke i was going to am i just havent got round to it yet better hurry up then banks said with a smile only one more shopping day to christmas he put his cup down on the hearth and stood up to leave thank you very much for the tea and bread he said to patsy and it was an honour to meet you mr ivers ive enjoyed your music for a long time ivers raised an eyebrow banks was thankful he just nodded and didnt say anything about being surprised that policemen listened to music banks walked over to the door and ivers followed him about veronica he said she must be in a terrible state do you think she needs me i dont know banks said he honestly didnt did a wife who lost her female lover turn back to her husband for comfort maybe you should ask her ivers nodded and the last thing banks noticed before the door closed was the darkening expression in patsy janowskis eyes fixed on the pipe in iverss hand he made his way against the wind back to the car and drove up the hill again the ivers household had left him with a strange feeling however rustic and cosy it was he couldnt help but suspect that all was not well and that nobody had told him the complete truth he had little doubt that ivers had bought the record for veronica and had more than likely delivered it too but he couldnt prove it as soon as he could he would go back to visit claude ivers again three the queens arms was never very busy at five oclock on a winters afternoon it was too late for the lunchtime drinkers and too early for the afterwork crowd the only other customers apart from banks richmond and susan gay were three or four people with shopping bags full of christmas presents the three of them sat in the deep armchairs around the fire banks and richmond were drinking pints and susan had accepted a brandy and soda they had pooled their notes and still had nothing concrete to go on richmond had discovered that nancy wood had left eastvale for an extended trip to australia a phone call to immigration had established that she was indeed there richmond followed with a call to the sydney police who got back to him a couple of hours later with positive confirmation that was one serious suspect eliminated richmond had so far got nowhere with the photograph of ruth the mysterious woman the record too remained unexplained they would have to start canvassing classical record shops all over england and that would take time veronica shildons therapist had confirmed that veronica had left her office at about seven oclock the previous evening as usual and that she had mentioned going shopping you said that caroline ran off to london when she was sixteen banks said to susan thats what her brother told me and she was down there for about six years before she came up to eastvale a lot can happen in that time any idea where she was sorry sir they didnt seem to know anything either that or they werent saying was that the feeling you got there was certainly something weird about them susan shuddered as she spoke never mind well find out when we talk to them again maybe you can get a printout from the pnc phil caroline hartley might have a record down there runaways often get in trouble with the law richmond nodded any other leads banks asked they shook their heads he smiled dont look so bloody despondent susan at least it means youll get christmas day at home sir if we dont solve a murder in twentyfour hours the odds are well be at it a long time a day here or there isnt going to make a lot of difference unless we come up with a hot lead tomorrow and it is christmas things slow down you know as well as i do its impossible to get anything done for a couple of days nobodys around for a start all we can do is get the statements sorted out and see if we can build up a clear picture of the victim you find often enough that the seeds of the death are in the life so to speak and given the life caroline hartley led that may have been more apt in her case well do what we can with the photo the record and the london connection and in a day or two well visit her family again and push a bit harder maybe you and i could have a bit of a chat with the amateur dramatic society again too susan there might be some connections there jealousy rivalry something like that susan nodded and i dont think veronica shildons coming clean with us either banks went on but then shes not likely to shell be protecting carolines memory especially if theres any shady business in the girls past her alibi checks out but there are ten minutes unaccounted for between her return home and going to christine coopers she could have nipped back earlier too say between seven and half past if shed wanted to and only pretended to arrive later then theres cooper himself and his wife for that matter if there was anything odd going on between those two households who knows what kind of can of worms it might have opened all im saying is that we should keep an open mind while we let them all stew for a while let them enjoy christmas maybe well do the rounds again on boxing day when theyre all full and comfy an old sparring partner of mine from the met dirty dick burgess always used to prefer sundays for surprise raids boxing days probably even better richmond raised his eyebrows at the mention of burgess banks and dirty dick had locked horns over a politically sensitive case in eastvale last spring and they had hardly parted on the best of terms apart from banks and burgess only richmond knew the full story banks looked at his watch and finished his pint right id better be off now i want to see if that postmortem reports turned up yet it was already dark outside and the snow had just started falling again the report had indeed turned up banks skipped the technical details for the laymans synopsis that dr glendenning always courteously provided there was nothing new at first she had been hit probably punched on the cheek and the blow could have rendered her unconscious after that she had been viciously and repeatedly stabbed with her own kitchen knife the only blood found at the scene was hers her dressing gown had no bloodstains on it so it had been removed or caroline herself had removed it before the stabbing glendenning had found no signs at all of sexual interference he had however found crumbs of chocolate cake in several of the wounds which led him to believe that the knife had been lying by the cake on the table if so banks thought they were probably dealing with a spur of the moment attack a weapon at hand grabbed and used in anger there were no signs of skin or blood under her fingernails which meant she hadnt had a chance to fight off her attacker and that was it apart from the general information banks read idly through health basically sound appendix scar gave birth to a child he stopped and read that part over again according to glendenning who had been as thorough as usual the cervix showed a multiparous os which meant the deceased had at some point had a baby that cast an interesting new light on things not only did it mean she had had at least one heterosexual relationship it might also explain why she went to london or what might have happened to her down there all the more imperative therefore to find out exactly where shed been and what shed done banks felt that the photograph was a clue given that it was the only memento shed kept apart from a pressed flower ruth was obviously someone important from carolines past banks walked over to the window and looked out on the market square it looked like one of brueghels winter scenes the tree was lit up and shoppers crossed the whitened cobbles to and fro with their packages banks was glad hed done his christmas shopping a week ago the only thing that remained was the booze hed buy that tomorrow a bottle of port a nice dry sherry perhaps some ciardhu single malt if he could afford it then his thoughts drifted back to caroline hartley a baby what a bloody turn up and if there was a baby somewhere there had to be a father maybe a father with a grudge eager to find out if there had been any progress on the record and the scrap of wrapping paper he phoned the forensic lab and asked for vic manson manson was slightly breathless when he came on the line what is it id just this minute put my overcoat on i was on my way out banks smiled to himself and lit a cigarette manson was always on his way somewhere sorry vic i wont keep you long just wanted to know if youve got anything for us on the hartley murder manson sighed not a lot no dabs we cant account for the knife was washed but we found traces of blood and crumbs where the blade meets the handle what about the record nothing besides people usually hold records by the edge no room for prints there the cover and inside sleeve were clean too anything else it looked new the record as far as we can tell it was in mint condition only been played a few times how many cant tell for sure two or three at the most but take our word it was new the paper common or garden christmas wrapping paper could have come from anywhere it does look like it had been wrapped around the record though it fits to a tee but theres no gift tag with the murderers name on unfortunately well at least weve got something thanks vic look can you send the record over to me when youve done with it of course tomorrow okay fine dont let me keep you any longer and have a good christmas you too banks hung up walked back to the window and lit a cigarette what the hell was it about the music that bothered him why did it have to mean something he would find out as much as he could about vivaldis laudate pueri all four versions claude ivers admitted he knew them but that didnt mean anything he must have known that if hed feigned ignorance given his musical reputation banks would have immediately become even more suspicious but ivers knew more than he let on that was for certain and so did patsy janowski she of the wandering eyes well give them time he thought as he smoked and looked down on the brueghel scene theyre not going anywhere let them think theyre safe then one james conran lived in a small terrace house on the northwest edge of town where cardigan drive met north market street and turned into the main swainsdale road at the far end of his living room a manual typewriter sat on a table by the window the view to the west along snowshrouded swainsdale was superb bookcases flanked the table on both sides with books on all subjects banks took a quick glance history theatre music but hardly any fiction a small sofa and two matching armchairs formed a semicircle around the hearth where a coal fire smouldered on the wall above the mantelpiece hung a poster advertising a performance of the duchess of malfi at stratford there was no television set but a music centre with a compactdisc player stood opposite the fireplace banks ran his eyes over the records and discs most of them the works of classical composers beethoven zelenka bax stanford mozart elgar there was some vivaldi including the stabat mater but not the laudate pueri conran having explained to banks how susan had once been one of his pupils was now fussing over her and offering to make tea both she and banks accepted nice collection of discs banks observed are you a musician merely a dabbler conran said i sang with the church choir when i was a boy then with an amateur outfit in york i also directed the choir at eastvale comprehensive for a few years mostly i might add because no one else would take on the job but thats just about the limit of my musical abilities i am a good listener however as conran made tea in the kitchen banks continued reading book and record titles it helped get a sense of people he always thought to discover their tastes in literature and music conran definitely read to learn not for pleasure which hinted at a certain amount of intellectual and artistic ambition his record collection while fairly eclectic favoured choral works perhaps an unconscious leftover from his choir days the fact that he owned a compactdisc player showed he was serious about his listening though she said she liked classical music veronica shildon only had an old stereo system a turntable complete with arm and spindle for stacking records no one who genuinely loved music would play it on such antiquated equipment especially if they could afford better no veronica shildons priorities lay elsewhere than music in decor perhaps in creating the sense of a cosy and comfortable home but conran clearly valued his artistic pleasures over material ones banks warmed his hands by the fire i should imagine you got to know caroline hartley pretty well during rehearsals for twelfth night he said can you tell us anything about her such as what anything at all her habits moods your impression of her believe me every little bit helps its very difficult conran said i mean i didnt know her that well none of us did really what was your relationship with her conran frowned relationship id hardly say we had a relationship what are you implying you were directing her in a theatrical production isnt that so well yes but thats a relationship i see i i thought anyway yes i directed her on stage it was a purely working relationship you dont really find out much about people when youre busy telling them where to stand and how to speak you know what did you think of her she was a very talented and attractive girl a natural its a real tragedy shed have gone far had she lived yet you only gave her a small part it was her first performance she needed more experience but she was quick it wouldnt have taken her long to get to the top if shed put her mind to it mercurial i think thats the best word to describe her talent how did she get on with the rest of the cast conran shrugged all right i suppose did she form any special relationships was she close to anyone in particular not that i know of were all pretty chummy really when it comes down to it after all this isnt the west end its meant to be fun thats the reason im involved she did join you for drinks after rehearsals sometimes didnt she yes usually but you can hardly get to know somebody in a group situation like that who did she talk to everyone really how did she behave i dont understand was she comfortable with the group as far as i could tell did you know she was a lesbian banks asked caroline he shook his head i dont believe it do you have evidence to the contrary of course not conran snapped stop twisting everything i say what i mean is im surprised she she what well you dont expect things like that do you she seemed quite normal to me heterosexual conran looked at susan as if pleading for support youre doing it again ive no knowledge of her sex life at all all im saying is she seemed normal to me so she didnt tell you anything about her private life no she kept herself to herself i knew nothing at all about what she did when she left the hall or the pub oh come on surely some of the men in the cast must have tried it on with her maybe you even tried yourself who wouldnt how did she respond im not sure what you mean its obvious enough was she cold polite friendly rude oh i see well no she certainly wasnt cold shed joke and flirt like the rest i suppose its not something i actually thought about she was always friendly and cheerful or so it seemed to me terrible waste dont you think a beautiful woman like that and no man stood a chance with her conran glanced down into his mug and muttered it takes all sorts chief inspector who did she usually sit next to it varied did you notice anything at all that hinted at a more than superficial relationship with anyone in the cast male or female no banks sipped some tea and leaned back in his chair in a close group like that you must get all sorts of pressures ive heard that actors sometimes have very fragile egos did you get many tantrums or rows any professional jealousies only over petty matters conran said like youd get in any team situation as i said were in it for pleasure not ambition or fame petty matters can you be a bit more specific i honestly cant remember any examples anything involving caroline hartley he shook his head was there any special reason why caroline didnt join you all for a drink after rehearsal on december twentysecond nobody went to the pub that evening we didnt always go you know it was a very casual thing but you went yes alone i wanted to mull over the rehearsal i seem to be able to think better about things like that when theres a bit of noise and festive activity around me drink much a bit i wasnt drunk if thats what you mean had anything odd happened between four and six any fights threats arguments there was nothing unusual no everybody was tired thats all or they had shopping to do surely you cant think one of the cast right now im keeping an open mind banks put down his mug why did you give up teaching mr conran if conran was surprised by the abrupt change in questioning he didnt show it id always wanted to write as soon as i had a little success i decided to burn my bridges much as i enjoyed it teaching made too many demands on my time and energy how do you make your living now surely not from the eastvale amateur dramatic society good lord no thats just a hobby really i work as a freelance writer ive also had a few plays produced on television some radio work banks looked around the room again dont you even watch your own work conran laughed i do have a television as a matter of fact i dont watch it very often so i keep it upstairs in the spare room one of the advantages of being a bachelor plenty of space are you working on anything right now conran beamed and sat forward hands clasped in his lap as a matter of fact i am ive just got this wonderful commission from the bbc to dramatize john cowper powyss novel weymouth sands itll be a hard task very hard but it pays well and its an honour to be involved im not the only writer in the project of course but still youre a long way from weymouth banks remarked come from down there little cheney actually you wont have heard of it its a small village in dorset i thought i could spot a trace of that hardy country burr well mr conran sorry to have bothered you on christmas eve hope we havent kept you from your family i have no family conran said and you havent kept me from anything no he stood up and shook hands then helped susan on with her coat back outside at the car banks turned to susan and said do you know i think he fancies you susan blushed he probably fancies anything in a skirt you could be right he seemed a bit edgy didnt he i wonder if theres more to this dramatic society than meets the eye you know the kind of thing fiery passions lurking beneath the surface of dull suburban life susan laughed could be she said or perhaps hes just shaken up and did i miss something banks said or did he tell us nothing at all he told us nothing susan agreed but i certainly got the impression he knew much more than he let on banks opened the car door yes he said yes i think he did didnt he thats the trouble with cases like this everybodys got something to hide two on christmas eve at four oclock the queens arms was packed businessmen off work early for the holidays loosened their ties smoked cigars and laughed themselves red in the face at dirty jokes friends met for a last few drinks before parting to spend the holidays with their families groups of female office workers drank brightly coloured concoctions and laughed about the way the mailroom boys hands had roamed during the office party a large proportion of the eastvale police force denied their favourite spot by the fire had pulled together two round tables with dimpled copper tops and castiron legs for their own party it was a movable feast men nipped over from the station for a quick one then returned to cover for others even fred rowe managed to drop by for a couple of pints while young tolliver took over the front desk the only real continuity was provided by the cid gristhorpe banks richmond and susan gay who had managed to hang on to their chairs amidst the chaos around them everyone seemed to be having a good time the atmosphere was cheery with its blazing fire and green and red decorations the only thing banks found objectionable especially after a couple of pints was the music that cyril the landlord had piped in for the occasion it sounded like airportmusic versions of christmas carols gristhorpe didnt seem to mind but he was tonedeaf after the visit to conrans they had achieved very little that day and nothing more would be achieved by working longer by midafternoon it had been almost impossible to reach anyone on the phone if you did happen to be lucky enough all you got for your trouble was a drunken babble in the earpiece police work may never stop completely but it does slow down at times the only coppers working harder than ever now would be the road patrols chasing after drunken drivers richmond had talked to carolines staff at the garden café but found out nothing more about her no they had never suspected she might be a lesbian she had kept her private life to herself just as conran had said she was cheerful and friendly yes good with customers but a closed book when it came to her personal life she never talked about boyfriends or shared her problems as some of the other women did richmond had also dropped in on christine cooper and taken her through her story again the details matched word for word he had first taken the initiative of phoning his mother and asking her what had happened on the december broadcasts of emmerdale farm and coronation street passing himself off as a fan who had missed his favourite programmes he asked christine cooper to give him a blow by blow description of them which she did that accounted for her whereabouts between seven and eight oclock caroline hartley had last been seen alive around seventwenty answering the door to a female visitor unless christine cooper had nipped out during the commercials and stabbed her with the handy kitchen knife or unless she was such a cunning killer she had videotaped the television programmes in case someone asked about them then it looked as if she was out of the running so far richmond had not been able to satisfy himself about her husbands alibi but he planned to pay a visit to barnard castle after christmas when the shop reopened the only new fact he had discovered via the pnc was that caroline hartley had been arrested for soliciting in london five years ago that seemed to back up what her brother gary had said about her life there but it still left a lot unsaid had gary actually known what she was doing or had he made an inspired guess both he and carolines father said that caroline had never contacted them during her time in london were they lying if so why for the moment though the festive season chased away day to day concerns even susan gay was knocking back the old peculiar and chatting with the others more easily than she usually did what are you doing over the holidays banks asked her over the racket going home because if youre stuck for somewhere he went on you can always join us for christmas dinner i know you dont get enough time off to really go anywhere thanks susan said but its all right sheffields not that far banks nodded richmond he knew would be spending the day with his family in town gristhorpe was coming to the bankss this year for their first two christmases up north banks and his family had gone out to his farmhouse where mrs hawkins the woman what did for him had done them proud this year however mrs hawkins and her husband had been invited to their daughters in cambridge it would be the first christmas away for them but as the daughter had recently borne them a grandchild they could hardly refuse gristhorpe had played hard to get at first but had succumbed without too much of a fight at bankss third invitation banks suspected that it was actually sandras telling gristhorpe that the house was now a smokefree environment that had finally tipped the balance at five oclock banks decided it was time to leave he had had three pints of theakstons bitter just about the right amount to work up an appetite sandra would be expecting him for dinner he was due to help with the big meal tomorrow mostly the dull stuff he imagined chopping vegetables and setting the table as his cooking skills were limited but tonight was sandras treat he said his goodbyes and wandered out into the snow which had been falling on and off all day opposite the blue lamp outside the police station shed its avuncular light banks didnt know why he hated it so much but he did it was phoney a kind of cheap nostalgia for a time when things were simpler or at least we fooled ourselves into believing they were simpler when the goodies wore white and the baddies wore black maybe it really had been like that but banks doubted it certainly nothing could ever have been simple for the caroline hartleys and veronica shildons of this world anyway he told himself no more gloomy thoughts he stuck on his headphones and fiddled with the walkman in his pocket the music hed chosen was his own tribute to the season benjamin brittens a ceremony of carols it was difficult though to put the case out of his mind not the investigation the details or the leads but the sheer fact of caroline hartleys brutal murder even at the pub he had felt at times like a spectator watching everyone celebrate but was held back from joining in by what he had seen at number eleven oakwood mews still it was christmas eve and he had to make an effort to be jolly for his familys sake the snow was crisp and squeaky at last eastvale had the white christmas it had been screaming for during the past three or four rainy ones coloured lights winked on and off in windows and banks felt for a moment that fleeting sense of peace and relaxation in the air that seems to arise and flourish briefly when the commercial fervour of the season begins to abate he remembered his own childhood christmases the sleepless nights before the big day the early mornings opening presents the disappointment the year his parents hadnt been able to buy him the bicycle he wanted because his father was out of work the joy two years later when he got an even better one than he had expected at home the decorations were up the lights were on and the children were brimming with excitement and curiosity about their presents at least tracy was brian being seventeen was much more cool about the whole thing no you cant open them tonight banks told his daughter but laura collins says they do at her house oh go on dad please no banks wasnt about to have a lifetimes tradition changed because of laura collins tracy pouted for a while but she wasnt the kind to sulk for long brian kept quiet as though he didnt even care whether he got a present all that interested him was pop music and banks had bought him a secondhand guitar hed spotted in a shop window of course it would mean a bit of noise to put up with banks didnt have much regard for his sons taste but far be it from him to stand in the way of the lads musical ambitions euterpe like god works in mysterious ways raucous pop music might inspire someone to learn the guitar but tastes change and the talent might well end up in the service of jazz blues or classical music tracy had been a good deal less specific in her demands but both banks and sandra had thought it a good idea to acknowledge that she was no longer a little girl she was after all fifteen and though her interest in history remained steady and had even extended to take in literature she had a new look in her eyes when the subject of boys came up banks had also noticed the odd pop star poster surreptitiously making its way onto her bedroom wall so rather than books they had bought her some fashionable new clothes and a makeup kit when banks looked at his children now it was with a tinge of sadness in his heart next year he would be forty and soon he would lose them to their own lives completely after a tasty beef stew with dumplings a frugal dinner to counterbalance tomorrows blowout came that time of evening when banks could start to relax the children out or occupied in their rooms the television turned off a tumbler of good scotch quiet music and sandra beside him on the sofa when he went for his refill he remembered the photograph he had brought home in his briefcase along with the record vic manson had sent over that afternoon he had hardly looked at it but something about it rang a bell sandra with her knowledge of photography should be able to help him he took the photograph out and handed it to her what do you think of that sandra examined it close up then held it at arms length do you mean technically any way you like well its obviously good a professional job you can tell that by the lighting and the way hes made it seem like a relaxed pose she looks very studious a striking woman good quality paper too why would someone have a photograph like that taken well lots of people have portraits done but i see what you mean theres something about it i cant put my finger on banks said somehow i think its more than a portrait i just wondered if you had any ideas hmm that look in her eyes very intelligent a bit haughty i wonder if that was her or the photographer what do you mean some photographers really capture a persons essence in their portraits but some create an image you know for pop stars or advertising im just not sure what this is thats it banks slapped the chair arm an image a pose why would someone want a photographer to create an image sandra put the photograph carefully aside on the coffee table for publicity i suppose right thats what was bothering me it must be a publicity picture of some kind that gives us a chance of tracking her down you need to find this woman yes youll still have a hell of a job it could be for anything modelling movies theatre banks shook his head caroline had an interest in theatre but i get the impression thats more of a recent passion still she could be an actress shes attractive yes but shes no model you said it yourself look at the intelligence the arrogance in that tilt of the head and the eyes and veronica shildon said the woman wrote poetry a book jacket those are the lines i was thinking along it could be a publicity still for an authors tour or something that should narrow things down a bit we can check with publishers and theatrical agents banks paused for a moment then went on speaking of caroline hartley did you ever meet her i met her a couple of times with the group when i went for a drink with marcia after working late in the gallery but i didnt know her i never even spoke to her what was your impression i can only tell you how she acted as part of a group in a pub she was very beautiful you couldnt help but notice her smooth complexion and her eyes notice and envy sandra put her hand to her own cheek which banks had always thought of as soft and unblemished in looks she reminded me a bit of that actress who played juliet in the old film whats her name olivia hussey and mostly she was vivacious sparkling though she did seem to have her quiet periods as if the energy was a bit of a hard act to keep up sometimes quiet periods yes i just remember her staring into space sometimes looking a bit lost never for long because there was always somebody wanting to attract her attention but it was noticeable did she seem especially close to anyone else in the group i dont know she chatted and laughed with them all but only in a general friendly way you never saw her arguing with anyone no did you know she was a lesbian not until you told me but why would i i dont know i just wondered if it was in any way obvious to you no to both questions did you ever notice anyone obviously chatting her up sandra laughed well most of the men did yes how did she react id say she played them along nicely if anything id have said she was a flirt a bit of a tease really but now i know the truth selfprotection i suppose what about the women sandra shook her head i didnt notice anything did james conran usually turn up for a drink hes the only one ive met apart from marcia the costume manager usually yes he seems like a pleasant fellow a bit theatrical highly strung drinks a fair bit i mean a lot of actors are really shy arent they they have to get themselves tanked up and play parts to express themselves and hes a bit of a practical joker nothing serious he just likes arranging for someones drink to be all tonic and no gin for example or having the barman tell someone theres none of their favourite pub grub left id say hes a bit of a ladies man too you know that vulnerable look the dedicated suffering artist hes pretty sure of himself really ill bet he just finds the act useful and i know for a fact hes been having it off with olivia olivia who i dont know her real name the actress whos playing olivia they had a bit of a tiff in the pub one night in the corridor that leads to the toilets and i happened to overhear them arguing she seemed to think now hed got what he wanted he wasnt interested any more and she told him that was fine with her because she hadnt liked it much anyway when was this quite early on in rehearsals i cant remember exactly midnovember maybe did he ever make a pass at you no he knew i was married to a tough detective whod beat him to a pulp if he did banks laughed what about caroline you mean did he come on to her yes well he contrived to sit next to her often enough and arrange for the occasional bit of accidental body contact id say he was putting the moves on her yes no wonder conran had been so tetchy when banks had asked about his relationship with caroline people often denied their true relationships with victims especially with murder victims how did she react he asked she pretended she didnt notice but she was always polite and friendly towards him after all he is the director i should hardly think directors of local amateur dramatic societies have casting couches no but they could make a persons life difficult if they wanted i suppose so what about this olivia might she have had good reason to resent carolines presence not that i noticed look alan do you think you could pack it in for a while its christmas eve im not used to being interrogated in my own home you know im glad to be of help whenever i can but i didnt know caroline hartley was going to get herself murdered so i didnt pay a lot of attention to who she did or didnt talk to banks scratched his head sorry love i cant seem to let it drop can i another drink please i dont mean to be banks held up his hand its okay youre right not another word he brought the drinks and turned out the main lights all they had left was the light from the christmas tree from the fake log in the electric fire and a red candle he lit and placed on the low table he could hear a monotonous pop song playing upstairs on brians portable cassette player when he sat down again he put his arm around sandra thats more like it she said mmm tell me something do you think you could ever see yourself going to bed with another woman what do you have in mind inviting jenny fuller over for a threesome unfortunately jennys away for christmas sandra hit him gently on the chest beast no seriously could you sandra was quiet for a moment her dark eyebrows knit together and tiny candle flames burned in her blue eyes banks sipped his drink and wished he could have a cigarette maybe later while sandra was getting ready for bed he could nip outside in the cold and have a few quick drags that should soon cure him of the habit well hypothetically the idea doesnt offend me sandra said finally i mean its nothing i think about much but it doesnt disgust me its hard to explain ive had crushes what schoolgirl or schoolboy hasnt but they never led to anything i cant say ive thought about it a lot over the years but theres something about the idea of being with another woman thats sort of comforting in a way it doesnt feel threatening to me when i think about it im probably not making much sense but ive had a few drinks and you did ask i think i understand banks said men always like the idea of two women together dont they it excites them banks had to admit that it did but he didnt know why so far he hadnt allowed himself to picture the sexual side of veronicas relationship with caroline though he guessed they had been a passionate couple and where theres passion he mused snuggling closer to sandra theres often likely to be violence even murder three susan left the pub shortly after banks and as soon as she got home to the bare empty flat she felt dizzy first she drank a large glass of water then she turned on the television and lay down on the sofa the picture looked blurred suddenly she started to feel horribly depressed and nauseated she remembered the lies she had told banks about going home to sheffield for christmas she had no intention of going she would phone and tell her parents she couldnt make it because she was working on an important case a murder and she would spend the day in her flat doing a few domestic chores and reading that new american book on homicide investigation she had enough food a tin of spaghetti a frozen chicken dinner so she didnt need to go out and risk being seen by someone because she only lived half a mile or so from banks she would have to be careful she had bought and wrapped her presents days ago she would try to pay a visit home next week or early in the new year somehow it was easier on nonfestive occasions the forced enjoyment of the season only exacerbated her discomfort for the same reason she had always hated and avoided new years eve parties the tv picture still looked blurred when she closed her eyes the world spun around and seemed to pull her into a swirling vortex that made her stomach heave she opened her eyes again quickly she felt sick but didnt want to get up the third time she tried her thoughts settled down and she fell into an uneasy sleep in her dream she moved into a room like the one gary hartley lived in and she called it home a highceilinged dark cold place crumbling around her as she stood there and when she looked at the far wall it wasnt a wall at all but a mesh of cobwebs beyond which more ruined rooms with dusty floorboards and walls of flaking plaster stretched to infinity when she went over to investigate a huge fat spider dropped from the ceiling and hung inches from her nose it seemed to be grinning at her susans own scream woke her as soon as she came to consciousness she realized that she had been struggling for some time to get out of the nightmare her clothes were mussed up and a film of cold sweat covered her brow frantically she looked around her at the room it was the same thank god dull empty characterless but the same she staggered to the kitchen and splashed her face with cold water too much to drink that old peculiar was powerful stuff and richmond had insisted on buying her a brandy and babycham no wonder she felt the way she did she cursed herself for the fool she was and prayed to god she hadnt made an idiot of herself in front of the others she looked at her watch seven oclock her head felt a little clearer now despite the dull ache behind her eyes she couldnt shake the dream though or the sense of panic it had caused in her she made tea paced about the room while the kettle boiled switching tv channels then suddenly she knew she had to do something about her bare joyless flat she couldnt go home but neither could she spend christmas day in such a miserable place the visit to gary hartley had shaken her up even more than shed realized panicking that it might be too late she looked at her watch again twenty to eight surely some places in the shopping centre would be staying open extra hours tonight every year christmas seemed to get more and more commercial they wouldnt miss a business opportunity like christmas eve all those lastminute desperate shoppers guilty because theyve forgotten someone susan hadnt forgotten anyone except herself she grabbed her coat and dashed for the door still time there had to be one christmas day in the banks household passed the way christmas days usually pass for small families plenty of noisy excitement and too much to eat and drink downstairs at nine oclock a great improvement over the ridiculously early hours they had woken up on christmas mornings past brian and tracy opened their presents while sandra and banks sipped champagne and orange juice and opened theirs outside framed in the bay window fresh snow hung heavy on the roofs and eaves of the houses opposite and formed a thick unmarked carpet across street and lawns alike banks and sandra were happy with their presents mostly clothes book or record tokens and the inevitable aftershave perfume and chocolates brian quickly disappeared upstairs with his guitar and tracy spent an hour in the bathroom preparing herself for dinner gristhorpe arrived about noon they ate at one thirty got the dishes out of the way as quickly as possible then watched the queens message which banks found as dull and pointless as ever the rest of the afternoon the adults spent variously chatting drinking and dozing around teatime banks and sandra made a few phone calls to their parents and distant friends in deference to gristhorpes tin ear banks refrained from playing music most of the time but later in the evening when brian and tracy had gone up to their rooms and the three adults sat enjoying the peace he couldnt restrain himself off and on he had been thinking about caroline hartley and was anxious to check out the music he was sure that it had some connection with the murder now he could hold back no longer he searched through his cassette collection for the vivaldi he thought he had there it was the magnificat with laudate pueri and beatus vir on the same tape first he put on the record that vic manson had sent over from forensics the familiar music with its stately opening and pure soaring vocal disturbed him with the memory of what he had seen in veronica shildons front room three days ago he could picture again the macabre beauty of the scene blazing fire christmas lights candles sheepskin rug and caroline hartley draped on the sofa the blood had run so thickly down her front that she had looked as if she were wearing a bib or as if an undergarment had slipped up over her breasts carefully he removed the needle i was enjoying that sandra said better than some of the rubbish you play sorry banks said try this he put the cassette in the player and waited for the music to start it was very different the opening was far more sprightly reminiscent of spring from the four seasons what are you after sandra asked banks stopped the tape theyve got the same title by the same composer but theyre different any fool can hear that even me gristhorpe added claude ivers was right then banks muttered to himself he could have sworn he had a piece by vivaldi called laudate pueri but he hadnt recognized the music he heard at the scene the sleeve notes for the record told him very little he turned to the cassette notes and read through the brief biographical sketch vivaldi affectionately called il prete rosso because of his flaming red hair had taken holy orders but ill health prevented him from working actively as a priest he had served at the pietà a kind of orphanagecumconservatory for girls in venice from to and would have been asked to compose sacred music when there was no choirmaster the blurb went on outlining the composers career and trying to pin down dates of composition the laudate pueri had probably been written for a funeral at the pietà one of its sections the antiphon sit nomen domini revealed the liturgical context as a burial service for very young children there was more about vivaldis setting being hardly solemn enough for a childs funeral but banks was no longer paying attention he went back to the word sheet enclosed in the record sleeve and read through the translation so few words so much music according to the translator sit nomen domini benedictum ex hoc nunc et usque in saeculum meant blessed be the name of the lord from henceforth now and for ever what that had to do with funerals or children banks had no idea he realized he didnt know enough about the liturgy he would have to talk to a churchman if he really wanted to discover the true relevance of the music the main point however was that what banks now knew how the music tied in with the information he had got from glendennings postmortem caroline hartley had given birth to a child according to bankss theories so far this had either been the reason for her flight to london or it had occurred while she had been there another chat with veronica shildon might clear that up where was the child what had happened to it and who was the father perhaps if he could answer some of those questions he would know where to begin as far as musical knowledge went claude ivers certainly seemed the most likely candidate to have brought the record already banks was far from satisfied with his account of himself naturally ivers would deny having called at veronicas house on the night of the murder he was known to have a grudge against caroline hartley but he must have realized he had left the record why take such a risk surely he must understand that the police would have ways of finding out who had bought the record even if there was no gift tag on the wrapping or did he like many geniuses his connection with the practical realities of life was probably tenuous and ivers couldnt have had anything to do with caroline hartleys baby unless they had known one another some time ago very unlikely put some carols on sandra said and stop sitting on the floor there staring into space what oh sorry banks snapped out of it and got up to freshen the drinks he searched through the pile of records and tapes for something suitable kathleen battle yes that would do nicely but even as o little town of bethlehem began his mind was on vivaldis requiem for a dead child caroline hartleys baby and the photograph of ruth the mystery woman christmas or not veronica shildon was going to get another visit very soon he went into the hall took his cigarettes and lighter from his jacket pocket and slipped quietly out into the backyard for a peaceful smoke two veronica shildon this is detective constable susan gay it was an embarrassing introduction but it had to be made banks was well aware of the modern meaning of gay but he was no more responsible for the words diminishment than he was for susans surname banks noticed the ironic smiled flit across veronicas lips and saw susan give a longsuffering smile in return something she would never have done in other circumstances veronica stretched out her hand good to meet you please sit down she sat opposite them back straight legs crossed hands folded in her lap the excessive formality of her body language seemed at odds with the casual slacks and grey sweatshirt she was wearing she offered them some sherry which they accepted and when she went to fetch it she walked as if shed put in a lot of time carrying library books on her head finally when they all had their glasses to hide behind veronica seemed ready for questions starting gently banks first asked her about the furniture whether she wanted the sofa cushions and the rug back she said no she never wished to see them again she was going to redecorate the room completely and as soon as the holidays were over and the shops had reopened she was going to buy a new suite and carpet how are you managing with the flower shop he asked i have a very trustworthy assistant patricia shell take care of things until i feel ready again did caroline ever have anything to do with your business the shop your partner veronica shook her head david my partner lives in newcastle and rarely comes here he was a friend of claudes one of the few that stuck with me when anyway he regards the shop more as an investment than anything else and patricia shes only eighteen i assume she has her own circle of friends banks nodded and sipped some sherry then he slipped the signed photograph from his briefcase are you sure you cant tell me any more about this woman veronica looked at the photograph again it was something personal to caroline she answered i never pried there were parts of her she kept hidden i could accept that all i know is that her name was ruth and she wrote poetry where does she live ive no idea but caroline lived in london for some years before she came up here and youve never met this ruth never seen her no banks bent to slip the photograph back into his briefcase and said casually before he had even sat up to face her again did you know that caroline had a conviction for soliciting soliciting i i veronica paled and looked away at the wall so they couldnt see her eyes no she whispered is there anything at all you can tell us about carolines life in london veronica regained her composure she sipped some sherry and faced them again no banks ran his hand through his cropped hair come on ms shildon he said you lived with her for two years she must have talked about her past as i understand it you were undergoing therapy caroline too do you seriously expect me to believe that two people digging into their psyches like that never spoke to one another about important things veronica sat up even straighter and gave banks a look as cold and grey as the north sea believe what you want chief inspector ive told you what i know caroline lived in london for a number of years she didnt have a very happy time there what she was working through in analysis was private how was she when you met her when i when you first met ive told you she was living with nancy wood she seemed happy enough it wasnt a it was just a casual relationship they shared a flat i believe but there was no deep commitment what else can i say was she more or less disturbed back then than she has been lately oh more definitely more as i said she seemed happy enough at least on the surface but she had some terrible problems to wrestle with what problems personal ones psychological problems like the ones we all have havent you read the poem they fuck you up your mum and dad they dont mean to but they do she reddened when shed finished as if just realizing there had been a fourletter word in the literary quotation philip larkin banks who had heard from susan all about the hartley home could certainly believe that he knew something about larkins poetry too through gristhorpe and a recent channel four special and made a mental note to have another look at the poem later but she was making progress he asked yes slowly she was becoming whole the scars dont go away but you recognize them and learn to live with them the better you understand why you are what you are the more youre able to alter destructive patterns of behaviour she managed a wry smile at herself im sorry if i sound like a commercial for my therapist but you did ask was anything bothering her lately was she especially upset about anything veronica thought for a moment and drank more sherry banks was coming to see this as a signal of a forthcoming lie or evasion quite the opposite veronica said finally as i told you she was making great progress with regard to her personal problems our life together was very happy and she was excited about the play it was only a small part but the director led her to believe there would be better ones to follow i dont know if mr conran was leading her to expect too much but from what she told me he seemed convinced of her talent did you ever meet james conran no caroline told me all this did she ever tell you that he fancied her veronica smiled she said he chatted her up a lot i think she knew he found her attractive and felt she could use it thats a bit coldblooded isnt it depends on your point of view how far was she willing to go veronica put her glass down look chief inspector i dont mind answering your questions when theyre relevant but i dont see how speaking or implying ill of the dead is going to help you at all banks leaned forward now you listen to me for a moment ms shildon were looking for the person who killed your companion at the moment weve no idea who this person might be if caroline did anything that might have led to her death we need to know whether it reflects well or badly on her now how far was she willing to go with james conran veronica pale and stiff remained silent a while when she spoke it was in a quiet tired voice it was only an amateur dramatic society she said the way you speak anyone would think we were talking about a movie role caroline could flirt and flatter mens egos easily enough but thats as far as shed go she wasnt mercenary or cold but she did lead men on it was part of her way of dealing with them if they were willing to be led she didnt sleep with them no and i would have known believe me so everything seemed to be going well for caroline there was nothing to worry or upset her again the hesitation the ladylike sip of sherry no its best not to hold anything back he said ive already told you you cant have any idea what information might be valuable in an investigation like this leave decisions like that to us veronica looked directly at him he could see courage pain and stubborn evasion in her eyes he let the silence stretch then gave susan who had been busy taking notes a discreet signal to go ahead veronica susan asked softly did you know about carolines baby this time the reaction was unmistakably honest she almost spilled her sherry and her eyes widened what veronica shildon certainly hadnt known about carolines baby and the fact that she hadnt known surprised her which meant banks deduced that she probably did know a lot more about caroline than she was willing to let on caroline had a baby some years ago susan went on we cant say exactly when but we were hoping you might be able to help veronica was able only to shake her head in disbelief were assuming she had it in london banks said thats why anything you can tell us about carolines life there would be a great help a baby veronica echoed caroline she never said a word its true susan said but what happened to it where is it thats what wed like to know banks said did you know that music the laudate pueri was used at burial services for children veronica looked at him as if she didnt understand her thin straight lips pressed tight together and a frown spread over her brow from a deep v at the top of her nose what does that have to do with it she asked maybe nothing but someone put that record on and made sure it was going to stay on you say it wasnt yours so someone must have brought it perhaps the killer you said you like classical music of course i could hardly have lived with claude for ten years if i didnt could i banks shrugged i dont know people make the strangest sacrifices for comfort and security i might have sacrificed my independence and my pride chief inspector but my love for music wasnt feigned i assure you i did then and still do enjoy all kinds of classical music but caroline didnt what does it matter i was quite happy to enjoy my records when she was out banks who had often suffered sandras opposition to some of the music he liked understood that well enough is it he asked the kind of present your husband might have given you if youre expecting me to implicate claude in this i wont do it we may have separated but i wish him no harm are you trying to suggest that there is some obscure link between this music the baby and carolines death the link seems obvious enough between the first two banks said but as for the rest i dont know if youd never seen the record before someone must have brought it over that evening it would help a lot if we knew who the father of carolines child was veronica shook her head slowly i didnt know i really didnt know about the baby i mean does it surprise you to discover that caroline wasnt exclusively lesbian no its not that after all ive hardly been exclusively so myself have i most people arent most people like us she tilted her head back and fixed him with a cool grey look it might interest you to know chief inspector just for the record that im not ashamed of what i am and neither was caroline but we werent crusaders we didnt go around holding hands and mauling one another in public nor did we proselytize on behalf of groups or causes that seem to think sexual preference is an important issue in everything from ordination as a church minister to what kind of breakfast cereal one buys like most peoples sex lives ours was an intimate and private matter at least it was until the papers got hold of this story they soon discovered i was married to claude and why we parted and it hasnt taken them long to guess at the nature of my relationship with caroline i shouldnt worry too much banks offered people pay much less attention to the gutter press during the christmas season do you know if caroline had any affairs while she was living with you with men or women veronica fingered the neckline of her sweatshirt youre very forthright arent you i sometimes have to be can you answer the question veronica paused then said as far as i know she didnt and i think i would have known of course she was attractive to men and she knew it she dealt with it as best she could what were her feelings about men fear contempt why veronica looked down into her glass and almost whispered who can say where something like that starts i dont know what about you my feelings toward men yes i cant see how thats relevant chief inspector but i certainly dont hate men i suppose i fear them somewhat like caroline but perhaps not as much they threaten me in a way but i have no trouble dealing with them in the course of business mostly they confuse me i certainly have no desire ever to live with one again she had finished her sherry and put the glass down on the low table as though announcing the end of the interview are you sure she wasnt involved with any members of the cast things like that do happen you know when people work together veronica shook her head all i can say is that she never came home late or stayed out all night did carolines brother ever visit you here susan asked gary he hardly left the house as far as i know you never met him no did he know where the two of you lived of course he did caroline told me she gave him the address in case of emergency shed drop by every once in a while to see how things were with her father you never went with her no she didnt want me to banks could understand why did anyone know you were going shopping after your therapy session the other evening he asked nobody at least i i mean caroline knew apart from caroline she might have told someone though i cant think why i certainly dont announce such domestic trivia to the world at large of course not but you might have mentioned it to someone i might have in passing but you cant remember to whom i cant even remember mentioning it to anyone other than ursula my therapist why is it important did your husband know she uncrossed her legs and shifted in her chair claude why would he i dont know you tell me veronica shook her head i told you ive not seen him for a while he phoned me yesterday to offer his condolences but i dont think it would be a good time tor us to meet again not for a while tell me is there any chance that your husband knew caroline hartley before you introduced them what a strange question no of course he didnt how could he without my knowing banks shook his head and gestured to susan that they were about to leave they stood up thanks for your time banks said at the door i hope it wasnt too painful for you not too much no incomprehensible perhaps but the pain was bearable banks smiled i told you its best to leave the sorting out to us she looked away yes as he turned she suddenly touched his arm and he swung around to face her again chief inspector she said this woman ruth if you do find her would you tell me i know its foolish but id really like to meet her from what caroline told me ruth had quite an influence on her on the kind of life shed begun to make for herself im being honest with you i know nothing more about her than that banks nodded all right ill see what i can do and if you remember anything else please call me she started to say something but it turned into a quick goodbye and a hastily closed door the chill hit them as soon as they walked out into oakwood mews banks shivered and slipped on his black leather gloves a christmas present from sandra the sky looked like iron and the pavement was slick with ice well susan said as they walked carefully down the street she didnt have much to tell us did she shes holding back i think shes telling the truth about not knowing the woman in the photograph but shes holding back about almost everything else maybe you could pick up the key from the station and drop in at the community centre caroline may have left some of her things there in a locker maybe or a dressingtable drawer susan nodded do you think we should bring her in to the station and press her a bit harder im sure she knows something maybe if we kept her for a while wore down her resistance banks looked at susan and saw a smart young woman with earnest blue eyes tight blonde curls and a slightly snub nose gazing back at him good as she is he thought shes got a long way to go yet no he said it wont do any good shes not holding back for reasons of guilt its a matter of pride and privacy with her you might break her given time but youd have to strip her of her dignity to do so and she doesnt deserve that whether susan understood or not banks didnt really know she nodded slowly a puzzled look clouded her eyes then she shoved her hands deep in the pockets of her navyblue coat and marched up king street beside him the crusted ice crackled and creaked under their winter boots three there were certainly no dressing rooms at the community centre not even for the lead players nor were there any lockers susan wondered how they would manage when the play opened and they had to wear costumes and makeup as she nosed around idly she reflected on her christmas on christmas morning she had weakened and considered going to sheffield but in the end she had phoned and said she couldnt make it because of an important murder investigation a murder her mother had echoed how lurid well dear if you insist and that was that she had spent the day studying and watching the old musicals on television but at least she remembered with a smile she had been on time on christmas eve to buy a small tree and a few decorations at least she had made the flat look a bit more like a home even if there were still a few things missing there was not much else they could do about identifying the three visitors caroline hartley had received on the evening of her death until they had more information about the record and the woman in the photograph they wouldnt get that until the shops and businesses were back into the swing of things again in a day or two banks had suggested a second visit to harrogate for the following day and though susan was hardly looking forward to that she was interested in what banks would make of the setup there susan wasnt sure about veronica shildon at all especially now that she had met her the woman was too stiff and thinlipped the kind one could imagine teaching in an exclusive girls school and her posh accent and prissy mannerisms stuck in her craw the idea of the two women in bed together made susans flesh crawl as she poked around looking for anything that might have been connected with caroline she thought she heard a noise down the hallway it could have come from anywhere the backstage area she had quickly discovered was a warren of store rooms and cubbyholes slowly she walked towards the stage entrance and peeked through a fire door the lights were on in the auditorium which seemed odd but it was silent and she saw no one puzzled she went to the props room marcia had scrubbed the graffiti from the walls susan noticed leaving only garish smears in places the trunk of tattered costumes had gone it was a shame about the vandals she thought but there was nothing really she could do as she had told conran and marcia the police had a good idea who the culprits were but they didnt have the manpower to put a round the clock watch on them and could hardly arrest them with no evidence at all pcs tolliver and bradley had had a word with the suspected ringleaders but the kids were so cool and arrogant they had given nothing away again susan thought she heard a noise like something being dragged across a wood floor she stood still and listened it stopped and all she could hear was her own heart beating not even a mouse stirred she shrugged and went on poking about the room it was no use she would pick up nothing about caroline hartley here by osmosis the door creaked open slowly behind her she turned ready to defend herself and saw a uniformed policeman silhouetted in the doorway what the hell as far as she knew they hadnt put a guard inside the place she couldnt make out who it was his helmet was too low over his brow and its strap covered his chin the light behind her in the store room was too dim to be much help he stood with his hands clasped behind his back and bent his knees hello hello hello what have we here it was an assumed voice she could tell that pretentiously deep and portentous for a moment she didnt know what to do or say then he walked into the room and closed the door im afraid he said i shall have to ask you to accompany me to the crooked billet for a drink and if you dont come clean there well proceed to marios for dinner susan squinted in the poor light and saw that under the ridiculous helmet stood james conran himself out of angry relief she said what the hell are you doing here im sorry he said taking off the helmet couldnt resist playing a little joke i saw you when you peeked into the auditorium id just dropped by to check out some blocking angles from the floor but the uniform susan said i thought the costumes had all been destroyed this i found it under the stage with a lot more old stuff been there for years i suppose our previous incarnation must have left it all behind susan laughed do you always dress the part when you ask someone out to dinner conran smiled shyly im not the most direct or confident person in the world he said unbuttoning the highcollared police jacket especially when im talking to an expupil you may be grownup now but you werent the last time i saw you maybe i need a mask to hide behind but i did mean what i said would you consider at least having a drink with me i dont know susan had nothing to do nowhere to go but home but she felt she couldnt just say yes it was partly because he made her feel like that sixteenyearold schoolgirl with a crush on the teacher again and partly because he was connected albeit peripherally with a case she was working on i think i should arrest you for impersonating a police officer she said he looked disappointed and a faint flush touched his cheeks at least grant the condemned man his last wish then surely you cant be so cruel still susan deliberated she wanted to say yes but she felt as if a great stone had lodged in her chest and wouldnt let out the air to form the words some other time perhaps then conran said when youre not so busy oh come on susan said laughing ive got time for a quick one at the crooked billet at least to hell with it she thought why not it was about time she had some fun he brightened good just a minute then let me change back into my civvies one thing first susan said did caroline or any of the cast keep any of their private things here i cant seem to find any lockers or changing areas we just have to make do with what we have conran said its all right at the moment but at dress rehearsal and after well well see what we can do about some of those little cubbyholes off the main corridor so theres not likely to be anything afraid not if people brought their handbags or briefcases to rehearsal we just left them in here while we were on stage the back door was locked so nobody could sneak in and steal anything dont go away he said and backed out of the room susan put her hand over her mouth and laughed when he had gone how shy and clumsy he seemed but he did have charm and a sense of humour right he said peeping around the door a couple of minutes later ready they left the community centre by the back door locked up and made their way down the alley to york road there midway between the bus station and the preroman site stood the crooked billet luckily it wasnt too busy they found a table by a whitewashed wall adorned with military emblems and conran went to fetch the drinks susan watched him his shirt hung out of the back of his trousers under his sweater he had rather round shoulders and his hair could have done with a trim at the back apart from that he was presentable enough slim though more from lack of proper diet than exercise she guessed tall and if not straight at least endearingly stooped very artistic really his eyes she noticed as he came back were two slightly different shades of bluegrey one paler than the other funny she had never noticed that at school here he said putting a half of mild in front of her and holding out his pint cheers they clinked glasses hows the investigation going he asked susan told him there was nothing to report on the vandalism im sorry about caroline hartley she went on i noticed how upset you were when the chief inspector mentioned her death conran looked down and swirled the beer in his glass yes as i told you on christmas eve i cant say we were great friends this was her first role with the company i hadnt known her very long obviously i didnt know her at all really but she was a joy to have around such childlike enthusiasm and what talent untrained but very talented weve lost an important member of the cast not that thats why i was upset a maria can easily be replaced but not a caroline hartley he shook his head no are you sure you werent in love with her conran started as if hed been stung what what on earth makes you ask that i dont know susan said and she didnt the question had just risen unbidden to her lips just that everyone says she was so attractive after all you are a bachelor arent you he smiled yes im sorry its just that well here we are having a drink together for the first time our first date so to speak and you ask me if i was in love with another woman dont you think thats a bit odd maybe but were you conran smiled from the corner of his mouth and looked at her youre very persistent id guess thats something to do with your job one day you must tell me all about it all about your last ten years why you joined the police and the answer to my question he held his hands out as if for handcuffs and said in a cockney voice all right all right guv enoughs enough ill come clean the people at the next table looked over susan felt embarrassed but she couldnt help smiling she leaned forward and put her elbows on the table well she whispered i suppose every mans a little bit in love with every beautiful woman conran said quietly susan blushed and reached for her drink she didnt consider herself beautiful but did he mean to imply that she was thats a very evasive answer she said and besides it sounds like a quote conran grinned but its true isnt it depending on ones sexual preference i suppose i think its disgusting the way she lived susan said its abnormal not that i mean to speak ill of the dead she blustered on reddening but the thought of it gives me the creeps well that was her business conran said but dont you think its perverted i can think of worse things to be i suppose so susan said feeling shed let too much out what was wrong with her she had been so hesitant about going out with him in the first place and now here she was exposing her fears and to him of all people surely being in the arts he must have come across all kinds of perverts but she hadnt been able to help herself the image of the two women in bed together still tormented her and it was especially vivid as she had just come from talking to the cool elegant veronica shildon slow down susan she warned herself do you have any idea who the killer is conran asked susan shook her head and what about your boss im never sure i know what he thinks susan said she laughed hes an odd one is chief inspector banks i sometimes wonder how he gets the job done at all he likes to take his time and he seems so sensitive to other people and their feelings even criminals ill bet she finished her drink you make him sound like a wimp conran said but i doubt very much that he is oh no hes not a wimp hes sympathetic more like empathetic compassionate its hard to explain it doesnt stop him from wanting to see criminals punished he can be tough even cruel if he has to be i just get the impression hed rather do things in the gentlest way youre more of a pragmatist are you susan wasnt sure if he was making fun of her or not it was the same feeling she often had with philip richmond her eyes narrowed i believe in getting the job done yes emotions can get in the way if you let them and you wouldnt id try not to another drink conran asked go on then she said on two conditions what are they one im buying two no more shop talk from either of us conran laughed its a deal susan picked up her handbag and went to the bar four ive told you detective sergeant jim hatchley said to his new wife its not exactly work you ought to know me better than that lass look at it as a night out but what if i didnt want a night out carol argued im buying hatchley announced as if that was the end of it carol sighed and opened the door they were in the carpark at the back of the lobster inn redburn about fifteen miles up the coast from their new home in saltby bay the wind from the sea felt as icy as if it had come straight from the arctic the night was clear the stars like bright chips of ice and beyond the welcoming lights of the pub they could hear the wild crashing and rumbling of the sea carol shivered and pulled her scarf tight around her throat as they ran towards the back door inside the place was as cosy as could be christmas decorations hung from beams that looked like pieces of driftwood smoothed and worn by years of exposure to the sea the murmur of conversations and the hissing of pumps as pints were pulled were music to hatchleys ears even carol he noticed seemed to mellow a bit once theyd got a drink and a nice corner table she unfastened her coat and he couldnt help but look once again at the fine curve of her bosom which stood out as she took off the coat her shoulderlength blonde hair was wavy now after a perm and hatchley relished the memory of seeing it spread out on the pillow beside him that very morning he couldnt get enough of the voluptuous woman he now called his wife and she seemed to feel the same way his misbehaviour at the reception had soon been forgiven carol spotted the way he was looking at her she blushed smiled and slapped him on the thigh stop it jim i werent doing anything his eyes twinkled its what you were thinking anyway tell me what did chief inspector banks say hatchley reached for a cigarette theres this bloke called claude ivers lives just up the road from here some sort of highbrow musician and he parks his car at the back of the pub banks wants to know if he took it out at all on the evening of december twentysecond why cant he find out for himself hatchley drank some more beer before answering hes got other things to do and itd be a long way for him to come especially in nasty weather like this besides hes the boss he delegates but still he neednt have asked you he knows were supposed to be on our honeymoon its more in the way of a favour love i suppose i couldve said no but you didnt you never do say no to a night out in a pub he knows that hatchley put a hand as big as a ham on her knee i thought youd be used to going with a copper by now love carol pouted i am its just oh drink your pint you great lummox she slapped him on the thigh hatchley obliged and they forgot work for the next hour chatting instead about their plans for the cottage and its small garden finally at about five to eleven their glasses only half full carol said theres not a lot of time left jim if youve got that little job to do hatchley looked at his watch plenty of time relax love but its nearly eleven youve not even gone up for a refill thats not like you trust me well you might not want another though thats a new one on me but i do fine hatchley muttered something about nagging wives and went to the bar he came back with a pint for himself and a gin and tonic for carol i hope its not all going to be like this she said when he sat down again like what work our honeymoon its oneoff job ive told you hatchley replied he drained about half his pint in one go hard work but someone has to do it he belched and reached for another cigarette at about twenty past eleven carol suggested that if he wasnt going to do anything they should go home hatchley told her to look around what do you see he asked when shed looked a pub what else nay lass thall never make a detective look again carol looked again there were still about a dozen people in the pub most of them drinking and nobody showing any signs of hurrying what time is it hatchley asked her nearly half past eleven any towels over the pumps what oh she looked no i see what you mean i had a word with young barraclough the local lad at saltby bay hes heard about this place and hes told me all about the landlord trust me hatchley put a sausage finger to the side of his nose and ambled over to the bar pint of bitter and a gin and tonic please he said to the landlord who refilled the glass without looking up and took carols tumbler over to the optic open late i see hatchley said aye i do so enjoy a pub with flexible opening hours village bobby here the landlord scowled and twitched his head towards the table by the fire thats him said hatchley just the fellow i want to see he paid the landlord then went and put the drinks down at their table wont be a minute love he said to carol and walked over to the table by the fire three men sat there playing cards all of them in their late forties in varying degrees of obesity baldness or greying hair police hatchley asked one of the men sturdy with a broad flat nose and glassy fishlike eyes looked up aye he said what if i am a minute of your time hatchley gestured to the table where carol sat nursing her gin and tonic the man sighed and shook his head at his mates a policemans lot he said they laughed what is it he grunted when theyd sat down at hatchleys table i didnt want to talk in front of your mates hatchley began might be a bit embarrassing anyways i take it youre the local bobby that i am constable kendal at your service if you get to the bloody point that is aye said hatchley tapping a cigarette on the side of his package well thats just it ciggie hmph dont mind if i do hatchley gave him a cigarette and lit it for him yon landlord seems a bit of a miserable bugger ive heard hes a tightlipped one too ollie kendal laughed tight as a scotsmans sphincter why whats it to you id like to make a little bet with you a bet i dont get it let me explain id like to bet you a round of drinks that you can get some information out of him kendals brow furrowed and his watery eyes seemed to turn into mirrors he chewed his rubbery lower lip information what information what the bloody hell are you talking about hatchley told him about ivers and the car kendal listened his expression becoming more and more puzzled when hatchley had finished the constable simply stared at him openmouthed and by the way hatchley added reaching into his inside pocket for his card my names hatchley detective sergeant james hatchley cid ive just been posted to your neck of the woods so well probably be seeing quite a bit of one another you might mention to yon ollie about his licence not that i have to remind you i dont suppose when its an offence youve been abetting pale and resigned constable kendal stood up and walked over to the bar hatchley sat back sipped some more beer and grinned what was all that about carol asked just trying to find out how good the help is around here why do a job yourself if you can get someone else to do it for you theres some blokes and ive a good idea that landlord is one of them wholl tell you its pissing down when the suns out just to be contrary and you think hell talk now aye hell talk all right no percentage in not doing is there he ran a hand through his fine strawcoloured hair ive lived in yorkshire all my life he said and ive still never been able to figure it out theres some places some communities as wide open as a nymphos legs friendly helpful and theres others zipped up as tight as a virgins sorry love and i reckon this is one of them god help us if anything nasty happens in redburn couldnt you just have asked the landlord yourself hatchley shook his head itll come better from the local bobby believe me love hes got very powerful motivation for doing this his job and the landlords got his licence to think about much easier this way the more highly motivated the seeker the better the outcome of the search i read that in a textbook somewhere about five minutes later kendal plodded back to the table and sat down well said hatchley he came in to open up at six they dont go in for that allday opening here except in season and he says iverss car was gone at six thereabouts aye but he didnt see him go no he did see that bird of his drive off though oh aye aye american she is young enough to be his daughter has her own car too flashy red sportscar well you know these rich folk tell me about her ollie says she was getting in her car and driving off just as he came in which way did she go kendal looked scornfully at hatchley and pointed with a callused thumb theres only one way out of here up the bloody hill hatchley scratched his cheek aye well they havent issued me my regulation ordnance survey map yet so lets get this straight at six oclock iverss car was already gone and his girlfriend was just getting into hers and driving off am i right kendal nodded owt else no kendal stood up to leave just a minute constable hatchley said i won the bet while youre on your feet ill have a pint of bitter for myself and a gin and tonic for the missis if its no trouble one whats susan up to richmond asked banks on the way to harrogate on the afternoon of december driving conditions had improved considerably most of the main roads had been salted and for the first time in weeks the sky glowed clear blue and the sun glinted on distant swaths and rolls of snow ive got her chasing down the record banks answered some shops might not even bother to reply unless we push them do you think itll lead anywhere it could but i dont know where it cant just have been on by accident it was like some kind of macabre soundtrack call it a strong hunch if you like but there was something bloody about it claude ivers could be at least we know now he lied to us about being out well talk to him again later what i want today is a fresh perspective on caroline hartleys family background weve already got susans perceptions now its time for yours and mine the old man couldnt have done it so well concentrate on the brother it sounds like he had plenty of motive and nobody keeps tabs on his movements it wouldnt have been hard for him to leave his father to sleep for a couple of hours and slip out from what susan said the old man probably wouldnt have noticed what about transport bus or train the services are frequent enough they pulled up outside the huge dark house bloody hell it does look spooky doesnt it richmond said hes even got the curtains closed they walked up the path through the overgrown garden and knocked at the door nobody answered banks hammered again harder a few seconds later the door opened slowly and a thin palefaced teenager with spiky black hair squinted out at the sharp cold day banks showed his card you cant see father today gary said hes ill the doctor was here its you we want to talk to banks said if you dont mind gary hartley turned his back on them and walked down the hall he hadnt shut the door so they exchanged puzzled glances and followed him closing the door behind them not that it made much difference the place was still freezing in the front room banks recognized the high ceiling curlicued corners and old chandelier fixture that susan had described he could also see the evidence of what gary hartley had done to the place its ruined grandeur wainscotting pitted with dart holes scratched with obscene graffiti richmond looked stunned he stood by the door with one hand in his overcoat pocket and the other touching the right side of his moustache just staring around him the room was dim lit only by a standard lamp near the battered greenvelvet sofa on which gary hartley lay smoking and studiously not looking at his visitors a small colour television on a table in front of the curtained window was showing the news with the sound turned down empty lager cans and wine bottles stood along the front of the stone hearth like rows of soldiers in places the carpet had worn through so much that only the crossed threads remained to cover the bare floorboards the room smelled of stale smoke beer and unwashed socks it must have been beautiful once banks thought but a beauty few could afford back in the last century for every family enjoying the easy life in an elegant yorkshire mansion like this there were thousands paying for it condemned to the misery of starving in cramped hovels packed close to the mills that accounted for their every waking hour banks picked a scuffed hardbacked chair to sit on and swept a pair of torn jeans to the floor he managed to light a cigarette with his gloves on what did your father do for a living he asked gary he owned a printing business so youre not short of a bob or two gary laughed and waved his arm in an allencompassing arc as you can see the fortune dwindles riches decay where did he get such language banks wondered he had already taken in the remains of an old library in ceilinghigh bookcases beside the empty fireplace beautiful tooledleather bindings cervantes shakespeare tolstoy dickens now he saw a book lying open face down beside garys sofa the gold embossed letters on the spine told him it was vanity fair something he had always meant to read himself what looked like a redwine stain in the shape of south america had ruined the cover so gary hartley drank smoked watched television and read the classics not much else for him to do was there was he knowledgeable about music too banks saw no signs of a stereo it was eerie talking to this teenager he couldnt have been more than a year or so older than brian but any other similarity between them ended with the spiky haircut surely there must be some money left banks said oh yes itll see him to his grave and you he looked surprised me yes when hes gone will you have some money left to help you leave here find a place of your own gary dropped his cigarette in a lager can it sizzled never thought about it he said is there a will not that hes shown me whatll happen to the house it was for caroline what do you mean dad was going to leave it for caroline banks leaned forward but she deserted him she left you all youve been taking care of him by yourself for all these years at least that was what susan gay had told him so what gary got up with curiously jerky movements and took a fresh pack of cigarettes from the mantelpiece she was always his favourite no matter what what now with her gone i suppose ill get it he looked around the cavernous room as though the thought horrified him more than anything else and flopped back down on the sofa where were you on the evening of december twentysecond richmond asked he had recovered enough to find himself a chair and take out his notebook gary glanced over at him a look of scorn on his face just like telly eh the old alibi well i was here im always here or almost always sometimes i used to go to school so they didnt get too ratty with me but it was a waste of time since i left ive got a better education reading those old books i go to the shops sometimes just for food and clothes then theres haircuts and the bank thats about it youd be surprised how little you have to go out if you dont want to i can do the whole lot in one morning a week if im organized right booze is the most important get that right and the rest just seems to fall into place what about your friends banks asked dont you ever go out with them friends those wallies from school they used to come over sometimes he pointed to the wainscotting as you can see but they thought i was mad they just wanted to drink and do damage and when they got bored they didnt come back nothing changes much here december twentysecond richmond repeated i told you gary said i was here can you prove that how you mean witnesses that would help i probably emptied out the old mans potty maybe even changed his sheets if he messed the bed but he wont remember he doesnt know one day from the next i might even have dropped in at the offlicence for a few cans of lager and some fags but i cant prove that either every time gary talked about his father his tone hardened to hatred banks could understand that the kid must be torn in half by his conflicts between duty and desire responsibility and the need for freedom he had given in and accepted the yoke and he must both hate himself for his weakness and his father for making such a demand in the first place and caroline of course how he must have hated caroline though he didnt sound bitter when he spoke of her perhaps his hatred had been assuaged by her death and he had allowed himself to feel some simple pity did you go to eastvale that evening richmond went on did you call on your sister and lose your temper with her gary coughed you really think i killed her dont you thats a laugh if i was going to id have done it a few years ago when i really found out what shed lumbered me with not now five or six years ago banks calculated gary would have been only twelve or thirteen perhaps too young for a relatively normal child to commit sororicide and surely he must have been living a more normal life back then also as banks had learned over the years bitterness and resentment could take a long time to reach breaking point people nursed grudges and deepseated animosities for years sometimes before exploding into action all they needed was the right trigger did you ever visit caroline in eastvale banks asked no i told you i hardly go out certainly not that far have you ever met veronica shildon that the lezzie she was shacking up with yes no i havent but caroline visited you here he paused sometimes when shed come back from london you told the detective constable who visited you a few days ago that you knew nothing of carolines life in london is that true yes so for over five years when she was between the ages of sixteen and twentyone you had no contact right six years really did you know she had a baby gary sniffed i knew she was a slut but i didnt know she had a kid no she did do you know what happened to it who the father was i told you i didnt even know shed had one he seemed confused by the issue banks decided to take his word for the moment did she ever mention a woman called ruth to you gary thought for a moment yeah some woman who wrote poetry she knew in london can you remember what she said about her no just that they were friends like and this ruth woman had helped her is that all helped her with what i dont know just that shed helped her what did you think she meant he shrugged maybe took her in off the street or something helped her with the baby how should i know what was her last name she never mentioned it just ruth whereabouts in london did she live ive no idea youre sure theres nothing more you can tell us about her gary shook his head do you know anything about music banks asked cant stand it i mean classical music any music sounds awful to me another one with a tin ear banks thought just like superintendent gristhorpe but it didnt mean gary knew nothing about the subject he read a lot and could easily have come across the necessary details concerning the vivaldi piece perhaps in a biography the last time you saw caroline he asked did she tell you anything that gave you cause to worry about her to think she might be in danger frightened of something gary appeared to give the question some thought then he shook his head no again banks thought he was telling the truth just but there was something on garys mind below the surface that made his answer seem evasive is there anything else you want to tell us nope right banks nodded to richmond and they headed for the door dont bother to see us out banks said we know the way gary didnt reply jesus christ said richmond when theyd got in the car and turned on the heater what a bloody nutcase he rubbed his hands together you wouldnt think would you banks said looking at the tall elegant stone houses that behind such a genteel façade youd find something so twisted not unless you were a copper richmond answered banks laughed time for a pub lunch on the way back he said then you can take a trip to barnard castle and ill see about having a chat with the therapist rather you than me richmond said if shes anything like she was when i saw her the other day shell probably end up convincing you you need therapy yourself after shes chewed your balls off who knows maybe i do need therapy banks mused then turned by the stray passed the royal baths and headed back towards eastvale two ursula kellys office was on the second floor of an old building on castle hill road a back room it was graced with a superb view over the formal gardens and the river to the eyesore of the east end estate and the vale beyond not that you could see much today but a uniform shroud of white through which the occasional clump of trees redbrick street or telegraph pole poked its head the waiting room was cramped and chilly and none of the magazines were to bankss taste it wasnt an interview he was looking forward to he had a great professional resistance to questioning doctors and psychiatrists during a case much as they were obliged and bound by law they had never in his experience proved useful sources of information the only one he really trusted was jenny fuller who had helped him out once or twice as he looked out the window at the snow he wondered what jenny would make of gary hartley and the whole situation pity she was away after about ten minutes dr ursula kelly admitted him to her inner sanctum she was a severelooking woman in her early fifties with grey hair swept back tight and held firm in a bun the lines of what might once have been a beautiful if harsh face were softened only by the plumpness of middle age her eyes though guarded couldnt help but twinkle with curiosity and irony apart from a few bookcases housing texts and journals and the desk and couch in the corner the consulting room was surprisingly bare ursula kelly sat behind the desk with her back to the picture window and banks placed himself in front of her she was wearing a fawn cardigan over her cream blouse no white coat in evidence what can i do for you chief inspector she asked tapping the eraser of a yellow hb pencil on a sheaf of papers in front of her she spoke with a faint foreign accent austrian german swiss banks couldnt quite place it im sure you know why im here he said my detective sergeant dropped by to see you the other day caroline hartley what about her banks sighed it was going to be just as hard as he had expected question answer question answer i just wondered if you might be able to tell me a little more than you told him how long had she been a patient of yours i had been seeing caroline for just over three years is that a long time ursula kelly pursed her lips before answering it depends some people have been coming for ten years or more i wouldnt call it long no what was wrong with her the doctor dropped the pencil and leaned back in her chair she eyed banks for a long time before answering lets get this clear she said finally im not a medical doctor im an analyst primarily using jungian methods if that means anything to you ive heard of jung she raised her eyebrows good well without going into all the ins and outs of it people dont have to be ill to start seeing me in the sense that you mean there was nothing wrong with caroline hartley so why did she come and pay im assuming your services arent free dr kelly smiled are yours she came because she was unhappy and she felt her unhappiness was preventing her from living fully that is why people come to me and you make them happy she laughed would that it were as easy as that i do very little actually but listen if the patient makes the connections they cut so much deeper the people who consult me generally feel that they are living empty lives living illusions if you like they are aware of what potential they have they know that life should mean more than it does to them they know that they are capable of achieving of feeling more but they are emotionally numb so they come for analysis im not a psychiatrist i dont prescribe drugs i dont treat schizophrenics or psychotics i treat people you would perceive as perfectly normal on the outside and inside ah arent we all a mass of contradictions inside our parents whether they mean to or not bequeath us a lot wed be better off without banks thought of gary hartley and the terrible struggles he had to live with he also thought of the philip larkin poem that veronica shildon had quoted can you tell me anything at all about caroline hartleys problems he asked anything that might help solve her murder i understand your concern ursula kelly said and believe me i sympathize with your task but there is nothing i can tell you cant or wont take it whichever way you wish but dont think im trying to impede your investigation the things caroline and i worked on were childhood traumas often nebulous in the extreme they could have nothing to do with her death i assure you how could the way a child felt about say a lost doll result in her murder twenty years later dont you think id be the best judge of that as one professional to another there is nothing i can tell you it was her feelings i dealt with we tried to uncover why she felt the way she did about certain things what the roots of her fears and insecurities were and what were they she smiled even in ten years chief inspector we might not have uncovered them all i can see by the way youre fidgeting you need a cigarette please smoke if you wish i dont but it doesnt bother me many of my patients feel the need for infantile oral gratification banks ignored the barb and lit up i dont suppose i need to remind you he said that the rule of privilege doesnt apply to doctorpatient relationships as it does to those between lawyer and client it is not a matter of reminding me i never even thought about it well it doesnt you are by law obliged to disclose any information you acquired while practising your profession if necessary i could get a court order to make you hand over your files pah do it then there is nothing in my files that would interest you very much she tapped her head it is all in here look the women had problems they came to me neither of them hurt anyone they are not criminals and they do not have any dangerous psychological disorders isnt that what you want to know banks sighed okay can you at least tell me what kind of progress caroline was making was she happy lately was anything bothering her as far as i could tell she seemed fine certainly she wasnt worried about anything in fact wed come to yes lets just say that shed recently worked through a particularly difficult trauma they occur from time to time in analysis and they can be painful i dont suppose youd care to tell me about it she had confronted one of her demons and won and people are usually happy when they overcome a major stumbling block at least for a while did she ever talk about her brother gary its not unusual for patients to talk about their families what did she have to say about him nothing of interest to you she treated him very badly did she feel no guilt we all feel guilt chief inspector do you not think so perhaps he should have been your patient he certainly seems to have his problems thanks to his sister i dont choose my patients they choose me veronica shildon was a patient of yours too wasnt she yes but i can say even less about her shes still alive judging by how little ursula kelly had said about caroline banks knew not to expect very much was veronica particularly upset about anything that last session she shook her head your sergeant asked me that and the answer is the same no it was a perfectly normal session as far as i was concerned no sudden traumas none she leaned forward and rested her hands on the desk look chief inspector you might not think ive been very forthcoming that is your prerogative in my business you soon become privy to the innermost fears and secrets of the people you deal with and you get into the habit of keeping them to yourself youre looking for facts i dont have any even if i did tell you what happened during my sessions with caroline and veronica it wouldnt help you i deal with a world of shadows of dreams and nightmares signs and symbols what my patients feel is the only reality we have to work with and i have already told you in all honesty that as far as i know neither caroline nor veronica was in any way especially disturbed of late if you need to know more try talking to veronica herself i already have and i think shes holding back well that is your problem banks pushed his chair back and stood up i think youre holding back too he said believe me if i find out that you are and that its relevant to carolines murder ill make sure you know about it youll need twenty years in analysis to rid yourself of the guilt her jaw muscles clenched and her eyes hardened should that occur it will be my burden banks walked out and slammed the door behind him he didnt feel good about his anger and his pathetic threat but people like ursula kelly with her smug generalizations and pompous selfrighteous air brought out the worst in him he took a couple of deep breaths and looked at his watch five thirty time to catch the end of rehearsal three richmond parked his car outside a pub on the main street got out and sniffed the air there was no reason he thought why it should smell so different up here but it did have a damper more acrid quality barnard castle was only twenty or so miles from eastvale but it was over the durham border in teesdale according to his map the shop should be on his right about halfway down the hill just in front of him it seemed to be the main tourist street with an indian restaurant coffeehouse bookshop and antique shop all rubbing shoulders with places that sold souvenirs along with walking and camping gear the toy shop was indeed about halfway down the hill first richmond looked in the window at the array of goods hardly any of them seemed familiar nothing at all like the toys he had played with as a child in fact mostly he had had to use his imagination and pretend that a stick was a sword it wasnt that his parents had been exceptionally poor but they had strict priorities and toys had come very low on the list the bell pinged as he entered and a young woman behind the counter looked up from behind a ledger he guessed her to be in her midtwenties and she had a fine head of tangled auburn hair that cascaded over her shoulders and framed an attractive freckled oval face she wore a long loose cardigan grey with a maroon pattern and from what richmond could see of her above the counter she seemed to have a slim shapely figure a pair of glasses dangled on a chain around her neck but she didnt put them on as he walked towards her what can i do for you sir she said with a lilting geordie accent in a slightly husky voice would it be something for your boy or your little girl perhaps richmond noticed the glint of humour in her eyes im not married he said mentally kicking himself even before he had got the words out i mean im not here to buy anything she looked at him steadily fingering the spectacles chain as she did so cid he said fumbling for his identification i spoke with the manager a couple of days ago when you were on holiday she raised her eyebrows ah yes mr holbrook told me about you tell me do all policemen dress as well as you do richmond wondered if she were being sarcastic he took pride in his dress certainly he had the kind of tall trim athletic body that clothes looked good on and he always favoured a suit white shirt and tie unlike banks who went in for the more casual rumpled look ill take that as a compliment he said finally look im at a bit of a disadvantage im afraid he didnt tell me your name she smiled its rachel rachel pierce pleased to meet you she held out her hand richmond shook it he noticed there was no sign of either a wedding ring or an engagement ring she seemed to be laughing at him and it made him feel foolish and disconcerted how could he question her seriously when she looked at him like that he remembered his training and aimed for the correct tone well miss pierce he began as you may be aware we are investigating she burst out laughing richmond felt himself flush to the tips of his moustache what the she put her hand to her mouth and quietened down im sorry she said seeming more than a little embarrassed herself i dont usually giggle its just that you seem so stuffy and formal well im sorry if she waved her hand no no dont apologize its my fault i know you have a job to do its just that it gets a bit lonely in here after christmas and im afraid that seems to affect my manners look she went on it would make this a lot easier for me if youd let me lock up and make you a cup of tea before we talk its near enough closing time already and the only customer ive had all day was a young lad wanting to exchange his christmas present richmond encouraged by her friendliness smiled if youre closing anyway he said maybe we could go for a drink and a bit to eat she chewed on her lower lip and looked at him all right she said just give me a minute to make sure everythings secure in ten minutes they were sitting in a cosy pub richmond nursing a pint and rachel sipping rum and coke im ready she said sitting back and folding her arms grill away mr cid richmond smiled theres not much to ask really you know charles cooper yes hes the general manager i understand hes been very busy lately making sure everything was in order for christmas rachel nodded do you remember december the twentysecond she wrinkled her brow and thought then said yes he was here that day sorting out some stock problems you see mr curtis the manager had forgotten to reorder some but you dont want to hear about that do you richmond wasnt too sure he felt like pinching himself to see if he could escape the way just listening to her voice and watching her animated face made him feel he tried it just a little nip at the back of his thigh but it did no good he took a deep breath how long was he at the shop he asked oh a couple of hours perhaps between what times he got here about four or thereabouts and left at six he left at six oclock yes you sound surprised why its nothing it was though unless he had gone to another branch and neither cooper nor his wife had mentioned anything about that then he had left the shop at six and not got home until eleven where the hell had he been and why had he lied are you sure he left at six oclock he asked well it cant have been much after rachel answered we closed at seven extra hours for the holiday period and he was gone a while before then he said hed try to shift some stock over from the skipton shop before christmas eve did you get the impression he was going to go to skipton right then no theyd be closed too wouldnt be any point would there presumably if hes the general manager hes got a key yes but he doesnt go carrying boxes of toys around does he if hes the general manager he gets some dogsbody to do that richmond fingered his moustache maybe youre right what was your impression of him do you know him well she shook her head not well no hed drop in once in a while we might have a cup of tea and a chat about how things were going thats all she raised her left eyebrow and squinted her right eye almost shut and just what might you mean by that im not sure really he didnt make a pass at you or anything mr cooper make a pass she laughed you obviously dont know him so he never did never the thought of it she laughed again did he ever talk about things other than business personal things no he kept himself to himself did you ever hear him mention a woman called caroline hartley she shook her head veronica shildon no he hardly ever mentioned his own wife only when i asked after her id met her once or twice at company dos you see so its only polite to ask after her isnt it was there anything odd about him at all richmond asked think surely you must have felt or noticed something at some time rachel frowned look there is something but i dont like to speak out of turn its not out of turn richmond said leaning forward remember this is a murder investigation what is it well i could be wrong it was just a couple of times you know what i think hes a drinker in what way were drinking right now i dont know but not like this a secret drinker a problem drinker whatever you call it what makes you say that i could smell alcohol on his breath sometimes early in the day when he hadnt bothered to take one of those awful breath mints he usually smelled of and once i saw him take a little flask out of his pocket in the stockroom when he thought i wasnt looking i cant be sure what it was of course but could there be anything in it richmond wondered rachel pierce had certainly given him a new perspective on the coopers but whether it would lead him to a murderer he couldnt tell so the man drank so he had lied about his alibi a silly lie at that an easy one to check but it might not mean anything one thing was certain though banks would want to visit the coopers again very soon and he wouldnt be as gentle as he had been on previous occasions richmond looked over at rachel her glass was nearly empty another he asked i shouldnt he glanced at his watch i think i can say im officially off duty now he said come on it wont do any harm she looked at him a long time he couldnt fathom the expression on her face then she said all right then another one wonderful theres just one thing i have to do first she raised an eyebrow call my boss richmond said dont go away i wont be a minute he glanced back and saw her smiling into her glass as he made for the telephone four disguise i see thou art a wickedness wherein the pregnant enemy does much how easy is it for the proper false in womens waxen hearts to set their forms alas our frailty is the cause not we for such as we are made of such we be how will this fadge my master loves her dearly and i poor monster fond as much on him and she mistaken seems to dote on me what will become of this as i am man my state is desperate for my masters love as i am woman now alas the day what thriftless sighs shall poor olivia breathe o time thou must untangle this not i it is too hard a knot for me tuntie better faith darling much better perhaps just a bit more introspection remember it is a soliloquy but not too serious james conran turned to banks what did you think i thought she was very good do you know the play yes not well but i know it so you know how it fadges then they all marry the ones they want and live happily ever after conran stuck a finger in the air ah not quite chief inspector malvolio remember ends by vowing revenge on the lot of them for making a fool of him all that banks remembered about the end of twelfth night was the beautiful song the clown sang alone when everyone else had walked off to their fates it was on his deller consort tape for the rain it raineth every day the refrain went it had always seemed a curiously sombre song to end a comedy with but nothing was black and white especially in shakespeares world perhaps youd care to see us on opening night conran said complimentary tickets of course yes i would very much accepting free tickets to an amateur production could hardly be called being on the take banks thought will you be much longer here he asked id like to talk to some of the cast members maybe it would be more comfortable over in the crooked billet conran frowned what on earth would you want to talk to them about police business definitely not pleased conran looked at his watch and clapped his hands the actors walked off stage and went for their coats after they had dashed down the alley in the chilly evening the warmth of the crooked billet greeted them like a long lost friend they unbuttoned their coats and hung them by the door then pulled two tables together near the fire to accommodate the thirsty thespians banks tried to keep track of the introductions and the links between actors and roles olivia played by teresa pedmore and viola faith green interested him the most marcia cunningham the costumes and props manager was there too it was a casual and unorthodox method of questioning possible suspects banks was aware but he wanted to get as much of a feel of the troupe as he could before he decided where to go from there i still cant imagine why you want to talk to the cast conran complained surely you cant think one of us had anything to do with poor carolines death dont be so bloody naive mr conran theres a chance that anyone who knew her might have done it certainly she seemed to know her killer as there was no sign of forced entry how long did you stay at the pub the night she died i dont know about an hour i suppose maybe a bit longer until just after seven about that yes then you went home yes i told you there you are then you could be lying youve got no alibi at all conran reddened and his hand tightened on his glass now just wait but banks ignored conran completely and went to the bar for another drink the director certainly seemed jumpy banks wondered why maybe it was just his artistic temperament when he got back to the table his seat had been taken by a distraught sir toby belch who seemed to think his part could do with some expansion perhaps to match his stomach despite the limitations shakespeare had imposed banks managed to squeeze himself in between teresa pedmore and faith green not a bad place to be at all teresa was deep in conversation with the man on her right so banks turned to faith and complimented her on her rendering of violas soliloquy she blushed and replied quickly her breathy voice pitched quite low thank you its very difficult i have no formal training im a schoolteacher and i do like to get involved with the plays the department puts on but its so difficult doing twelfth night i have to remember that im really a woman dressed as a man talking about a woman who seems to have fallen in love with me its all very strange a bit perverted really she put her hand to her mouth and touched bankss arm oh god i shouldnt have said that should i not after poor caroline im sure shed forgive you banks said did you have any idea of her sexual inclinations before her death none at all none of us did not until i read about it in the papers if youd asked me id have said she was manmad why faith waved her hand in the air oh just the way she behaved she knew how to string a man along a woman knows about these things at least i thought i did but you never actually saw her with a man not in the way you mean no im talking about her general effect the way she could turn heads did you notice any personality conflicts among the cast especially involving caroline faith rubbed one of her long blue teardrop earrings between her finger and thumb she was probably in her early twenties banks thought with especially beautiful silvery hair hanging in a fringe and straight down to her shoulders it looked so vibrant and satiny he wanted to reach out and touch it he was sure sparks would fly if he did her eyes were a little too close together and her lower lip pouted a bit but the total effect had an interesting kind of unity as he had noticed on the stage she was tall and wellformed it would be difficult without very good costumes to conceal the fact that faith green was all woman she leaned closer to speak to banks and he smelled her perfume it was subtle and probably not cheap he also smelled the martini rossi on her breath i didnt notice anything in particular she said flicking her eyes towards the rubicund sir toby and malvolio who looked like an undertakers assistant but some of the men arent too keen on mr conran oh whys that i think theyre jealous but the women like him most of them yes and thats partly why the others are jealous youd be surprised what shady motives people have for joining in amateur events like this she widened her eyes and banks noticed that they were smiling sex she said but hes not my type i like my men dark and handsome she looked banks up and down not necessarily tall mind you i dont mind being bigger than my boyfriends banks noticed the plural surely there had never been schoolteachers like this in his time i hear there was something between mr conran and olivia teresa that is youll have to ask her about that faith said ill not tell tales on my friends out of school she wrinkled her nose can you tell me anything more about caroline faith shrugged not really i mean i hardly knew her she was beautiful in a petite girlish sort of way but i cant say she made much of an impression on me as i said before i thought she was a bit of a flirt myself but i dont suppose she could help the way the men flocked to her anyone in particular no just in general really most of the men seemed to like being with her including our director did he make a pass at her no hes too subtle for that he plays the shy and vulnerable one until women approach him then he reels them in at least he did with teresa she clapped a hand to her mouth look i am telling tales out of school how do you do it banks smiled professional secret so in your opinion caroline hartley was a flirt but nothing ever came of it yes i suppose thats how she kept them at bay faith shook her head and her hair sparked like electricity maybe i was blind but im damned if i could see what she really was what did you think of her as an actress faith traced a ring around the top of her glass she was young inexperienced she had a long way to go and it was only a small part after all young maggie over theres taken it on now she nodded towards a seriouslooking young woman sitting next to conran but she was talented who am i to say perhaps in time look did anything odd happen at rehearsal the day caroline was killed does any incident stand out in your mind however petty it might have seemed at the time no not that i remember look will you excuse me for a min have to pee of course banks waited a moment or two then attracted teresa pedmores attention her hair was as dark as faiths was silver she had the healthy complexion of a young countrywoman and it didnt surprise banks to discover that she was a milkmans daughter from mortsett now working in the main eastvale post office and living in town but that was where her rusticity ended the haughty tilt of her head when she spoke and her fierce dark eyes had nothing to do with simple country life there was an aura of mystery about her banks found its source hard to pin down something to do with the economy of her body language perhaps or the faintly sardonic tone of her voice and she was ambitious he could sense that from the start its about caroline hartley isnt it she said before banks could open his mouth as she spoke banks noticed she was looking over at james conran who was watching her with a frown on his face yes banks answered can you tell me anything about her teresa shook her head coalblack hair danced about her shoulders i hardly knew her even less so than i thought at the time according to the papers i understand you were involved with mr conran who told you that faith banks shook his head faith was subtly evasive were you what if i was were both single james is fun once you get to know him at least he was and did caroline hartley spoil that fun for you of course not how could she didnt he switch his attentions from you to her look i dont know whos been telling you all this but its rubbish or are you just making it up james and i ended our little fling ages ago so you werent jealous of caroline not at all how did caroline behave among the other women in the cast teresa laughed showing a set of straight white teeth rarely seen outside america i dont know what youre getting at was she close to anyone no i thought she always seemed aloof you know friendly but distant casual so you didnt like her very much i cant say i cared one way or the other not that im glad shes you know this is only the second play the companys done since james took over but it was carolines first none of us knew her that well how did she get the part teresa raised her dark arched eyebrows auditioned i should think like everybody else you didnt notice her form any close attachments to other women in the play there are only three of us what are you trying to say that im a lesbian too banks shifted in his seat no no id say that was very unlikely wouldnt you slowly she relaxed well what about faith teresa gave her cigarette a short sharp flick with her thumbnail what did she tell you i saw you talking to her she told me nothing thats why im asking you there was nothing between them i can assure you of that faiths as straight as i am she took a breath sipped some milky pernod and water then smiled as far as the others go i dont think youve got much chance of finding a murderer among them quite frankly malvolios such a puritan prig he probably even whips himself for taking part in such a sinful hobby as acting sir andrews thick as pigshit excuse my french and orsinos so wrapped up in himself he wouldnt notice if samantha fox waggled her boobs in front of his face banks looked over at orsino he had muscular shoulders clearly the fruits of regular weighttraining dark wavy hair hollow cheeks bright eyes and an expression set in a permanent sneer as if all he saw outside a mirror was unworthy of his regard none of them three had much to do with caroline anyway as far as i noticed they had some scenes together but i never saw them communicate much offstage and you can forget the others too i know for a fact that antonios queer as a threepound note sebastians very happily married with a mortgage a dog and twopointfive kids and the clown well hes very quiet actually and he never seems to socialize with us have you ever noticed him talking to caroline offstage or between scenes ive never noticed him talking to anyone period one of the strangest transformations you can imagine a wonderful clown but such a dull depressinglooking man banks asked her a few more general questions but found out nothing else before long teresa was asking him about his most exciting cases and it was time to move on he chatted briefly with some of the others but got no further finally he went back to james conran excused himself from the company and walked out into the cold evening but not before faith green managed to catch him at the door and slip him her telephone number outside banks caught his breath at the cold bright stars stabbed pinpoints of light in the clear sky who banks wondered had believed that the sky was just a kind of blackvelvet curtain and the light of heaven beyond showed through the holes in it the greeks anyway on nights like this it felt exactly that way there had been something wrong about his conversations in the crooked billet he couldnt put his finger on it but everything had seemed too easy too chummy everyone he spoke to had been nervous worried about something he hadnt missed the way faith excused herself before answering one of his questions nor the way teresa played with her cigarette when he asked her questions she didnt like those two would merit further talking to definitely surely there must have been minor tiffs or conflicts among the cast of a play according to the people he had talked to it had all been happy families much too squeaky clean for his liking what were they covering up and when had they decided to do so he put his headphones on in winter they acted as earmuffs too the tape he had in was a collection of jazz pieces by the likes of milhaud gershwin and stravinsky performed by simon rattle and the london sinfonietta tracy had bought it him for christmas clearly under instructions from sandra when banks switched on the walkman the erotic clarinet glissando at the opening of gershwins rhapsody in blue almost bowled him over he turned down the volume and walked on the tree was still lit up outside the church in the market square but there were no carol singers in evidence this evening the cobblestones were icy and he had to step carefully the blue lamp glowed coldly outside the police station it was seven oclock just time to drop in and see if any new information had turned up before going home for dinner he walked into the bustle of the police station and went straight upstairs to his office before he could even shut the door susan gay called after him and entered banks sat down and took his headphones off anything new i followed up on the record shops she said breathlessly most of them are open now because theyre having post christmas sales anyway ive tracked down two copies of that luddite poori thing sold in the past three weeks good work where from one from a small speciality shop in skipton and another from the classical record shop in leeds but theres more sir she went on it seemed a long shot but i asked for a description of the purchaser in both instances and the leeds shop sir before id even started he told me whod bought it the salesman recognized him claude ivers yes sir well well well banks said so he was lying after all why arent i surprised youve done a great job susan in fact i think you deserve a day at the seaside tomorrow susan smiled yes sir oh and ds richmond phoned from barnard castle with a message about charles coopers alibi it seems things are getting a bit complicated doesnt it one a sea mist clung to the coastline when banks and susan arrived in redburn at eleven oclock the next morning icy roads over the vale and freezing rain on the moors had made driving difficult all the way and now as they came down from the land to the sea the clash of the two elements had produced a fog that reduced visibility to no more than a few yards susan banks could tell was surprised at being chauffeured by a senior officer but she would soon learn he preferred his own car because of the stereo and the generous mileage allowance and he actually enjoyed driving in yorkshire even in poor conditions such as these on the way he had been listening to metamorphosen richard strausss haunting string elegy for the bombing of the munich hoftheater and he hadnt spoken much he didnt know whether susan liked the music she had been as silent as he and had spent most of the journey looking out the window lost in thought he parked the car outside the lobster inn again and they made their way up the path to iverss cottage the mist seemed to permeate everything and by the time they got to the cottage they were glad of the fire blazing in the hearth again it was pasty janowski who answered the door this time when banks introduced detective constable gay her big brown eyes clouded with worry and fixed on the door handle she was wearing tight jeans and a darkgreen turtleneck sweater her dark hair which still fell almost to her eyes in a ragged fringe was tied back in a ponytail her smooth complexion was tinged with the kind of flush that a brisk walk in fresh weather brings hell be down in a few minutes she said sit down and warm yourselves ill make some tea shouldnt we go up sir susan asked when patsy had left the room itll give us an edge banks shook his head hell be no trouble besides i want to talk to her alone first they sat in the creaky wooden chairs near the fire and banks rubbed his hands in front of the flames although he had been wearing gloves on this trip the chill seemed to have penetrated right through both leather and flesh when he felt warm enough he took off his overcoat and lit a cigarette warm air from the fire hooked the smoke and sucked it up the chimney patsy returned with the tea tray and set it down beside them there was no freshmade bread this time what is it she asked joining them by the fire have you found the killer banks ignored her question and picked up his mug of tea tell me he asked where did you drive to when you left your parking spot behind the lobster inn the evening caroline hartley was killed patsy stared at his breast pocket her eyes wide open and afraid like a hunted does i i you cant expect me to remember a particular night just like that days are much the same out here i can imagine that but it was the evening before my last visit i asked you then very specifically where youd been the night before and you both told me youd stayed in now im asking you again patsy shrugged if i said i stayed in i guess thats what i did but you were seen leaving the car park it must have been someone else i dont think so unless youre in the habit of lending out your car where did you go she stirred a spoonful of sugar into her tea and gazed into the steaming mug as she spoke i dont remember going anywhere but i might have gone for a drive early on i sometimes do that but i wouldnt have been gone long there are some beautiful vantage points along the coast but you have to drive out there then walk a fair distance to find them even in this weather sure id hardly live here if i minded a bit of rough weather would i i like it when the sea gets all churned up she seemed to be regaining her composure but banks still didnt believe her story why didnt you mention this little drive he asked she smiled at the fireplace it didnt seem important i guess i mean it was nothing to do with what you were asking about did you go alone she hesitated then said yes where was mr ivers back here working then who was using his car her hand went to her mouth i i dont understand its simple really ms janowski his car was missing from its usual spot if he was here working who was using it patsy was saved from having to answer by the creak of the stairs as ivers came down he was dressed in much the same kind of baggy jeans and loose jersey as he had been on bankss first visit but this time he had combed back his longish grey hair he ducked underneath the low lintel beam and walked into the room where his height and gaunt features commanded attention the room had seemed crowded enough with three people in it but with four it felt cluttered and claustrophobic whats going on he asked looking over at patsy who was squeezing her plump lower lip between her fingers and staring out of the window banks stood up ah mr ivers please join us sit down i hardly need to be invited to sit down in my own house ivers said but he sat banks lit another cigarette and leaned against the stone mantelpiece not a tall man himself he wanted the advantage of height susan remained where she was her notebook in her lap ivers glanced nervously at her but banks didnt introduce them we were just talking about memory he said how deceptive it can be ivers frowned i dont understand seems to be a lot of that about banks said mr ivers susan asked where did you drive to on the evening of december twentysecond he stared at her but didnt appear to see her then he turned towards banks and gripped the arms of his chair he thrust himself forward in as menacing a manner as possible what is this what are you insinuating banks flicked a column of ash into the fire were just asking you a simple question he said where did you go i told you i didnt go anywhere i know but you were lying ivers half rose now look banks stepped forward and gently pushed him back no you look let me save us all a lot of time and effort and tell you what happened ivers settled back and fumbled for his pipe and tobacco in his trouser pocket patsy poured him some tea and passed it over her hand was shaking the corner of his thin mouth twitched for her in what was meant to be a reassuring smile that evening banks began you decided to take veronica her christmas present it was a record you bought for her at the classical record shop in the merrion centre in leeds vivaldis laudate pueri sung by magda kalmar a singer you knew had impressed her but when you got to the house just after seven say she was out caroline hartley answered the door and let you in you were simply going to drop off the present but something happened something made you angry perhaps she said something about your virility i dont know or maybe the rage you felt about her stealing veronica from you finally boiled over you fought hit her then stabbed her with the kitchen knife you found on the table ingenious ivers said but not a word of it is true banks knew full well that his theory was full of holes the two female visitors caroline hartley had received after ivers had apparently left for example but he went on regardless he wanted to shake ivers up a bit at the very least i dont know why you put the record on but you did perhaps you wanted to make it look like the work of a psychopath that could also have been why you removed her robe after you hit her anyway when it was done you washed the knife in the sink i imagine you must have got blood on your gloves and sleeves but it would have been easy enough to destroy that evidence when you got home banks flicked his cigarette end into the fire right there ivers shook his head and clamped his teeth down on his pipe well banks said no he whispered between clenched teeth it didnt happen like that at all i didnt kill her did you know that caroline hartley had once had a baby banks asked ivers took his pipe out of his mouth in surprise what no all i know is that she was the bitch who corrupted my wife and induced her to leave me which gives you a very good motive for wanting to be rid of her susan said looking up from her notebook again ivers looked at her but hardly appeared to see her perhaps so he said but im not a killer i create i dont destroy patsy leaned forward and took his hand in hers with his other hand he held on to his pipe what happened banks asked ivers sighed and stood up he stroked patsys cheek and went to the fireplace where he knocked out his pipe he seemed more stooped and frail now somehow and his cultured voice no longer held its authoritative tone youre right he said i did go over to eastvale that evening i shouldnt have lied i should have told you the truth but when you told me what had happened i was certain id be a suspect and i was right wasnt i i couldnt bear the thought of any serious interruption to my work but i swear chief inspector that when i left caroline hartley the little slut was as alive as you and i yes i went to the house yes veronica was out shopping caroline let me in grudgingly but she let me in because it was cold and snowing and she didnt want to leave the door open i wasnt in there more than a few minutes out of politeness i asked how she was and asked about veronica then i just handed over the present and left and thats the truth whether you believe it or not id find it easier to believe if youd told me the first time i called banks said youve wasted a lot of our time ive already explained why i couldnt tell you good lord man what would you have done in my position banks always hated it when people asked him that in ninetynine per cent of cases he would have done exactly as they had the wrong thing how could you even imagine that we wouldnt trace the buyer of the record ivers shrugged ive no idea what you can or cant do i dont read mystery novels or watch police shows on television we dont even have a television never have had i knew i hadnt put a gift tag on the record i remembered id forgotten to do that shortly after i left veronicas so when you mentioned vivaldi last time you called i had a good idea you were only guessing it was me you never asked me outright whether i took her the record or not when you left banks said was the record still wrapped or had it been opened still wrapped of course why should it have been opened i dont know but it was could caroline have opened it she may have done just to have a laugh at me and my tastes i suppose she always said i was an old bore she once told veronica she thought my music sounded like the kind of sounds youd get from a constipated camel if ivers was telling the truth banks wondered then how had the record come to be unwrapped unless either caroline had opened it out of malicious curiosity hello darling look what the boring old farts bought you for christmas or veronica shildon herself had returned to the house and opened it but why should she do that with a christmas present surely she would have put it under the tree with the rest and waited until the morning of the twentyfifth and she certainly wouldnt have done anything so mundane if she had walked into the room and found carolines body did you tell her what it was banks asked not in so many words what did you say just that it was something very special for veronica how did caroline react she didnt she just glanced at it and i put it down did you argue with her ivers shook his head not this time no it was cool between us but civilized ive told you i was out again within five minutes what did you do then i drove over to the shopping centre i wanted to buy a few last minute things i couldnt get here in the village then i came home what things ivers frowned oh i cant remember books a sweater patsy wanted a case of decent claret that kind of thing you didnt by any chance see your wife in the shopping centre did you no id have mentioned it if i did its a fairly large place you know and it was very busy why did you go to eastvale that night in particular because it was so close to christmas and patsy and i well i always leave things till the last minute and we just didnt want to have to go anywhere over the next few days im very involved in a complex piece of music right now its all to do with the rhythms of the sea so i dont want to spend more time than necessary away from here i have no other commitments until after the new year so i thought id get the shopping and veronicas present out of the way then my time would be my own he returned to the chair and started to refill his pipe believe me its nothing more sinister than that i havent killed anyone i couldnt not even someone i hated the way i hated caroline hartley if id been stupid enough to believe that killing caroline would bring back veronica id have done it two years ago but ive got a new life now with patsy its been tough getting here but ive put veronica behind me now yet you still took her a special christmas present rather a sentimental gesture wouldnt you say i never claimed to have no feelings for her after so long you cant help that she put me through hell but thats over he took patsys hand im happier now than ive ever been it was the second time banks had heard someone refer to having a motive for killing caroline some years ago but not in the present iverss story rang truer than gary hartleys though in the first place ivers obviously did have a comfortable life with an attractive younger woman a cosy cottage by the sea and his music gary hartley had nothing on the other hand ivers could easily have lost his temper and lashed out at something caroline said sometimes after all the big things have been endured and overcome some apparently inconsequential matter sets off an explosion there was no real evidence pointing either way though the use of a knife so close to hand indicated a spontaneous act if he charged claude ivers with murder now he wouldnt have had much of a case id like you to drop by the eastvale police station tomorrow morning and sign a statement banks said gesturing for susan to close her notebook must i my work much as i love your music mr ivers banks said im afraid you must he smiled look at it this way its a hell of a lot better than being charged with murder and sitting in a cell with the drunks on new years eve youre not charging me not yet but i want you to stay where i can find you any unexpected moves on your part will be considered as very suspicious behaviour indeed ivers nodded i wasnt going anywhere good see you tomorrow then banks and susan made their way back down the winding path to the car on their left only partially obscured by wraiths of mist the sea lay quiet and the small waves lapped and hissed on the sands banks wondered what iverss winter sea music would sound like something along the lines of peter maxwell daviess third symphony perhaps or the sea interludes from brittens peter grimes there was certainly a lot of potential in the idea they had just reached the road when banks became aware of a figure running after them it was patsy janowksi and she hadnt even bothered to put an overcoat on they turned and she stood facing them shivering with her arms wrapped around her chest i need to talk to you she said please its really important banks nodded go on she looked around is there somewhere we can go im freezing they were outside the lobster inn and banks could think of no better place to talk they went inside and found the lounge almost deserted except for the landlord and a couple of gnarled old men chatting at the bar the large room was cold and draughty even by the hearth where they sat the fire clearly hadnt been lit long and the pub had not yet warmed up banks walked to the bar the two old men flicked their hooded eyes in his direction and continued talking in low voices thick with local dialect the landlord shuffled over and stood in front of banks drying a glass he neither spoke nor looked up banks found himself marvelling at jim hatchley for getting information out of such a taciturn old bugger one day hed have to ask jim how hed managed it he asked for three whiskies and the landlord ambled off without a word the entire transaction took place in silence when he got back to the table banks found patsy and susan gay huddled around the meagre fire trying to get warm its not the cold i mind patsy was saying but the goddamn chill its so damp it gets right in your bones where are you from banks asked huntington beach california warm there patsy managed a smile all year round they even play beach volley ball in winter dont get me wrong though i love england even the weather im just not dressed right for outdoors today banks passed her the whisky here this should warm the cockles of your heart as we say up here thank you she took a sip and smacked her lips her eyes ranged around the pub and settled briefly like a butterfly on various objects a dented ashtray the range of wine glasses above the bar an optic the old fishing print on the far wall banks lit a cigarette and leaned back in his chair what was it you wanted to tell us patsy frowned i know it must seem too late to you that weve told so many lies but claude was telling the truth just now honestly he was we only lied because we knew hed be the main suspect you must have known wed find out the truth sooner or later she shook her head claude said its only on television that things like that happen not in real life despite what he says he has watched television he said policemen in real life are just thick she put her hand to her mouth oh shit im sorry banks smiled where did you drive to that night well thats just what i came out to tell you i know claude cant have killed caroline hartley because i went to see her after hed left and i can assure you she was still alive then what do you mean patsy rubbed her temple and frowned what i say look i know its not very nice but i was well checking up on him you suspected he was still involved with veronica shildon yes he still loves her theres no doubt about that you heard what he said but i did hope he really had put her behind him and i know he loves me too i suppose im just jealous possessive ive been burned before by people hung up on past relationships did you know him when he split up with her no we met afterwards he was in real bad shape in what way in every way claude is a naturally confident man used to getting what he wants and having his own way but after he split with veronica his selfesteem was at rockbottom he felt betrayed and well sexually too he felt worthless and unwanted he told me he never thought another woman would want him as long as he lived she smiled and looked into the fire i know it sounds like a comeon but it wasnt you have to know him when we got together i helped him build up his confidence again there was nothing wrong with him really it was all just the psychological mess caused by what that woman did to him caroline no veronica he always blamed caroline and i never contradicted him but if anyones the bitch veronica is the way she treated him all of a sudden she comes along and tells him im not really the woman you think i am in fact i never have been its all been an illusion an act just to please you but i cant do it any more ive seen the light ive found someone else a woman in fact and im leaving you to go and live with her im sure you can imagine the impact of something like that on a man better than i can especially a man as sensitive and vulnerable as claude the bitch anyway he never saw it that way he always saw caroline as the enemy the wifestealer and veronica as the victim he thought shed end up getting hurt discarded when caroline had finished with her after all there was ten years between them she held up her hand before anyone could say a word all right i know i know im nobody to talk there are nearly thirty years between claude and me but thats different nobody challenged her banks had almost finished his whisky he felt like another one a single shouldnt put him over the limit for driving this time susan offered to go and buy the drinks what are you trying to say ms janowski banks asked swirling the ambergold liquid in the bottom of the glass that you were jealous of claude iverss relationship with his wife and that you followed him that night to find out if he was still seeing her secretly i didnt exactly follow him she said youve got to understand how difficult all this has been for claude and me weve had one or two rows about his seeing veronica usually after hes been for dinner with her and got back late i dont know as i said i must be a terribly jealous person but i couldnt just sit back and accept it oh its not even as if i thought they were having an affair or anything sometimes an emotional attachment to another person can seem like just as much of a threat or betrayal as a sexual one maybe even more so can you understand that banks nodded susan came back with the drinks anyway patsy went on he didnt tell me where he was going that evening and i figured because of the rows wed had he was keeping it from me you know that he was going to see her that got me all worried i just couldnt stay in the house alone so i decided to call at veronicas to see if i was right and what happened i couldnt see his car anywhere you cant park in the street of course but it wasnt even anywhere in sight on king street then i finally plucked up my courage and went to the house i knocked on the door and caroline hartley answered i didnt think shed recognize me because wed hardly met but she did she must be very good with faces she asked me in but i didnt want to go i asked her if claude was in the house and she laughed she told me he had called but veronica was out and he clearly hadnt wanted to spend a minute longer than he had to with her hed left his present and gone i thanked her and went back to the car then i drove home thats all what time did you arrive at the house about a quarter after seven twenty after maybe it took about an hour and a quarter to drive from redburn then five minutes or so to walk from where i parked the car did you see anyone else approaching the house as you left patsy shook her head no i dont think so the street was quiet i i cant really remember there were a few people in king street shoppers im so confused about it think banks said try to rerun the scene in your mind let us know if you remember anything at all it could be important will you try patsy nodded all right was mr ivers in when you got home no he got back later with the shopping didnt you ask where hed been yes we had a row a bad one but we made up she blushed and looked into the fireplace banks lit a cigarette and let a few moments pass then he asked how did caroline hartley seem when you saw her patsy shrugged fine i guess i never really thought about it she was obviously being sarcastic about claude but that was only to be expected she didnt seem worried or frightened when she answered the door not at all what was she wearing some sort of kimonostyle bathrobe as if shed just come out of the shower or something could you hear music playing no can you remember exactly what she said to you patsy sipped some whisky and frowned just that hed been and gone and left some boring classical record for veronica thats all she knew what the present was seemed to yes she didnt mention the title the one you talked about the other day but she did use the words boring classical record i remember that because i took it as an insult to claude she could have been just guessing susan said after all mr ivers is a classical musician and he knows veronicas tastes hed hardly be likely to bring her the rolling stones or something would he possibly not banks said either that or shed opened it to see what was so special that she didnt know about anyway it doesnt matter for now he turned back to patsy what happened next nothing i told you i left and drove home banks stubbed out his cigarette and looked closely at her she stared back defiantly lips close together eyes serious look she said i know what youre thinking i didnt kill her think about it id hardly do that would i with her out of the way there was more chance of my losing claude back to veronica wasnt there it made a kind of sense but banks knew that murders are rarely so logically committed still he felt inclined to believe her for the moment for one thing her story tallied with what the neighbours had seen one man ivers obviously and two women the one who had simply knocked at the door like a salesperson had been patsy then asking after ivers and unless she had returned later she was in the clear so if patsy was the first woman visitor and she was telling the truth then who was the next faith green teresa pedmore veronica herself ruth the mystery woman from london or had someone called even later than the last woman someone none of the neighbours had seen a man it was possible gary hartley james conran someone else from the dramatic society the father of carolines child a psychopath even ivers himself could have returned he hadnt been at home when patsy got back to redburn banks made a note to question the neighbours again and see if he could get a better description it was unlikely especially after so much time had elapsed but still worth a try at least someone might be able to tell them whether the woman who had knocked at the door and gone away was dressed the same as the one who did go in later banks finished his drink thank you ms janowski he said i think youd better come along tomorrow with mr ivers and make a statement all right she nodded yes yes of course then she knocked back the rest of her drink and left what do you think banks asked susan i dont know id want to keep an eye on them maybe ill ask jim hatchley to drop by once or twice over the next few days and make sure theyre not up to anything any ideas about what did happen that night susan paused took a delicate sip of whisky then said ive been wondering about veronica shildon i know she doesnt seem to have a motive but i cant help but keep coming back to her maybe everything wasnt as wonderful as she made out between her and caroline hartley i mean what if she was jealous what if she saw patsy janowski leaving the house and thought there was something to it maybe there even was something to it caroline hartley could have taken her own robe off and if veronica had found her naked she could have charged in had a row with caroline and killed her then she could have changed her clothes sneaked out and come back later they walked out into the cold and sat in the car while it warmed up its possible banks said but we checked the entire house for bloodstained clothing and found nothing there were no pieces of charred cloth in the fire either im not saying she couldnt have found a way just that i havent figured it out yet we seem to have too many suspects too many motives and opportunities he slammed the wheel with the flat of his hand i still keep coming back to that damn record though why why would somebody put a record on and leave it to repeat perhaps caroline herself put it on she hated classical music she may have opened it but i doubt shed have played it but if veronica had come back if it happened the way you suggest and shed seen patsy leaving shed have been on the warpath shed hardly have stopped to listen to her christmas present first especially on december twentysecond no it doesnt make sense he spoke quietly almost to himself but the music is for the burial of a very small child carolines child could be anything up to nine or ten by now maybe if i can track the kid down thats if whoever put the record on knew what it was and knew what it meant oh the killer knew all right im sure of that are you sure youre not making too much of it sir i might be but youve got to admit its a puzzle talking about records sir yes do you think you could play something different on the way back i dont mean to be rude sir but that music you were playing on the way over was so boring it nearly put me to sleep banks laughed and drove off your wish is my command two well well well if it isnt mr banks its a rare treat seeing you in here sorry vicar theres something about my job that disinclines me to believe in a benevolent deity you catch your criminals sometimes dont you yes well there you are the lord works in mysterious ways the reverend piers catcotts eyes twinkled he was a slight man in his late forties who looked more like an accountant than a minister spectacles thinning silver hair slight stoop and an anaemic wellscrubbed complexion he was also banks had discovered from their discussions and arguments over pints in the queens arms an extraordinarily erudite and intelligent man pity banks thought about the superstition he deemed fit to embrace still catcott said i dont think you made the supreme sacrifice of entering this hallowed place just to argue theology did you banks smiled thats right vicar we can do that much better in the pub no its just some background information i want knowledge rather i want to pick your brains oh dear i should think thatll be much more comfortable sitting down that is if youve no objection to taking a pew or we could go into the vestry a pewll do fine banks said as long as you dont expect me to kneel the small church was dim and cool weak evening sunlight filtered through the stainedglass windows banks had seen more of it from the outside than in though he had been in once or twice to look at the celtic cross and stone font the pews creaked as they sat down whats the liturgy banks asked oh come on mr banks catcott said with a thinlipped smile surely even a heathen like yourself knows that humour me catcott put a pale slender forefinger to his lips very well the liturgy the word is often used to refer to the book of common prayer of course but the meaning goes back a long time beyond that a long time essentially its simply the order of services in the church as even you probably know we have different services at different times of the year christmas easter harvest festival and the like and you might remember from your misspent youth we sing different hymns and have different lessons according to the nature of the service do you follow so far banks nodded there is a liturgical calendar to cover the years worship advent the fourth sunday before christmas came first then christmas itself ending with epiphany the sixth of january or twelfth night to you then we have the prelenten season followed by lent when youre supposed to give up bad habits here he paused and cast a narroweyed look at banks and the last three are eastertide pentecost and trinity but what on earth do you want to know all this for surely youre not thinking of no im not and believe me vicar youd be better off not knowing im particularly interested in the music that goes along with these services liturgical music well thats a slightly different matter its very complicated goes back to gregorian chants but basically each part of the year has its own biblical texts and early composers set these to music people still do it of course vaughan williams finzi and britten did quite a bit but its rarely part of a normal church service these days what youre probably talking about are biblical texts or parts of texts set to music actually most of them were abolished in what kind of music are you talking about all kinds right from early polyphonic motets a composer would take a text perhaps a psalm and set it to music in latin of course like a gloria or a magnificat actually the gloria is part of the mass which has its own liturgy i told you it can get quite complicated banks remembered the section titles from his tapes of masses and requiems kyrie eleison agnus dei credo i think im getting the idea he said what about laudate pueri ah yes laudate pueri dominum it means praise the lord ye children that was a popular liturgical work based on psalm if my memory serves me right do you know vivaldis settings indeed i do magnificent it says in the notes to my tape that the piece may have been used as part of the burial service for a small child is that right catcott rubbed his smooth chin that would make sense yes would that be fairly common knowledge well you knew it didnt you id say any reasonably welleducated person might have a chance of knowing would someone like claude ivers know ivers of course i remember reading an article about him in gramophone and hes extremely knowledgeable about sacred music pity he doesnt see fit to write any himself instead of that monotonous stuff he churns out banks smiled catcott had sown the seeds of another queens arms argument but there was no time to pursue the point now thank you vicar banks stood up and shook hands with catcott then headed out his footsteps echoed on the cold stone just before he got to the door he heard the vicar call out from behind him the collection box for the restoration fund is to your right banks felt in his pocket for a pound dropped it in the box and left three fortunately charles cooper was at home when banks and richmond called just after teatime that day mrs cooper flitted about the kitchen offering coffee but banks suggested he and richmond retire with her husband somewhere private mrs cooper seemed worried by that but she raised no real objection they settled for the living room dominated by a huge television screen and richmond took out his notebook cooper banks noticed looked a few years older than his wife he had a weak chin and a veined nose his sparse grey hair was combed straight back he was an odd shape mostly skin and bone with rounded shoulders but he had a substantial potbelly bulging through his grey pullover its a pleasure to meet you at last said cooper of course ive heard all about the business from my wife dreadful he seemed nervous and fidgety banks thought though his tone seemed calm and genuine enough what did you do on the evening of december the twentysecond banks asked i worked cooper said with a sigh i seemed to do nothing else around that time i understand youre general manager of a chain of toy shops thats right and on the twentysecond you were dealing with some stock shortages in the barnard castle branch cooper nodded what time did you leave he paused well let me see i got home about eleven yes but what time did you leave the shop its about a halfhour drive a little slower in the snow i suppose itd be about ten fifteen you left the shop at ten fifteen and came straight home why yes look is are you sure mr cooper cooper looked towards the sideboard and nervously licked his lips i ought to know he said richmond glanced up from his notes its just that the lady who works there told me you left about six mr cooper would she have any reason to lie cooper looked from richmond to banks and back i i dont understand banks leaned forward its perfectly simple he said you left the shop at six oclock not at ten fifteen as you led us to believe what were you doing all that time cooper pursed his lips and looked down at the liver spots on the backs of his hands what was your relationship with caroline hartley banks asked what do you mean he said i didnt have a relationship with her were you fond of her i suppose so we were just acquaintances she didnt remind you of your late daughter corinne cooper turned red i dont know who told you that but its not true and youve no right to bring my daughter into it its exactly as i said we were neighbours yes i liked the girl but thats all you didnt attempt to start an affair with her dont be ridiculous she was young enough to be my besides you know as well as i do she wasnt interested in men but you did try i did no such thing he grasped the chair arms and started to get up i think you ought to leave now well leave when were satisfied mr cooper banks said please sit down cooper slumped back in his chair and started twisting his hands in his lap do have a drink if you want banks said that is whats on your mind isnt it damn you cooper jumped up with surprising agility took a bottle of scotch from the sideboard and poured himself three fingers he didnt offer any to banks or richmond he sat down again and drank half of it in one gulp were not satisfied yet mr cooper banks said were not satisfied at all youve been lying to us now thats nothing new in our business we expect it he jerked his thumb towards the wall but a young woman was brutally murdered next door on december the twentysecond a woman you liked who reminded you of your daughter now id think that unless you killed her yourself youd want to help youd want to tell us the truth i didnt kill her for gods sake why on earth would i do that you tell me i told you i didnt kill her and whatever i did that night has no bearing whatsoever on what happened next door let me be the judge of that cooper swirled his drink and took another long sip well stay until you tell us banks said unless youd prefer to get your coat and all right all right mr cooper waved his free hand i did leave the shop at six but i wasnt anywhere near eastvale until eleven i swear it where were you does it really matter we have to check cooper got up and poured himself another drink he cocked his ear towards the livingroom door then satisfied by the sound of washingup water running in the kitchen spoke quietly i drink mr banks he said simple as that ever since corinne well you dont need to know about that but christine doesnt approve he looked at his glass oh shes not a teetotaller or anything shell allow the occasional glass of scotch after dinner but more than one and i can even smell the disapproval so i drink elsewhere where were you drinking that night banks asked tan hill said cooper its an isolated spot i like it up there were you alone no theres a group of regulars names cooper gave the names and richmond wrote them down what time did you leave about ten thirty i darent be too late and i keep some breath mints in the car so christine cant smell anything anything else to tell us cooper shook his head no nothing thats it look im sorry i i didnt mean to cause any problems its really nothing to do with poor carolines death at all well see said banks and got up to leave with richmond there is one small thing cooper said before they got to the door banks turned yes the driving i mean id had a few drinks i wasnt drunk honestly you wont do anything to my licence will you i shouldnt worry about that banks said i think the statute of limitations has just about run out he made a mental note to find out the licence number of coopers car and alert the local police patrols fancy a trip to tan hill banks asked richmond outside tonight sooner the better dont you think richmond looked at his watch and frowned well i did have a er take her with you banks said its a routine enquiry wont take long richmond touched his moustache not a bad idea he said not bad at all off you go then ill see if i can get anything more out of the people across the street four it was a cold night spiky needlesharp cold rather than the damp numbing chill of the sea mist and the crusts of ice over puddles on the pavements cracked as banks walked over them hands deep in his furlined carcoat pockets he decided to call first on patrick farlowe who had originally said he was sure he had noticed two women and a man call at the house on separate occasions between about six and seven thirty on december farlowe was finishing his dinner when banks arrived and there was still a little wine left in the bottle banks accepted a glass and the invitation to join farlowe in the den while his wife cleared the table they certainly lived well in oakwood mews banks noted remains of sirloin steaks on the plates fine cutlery a cutglass vase holding two longstemmed roses the wine was a decent crozeshermitage the den was an upstairs study with two walls of dark bookcases a deep leather armchair by a standard lamp and a small teak table beside it for resting cups of coffee pencils and notepads the light gleamed on the dark varnished surfaces of the wood the hartley place in harrogate would have been a larger version of this banks thought before gary let it fall to ruin farlowe relaxed in his armchair and banks took the swivel chair in front of the writing desk one sniff of the clean leatherscented air tipped him off that this was a nonsmoking room were very grateful for the information you gave us banks began but i was wondering if you remembered anything else about that evening farlowe a small rolypoly man with tufts of grey hair over his ears still wearing a threepiece suit pressed his damp lips together and scratched the side of his nose finally he shook his head the roll of pink fat around his neck wobbled cant say as i do no do you mind if we go over a couple of points not at all be pleased to banks sipped some wine and asked about the timing farlowe strained to remember for a moment then answered i know the first one the man called at about seven oclock because wed just had supper and i was in the front room turning the christmastree lights on then i caught a glimpse of the woman standing on the doorstep when i went to replace a burntout bulb a bit later the door was open and she was talking to the hartley woman did you get a clear look at her no she had her back to me nicely shaped though so theres no doubt it was a woman none at all what was she wearing he put a pudgy finger to his lips and whistled while trying to recall the scene let me see it was a winter jacket of some kind padded or thickly lined waistlength no longer because i could see the outline of her hips thats how i knew it was a woman a youngish one id say and she wore tight jeans lovely long legs she had he winked what about her hair it was wrapped in a scarf i really couldnt see it at all and she was silhouetted by the hall light of the house of course so i couldnt make out any detail it was only a quick glimpse i got i already told all this to your constable the other night i know and im sorry to put you through it again sir sometimes believe it or not people do remember more when theyre given a few days to think about it what was caroline hartley wearing as far as i could tell it was some kind of bathrobe she held it wrapped tight around her while she stood at the door as if she was feeling the cold im sorry i cant be of any more help id like to see the blighter caught of course dont like the idea of a murderer stalking the neighbourhood the third visitor banks asked can you be clearer about the time i have given the matter some thought farlowe said reaching for a decanter on the table beside him port banks tossed back the rest of his wine and held his glass out please and im trying to recollect why i was at the front window again but its slipped my mind perhaps id heard a noise or something he tapped the side of head thats it i remember i heard some music and i went out to see if we had carol singers in the street plagued by them we are he made them sound like an infestation of rodents i consider ive handed out my fair share this year should be restricted to christmas eve if you ask me anyway it was only the wife putting the radio on do you remember the time no all i remember now i come to think about it is hearing away in a manger and heading for the window but there was no one at the door i noticed a woman going into the house over the street the house where the woman was murdered can you add anything to your earlier description im sorry it all happened so fast i have to admit i was rather angry at the thought of more singers and i just caught the figure out of the corner of my eye but youre sure it was a woman well this one was wearing a light coat belted i think because it came in at the waist right down to midcalves and she definitely didnt have any trousers on i thought i could see the bottom of a dress or skirt too as if the coat was just a bit too short to cover the dress and you could see her legs below that what about height any idea a little taller than the woman who answered the door caroline hartley hair he shook his head again her head was covered by a scarf of some kind and this woman definitely entered the house oh yes she was walking in when i saw her so you didnt notice caroline hartleys reaction to seeing her no not at all i didnt even see caroline that time just this other woman silhouetted as she walked in the door so caroline might not have let her in i suppose thats possible but there didnt seem anything suspicious about it she didnt seem to be pushing and i didnt hear any noise of forced entry or anything like that it all seemed perfectly normal to me i try to be a responsible neighbour if id thought there was any trouble i would have called the police did you see her leave no but then i didnt look out the window again anybody could have arrived or left between seven thirty and the time when well you know and i wouldnt have seen them banks finished his port and stood up thank you for being so cooperative mr farlowe also for the port it was very good farlowe smiled yes it is rather isnt it the sixtythree vintage you know he struggled to get out of his armchair floundering like a seal on a beach please dont bother showing me out banks said ill find my own way oh very well fine then bye and banks saw mr farlowe reach for the decanter again as he left the room a suitable case for gout that one a lot of tipplers it seemed on oakwood mews on the way out he met mrs farlowe in the hall she had seen nothing that night but she was able to tell him that the radio had been tuned to radio three as always when she turned it on no she couldnt remember what time but her husband was right it was a carol service from kings college away in a manger had been playing lovely tune that one isnt it banks agreed and left from mrs eldridge at number eight banks got no further information she had seen the man go in first then the woman knocking on the door at about seven fifteen no she hadnt seen the man leave in the meantime but the woman in the short coat and tight jeans definitely didnt enter the house and it wasnt the same woman as the one who called later this one was a bit taller and dressed differently some kind of long dress under her coat instead of jeans the way it looked unless patsy janowski had dashed off changed clothes and added a few inches to her height in the interim the third visitor couldnt possibly have been her he needed to know who this third woman was unless someone else had come after her someone nobody had seen arrive or unless claude ivers had been in the house all the time and nobody had seen him leave then she was the one almost certainly who had killed caroline hartley was it veronica shildon as susan had suggested banks didnt think so her love and grief seemed genuine but he needed to talk to her again there was a lot of ground yet to cover before he could hope to understand the people and therefore the motives involved in this case there was however one small practical piece of information he carried away with him both mr and mrs farlowe had said that the third woman entered the house bidden or otherwise when away in a manager was being played on radio three it should be possible to find out from the local bbc station what time the programme started the order of carols in the concert and the length of each one given that information it would be simple to work out at exactly what time the mysterious third woman had entered caroline hartleys house and in all likelihood stabbed her to death with a kitchen knife one banks walked slowly by the river he wore his furlined suede carcoat collar up hands thrust deep in his pockets as he walked he breathed out plumes of air the river wasnt entirely frozen over ducks paddled as usual apparently oblivious to the cold in channels between the lumps of grey ice as he walked he thought about the success he had had that morning with the bbc a keen young researcher in the local studio had taken the trouble to dig out and listen to the december taped carol broadcast using a stopwatch the programme had started at seven sharp away in a manger began just over midway through the broadcast to be exact and finished two minutes fourteen seconds later banks marvelled at the precision with such a sense of exact measurement the young woman perhaps had a future working for the guinness book of records or the olympic records committee anyway they now knew that carolines likely killer had been let in between and they also knew that it wasnt charles cooper richmond had talked to the regulars at tan hill and confirmed his alibi cooper had been drinking there between about six thirty and ten thirty on december and on most other evenings leading up to the christmas period it would be more difficult for him to explain long absences to his wife at any other time banks thought banks started thinking about the victim caroline hartley again and realized he still didnt know much about her she had run away from home at sixteen gone to london got herself pregnant picked up a conviction for soliciting come back up north and shacked up first with nancy wood who was out of the picture now and then with veronica shildon attractive to both men and women but now interested only in the latter vivacious and enthusiastic but given to thoughtful secretive moods a budding actress a good mimic that was about all it covered ten years of the womans life and it didnt add up to a hell of a lot there had to be more and the only place to find out as carolines friends and family either wouldnt talk or didnt know was in london but where to start banks picked up a flat stone and skimmed it across the water towards the green briefly he thought of jenny fuller who lived in one of the georgian semis there a lecturer in psychology at york she had helped banks before she would be damn useful in this case too he thought but shed gone away somewhere warm for christmas tough luck up ahead near the bridge banks saw a boy no older than twelve or thirteen he had a catapult and was aiming pebbles at the ducks out on the river banks approached him before saying a word he took out his identity card and let the boy have a good long look the boy read it then glanced up at banks and said are you really a copper or just one of those perverts my dads warned me about blokes like you lucky for you sonny im really a copper banks said and snatched the metal catapult from the boys hand hey what you doing thats mine thats a dangerous weapon is what that is banks said slipping it in his coat pocket think yourself lucky i dont take you in what do you want to go aiming at those ducks for anyway what harm have they ever done you dunno the kid said i wasnt meaning to kill them or anything i just wanted to see if i could hit one can i have my catapult back mister no go on it cost me a quid that did i saved up out of my pocket money well dont bother saving up for another banks said walking away its bloody daylight robbery the kid called after him youre no better than a thief but banks ignored him and soon the shouting died down there was something in what the boy had said that interested him i wasnt meaning to kill them or anything i just wanted to see if i could hit one could he really divorce the action from its result as cleanly and innocently as that and if he could could a murderer too there was no doubt that whoever plunged the knife into caroline hartleys body had meant her to be dead but had that been the killers original intention the bruise on the cheek indicated that she had been hit perhaps stunned first how had that come about was it the kind of thing a woman would do punch another woman could it have been some kind of sexual encounter gone out of control with the original object not so much murder but just a desire to see how far things could go a sadomasochistic fantasy turned reality perhaps after all caroline hartley had been naked but that was absurd veronica and caroline were respectable middleclass conservative lesbians they didnt cruise the gay bars or try to lure innocent schoolgirls back to the house for orgies like the lesbians one read about in lurid tabloids still when lovers fight no matter what sex they can easily become violent towards one another what happened between the punch and the stabbing what warped sequence of emotions did the killer feel caroline must have been unconscious or at least momentarily stunned and the killer must have picked up the knife which lay so conveniently on the table by the cake what made her do it would she have done it if the knife hadnt been so close to hand would she have gone into the kitchen and taken a knife from the drawer and still had the resolve when she got back to the living room impossible questions to answer the kind that jenny might have been able to help with but they had to be answered or he would never find the key to his problem banks needed to know what happened in the dark area what it was that pushed someone beyond argument past reason past sex beyond even simple physical assault to murder he turned his back on the river and started walking up the hill by the formal gardens back around the castle to the market square back at the station as soon as he turned from the stairwell to the corridor that led to his upstairs office he saw susan gay come rushing towards him with a sheet of paper flapping in her hand she looked like the cat that had got the cream her eyes gleamed with success found her she announced ruth its a small london publishing company sappho press i faxed them the photo and they said they had it taken for a dust jacket and for general publicity good work banks said tell me what made you call that particular press out of the dozens we had listed susan looked puzzled i got as far as s in the alphabet it took me all morning do you know who sappho was susan shook her head gristhorpe would have known banks thought but you could hardly demand a degree in classics of everyone who wanted to join the police on the other hand perhaps it wouldnt be a bad idea an elite squad of literary coppers she was an ancient greek poet from the isle of lesbos he said is that susan began banks nodded she blushed well id like to say i got the literary clue like in agatha christie she said but it was down to pure hard slog banks laughed well done anyway tell me the details her names ruth dunne and apparently shes published a couple of books doing very well for herself in the poetry scene the woman i spoke to said one of the bigger publishers might be after her soon faber and faber perhaps what kind of stuff does she write well thats another thing they told me she started by writing the kind of thing the sappho press people support i assumed it was feminist stuff but now you mention it anyway shes moved away from that they said and it looks like shes shifting into a broader market whatever that means did you mention caroline hartley yes its a funny thing the editor recognized the name she went to check and then told me ruth dunnes second book was dedicated to someone called caroline i thought it was odd we didnt find a copy among the victims things dont you she liked to travel light banks said still it would have made it a lot easier for us if we had maybe they just lost touch with one another susan passed the paper over anyway she lives in kennington heres the address what now im going down there tomorrow theres a few things i want to talk to ruth dunne about shes the only link we have so far with caroline hartleys child and her life down there i think she might be able to tell us quite a lot two perhaps im pushing too hard susan told herself later that evening she was trying to decide what to wear for her first real date with james conran but she couldnt help going over the past two days events in her mind banks had seemed so calm so sure of himself with claude ivers susan left to her own devices would have charged into his studio she also doubted that she would have left redburn without bringing both ivers and the janowski woman in for a lengthy interrogation at the station after all they had both been at the oakwood mews house around the time of caroline hartleys murder and both had lied about it she couldnt understand bankss obsession with the record and the meaning of the music in her experience criminals werent intelligent enough to leave erudite musical clues behind them things like that only happened in the detective stories she had read as a teenager but the music had been playing she had to admit and that was very odd indeed she decided on the blue cotton blouse and navy midlength skirt neither were so close fitting that they would reveal what she thought of as an unacceptably thick waist and she mustnt overdress marios was a little upmarket but it wasnt really posh the more she thought about the case the more she thought about veronica shildon susan had felt intimidated by the womans reserve and poise and the mysterious transition from happily married woman to lesbian disturbed her it just didnt seem possible ivers could be right in blaming caroline hartley perhaps veronica knew this too deep down and hated herself for allowing herself to fall so low then she found caroline naked after seeing patsy janowski leave the house and she hit out that seemed as good an explanation as any to her all they had to do was discover how veronica had disposed of her bloody clothing surely if banks put his mind to it instead of dwelling on that damn music he could come up with something gary hartley susan thought wasnt capable of the crime he might be bitter but he was also weak a captive in his fathers cold decaying mansion banks seemed to suspect everyone except veronica shildon or at least he didnt see her as a serious contender perhaps it was to do with his being a man susan thought men perceived things differently they were unsuited to spotting subtle nuances they were basically selfish and saw things only in relation to their own egos whereas women spun a more general net of consciousness she knew banks was astute enough not to get sidetracked by his feelings at least most of the time but maybe he was attracted to veronica shildon there was something in that tension between her straitlaced exterior and inner passions that a man might find sexy and the fact that he couldnt have her would only add to the excitement make her seem more of a challenge didnt men always want unattainable women rubbish susan told herself sharply she was letting her imagination run away with her time to apply a bit of lipstick when she was ready she looked again at her small tree and the few trimmings she had hastily put up on christmas eve they made the place look a bit more like a home as she looked around the room she couldnt really see what was missing the wallpaper red roses on a cream background was nice enough the threepiece suite arranged around the gas fireplace looked a little shabby but nonetheless cosy and the bookcase added a learned look there was a beautiful pine table too in the corner by the window where she ate so what was it looking again at the christmas trimmings she realized with a shock what was missing so simple really if she had been on a case looking objectively at a suspects apartment and had seen one just like this she would have known immediately but because it was her own she hadnt paid it the same attention the one personal touch the christmas decorations pointed out that there was nothing of her there the room had no personality the furniture wallpaper carpet could all belong to anyone where were the knickknacks that people accumulate over the years where were the favourite prints on the walls the framed photographs of loved ones on the mantelpiece the ornaments on the windowsill there were no books only her textbooks which she kept in the guest room she used as a study and where was the music she had a music centre her parents had bought for her twentyfirst birthday but all she ever listened to was the radio she had no records or tapes at all the doorbell rang well she thought slipping on her coat perhaps its time i started a nice landscape on the wall over there a constable print or something a couple of china figurines on the mantelpiece a few books and a record of that music banks played in the car on the way back from redburn yesterday she had felt embarrassed and stupid when he had asked what she wanted to listen to because she had no idea she heard music on the radio pop and classical and enjoyed some of it but could never remember the names of performers or titles of the pieces for some reason she had asked for some vocal music and he had played a tape of kiri te kanawa singing highlights from madama butterfly even susan had heard of kiri te kanawa the soprano from new zealand who had sung at the wedding of prince charles to lady di one song in particular sent shivers all the way up her spine and made the hackles at the back of her neck stand on end banks had told her the heroine was imagining the return of her lover in the aria which translated as one fine day susan had taken a note of the title and she would buy it for herself tomorrow as a start to her collection perhaps she would also try to find out what happened in the story did the lover return as butterfly dreamed the doorbell rang again smiling susan went downstairs to the front door to meet james he told her she looked beautiful she didnt believe him but she felt wonderful as they got into his car and drove off into the icy night three sorry about the mess veronica shildon said as she let banks in he looked around there was no mess really he sat down veronica stood by the kitchen door with her arms folded the reason i came he said is to tell you that weve tracked down the woman in the picture veronica shifted her weight from one foot to the other yes her name is ruth dunne shes a poet as you said published by a small feminist press and she lives in london you have an address yes thank you for telling me chief inspector i realize it might have been unethical ms shildon i never do anything unethical his eyes twinkled when he smiled i i didnt meant its all right would you like some tea i was just about to make some yes please its a bit nippy out there if youd like something stronger no tea will do fine while veronica made the tea banks looked around the room it was in a state of flux in the first place there was hardly anywhere to sit the suite was gone leaving only a couple of hardbacked chairs at the table by the window also the sideboard had been moved and the christmas tree along with all the trimmings was gone even though it was only december banks wondered if veronica could have done it all herself have you talked to her veronica asked placing the tray on the table and sitting opposite him no not yet im going down there tomorrow morning it wouldnt be wise to phone ahead you dont mean shes a suspect until i find out otherwise she is and i dont want to give her any reason to run off if she thinks shes sitting pretty it must be an awful job you do veronica said sometimes but not as awful as the things the people we try to catch do touché anyway i just thought id let you know and im grateful veronica put her cup and saucer down id like to see her she said ruth dunne if its not too much of an imposition may i travel down with you banks scratched the scar by his right eye then crossed his legs he knew he should say no officially veronica shildon was a major suspect in her lovers murder he had told her about ruth dunne only partly out of goodwill mainly he had been interested in her reaction to the news on the other hand if he got her out of her normal environment out of this house and out of eastvale he might be able to get her to open up a bit more about carolines background was that worth the risk of her making a break for it it would be easy for her to disappear in a city as large as london but why should she they had no real evidence against her they couldnt put her under arrest im going by train he said i wont be driving down i never could stand driving in london are you trying to put me off i know its an unusual request to make chief inspector but ive heard about ruth often enough from caroline though never more than her first name and what a good friend she was somehow now that carolines gone i just feel id like to meet her theres very little else left banks sipped at his tea and let a minute pass on two conditions he said finally first of all i cant allow you to be present at the interview and second youll have to wait until ive talked to her before you see her veronica nodded that sounds fair i havent finished yet but that was two ill make it three then i reserve the right to stop you seeing her at all if for any reason i feel it necessary but why on earth it should be obvious if ruth dunne turns out to be even more of a suspect than she is now i cant allow the two of you to discuss the case together do you agree to the terms veronica nodded slowly i suppose ill have to and youll also have to return with me i was thinking of looking up an old friend veronica said perhaps staying down for new year banks shook his head im already going out on a limb veronica stood up very well i understand right he said at the door eight twenty from eastvale change at leeds ill be there she said and closed the door behind him four marios was a cosy restaurant in a narrow culdesac of gift shops off north market street it had a small bar at one end of the long room stucco walls and small tables with red and white checked cloths and candles in orange pressedglass jars a man with a guitar sat on a stool at the far end quietly crooning italian love songs the place was full when james and susan got there and they had to sit for ten minutes at the bar james ordered a half litre of barolo which they sipped as they waited he looked good susan thought clearly he had made some sartorial effort replacing cords and poloneck with grey slacks a white shirt and a welltailored darkblue sports jacket his fair hair thinning and combed forward flat against his skull looked newly washed and he had also shaved as a couple of nicks under his chin testified his grey eyes seemed bluer tonight and they sparkled with life and mischief youll just love the cannelloni he said putting his fingers to his lips and making a kissing gesture susan laughed how long was it since an attractive man had made her laugh she had no idea but very quickly she seemed to be getting over the idea of james conran as drama teacher and moving towards well she didnt quite know and didnt really want to contemplate just yet at least not tonight james chatted easily with the barman in fluent italian and susan sipped her wine reading the labels of the liqueur bottles behind the bar soon a whitejacketed waiter ushered them with a flourish to a table for two luckily susan thought it wasnt too close to the singer now lost in the throes of o sole mio they examined their menus in silence and susan finally decided to take jamess advice on the cannelloni he ordered linguine in a white wine and clam sauce for himself he had recommended that too but she was allergic to shellfish i must say again he said raising his glass in a toast that you look gorgeous tonight oh dont be stupid susan felt herself blush she had done the best she could with her appearance accenting her rather too thin lips and playing down the extra fat on her cheekbones with powder she knew that she wasnt bad looking her large eyes were a beautiful ultramarine colour and her short blonde hair naturally thick and curly gave her no trouble at all if she could just lose a couple of inches from her waist and three or four from her hips she thought shed be more inclined to believe compliments and wolf whistles still it was a long time since shed gone to such lengths for a date she smiled and clinked glasses with james all you lack is confidence he said as if reading her thoughts you have to believe in yourself more i do susan answered how do you think ive got where i am i mean your personality the image you project believe youre lovely and people will see you that way is that what you do james winced in mock agony oh now youre being cruel im sorry its all right ill survive he leaned forward tell me ive always wondered what did you think of me when you were at school i mean what did the girls think of me susan laughed and put her hand to her mouth they thought you were gay jamess face showed no expression but a sudden chill seemed to emanate from him im sorry susan said feeling flustered i didnt mean anything by it i didnt think so if thats any consolation and it was just because you were in the arts in the arts yes you know how people in the performance arts always seem to be thought of as gay if itll make you feel any better they thought mr curlew was that way too james stared at her then burst into laughter peter curlew the music teacher susan nodded well thats a good one i do feel better now curly was a happily married man with four kids devoted family man susan laughed with him that just shows you how wrong we were i suppose i liked the way he used to conduct to himself whenever he played a record for us he really got quite worked up in a world of his own of course you lot were all snickering at him behind your hands werent you yes yes im afraid we were susan felt strangely ashamed to admit it now though she hadnt thought of mr curlew for years he was a very talented pianist you know he could have gone a long way but those years of dreary teaching broke his spirit susan felt embarrassed how are you getting on without caroline she asked to change the subject james paused for a few seconds as if deep in thought before answering fine i suppose it wasnt a difficult part it was just that well caroline was special thats all are you any closer susan shook her head not that she would have said even if they were closer to finding carolines killer she frowned do you think anyone in the production could have been involved in her death he cupped his chin in his hand and thought for a moment no he said finally no i cant see it nobody knew her that well her killer didnt need to know her well she let him or her in but he or she could have been merely an acquaintance someone come to talk to her about something i still cant see it there must have been friction with the other women the leads why competition over what anything men lines parts there wasnt im not saying we were a totally happy family we had our ups and downs our off days but youre grasping at straws remember its the amateur dramatic society people join for pleasure not profit id like to think though that were far from amateur in quality susan smiled im sure you are tell me what was caroline hartley really like im sorry susan its still very upsetting for me such a loss i just dont want to ah look heres our food he rubbed his hands together delightful and another half litre of your best barolo please enzo do you think we should susan asked ive still got half a glass left im not certain i can drink any more well if you cant i can i know i should be drinking white with the linguine but what the hell i prefer barolo worry not not a drop will be wasted what did you do for christmas i i well what did you visit your parents he gathered a forkful of food and lifted it to his mouth his eyes probing her face for an answer all the time susan looked down at her plate i not really no i didnt i was busy with the case you dont get on with them do you he said still looking directly at her with just a glint of satisfaction in his eyes she found his gaze disconcerting and looked down at her plate again to cut off a bit of cannelloni i dont suppose i do she admitted when shed finished chewing she shrugged its nothing serious just that holidays at home can be awfully depressing i suppose so james said im an orphan myself and i always find christmas terribly gloomy it brings back memories of those awful orphanage dinners and enforced festivities but you have a family you shouldnt neglect them you know one day itll be too late look susan said reaching for her glass when i want a lecture on a daughters responsibility ill ask for one james stood up im sorry really i am he patted her arm excuse me for a moment susan held her anger in check and tossed back the last of her wine the second half litre arrived she refilled her glass and took a long swig to hell with caution she could get as pissed as the next person if she wanted to why couldnt she talk about her parents without getting so damned emotional she asked herself she picked away at her cannelloni which was very good until james came back then she took a deep breath and put down her knife and fork im the one that should apologise she said i didnt mean to blow up like that its just that its my problem all right fine james said fine so what did you do she sighed i stayed at home i had quite a nice day actually id dashed out and bought a small tree and a few decorations the night before so the place looked quite seasonal i watched the queens message and a variety show and read a book on homicide investigation james laughed a forkful of pasta halfway to his mouth you read a textbook on homicide on christmas day susan blushed at that moment the manager walked by he nodded at james as he passed i dont believe it james said you sitting there by the christmas tree listening to carols reading about dead bodies and poisons and ballistics well its true susan said managing a smile anyway if my job dis but she had no time to finish before she could even get the word out a man appeared beside her and began singing into her ear she didnt know the song but she could make out words like bella and amore she wished she could shrink to nothing and disappear down a crack in the floor james sat opposite hands folded on his lap watching with cool amusement in his eyes when the singer had gone and susan had grudgingly thanked him she turned to james with fury in her eyes you set that up didnt you when you went to the gents you talked to the manager go on admit it very well james turned his hands palms up mea culpa i just thought you might enjoy it thats all ive never been so embarrassed in my life ive a good mind susan dropped her napkin on the table and pushed back her chair but james leaned forward and put his hand gently on her arm she could see the mild amusement in his eyes turn to concern dont go susan i just meant i thought it might cheer you up after a christmas spent alone honestly i didnt mean to embarrass you i never thought you wouldnt like it how could i know looking at his eyes again she could see he was sincere not so much that but it hadnt even occurred to him that the singer might embarrass her she eased the chair towards the table again and relaxed all right she said forcing a smile ill let you off just this once but dont you ever i wont james said i promise scouts honour cross my heart and hope to die come on eat your cannelloni and drink your wine enjoy and he let his hand rest on hers on the checked tablecloth for a long moment before taking it away five banks switched off milhauds creation as he pulled up outside faith greens block of flats it was a small unit only three stories high with six flats on each floor he looked at his watch plenty of time for faith to have come home from the crooked billet if she hadnt gone out on a date luckily she was in when he knocked he heard someone cross the room and saw the tiny peephole in the door darken inspector banks faith said as she pulled the door open with a dramatic flourish what a surprise do come in let me take your coat she hung up his coat then took his arm and led him into the spacious living room a number of framed posters from old movies hung on the pastelgreen walls bogart in casablanca garbo in camille john garfield and lana turner in the postman always rings twice faith gestured towards the modular sofa that covered almost two walls and banks sat down drink maybe just a small scotch if you have it of course faith opened up a glassfronted cocktail cabinet and poured them both drinks bankss was about two fingers taller than he would have liked to what do i owe this pleasure faith asked in her husky voice if only youd told me you were coming i could have at least put my face on i must look terrible she didnt with her beautiful eyes and silvery pageboy hair it would have been difficult for faith green to look terrible she wore no makeup but that didnt matter her high cheekbones needed no highlights her full pink lips no colouring in skintight black slacks and a darkgreen silk blouse her figure slim at the waist nicely curved at the hips and wellrounded at the bust looked terrific the perfume she wore was the same one banks remembered from their brief chat at the crooked billet very subtle with a hint of jasmine she settled close to banks on the sofa and cradled a glass of white wine in her hands you should have phoned first she said i gave you my number maybe you didnt know i was married she laughed ive never known that to make very much difference to men given the way she was sitting and looking at him he could well believe her he fiddled for his cigarettes oh youre not going to smoke are you she pouted please dont its not that im so anti but i just cant bear my flat smelling of smoke please banks removed his hand from his jacket pocket and took a long swig of scotch he waited until the pleasant burning sensation had subsided then said remember the last time we talked about how things were going between the people in the play of course i do her eyes twinkled i told you i liked my men dark and handsome and not necessarily tall if banks had been wearing a tie he would have loosened it at this point miss green faith please its not such a bad name is it there are three of us sisters but my parents never were that well up on the bible the youngests called chastity banks laughed faith it is then you told me you had no idea that caroline hartley was a lesbian are you sure you didnt faith frowned of course not what an odd question she didnt walk around with it written on her forehead besides its not as obvious in a woman as it sometimes is in a man is it i mean ive known a few homosexuals and most of them dont mince around and lisp but you have to admit that some conform to the stereotype how could you possibly tell with a woman unless she went about dressed like a man or something perhaps you would just sense it well i didnt not with caroline and she certainly didnt walk around dressed like a man so she told no one not as far as i know she didnt she certainly didnt tell me i cant vouch for the others another drink banks looked at his glass amazed to find it empty so soon no thanks oh come on faith said and took it from him she brought it back only slightly fuller than the last time and sat about six inches closer banks held his ground theres something missing he said some factor maybe just a little thing and im trying to find out what it is i get the feeling that people you especially are holding something back hiding something little me hiding something like what she spread her hands and looked down as if to indicate that all she had was on display she wasnt far from the truth i dont know do you think there might be a chance that caroline hartley was having an affair with someone other than the woman she was living with perhaps someone in the theatre company faith stared at him then backed away a few inches burst out laughing and pointed at her chest me you think im a lesbian given the situation her physical closeness and the heady aura of sex that seemed to emanate from her it did seem rather a silly thing to think not you specifically banks said anyone when faith had stopped laughing she moved closer again and said well i can assure you im not she shifted her legs the material swished as her thighs brushed together in fact if you let me i can even prove to you im not banks held her gaze its quite possible for a person to be bisexual he said especially if he or she is oversexed to start with faith seemed to recede several feet into the distance though she hadnt moved at all i ought to be insulted she said with a pout but im not disappointed in you yes but not insulted do you really think im oversexed banks put his thumb and forefinger close together and smiled maybe just a little bit all the seductiveness the heat and smell of sexuality had gone from her manner and what sat next to him was a very attractive young woman perhaps a little shy a little vulnerable perhaps it had all been an act could she turn her sexual power on and off at will why did he keep forgetting that there were so many actors on the fringes of caroline hartleys death i didnt mean it as an insult banks went on it just seemed the best way to cut the games and get down to business i really do need information thats why im here faith nodded then smiled all right ill play fair but im not just all talk you know just for a moment she upped the voltage again and banks felt the current could caroline have been seeing someone he asked quickly she could have been yes but i cant help you there caroline kept herself to herself nobody knew anything about her private life im certain after a couple of drinks shed go off home by herself usually if it was an especially nasty night james would give her a lift and before you make too much out of that he would take teresa too and drop her off last she paused for effect then added huskily at his place sometimes teresa told me she didnt care about jamess attraction to caroline what would you say about that faith put a slender finger to her lips then said well i wouldnt quite put it that way i dont like to tell tales out of school but but what it could be important teresas very emotional you mean she fought with caroline not exactly with james conran faith swirled her drink and nodded slowly i heard them talking once or twice she said carolines name came up in what way faith lowered her voice and leaned closer to banks usually as that prickteasing little bitch teresas a good friend she added settling back but you did say it was important so teresa pedmore had more of a grudge against caroline hartley than she had cared to admit she could have been the woman who visited carolines house after patsy janowski on the other hand so could faith green who was being much more circumspect about her own involvement in the thespian intrigues if she had any both were a little taller than caroline hartley banks would have to have a word with teresa later and see what she in turn had to say about her friend you say james seemed attracted enough to caroline to upset teresa he said how strong would you say his interest was he flirted with her in the pub that was all i ever saw how did she react she gave as good as she got did they sleep together not as far as i know teresa never referred to them doing that no just to the way james fussed about her it wasnt caroline who manoeuvred the seating in the pub if anyone teresa should have blamed james not caroline people arent very logical when it comes to blame banks said thinking of what claude ivers and patsy janowski had said about caroline and veronica where did you all go after the rehearsal on the day of carolines death i came home honestly i was tired i didnt even have a date why didnt you all go for a drink as usual faith shrugged no special reason sometimes we just didnt thats all people just wandered off home theres nothing more to it than that it was close to christmas there was shopping to do family to visit banks didnt believe her she fiddled with her pearl necklace as she spoke and looked away from him she also spoke as if there was nobody listening to her did something happen at that rehearsal faith he asked was there a row between caroline and teresa faith shifted in her seat she turned her eyes on him again they gave away nothing a waft of perfume drifted over another drink no tell me what happened leave me alone nothing happened banks put his glass down on the st ives coaster and stood up faith scratched the inside of her elbow are you going now she asked all of a sudden she seemed like a frightened girl whose parents were about to turn the lights out yes thanks very much for the drinks youve been a great help she touched his arm nothing happened really believe me we just finished our rehearsal and we all went home dont you believe me banks moved towards the door faith walked beside him still holding on you must catch him soon you know she said him whoever killed caroline was it a woman i suppose it could have been but you must dont worry we will with or without your help why are you so concerned faith let go of his arm the rest of us are in danger arent we it stands to reason what do you mean whoever killed caroline he might be stalking the cast a serial killer a psychopathic killer its possible but i dont think so youve been reading too many books faith so you really dont think the rest of us are in danger no but you might as well keep your door locked anyway and always look and see whos there he paused half out of the door what is it faith asked some of you could be in danger he added slowly if you know more about the crime than youre telling and if the killer knows you know or suspects that you do faith shook her head i know nothing more than i told you then youve nothing to worry about have you banks smiled and left he wanted to get teresas version of that final night but she would have to wait it was going on for ten oclock he was tired and he was going to london early in the morning if he still needed to talk to her when he got back he could do it then as he walked over the brittle ice listening to the rest of the milhaud piece he recalled faith greens expression at the door she had told him that she knew nothing but had looked distinctly worried when he had hinted she might be in danger of course knowing her it could have been just another act but perhaps he thought it wouldnt be a bad idea to have richmond and susan gay keep an eye on the thespians while he was in london one it wasnt until the intercity train pulled out of leeds city station that veronica shildon seemed to relax banks had met her at eastvale station early that morning and they had paced the platform shivering and breathing plumes of mist until the overheated old diesel rattled in and carried them off silent but for small talk theyd watched the shrouded landscape roll by south of ripon the dales and moors to the west gave way to rolling farmland where patches of frozen brown earth and clumps of bare trees showed through the gauze of snow and finally to the suburbs and industrial estates of the city itself they had endured a halfhour wait on the cold grimy platform at leeds breathing in the diesel smell of warm engines and listening to the crackly voice over the loudspeaker now well past the sign at the stations entrance in honour of the local beer magnate joshua tetley welcomes you to leeds banks looked over his shoulder and watched the city recede into the distance first it filled the horizon an urban sprawl under a heavy sky tall chimneys and church spires poked through the greybrown snow the town hall dome and the white university library tower dominated the distance then the city was gone and only bare fields stretched east and west veronica took off her heavy blue winter coat and folding it carefully placed it in the luggage rack then she smoothed her tweed skirt and sat back down opposite banks resting her hands on the table between them im sorry she said with an embarrassed smile i know i must be a burden but i didnt like the idea of travelling down by myself its a while since ive been anywhere alone thats all right said banks who had been uncharitably wishing he could spend the journey with the guardian crossword and some poulenc chamber music on his walkman coffee yes please the buffet car hadnt opened yet but a british rail steward was making his way slowly along the corridor with an urn and a selection of biscuits banks headed him off bought two coffees and pushed one over the smooth table to veronica automatically he reached for his cigarettes then remembered he was in a nonsmoking carriage it wasnt veronicas fault she would have been happy to sit anywhere with him since he had allowed her to come along the problem was that there was only one smokers car on the entire train and as usual it was almost full and completely unventilated even banks refused to sit in it he could do without a cigarette for a couple of hours easily it might even do him good as an alternative he caught up with the steward and bought a penguin biscuit after wakefield they sped along past dreary fields and embankments trying to sip the hot weak coffee without spilling any their carriage was unusually quiet and empty perhaps banks guessed this was because they were in that limbo between christmas and new year everyone was both broke and in need of a brief hibernation period of recovering between the two festive occasions deep into south yorkshire banks noticed veronica looking out at the desolate landscape of pit wheels and slag heaps and asked her what she was thinking about its funny she said but i was thinking how i still feel only half there do you know what i mean i can accept that caroline is gone that shes dead and ill never see her again but i cant believe that my life is whole or even real without her she nodded towards the window even the world out there doesnt seem real somehow not any more thats understandable banks said it takes time how did you meet her veronica gave him a long appraising look and then leaned forward and rested her arms on the table clasping her slim freckled hands it must seem very odd to you perverted even but its not there was nothing sordid about it banks said nothing veronica sighed and went on i first met caroline at the café where she worked i used to go for long walks by the river oh just thinking about my life and how empty it felt somehow the moving water seemed to help soothe me we got on speaking terms then once i saw her in the market square and we went for a coffee we discovered we were both in therapy after that well it didnt happen quickly what attracted you to her i didnt even know i was attracted to her at first could you imagine someone like me admitting id fallen in love with a woman but caroline was so alive so childlike in her enthusiasm for life it was infectious id felt half dead for years id been shutting the world out its possible to do that you know so many people accept what life dishes out to them apart from the occasional daydream they never imagine it could be any different any better even the halflife i have now is preferable to what my life was like before caroline theres no going back i was living like a zombie denying everything that counts until caroline came along she showed me how good it was to feel again she made me feel alive for the first time she got me interested in things because she was so passionate about them herself like what oh theatre books film so many things and music claude was always trying to get me interested in music and it really frustrated him that i didnt seem to care as much as he did or notice as much about it as he did i suppose i loved opera most of all but he never had much time for it most seasons i went to leeds to see opera north by myself i liked to listen i still do like classical music but i never actually bought records for myself there always seemed something stuffy about the music we listened to perhaps because claude hated anything popular anything outside the classical field but with caroline it was jazz and blues and folk music somehow it just seemed more alive we even went to clubs to see folk groups perform id never done that before ever but your husbands a musician himself he loves music didnt he mean anything to you why couldnt you respond to his enthusiasm veronica lowered her head and scratched the table surface with her thumb nail the train hit a bumpy stretch of track and rocked i dont know somehow i just felt completely stifled by his existence thats the only way i can put it like it didnt matter what i thought or felt or did because he was the one our lives revolved around i depended on him for everything even for my tastes in music and books i was suffocated by his presence anything i did would have been insignificant beside what he did he was the great claude ivers after all always the teacher the master one dismissive comment from him on anything that mattered to me and i was reduced to silence or tears so i learned not to let things matter i was the great mans wife not a person in my own right she sat up straight her brow furrowed how can i explain it to you claude wasnt cruel he didnt do any of it on purpose its just the way he is and the way i am or was i still have my problems more than ever now carolines gone i suppose but when i look back i cant believe im the same person i was then she worked an act of magic she breathed life into dust and i know i can carry on somehow no matter how hard just because of her just because i had her in my life even for such a short time she paused and glanced out the window banks could read the intense feeling in the set of her jaw the way the small muscles below her cheekbones seemed drawn tight do you see she went on turning her clear greygreen eyes on banks it wasnt black and white he wasnt a bad husband neglectful maybe certainly the last few years he was far too wrapped up in his work to notice me and i was dying drying up inside if caroline hadnt come along i dont know what would have become of me but you started seeing the therapist before you met caroline banks said what made you do that desperation despair id read an article about jungian therapy in a womens magazine it sounded interesting but not for me time passed and i became so miserable i had to do something or i was frightened i would try to kill myself i suppose i told myself therapy was a sort of intellectual fun not anything deep and personal more like going to an evening class you know pottery basket weaving or creative writing it wasnt like going to the real doctor or to a psychiatrist and somehow i could handle that it still took a lot of nerve more than i believed i ever had but i was so unhappy and it helped it can be a painful process you know you keep circling things without ever really zooming in on them and sometimes you feel its a waste of time its going nowhere then you do focus on things and you find you were circling them for good reason occasionally you get some kind of insight and that sustains you for a while then i met caroline had you experienced feelings like that before banks asked towards another woman yes veronica shook her head i hadnt experienced feelings like that for anyone before male or female somehow or other her being a woman just wasnt an issue not after a while anyway everything began to feel so natural i didnt even have to think what about your past your upbringing veronica smiled yes isnt it tempting to try and put everything down to that i dont mean to be dismissive but i dont think its so i had no horrible experiences with men in my past id never been abused raped or beaten she paused at least not physically what was your family background like solid suburban upper middle class very repressed utterly cold we never spoke about feelings and nobody told me about the facts of life my mother was well bred very victorian and my father was kind and gentle but rather distant aloof and he was away a lot i never had much contact with boys while i was growing up i went to convent school and even at university i didnt mix very much i was in an allgirls residence and i tended to stay at home and study a lot i was shy men frightened me with their deep voices and their aggressive mannerisms i dont know why when i met claude he was a guest lecturer for a music appreciation course it was the kind of thing genteel young ladies did appreciate music so i took the course i was fascinated by his knowledge and his obvious passion for his subject the very things i came to hate later for some reason he noticed me he was an older man much safer than the randy boys in the campus pub i was twentyone when i married him so you never had any other boyfriends never i was reclusive frightened as a mouse believe it or not when claude seemed to lose interest in sex that suited me fine now when i look back i cant remember what i did from day to day how i got through i was a housewife i had no outside job i suppose i cleaned and cooked and watched daytime television in a kind of trance then there was the valium of course how long were you married we were together for fifteen years i never complained i never took an interest in life outside his circle of friends and acquaintances i had no passions of my own i dont blame claude for that he had his own life and music was more important to him even than marriage i think it has to be like that with a great artist dont you and i believe claude is a great artist but great artists make lousy husbands did you ever think of having children i did but claude thought they would interfere with his peace and quiet he never really liked children and i suppose i was am afraid of childbirth terrified to be honest anyway he just went ahead and had a vasectomy he never even told me until it was done what do you think of childless marriages mr banks banks shrugged i wouldnt know never had one some people say theres no love in them but i dont agree sometimes i think it would be best if we were all childless childless and parentless she caught the paradox and smiled impossible i realize thered be no one here to feel anything i know i feel alone and it hurts because caroline isnt here but at the same time i seem to be saying wed all be better off without any feelings or any other attachments i want it both ways dont i dont we all look this philosophys made me thirsty i know its early but how about a drink veronica laughed have i driven you to drink already all right ill have a gin and tonic banks made his way down to the buffet car holding on to the tops of seats to keep his balance in the rocking train most of the other passengers seemed to be business people with their heads buried deep in the financial times or briefcases full of papers open in front of them one man even tapped away at the keys of a laptop computer after a short queue banks got veronicas drink and a miniature bells for himself going back onehanded was a little more difficult but he made it without falling or dropping anything back in his seat he poured the drinks they passed a small town smoking chimneys grimy factory yards stacked with pallets a new redbrick school with hardly any windows a roundabout snowcovered playing fields as white as the rugby posts the trains rhythm was soothing even if it wasnt the same as the steamtrain journeys banks remembered taking with his father when he was young the sound was different and he missed the tangy smell of the smoke the sight of it curling over trees by a wooded embankment where the track curved and he could see the engine through the window veronica seemed content to sip her drink in silence there was so much more he wanted to ask her to understand about her relationship with caroline hartley but he didnt feel he could justify his questions he thought of what she had said about a childless and parentless life and remembered the philip larkin poem which he had recently reread it was certainly depressing the ending as much as the beginning but he found something in the wit and gusto of larkins colloquial style that brought a smile to the lips too perhaps that was the secret of great art it could engender more than one feeling in the spectator at the same time tragedy and comedy laughter and tears irony and passion hope and despair whats your wife like the suddenness of the question surprised banks and he guessed he must have shown it im sorry veronica went on quickly blushing i hope im not being presumptuous no i was just thinking about something else thats all my wife well shes just an inch or so shorter than i am shes slim with an oval face blonde hair and dark eyebrows what id call a nononsense personality and let me think veronica laughed and held up her hand no no thatll do i didnt want a policemans description i suppose i hadnt thought how difficult it is to answer off the cuff like that if anyone had asked me to describe caroline i wouldnt have known where to start you did well enough earlier but that was just scratching the surface she drank some more gin and tonic and looked at her reflection in the window as if she couldnt believe what she was seeing i suppose my wife and i are still together banks said because she has always been determined and independent shed hate to be a housewife worrying about meals and threepenceoff coupons in the papers some people might see that as a fault but i dont its what she is and i wouldnt want to turn her into some sort of chattel or slave and she wouldnt want to depend on me to entertain her or keep her happy oh weve had some dull patches and a few close shaves on both sides but i think we do pretty well and you put it down to her independence mostly yes more an independent spirit really and intelligence its very hard being a policemans wife its not so much the worry though thats there but the long absences and the unpredictability ive seen plenty of marriages go down the tubes because the wife hasnt been able to take it any more but sandra has always had a mind of her own and a life of her own photography the gallery friends books she doesnt let herself get bored she loves life too much so i dont feel i have to be around to entertain her or pay attention to her all the time that sounds like caroline and me though i suppose i depended on her quite a lot especially at first but she helped me become more independent she and ursula banks wondered why on earth he had opened up that way to veronica there was something about the woman he couldnt quite put his finger on a terrible honesty a visible effort she made to communicate to be open she was working at living not simply coasting through life like so many she didnt shirk experience and banks found it was impossible not to be as frank in return with someone like that was he letting his feelings overrun his judgement after all this woman could be a murderess how long had you known caroline before you left your husband banks asked known her a few months but mostly just casually but how did you know how you felt what you wanted to do i just knew do you mean sexually well i dont know she went on cutting through his embarrassment certainly it wasnt anything id experienced or even thought about before i suppose i must have but i dont remember of course there were crushes and a little petting at school but i imagine everyone indulges in that i dont know it was awkward we were at her flat and she just took me after that i knew i knew what had been missing in my life what i had been repressing if you like and i knew i had to change things i was buoyant with love and i suppose i expected claude to understand when i told him but he didnt it was the closest he ever came to hitting me banks remembered the exhusbands anger his humiliation what happened oh i know what i did wrong now at least i think i do she laughed at herself i was crazy with joy then i expected him to feel happy for me can you believe that anyway i moved out the next day and went to live with caroline in her flat then he sold the house and left eastvale later we got the little place on oakwood mews the rest you know and you never looked back never id found what i was looking for and now veronicas face darkened now i dont know but you wouldnt go back to him to claude i couldnt do that even if he wanted to she shook her head slowly no whatever the future holds for me its certainly not more of my miserable mistake of a past in the silence that followed banks glanced out the window and was surprised to find the train was passing peterborough the landmarks were so familiar the tall kiln chimneys of the brick factory growing straight from the ground the white sign of the great northern hotel against its charcoalgrey stone the truncated cathedral tower what is it veronica asked you look so engrossed have you seen something my home town banks explained not much of a place but mine own veronica laughed where do you come from banks asked crosby near liverpool but lightyears away really its a horribly stuckup suburb at least it was then id hardly say peterborough was stuckup banks said doesnt your poet larkin have something to say about childhood places youve been doing your research i see yes he does and he set it on a train journey like this its very funny and very sad it ends nothing like something can happen anywhere do you read a lot of poetry yes quite a bit do you read any journals some the poetry review occasionally mostly i read old stuff i prefer rhyme and metre so i tend to stay away from contemporary work except larkin seamus heaney and a couple of others of course thats one area caroline and i disagreed on she liked free verse and i never could see the point of it what was it robert frost said like playing tennis without a net but youve never noticed ruth dunnes name in print never come across her work veronica tightened her lips and looked out the window she seemed irritated that banks had broken the spell and plunged into what must have felt like an interrogation i dont remember it no why i just wondered what kind of stuff she writes and why caroline didnt tell you about her because she tended to be secretive about her past sketchy anyway i also suspect that maybe she didnt want to make me jealous were they still seeing one another as far as i know caroline made no trips to london while we were together i havent even been myself for at least three years no i mean jealous of a past lover it can happen you know people have even been jealous over dead lovers and i was especially vulnerable being in such a new and frightening relationship frightening well yes of course especially at first do you imagine it was easy for me with my background and my sheltered existence to go to bed with a woman to give up my marriage and live with one was there anyone else who might have been jealous enough of carolines relationship with you veronica raised her eyebrows youre never very far away from your job are you it makes it hard to trust you to open up to you i can never tell what youre thinking from your expression banks laughed thats because im a good poker player but seriously despite all evidence to the contrary i am a human being and id be a liar if i didnt admit that the foremost thing on my mind is catching carolines killer right now the work is never far away thats because somebody took something they had no right to and do you think catching and punishing the criminal will do any good i dont know it becomes too abstract for me at that point i told you i like concrete things put it this way i wouldnt like to think that the person who stabbed caroline is going to be walking around eastvale or anywhere else for that matter whistling oh what a beautiful mornin for the rest of his or her life do you know what i mean revenge perhaps but i dont think so something more subtle more right than mere revenge but why do you take it so personally somebody has to caroline isnt around to take it so personally herself veronica stared at banks her eyes narrowed then she shook her head what banks asked nothing just trying to understand thinking what a strange job you do what a strange man you are do all policemen get as involved in their cases banks shrugged i dont know for some its just a days work like anyone else theyll skive off as much as they can some get very cynical some are lazy some are cruel vicious bastards with brains the size of a pea just people you probably think i dont care about revenge or justice or whatever it is no i think youre confused and youre too shaken by carolines death to think about whoever did it youre also probably too civilized to feel the blood lust of revenge repressed maybe then perhaps a little repression is a good thing ill have to tell ursula that before she releases the raging beast inside me banks smiled i hope weve got the killer safely behind bars long before that the train passed a patch of waste ground scattered with bright yellow oil drums and old tyres then a factory yard a housing estate and a graffitiscarred embankment soon banks could see alexandra palace through the window better get ready he said standing up and reaching for his camelhair overcoat well be at kings cross in a few minutes two half an hour later banks looked across the street at the gothic extravaganza of st pancras complete with its chimneys crocketed towers and crenellated gables so here he was back in london for the first time in almost three years black taxis and red doubledecker buses clogged the roads and poisoned the streets with exhaust fumes horns honked drivers yelled at one another and pedestrians took their lives into their hands crossing the street veronica had taken a taxi to her friends house for banks the first priority was lunch which meant a pint and a sandwich he walked down euston road for a while taking in the atmosphere loving it almost as much as he hated it there didnt appear to have been much snow down here apart from occasional lumps of grey slush in the gutters the streets were mostly clear the sky was leaden though and seemed to promise at least a cold drizzle before the end of the day he turned down tottenham court road found a cosy pub and managed to elbow himself a place at the bar it was lunchtime so the place was crowded with hungry and thirsty clerks come to slag the boss and gird up their loins for another session at the grindstone banks had forgotten how much he liked london pubs the yorkshire people were so proud of their beer and their pubs it had been easy to forget that a london boozer could be as much fun as any up north banks drank a pint of draught guinness and ate a thick ham and cheese sandwich as always in london such gourmet treats cost an arm and a leg even the pint cost a good deal more than it would in eastvale luckily he was on expenses the raised voices all around him with their london accents brought it all back the good and the bad for years he had loved the citys streets their energy even some of the villains hed nicked had a bit of class and those that lacked class at least had a sense of humour he pushed his plate aside and lit a cigarette the bottles ranged at the back of the bar were reflected in the giltedged mirror the barmaid had broken into a sweat trying to keep up with the customers her upper lip and brow were moist with it but she managed to maintain her smile banks ordered another pint he couldnt put his finger on when it had all started to go wrong for him in london it had been a series of events most likely over a long period but somehow it all merged into one big mess when he looked back brian getting into fights at school his own marriage on the rocks anxiety attacks that had convinced him he was dying but the worst thing of all had been the job slowly subtly it had changed and banks had found himself changing with it he was becoming more like the vicious criminals he dealt with day in day out less able to see good in people and hope for the world he ran on pure anger and cynicism occasionally thumped suspects in interrogation and trampled over everyones rights and the damnedest thing was it was all getting him good results gaining him a reputation as a good copper he sacrificed his humanity for his job and he grew to hate himself what he had become he had been no better than dirty dick burgess a superintendent from the met with whom he had recently done battle in eastvale life had dragged on without joy without love he was losing sandra and he couldnt even talk to her about it he was living in a sewer crowded with rats fighting for food and space no air no light no escape the move up north if he admitted it had been his way of escape put simply he had run away before it got too late and just in time whilst everything in eastvale hadnt been roses it had been a damn sight better than those last months in london during which he seemed to do nothing but stand over corpses in stinking rundown slums a woman ripped open from pubes to breast bone intestines spilling on the carpet the decaying body of a man with his head hacked off and placed between his legs he had seen those things dreamed about them and he knew he could never forget even in eastvale he sometimes awoke in a cold sweat as the head tried to speak to him he finished his pint quickly and walked outside pulling up his overcoat collar against the chill so he was back but not to stay never to stay so enjoy it the city seemed noisier busier and dirtier than ever but a fresh breeze brought the smell of roast chestnuts from a street vendor on oxford street banks thought of the good days the good years searching for old leatherbound editions of dickens on autumn afternoons along charing cross road portobello road market on a crisp windy spring morning playing darts with barney merritt and his other mates in the magpie and stump after a hard day in the witness box family outings to epping forest on sunday afternoons drinks in the street on warm summer nights at the back of leicester square after going to the pictures with sandra the kids safe with a sister no it hadnt all been bad not even soho even that had its comic moments its heart at least it had seemed so before everything went wrong still he felt human again he was out of the sewer and a brief visit like this one wasnt going to suck him back into it first he made a phone call to barney merritt an old friend from the yard to confirm his bed for the night that done he caught the tube to the oval as he sat in the small compartment and read the ads above the windows he remembered the countless other underground journeys he had made because he always tried to avoid driving in london he remembered standing in the smoking car crushed together with a hundred or more other commuters all hanging on their straps trying to read the paper and puffing away it had been awful but part of the ritual how hed managed to breathe he had no idea now you couldnt even smoke on the platforms and escalators let alone on the trains he walked down kennington road and found the turnoff a narrow street of threestorey terrace houses divided into flats each floor with its own bay window at number twentythree a huge cactus stood in the window of the middle flat and in the top oriel he could see what looked a stuffed toy animal of some kind her name was printed above the top bell r dunne no first name to discourage weirdos but all the weirdos knew that only women left out their first names there was no intercom banks pushed the bell and waited would she be in what did poets do all day stare at the sky with their eyes in a fine frenzy rolling just when he was beginning to think she wasnt home he heard footsteps inside the hall and the door opened on a chain a face the face peered round at him yes banks showed his identification card and told her the purpose of his visit she shut the door slid off the chain and let him in banks followed the slender boyish figure in turquoise slacks and baggy orange sweatshirt all the way up the carpeted stairs to the top the place was clean and brightly decorated with none of the smells and graffiti he had encountered in such places so often in the past in fact he told himself flats like this must cost a fortune these days how much did poets make surely not that much it would be rude to ask the flat itself was small the door opened on a narrow corridor and banks followed ruth dunne to the right into the living room he hadnt known what to expect had no preconceived idea of what a poets dwelling should look like but whatever he might have imagined it wasnt this there was a divan in front of the gas fire covered with a gaudy crocheted quilt and flanked on both sides by sagging armchairs similarly draped he was surprised to find no bookshelves in evidence and assumed her study was elsewhere in the flat but what was there surprised him as much as what wasnt several stuffed toys a green elephant a pink frog a magenta giraffe lay around in alcoves and on the edge by the bay window and on three of the four walls elaborate cuckoo clocks ticked all set at different times it must be noisy banks said nodding at the clocks ruth dunne smiled you get used to it why the different times im not interested in time just clocks in fact my friends tell me im a chronically late person on the low table between the divan and the fire lay a coffeetable book on watch making a couple of bills an ashtray and a pack of unfiltered gauloises make yourself comfortable ruth said ive never been interrogated by the police before at least not by a detective chief inspector would you like some coffee please its instant im afraid thatll do fine black ruth nodded and left the room if banks had expected a hostile welcome for whatever reason he was certainly disarmed by ruth dunnes charm and hospitality and by her appearance her shiny brown hair medium length was combed casually back parted at one side and the forelock almost covered her left eye her face was unlined and without makeup strongfeatured handsome rather than pretty but with a great deal of character in the eyes theyd seen a lot banks reckoned those hazel eyes felt a lot too in life she looked far more natural and approachable than the arrogant knowing woman in the photograph yet there was certainly something regal in her bearing how did you find me she asked bringing back two mugs of steaming black coffee and sitting with her legs curled under her on the divan she held her mug with both hands and sniffed the aroma the gas fire hissed quietly in the background banks sat in one of the armchairs the kind that seem to embrace you like an old friend and lit a cigarette then he showed her the photograph which she laughed at and told her so easy she said when hed finished a lot of police work is easy and boring timeconsuming too i hope thats not a subtle way of hinting i should have come forward earlier no reason to had you did you know about carolines death ruth reached for the blue paper packet of gauloises tapped one out and nodded read about it in the paper not much of a report really can you tell me what happened banks wished he could but knew he couldnt if he told her then hed have no way of checking what she already knew she noticed his hesitation and waved her hand all right i suppose i should think myself lucky to be spared the gory details look i imagine im a suspect if youve come all this way can we get that out of the way first i might have an alibi you never know and itll make for a hell of a more pleasant afternoon if you dont keep thinking of me as a crazed butch dyke killer she finally lit the cigarette shed been toying with and the acrid tang of french tobacco infused the air banks asked her where she had been and what she had been doing on december ruth sucked on her gauloise thought for a moment then got up and disappeared down the corridor when she reappeared she held an open appointment calendar and carried it over to him i was giving a poetry reading in leamington spa of all places she said very supportive of the arts they are up there what time did it start about eight how did you get there i drove ive got a fiesta its life in the fast lane all the way for us poets you know i was a bit early too for a change so the organizers should remember me good audience pretty good adrian henri and wendy cope were reading there too if you want to check with them banks noted down the details if ruth dunne had indeed been in leamington spa at eight oclock that evening there was no conceivable way she could have been in eastvale at seven twenty or later if she was telling the truth about the reading which could be easily checked then she was in the clear one thing puzzles me banks said caroline had your picture but we couldnt find a copy of your book among her things can you think why that might be plenty of reasons she wasnt much of a one for material possessions wasnt caroline she never did seem to hang on to things like the rest of us acquire possessions i always envied her that i did give her a copy of the first book but ive no idea what happened to it i sent the second one too the one i dedicated to her but i wasnt sure what her address was then the odds are it went to an old address and got lost in the system either that or nancy wood had run off with both of them banks thought nodding but she hung on to the photograph maybe she liked my looks better than my poetry what kind of poetry do you write if you dont mind me asking i dont mind but its a hard one to answer she tapped the fingers holding the cigarette against her cheek the short blonde hairs on the back of her hand caught the light let me see i dont write confessional lesbian poetry nor do i go in for feminist diatribes a little wit i like to think a good sense of structure landscape emotion myth will that do to be going on with do you like larkin ruth laughed i shouldnt but i do its hard not to i never much admired his conservative middleclass little englandism but the bugger certainly had a way with a stanza she cocked her head do we have a literary copper here another adam dalgliesh banks smiled he didnt know who adam dalgliesh was some television detective no doubt who went around quoting shakespeare just curious thats all he answered whos your favourite h d a woman called hilda doolittle friend of ezra pounds banks shook his head never heard of her ah clearly not a literary copper then give her a try maybe i will banks took another sip of his coffee and fiddled for a cigarette back to caroline when did you last see her let me see it was years ago five or six at least i think she was about twenty or twentyone at the time twenty going on sixty why do you say that banks remembered caroline as beautiful and youthful even in death the kind of life she was leading ages a woman fast especially on the inside what life you mean you dont know tell me ruth shifted into the crosslegged position oh i get it you ask the questions i answer them right banks allowed himself a smile im not meaning to be rude he said but thats basically how it goes i need all the information i can get on caroline so far i dont have a hell of a lot especially about the time she spent in london if itll make talking easier for you i can tell you that we already know she had a conviction for soliciting and gave birth to a child thats all ruth looked down into her coffee and banks was surprised to see tears rolling over her cheeks im sorry she said putting the mug down and wiping her face with the back of her hand it just sounds so sad so pathetic you mustnt think im being flippant the way i talk i dont get many visitors so i try to enjoy everyone i meet i was very upset when i read about caroline but i hadnt seen her for a long time ill tell you anything i can a marmalade cat slipped into the room looked once at banks then jumped on the divan next to ruth and purred meet ts eliot ruth said he named so many cats so i thought at least one should be named after him i call him ts for short banks said hello to ts who seemed more interested in nestling into the hollow formed by ruths crossed legs she picked up her coffee again with both hands and blew gently on the surface before drinking caroline started as a dancer she said an exotic dancer i believe theyre called well its not too much of a leap from that to pleasing the odd and i do mean odd punter or two for extra pocket money im sure you know much more about vice here than i do but before long she was doing the lot dancing peep shows turning tricks she was a beautiful child and she looked even younger than she was a lot of men around that scene have a taste for fourteen or fifteenyearolds or even younger and caroline could fulfil that fantasy when she was eighteen was she on drugs ruth frowned and shook her head not as far as i know not like some of them she might have had the odd joint maybe an upper or a downer now and then who doesnt but nothing really heavy or habitual she wasnt hooked on anything what about her pimp bloke called reggie charming character one of his women did for him with a woolworths sheath knife shortly before caroline broke away you can check your records im sure theyll have all the details caroline wasnt involved but it was a godsend for her in a way how surely its obvious she was scared stiff of reggie he used to bash her about regularly with him out of the way she had a chance to slip between the cracks before the next snake came along when did she break away ruth leaned forward and stubbed out her cigarette about a year before she went back up north and you knew her during that period we lived together here i got this place before the prices rocketed you wouldnt believe how cheap it was i knew her before for a little while too id like to think i played a small part in getting her out of the life who played the biggest part she did that herself she was a bright kid and she saw where she was heading not many you can say that about shed been wanting out for a while but reggie wouldnt let go and she didnt know where to run how did you come to meet her after a poetry reading funny i can remember it like it was yesterday out in camden town all we had in the audience was a prostitute and a drunk who wanted to grab the mike and sing your cheating heart he did too right in the middle of my best poem afterwards we drove down to soho not the drunk just me and my fellow readers to the pillars of hercules know it banks nodded hed enjoyed many a pint of draught becks there we just happened to be jammed in a corner next to caroline and another girl we got talking and one thing led to another right from the start caroline struck me as intelligent and wise wasted on that scummy life she knew it too but she didnt know what else she could do we soon became close friends we went to the theatre a lot and she loved it cinema art exhibitions she gave a small laugh anything but classical music or opera she didnt mind ballet though it was all a world shed never known was that all there was to your relationship ruth paused to light another gauloise before answering of course not we were lovers but dont look at me as if i was some kind of corrupter of youth caroline knew exactly what she was doing were you the first woman shed had such a relationship with yes that was obvious right from the start she was shy about things at first but she soon learned ruth inhaled the smoke deeply and blew it out god did she learn one of the cuckoo clocks went through its motions they waited until it stopped what do you think turned her into a lesbian banks asked ruth shifted on the sofa and ts scampered off it doesnt happen like that women dont suddenly quote turn into lesbians unquote they discover thats what they are what they always were but were afraid to admit because there was too much working against them social morality male domination you name it do you think there are a lot of women in that situation more than you imagine what about the men in her life work it out for yourself what do you think it does to a woman to have gross old men sticking their willies in her and meek suburban husbands asking if they can pee in her mouth youve got the pimp at one end and the perverts at the other no quarter so caroline discovered her lesbianism under your guidance ruth flicked a column of ash into the tray you could put it like that yes i seduced her it didnt take her long to figure out that she loathed and feared sex with men the only difficult thing was overcoming the taboos and learning how to respond to a womans body a womans way of making love and im not talking about dildos and vibrators why did you split up why does anybody split up i think wed done what we could for each other caroline was restless she wanted to go back up north there were no great rows or anything just a mutual agreement and off she went did you know she had a baby yes colms but that was before i met her she told me shed just arrived in london and was lucky enough to meet colm in a pub apparently he was a decent enough bloke just broke all the time some of his mates werent so decent and thats partly what got caroline involved in the game to start with you know just a temporary dancing job at this club no harm in it is there bit of extra cash no questions asked creeps in all fairness i dont think colm knew at least not for a while then she had his baby and they put it up for adoption do you remember the name of the club yes it was the holeinthewall just off greek street dingy looking place this colm banks asked do you know his second name no its funny but come to think of it caroline never used last names when she spoke about people seen him lately me ive never seen him how come you know so much about him because caroline told me about him when we were first getting to know each other where did he live notting hill somewhere or it could have been muswell hill im not sure honestly i cant help you on that one she never was much of a one for details just the broad gesture are you sure caroline wasnt already pregnant when she arrived in london ruth frowned and paused as if she had suddenly remembered something she turned her eyes away and when she spoke there was an odd distant tone to her voice what do you mean im just asking as far as i know she wasnt unless she was lying to me i suppose colm will be able to confirm it if you can find him why did that question upset you so much she put her hand to her chest i dont know what youre talking about youre more defensive than you were earlier ruth shrugged it just reminded me of something thats all reminded you of what ruth reached for her coffee cup but it was empty banks waited he noticed her hand was shaking a little something that was bothering caroline its not important ruth said probably not even true let me decide well it was those dreams shed been having and the things shed been remembering at least she thought she had she didnt really know if they were memories or fantasies what about ruth looked him in the eye her cheeks flushed oh hell she said caroline was beginning to think shed been molested as a child she felt shed repressed the incident but it was making its way back up from her subconscious perhaps because of all the weird johns she was servicing molested when where who by ive told you she wasnt sure she believed it herself do you know shit yes when she was a kid at home by her father one you knew didnt you banks challenged veronica shildon later that evening they were eating in an indonesian restaurant in soho the view out of the window was hardly romantic a peep show offering naked girls in bed for p but the food was excellent and the bar served tiger beer veronica played with her nasi goreng mixing the shrimp in with the rice knew what about carolines past no not the way you think you could have saved me a lot of time and effort veronica shook her head her eyes looked watery on the verge of tears banks couldnt be sure whether it was emotion or the hot chili peppers his own scalp was prickling with the heat and his nose was starting to run he took another swig of cold tiger some things i knew she said finally i knew caroline had been on the streets but i didnt know any of the names or places involved when she talked about ruth she always spoke with affection but she never mentioned her second name or where theyd lived you knew they were lovers though yes but werent you jealous didnt you question caroline about it veronica snorted i had little right to be jealous did i remember where i was coming from caroline told me thered been others she was even living with nancy wood when i first met her and i was with claude you must be very naive mr banks if you think we walked into our relationship like a couple of virgins with no emotional baggage and somehow i dont honestly believe you are naive no matter what the rules are banks said no matter what people try to convince themselves about what they accept and understand about how openminded they are they still cant stop feeling things like jealousy hatred and fear those are powerful primitive emotions instincts if you like and you cant convince me that you were both so bloody civilized you calmly decided not to feel anything about one anothers pasts veronica put down her fork and poured some more beer into her half empty glass quite a speech and not so long ago you were telling me i was too civilized to feel the need to revenge carolines murder perhaps you are but thats another matter can you answer my question yes i didnt feel jealous about ruth dunne for one thing it was years ago and for another from what i could gather shed done caroline a big favour perhaps the same kind of favour caroline later did for me as i said i didnt know all the details but i know the gist and when i talked to ruth this afternoon after youd been to see her i liked her i was glad to think caroline had met and loved someone like her thats my answer believe it or not as you choose or do you think people like us are just so perverted that all we do is rip each others clothes off and jump into bed together banks said nothing he ate a mouthful of pork satay and washed it down with beer attracting the waiters attention he then ordered two more tigers he did believe veronica after all she had felt secure in her relationship with caroline and ruth dunne had certainly posed no threat so why didnt you tell me what you did know about carolines past he asked after the beers had arrived ive already told you i hardly knew anything maybe not but if youd told us what you did know it would have made it easier for us to find out the rest veronica slammed her knife and fork down her cheeks flushed and her eyes narrowed to glaring slits all right damn you so im sorry what more do you want me to say some of the other diners looked around and frowned whispering comments to one another veronica held bankss gaze for a few seconds then picked up her fork again and speared a spicy shrimp far too violently a few grains of rice skipped off the edge of her plate onto the napkin on her knee what i want to know banks said is why you didnt tell me what you knew and whether theres anything else youve been keeping to yourself see its simple really veronica sighed youre an exasperating man she said do you know that banks smiled all right i didnt tell you because i didnt want to to soil carolines memory she wasnt that kind of person any more i couldnt see how it would do any good to drag all that up and let the newspapers get hold of it is that good enough its a start but ill bet theres more to it than that veronica said nothing her mouth was pressed shut so tight the edges of her lips turned white banks went on you didnt want me or anyone else to think you were the kind of woman to be living with someone with such a lurid past am i right youre a bastard is what you are said veronica through gritted teeth what you dont understand is that it takes more than a couple of years of therapy to undo a lifetimes damage christ all the time i keep hearing my mothers voice in my mind calling me dirty calling me perverted maybe youre right and i didnt want that guilt by association but i still dont see what good knowing that does you the reason for carolines murder could lie in her past she was running with a pretty rough crowd i know some of them i worked the vice squad in soho for eighteen months and its not as glamorous as miami vice you can be sure of that drugs prostitution gambling big criminal business very profitable and very dangerous if caroline maintained any kind of involvement with these people it could explain a lot but she didnt veronica insisted pressing her hands together and leaning across the table she didnt i lived with her for two years in all that time we never went to london and she never mentioned much about her life there dont you see it was the future we wanted not the past both of us had had enough of the past banks pushed his empty plate aside asked veronicas permission to smoke and reached for his cigarettes when hed lit one and inhaled he took a sip of beer veronica folded her napkin in a perfect square and laid it on the coral tablecloth beside her plate a small mound of rice dotted with chunks of garlic onion and diced pork remained but the shrimp were all gone banks glanced out the window and watched a punter in a cloth cap and donkey jacket hesitate outside the peep show he was probably having a hard time making up his mind with so much to choose from nude naughty and nasty down the street live erotic nude bed show next door and now naked girls in bed opposite shoving his hands in his pockets he hunched his shoulders and carried on towards leicester square either lost his bottle or come to his senses banks thought veronica had been watching him and when banks turned back to face her she gave him a small smile what were you looking at nothing but you were watching so intently banks shrugged coffee liqueur id love a cointreau if theyve got any theyll have it banks called the waiter he ordered a drambuie for himself what did you see out there veronica asked again i told you it was nothing just a man likely down from the provinces for a soccer match or something he was checking out soho probably surprised it was so cheap what do you get for p brief glance at a naked tart if youre lucky its a loss leader really banks said supposed to give you a taste for the real action you sit in a booth put your coin in the slot and a shutter slides so you can see the girl as soon as your meters up so to speak the shutter closes of course sohos been cleaned up a lot lately but you cant really keep its spirit down already banks noticed his accent and his patterns of speech had reverted to those of his london days he had never lost them in almost three years up north but they had been modified quite a bit now here he was to all intents and purposes a london copper again do you approve veronica asked its not a matter of approval i dont visit the booths or the clubs myself if thats what you mean but would you like to see it all stamped out of existence itd just spring up somewhere else wouldnt it thats what i mean about the spirit every big city has its vice area the red light district in amsterdam the reeperbahn times square the tenderloin the yonge street strip in toronto theyre all much the same except for what local laws do and dont allow prostitution is legal in amsterdam for example and they even have licensed brothels in part of nevada then theres las vegas and atlantic city for gambling you cant really stamp it out for better or for worse it seems to be part of the human condition i admire its energy its vitality but i despise what it does to people i recognize its humour too in my job you get to see the funny side from time to time maybe it actually makes policing easier so much vice concentrated in one small area we can keep closer tabs on it but well never stamp it out i feel so sheltered veronica said looking out the window again i never knew any of this existed when i was growing up even later it never seemed to have anything to do with my life i couldnt even imagine what people did together except for you know she shook her head and now youre wordly wise i dont think so no but after caroline after she brought me to life at least i was able to see what all the fuss was about if thats what it felt like then no wonder everyone went crazy over it do you know that shakespeare sonnet the one that starts the expense of spirit in a waste of shame i never understood it until a couple of years ago its about lust isnt it banks said had having and in quest to have extreme christ he thought im getting just like that dalgliesh fellow ruth dunne mentioned better watch it he nodded towards the window suits that lot out there more than it suits you veronica smiled no you dont know what i mean at last i could understand even lust i could finally understand do you see yes banks lit another cigarette and veronica held the glass of cointreau in her hand about carolines child he said she never told me okay but did she ever make any references to a person called colm no and im sure id remember a name like that she had no contact with anyone you didnt know no mysterious letters or phone calls not that i ever found out about im not saying she couldnt have had she could be very secretive when she wanted what are you getting at banks sighed and swirled his drambuie in its glass i dont know i thought she might have kept in touch with the foster parents adopters whatever surely that would have been too painful for her maybe so forgive me im grasping at straws and he was the child must be about nine or ten now far too young to hunt out his mother and stab her with a kitchen knife for abandoning him or her far too young to see the irony in leaving a requiem for himself on the stereo there is one thing you might be able to help me with though he said yes ruth mentioned that caroline had begun to suspect shed been sexually abused as a child do you know anything about that veronica blushed and turned her face to the window her profile looked stern against the gaudy neon outside and the muscle at the corner of her jaw twitched well i i cant see what its got to do with weve already been through that let me be the judge poor caroline veronica looked directly at banks again and her expression seemed to relax into sadness melancholy was a better word banks decided a good romantic word veronica looked melancholy as she fingered her glass and tilted her head before she spoke i suppose i didnt tell you for the same reason i didnt tell you anything else about her past i didnt think it mattered and it would only look bad now i feel foolish but im not afraid did she talk to you about it yes at first it was like ruth said she had dreams terrible dreams do you know what sexual abuse does to a child mr banks banks nodded jenny fuller the psychologist who occasionally helped with cases had explained it to him once then you know they begin to hate themselves they lose all selfrespect they get depressed they feel suicidal and they often seek reckless selfdestructive ways of life all those things happened to caroline and more is that why she left home yes but shed had to wait a long time to get out till she was sixteen what do you mean when did this start happening when she was eight eight jesus christ go on i take it this is fact not fantasy i cant offer you irrefutable proof especially now carolines dead but you can take my word for it if youre willing as i said at first it was just dreams fears suspicions then when she started working on it with ursula more memories began to surface shed buried the events of course which is perfectly natural under the circumstances just imagine a childs confusion when the father she loves starts to do strange and frightening things with her body and tells her she must never tell anybody or terrible things will happen to her it ties her in knots emotionally it must be good because daddy is doing it perhaps she even enjoys the attention but it doesnt feel good it hurts and why will she go to hell if she ever tells anyone what happened as far as she could piece it together it occurred first when she was eight her mother was having a difficult pregnancy and spent the last two weeks of her term in hospital under close observation something to do with her blood pressure and the possibility of toxaemia caroline was left alone in the big house with her father and he started coming to her bedroom at nights asking her to be a good girl and play with him before long he was having intercrural sex with her its not very clear how far he went she remembered pain but not extreme agony or bleeding obviously he was careful he didnt want anyone to find out what does intercrural mean banks asked ive never heard the word before veronica blushed i suppose it is a bit technical it was ursula who used it first it means between the thighs rather than true penetration banks nodded what happened when the mother came home it continued but with even more caution it didnt stop until she was twelve and had her first period he wasnt interested after that no shed become a woman that terrified him or so ursula reckoned banks drew on his cigarette and looked out at the peep show two swaying teenagers in studded leather jackets stood in the foyer now arguing with the cashier a girl slipped out past them she couldnt have been more than seventeen or eighteen from what banks could see of her pale drawn face in the street light she clutched a short black shiny plastic coat tightly around her skinny frame and held her handbag close to her side she looked hungry cold and tired as far as he could make out she wasnt wearing stockings or tights in fact she looked naked but for the coat which probably meant she was on her way to do the same job in another club nearby after shed stopped off somewhere for her fix gary hartley told dc gay that his sister had always hated him banks said almost to himself he said she even tried to drown him in his bath once when he was a baby apparently she made his life a misery her mothers too gary blamed her for sending his mother to an early grave ive met him myself and hes a very disturbed young man veronica said nothing she had finished her drink and had only the dregs of her coffee left to distract her the waiter sidled up with the bill what id like to know banks said picking it up is did gary know why shed treated him that way right from the start just imagine the psychological effect there he was someone new and strange the root and cause of all her suffering at her fathers hands her mother had deserted her and now when she came back she was more interested in this whining crying little brat than in caroline herself my sister was born when i was six and i clearly remember feeling jealous it must have been countless times worse for caroline after what had happened with her father of course gary couldnt have known at the time not for years perhaps but did she ever tell him that her father had abused her sexually veronica started to speak then stopped herself she glanced at bankss cigarette as if she wanted one finally when she could find nowhere to hide she breathed yes when as soon as she felt certain it was true which was a couple of weeks before she died two banks walked veronica to charing cross road and got her a taxi to holland park where she was staying with her friend after shed gone he paused to breathe the night air and feel the cool needles of rain on his face then went back down old compton street to clubland it was friday night about ten thirty and the punters were already deserting the leicester square boozers for the lure of more drink and a whiff of sex in a seedy alley off greek street notable mostly for the rubbish on its pavements banks found the holeinthewall remarkable it had been there in his days on the vice squad and it was still there looking just the same not many places had such staying power except the old landmarks almost traditions by now like the raymond revue bar he kicked off a sheet of wet newspaper that had stuck to his sole and walked down the steps the narrow entrance on the street was ringed with lowwatt bulbs and photos in a glass display case showed healthy smiling busty young women some in leather some in lacy underwear the sign promised a topless bar and live girls totally nude the place was dim and smoky inside noisy with customers trying to talk above the blaring music it took banks a minute or so to get his bearings during that time a greasyhaired lad with a slothlike manner had relieved him of his admittance fee and indicated in slowmotion that there were any number of seats available banks chose to sit at the bar he ordered a half of lager and tried not to have a heart attack when he heard the price the woman who served him had a nice smile and tired blue eyes her curly blonde hair framed a pale moonshaped face with too much red lipstick and blue eyeshadow her breasts stood firmly and proudly to attention evidence banks was sure of a recent silicone job other waitresses out on the dim floor weaving among the smoky spotlights didnt boast the barmaids dimensions still they came like fruit in all shapes and sizes melons apples pears mangoes and as is the way of all flesh some were slack and some were firm the girls themselves looked blank and only seemed to react if some overeager punter tweaked a nipple strictly against house rules then they would either scold him and walk off in a huff call one of the bouncers or make arrangements for tweaking the other nipple in private later on the stage gyrating and chewing gum at the same time to a song that seemed to be called i want your sex was a young black woman dressed only in a white gstring she looked in good shape strong thighs flat taut stomach and firm breasts perhaps she really wanted to be a dancer some girls on the circuit did when she wasnt dancing like this to earn a living banks thought she was probably working out on a nautilus machine or doing ballet exercises in a pink tutu in a studio in bloomsbury watching the action and thinking his thoughts in the hot and smoky club banks felt a surge of the old excitement the adrenaline it was good to be back to be here where anything could happen most of the time his job was routine but he had to admit to himself that part of its appeal lay in those rare moments out on the edge never far from trouble or danger where you could smell evil getting closer and closer the lager tasted like piss cats piss at that banks shoved it aside and lit a cigarette that helped can i get you anything more sir the barmaid asked he was sitting and she was standing which somehow put her exquisitely manufactured breasts at bankss eye level he shifted his gaze from the goosebumps around her chocolatecoloured nipples to her eyes he felt his cheek burn and if he cared to admit it more than just that no he said his mouth dry i havent finished this one yet she smiled her teeth were good i know but people often dont they tell me it tastes like cats piss and ask for a real drink how much does a real drink cost she told him forget it im here on business tuffy in her eyes narrowed who are you you aint law are you banks shook his head not down here no just tell him mr banks wants to see him will you love banks watched her pick up a phone at the back of the bar it took no more than a few seconds he said to go through she seemed surprised by the instruction and looked at banks in a new light clearly anyone who got in to see the boss that easily had to be a somebody its down past the i know where it is love banks slid off the bar stool and threaded his way past tables of drooling punters to the fire door at the back of the club beyond the door was a brightly lit corridor and at the end was an office door in front stood two giants banks didnt recognize either of them turnover in hired muscle was about as fast as that in young female flesh both looked in their late twenties and both had clearly boxed judging by the state of their noses neither had won many bouts still they could make mincemeat of banks with their hands tied behind their backs unless his speed and slipperiness gave him an edge he felt a tremor of fear as he neared them but nothing happened they stood back like hotel doormen and opened the door for him one smiled and showed the empty spaces of his failed vocation in the office with its scratched desk threadbare carpet telephone pinups on the wall and institutional green filing cabinets sat tuffy telfer himself about sixty now he was fat bald and rubicund with a birthmark the shape of a teardrop at one side of his fleshy red nose his eyes were hooded and wary lizardlike and they were the one feature that didnt seem to fit the rest of him they looked more as if they belonged to some sexy hollywood star of the forties or fifties victor mature perhaps or leslie howard rather than an ugly ageing gangster tuffy was one of the few remaining oldfashioned british gangsters he had worked his way up from vandalism and burglary as a juvenile through fencing refitting stolen cars and pimping to get to the dizzy heights he occupied today the only good things banks knew about him were that he loved his wife a peroxide exstripper called mirabelle and that he never had anything to do with drugs as a pimp he had been one of the few not to get his girls hooked still it was no reason to get sentimental over the bastard hed had one of his girls splashed with acid for trying to turn him in though nobody could prove it and there were plenty of women old before their time thanks to tuffy telfer banks had been the bane of his existence for about three months many years ago the evil old sod hadnt been able to make a move without banks getting there first the police had never got enough evidence to arrest tuffy himself though banks had managed to put one or two of his minions away for long stretches well well well said tuffy in the eastend accent he usually put on for the punters he had actually been raised by a meek middleclass family in wood green but few people other than the police knew that if it aint inspector banks chief inspector now tuffy i always thought youd go far son sit down sit down a drink the only classy piece of furniture in the entire room was a wellstocked cocktail cabinet a real drink wha oh i get it telfer laughed been sampling the lager downstairs eh yeah a real drink ill have a scotch then mind if i smoke telfer laughed again go ahead cant indulge no more myself he tapped his chest quack says its bad for the ticker but ill get enough secondhand smoke running this place to see me to my grave a bit more wont do any harm tuffy was hamming it up as usual he didnt have to be here to run the holeinthewall he had underlings who could do that for him nor was he so poor he had to sit in such a poky office night after night the club was just a minor outpost of tuffys empire and nobody not even vice knew where all its colonies were he had a house in belgravia and owned property all over the city he also mixed with the rich and famous but every friday and saturday night he chose to come and sit here just like in the old days to run his club it was part of his image part of the sentimentality of organized crime making ends meet banks asked just times is hard very hard one of the musclemen put bankss drink a generous helping on the desk in front of him but what can i say tuffy went on i get by what you been up to moved up north yorkshire tuffy raised his eyebrows bit drastic init i like it fine whatever suits not having a glass yourself tuffy sniffed doctors orders im a sick man mr banks old tuffys not long for this world and therell not be many to mourn his passing i can tell you that except for the nearest and dearest bless her heart how is mirabelle shes hale and hearty thank you for asking mr banks remembers you fondly does my mirabelle wish i could say the same myself there was humour in his voice but hardness in his hooded eyes banks heard one of the bruisers shift from foot to foot behind him and a shiver went up his spine what can i do you for tuffy asked information tuffy said nothing just sat staring banks sipped some scotch and cast around for an ashtray suddenly one appeared from behind his shoulder as if by magic he set it in front of him a few years ago you had a dancer working the club name of caroline hartley remember her what if i do telfers expression betrayed no emotion shes dead murdered whats it got to do with me you tell me tuffy telfer stared at banks for a moment then laughed know how many girls we get passing through here he said a fair number ill bet a fair number indeed these punters are constantly demanding fresh meat see the same dancer twice they think theyve been had and youre talking how many years ago six or seven telfer rested his pale pudgy hands on the blotter well you can see my point then cant you what about your records records what you talking about banks nodded towards the filing cabinets you must keep clear and accurate records tuffy cash flow wages rent bar take for the taxman remember telfer cleared his throat yeah well what if i do you could look her up come on tuffy weve been through all this before years ago i know you keep a few notes on every girl who passes through here in case you might want to use her again maybe for a video a stag party some special telfer held up a hand all right all right i get your drift its all aboveboard you know that cedric see if you can find the file will you one of the bruisers opened a filing cabinet cedric banks whispered eyebrows raised telfer shrugged his chins wobbled they sat silently telfer tapping his short fat fingers on the desk while cedric rummaged through the files muttering the alphabet to himself as he did so aint here cedric announced finally you sure telfer asked it begins with a aitch hartley that comes after gee and before eye cedric grunted aint here got a carrie eart but no caroline artley lets have a look banks said she might have used a stage name telfer nodded and cedric handed over the file pinned to the topleft corner was a four by five black and white picture of a younger caroline hartley topless and smiling her small breasts pushed together by her arms she could easily have passed for a fourteenyearold even a mature twelveyearold below the photo in telfers surprisingly neat and elegant hand were the meagre details that had interested him about caroline hartley vital statistics colour of hair jetblack eyes blue skin olive and satiny banks hadnt suspected tuffy had such a poetic streak and so it went on telfer obviously gave his applicants quite an interview the one piece of information that banks hoped he might find was at the end an address under her real name caroline hartley co colm grey it was old now of course and might no longer be of any use but if it was colm greys address and he was poor he might well have hung on to his flat unless hed left the city altogether also now banks had his last name colm grey would be easier to track down he recognized the street name it was somewhere between notting hill and westbourne park he had lived not far from there himself twenty years ago got what you want asked telfer maybe banks handed the file back to cedric who replaced it then finished his scotch well then said tuffy with a smile nice of you to drop in but you mustnt let me keep you he stood up and shook hands his grip was firm but his palm was sweaty not staying long are you around here i mean banks smiled no not thinking of coming back to stay no good good just wanted to be sure well do pop in again the next time youre down wont you and well have another good old natter sure tuffy and give my love to mirabelle i will i will mr banks the bruisers stood aside and banks walked out of the office and down the corridor unscathed when he got back to the noisy smoky club he breathed a sigh of relief tuffy obviously remembered what a pain in the arse hed been but working on the edge of the law as he did he had to play it careful true plenty of his operations were aboveboard it was a game give and take live and let live and both sides knew it banks had come close to breaking the rules once or twice and tuffy wanted to be sure he wouldnt be around to do that again questions that sounded like friendly curiosity were often in fact thinly veiled threats another drink dear the mammarially magnificent barmaid said as banks passed by no love sorry have to be off now maybe another time story of my life she said and her breasts swung as she turned away outside banks fastened his overcoat shoved his hands deep in his pockets and walked along greek street towards tottenham court road tube station he had thought of taking a taxi but it was only midnight and barney lived a stones throw from the central line at soho square he saw a drunk in a tweed overcoat and trilby vomiting in the gutter a tart inadequately dressed for the cold stood behind him and leaned against the wall arms folded across her chest looking disgusted how did that poem end banks wondered the one veronica had quoted earlier that evening then he remembered after its haunting summary of the horrors of lust it finished all this world well knows yet none knows well to shun the heaven that leads men to this hell certainly knew his stuff did old willie they didnt call him the bard for nothing banks reflected as he turned up sutton row towards the bright lights of charing cross road three the next morning after a chat with barney over bacon and eggs banks set out to find colm grey he had arranged to have lunch with veronica and had asked barney to check ruth dunnes alibi and to see what he could find on the stabbing of carolines pimp reggie just to cover all the angles the rushhour crowd had dwindled by the time he got a train and he was even able to grab a seat and read the guardian the way he used to he got off at westbourne park and walked towards notting hill until he found the address on st lukes road five names matched the bells beside the front door and he was in luck c grey was one of them flat four banks pushed the bell and stood by the intercom no response he tried again and waited a couple of minutes it looked like grey was out the way things stood at the moment grey was hardly a prime suspect but he was a loose end that had to be tied up he was the only one who knew the full story about caroline hartleys child just as banks started to walk away he thought he heard a movement behind the door sure enough it opened and a young man stood there hair standing on end eyes bleary stuffing a white shirt in the waist of his jeans he frowned when he saw banks wharrisit what time is it half past nine sorry to disturb you banks introduced himself and showed his identification its about caroline hartley the name didnt register at first then grey suddenly gaped and said bloody hell youd better come in banks followed him upstairs to a tworoom flat best described as cosy the furniture needed reupholstering and the place needed dusting and a damn good tidying up i was sleeping grey said as he bent to turn on the gas fire excuse me a minute when he came back he had washed his face and combed his hair and he carried a cup of instant coffee want some he asked banks no this shouldnt take long mind if i smoke be my guest grey sat opposite him leaning forward as if hunched over his steaming coffee cup he was lanky with a long pale face pitted from ancient acne or chickenpox he needed a shave and a trim and his slightly protruding eyes were watery blue is it bad news he asked as if he were used to life being one long round of bad news you mean you dont know obviously or i wouldnt be asking well banks took a deep breath he had assumed grey would have read about the murder in the papers caroline hartley was murdered in eastvale on december the twentysecond he said finally at first grey didnt seem to react he couldnt have been much paler so losing colour would have been no indication and his eyes were already watery enough to look like they were on the verge on tears all he did was sit silent and still for about a minute completely still and so silent banks wondered if he were even breathing banks tried to imagine grey and caroline hartley as a couple but he couldnt are you all right he asked can i have one grey indicated the cigarettes supposed to have chucked it in but banks gave him a cigarette which he lit and puffed on like a dying man on oxygen i dont suppose this is a social call either he said banks shook his head grey sighed i havent seen caroline for about eight years ever since she started running with the wrong crowd tuffy telfer thats the bastard just like a father to her he was to hear her speak banks hoped not did you ever meet him no i wouldnt have trusted myself with him for ten seconds id have swung for the bastard not a chance banks thought colm grey couldnt have got within a hundred yards of tuffy telfer without getting at least both arms and legs broken what caused you and caroline to split up he asked just about everything grey flicked some ash onto the hearth by the fire and reached for his coffee again i suppose it really started going downhill when she got pregnant what happened did you try to give her the push grey stared at banks couldnt be further from it we were in love i was anyway when she got pregnant she just turned crazy i wanted to have it the kid even though we were poor and she didnt want rid of it at first at least i dont think she did maybe i pushed her too hard i dont know maybe she was just doing it to please me anyway she was miserable all the time she was carrying but she wouldnt have an abortion either there was time if shed wanted but she kept putting it off until it was too late then she was up and down like a yoyo one day wishing she could have a miscarriage taking risks walking out in icy weather maybe hoping shed just slip and fall the next day feeling guilty and hating herself for being so cruel then as soon as the child was born she couldnt wait to get shot of the blighter where is the child now no idea caroline never even wanted to see it as soon as it was born it was whisked off to its new parents she didnt even want to know whether it was a girl or a boy then things started getting worse for us fast caroline worked at getting her figure back like nothing had ever happened as soon as she got introduced to telfers crowd that was it she seemed hellbent on selfdestruction dont ask me why who introduced her to telfer colm bit his lower lip then said i blamed myself after i found out you know what its like a man doesnt always choose his friends well the crowd we went about with caroline and me it was a pretty mixed bunch some of them liked to go up west on a weekend and do the clubs we went along too a few times caroline seemed fascinated by it all or horrified i never could make out which she was well into the scene before i even found out and there was nothing i could do to stop her she was a goodlooking kid a real beauty and she must have caught someones eye i should think theyre always on the look out for new talent at those places one night she came home really late i was beside myself with worry and it came out as anger you know like when your mother always yelled at you if you were late we had a blazing row and i called her all the names under the sun it was then she told me in detail and she rubbed my face in it laughed at me for not catching on sooner where did i think her new clothes were coming from how did i think we could afford to go out so often i was humiliated i should have walked out there and then but i was a fool maybe it was just a wild phase maybe it would go away thats what i tried to convince myself but it didnt go away the trouble was i still loved her colm rested his chin in his hand and stared at the floor a couple of months later we split up she left just walked out one evening and never came back didnt even take her belongings with her what little she had he smiled sadly never much of a one for possessions wasnt caroline said they only tied her down had you been fighting all that time no there was only the one big row then everything was sort of cold i was trying to accept what she was up to but i couldnt it just wasnt working with her coming in at all hours or not at all and me knowing what shed been up to imagining her in bed with fat greasy punters and dancing naked in front of slobbering businessmen where did she go dunno never saw or heard from her again she was a great kid and i loved her but i couldnt stand it i was heading for a breakdown she was living life in the fast lane heading for selfdestruct i tried to stop her but she just laughed at me and told me not to be such a bore did she ever tell you anything about her past not a lot no didnt get on with her mum and dad so she ran off to the big city usual story ever mention her brother no didnt know she had one did she ever tell you about her dreams dreams he frowned no why it doesnt matter what about you what did you do after shed gone me well i didnt exactly join the foreign legion but i did run away and try to forget i sublet the flat for a year and drifted around europe france mostly grape picking and all that came back got a job as a bicycle courier and now im doing the knowledge nearly there too with a bit of luck ill get out and have my bill and badge inside a year good luck banks had heard how difficult it was riding around on a moped day after day in the traffic fumes memorizing over eighteen thousand street names and the numerous permutations of routes between them but that was what one had to do to qualify as a london taxi driver did you forget her he asked you never do do you really what did she do after she left me do you know banks gave him a potted history of carolines life up to her death and again grey sat still after hed finished she always was funny about sex he said not that id have guessed like that she was a lezzie ive nothing against them live and let live i say but sex always seemed like some kind of trial or test with her you know as if she was trying to find out whether she really liked it or not i suppose not liking it made it easier for her to live on the game in a way it was just a job she didnt have to like it banks nodded it was common knowledge that a lot of prostitutes were lesbians there was nothing more to say he stood up and held out his hand grey leaned forward and shook it were you working on the twentysecond banks asked grey smiled my alibi yes yes i was you can check and ive got to get started today too when youre doing the knowledge you eat breathe and sleep it i know besides i dont even know where eastvale is on his way out banks offered grey another cigarette but he declined it didnt taste all that good and i couldnt justify starting again thanks for telling me you know about her life at least someone seemed to make her happy she deserved that he shook his head she was just one fuckedup kid when i knew her we never had a chance outside banks turned up his collar and walked through the squares and side streets towards notting hill gate this area had been his first home in london when he had come as a student back then the tall houses with their white facades had been in poor repair and small flats were just about affordable banks had paid seven pounds a week for an lshaped room with free mice in a house that included one out of work jazz trumpeter an earnest social worker a morose and anorexiclooking woman on the second floor who wore beads and a kaftan and never spoke to anyone and jimmy the cheerful and charming bus driver who banks suspected of selling marijuana on the side he passed the house on powis terrace and felt a twinge of nostalgia that small room now with lace curtains in the window was where he and sandra had first made love in those carefree days when he had been unhappy with his business studies courses but still hadnt quite known what to do with his life back then the area had been very much a swinging sixties enclave with its requisite mixture of musicians poets artists dopers revolutionaries and general dropouts it had suited banks at the time he enjoyed the music the animated discussions and the aura of spontaneity but he could never wholeheartedly turn on tune in and drop out he had wanted to get away from home from the dull routine of peterborough and the notting hill flat had been both a cheap and exciting way of finding out what life was all about ah to be eighteen again he walked up to the main intersection and took the underground at notting hill gate he was on the central line and he still had some time to kill so he got off at tottenham court road in the same general area hed been in the previous evening he was feeling vaguely depressed after his talk with colm grey which had reduced a couple of his favourite theories to shreds and thought a city walk in the bracing air might help blow away the blues soho was another world in the daytime the clubs and love shops and peep shows were still there but somehow the glitz and sleaze only managed to look anaemic in daylight the gaudy lights held no allure they were washed out paled by even the grey winter light in the daytime the sirensong of sex for hire was muted to a distant nagging whine there was no hiding the cheap shabby reality of the product but another kind of vital street life took the ascendant the world of markets of business banks wandered among the stalls on berwick street which seemed to sell everything from pineapples and melons to cotton panties cups and saucers watches mixed nuts and egg cutters under one stall a big brown dog lay sheltered watching the passersby with mournful eyes feeling better he found a phone booth on great marlborough street and called barney merritt at scotland yard as banks had expected and hoped ruth dunnes alibi checked out the stabbing of reggie becker was also as clear cut as could be the killer a seventeenyearold prostitute called brenda meers had stabbed becker five times in broad daylight on greek street at least two of the wounds had nicked major arteries and he had bled to death before the ambulance got there eyewitnesses abounded though fewer came forward later than were present at the time when asked why she had done it brenda meers said it was because reggie was trying to make her go with a man who wanted her to drink his urine and eat his faeces she had been with him before and didnt think she could stand it again she had begged reggie all morning not to make her go but he wouldnt relent so she walked into woolworths bought a cheap sheath knife and stabbed him as far as the police were concerned reggie becker was no great loss and brenda would at least get the benefit of psychiatric counselling so that was that the london connection ruled out but maybe he hadnt wasted his time entirely he now had a much fuller picture of caroline hartley even if he did have to throw out that neat theory of a connection between the vivaldi laudate pueri and the child she had given birth to he still believed the music was important but he could no longer tell how or where it fit he looked at his watch just time to buy sandra and tracy presents in libertys and maybe something for brian from virgin records on oxford street then it would be time to meet veronica for lunch and set off he wondered what if any developments would be waiting for him back in eastvale one you dont think he did it do you susan gay asked banks over coffee and toasted teacakes in the golden grill it was two largely frustrating days after his return from london gary hartley banks shrugged i dont know i dont suppose it makes much sense gary finds out caroline was abused as a child so he kills her all i know is that she told him about it a couple of weeks before she was killed but youre right weve no real motive at all on the other hand she did make his life a misery then she ran off and left him stuck with the old man a thing like that can fester into hatred the timing is interesting too does he know anything about classical music well have to find out hes certainly well read look at all those books around the place and the way he speaks his vocabulary hes way beyond the range of most teenagers he could easily have come across the information about laudate pueri somewhere then seen the record at carolines so youre going to see him yes and id like you to come along if you can spare the time anything happening with the breakins nothing that cant wait good remember garys lied to us before i want to see the old man too who knows we might be able to get something out of him he was pretty useless last time susan said im not convinced hes all there she shivered cold she shook her head just the thought of that house i know what you mean let phil know will you i want the three of us in on this ill be with the super filling him in banks looked at his watch say half an hour susan nodded and left thirty minutes later they sat in an unmarked police rover with susan at the wheel and banks hunched rather glumly in the back missing his music sandra was using the cortina to buy photographic supplies in york so they had had to sign a car out of the pool susans driving was assured though not as good as richmonds banks noted sergeant hatchley had been the worst he remembered a bloody maniac on the road despite more snow road conditions were clear enough it was in fact much brighter in the north for once than it had been in london and a weak winter sun shone on the distant snowcovered fells spreading a pastel coral glow in under an hour they pulled into the familiar harrogate street and rang hartleys doorbell as expected gary answered giving nothing but a you again look he wandered back into the front room leaving them to follow the room hadnt been cleaned or tidied since their last visit and a few more beer cans and tab ends had joined the wreckage on the hearth the air smelled stale like a pub after closing time banks longed to open the window to let in some air before he could get there richmond beat him to it yanking back the heavy curtains and raising the window gary squinted at the burst of sunlight but said nothing weve got a few more questions to ask you banks said but first id like a word with your father you cant hes sick hes resting gary gripped the chair arm and sat up he reached for a cigarette and lit it doctors orders im sorry gary i already know most of it i just need him to fill me in on a few details what do you know what are you talking about caroline your father gary sagged back into his chair oh god he whispered you know yes then you can hardly imagine hes going to tell you anything can you hes asleep anyway practically in a bloody coma banks stood up stay with him will you phil susan come with me susan followed banks upstairs they both heard gary cry no as they went this way sir susan pointed to mr hartleys door and banks pushed it open if only gary had turned off the electric fire banks thought later the smell wouldnt have been so bad as it was susan put her hand over nose and mouth and staggered back while banks reached for a handkerchief neither advanced any further into the room the old man lay back on his pillows emaciated almost beyond recognition judging by the reddish discolouration of the veins in his scrawny neck banks guessed he had been dead at least two days it would take an expert to fix the time more exactly than that though as there were many factors to take into consideration not least among them his age the state of his health and the warm temperature of the room call the local cid banks told susan and tell them to arrange for a police surgeon and a sceneofcrime team you know the drill susan hurried downstairs and went to phone while banks gently closed the door and returned to the front room gary looked at him as he entered the boy seemed drained of all emotion tired beyond belief banks motioned for richmond to stand by the window where gary couldnt see him then sat down close to gary and leaned forward want to tell me about it son he asked whats to tell gary lit a new cigarette from the stub of his old one his long fingers were stained yellow with nicotine around the nails you know banks pointed at the ceiling what happened gary shrugged is he dead yes i told you he was sick how did he die gary he had cancer how long has he been dead how should i know why didnt you call a doctor no point was there when did you last look in on him take him some food gary sucked on his cigarette and looked away into the cold hearth littered with butts and empty beer cans sweat formed on his pale brow when did you last go up and see him gary banks asked again i dont know yesterday the day before i dont know im no expert gary but id say you havent been up there for at least three days have you if you say so did you kill him he was sick getting worse but did you kill him i never touched him if thats what you mean never laid a finger on the old bastard i couldnt bear banks noticed the boy was crying he had turned his head aside but it was shaking and strange snuffling sounds came from between the fingers he had placed over his mouth and nose you deserted him you left him up there to die is that what you did banks couldnt be sure but he thought gary was nodding why for gods sake why you know he said wiping his nose with the back of his hand and turning to face banks angrily you told me you know all about it what he did for what he did to caroline you know it is what about caroline did you kill her too why should i do that im asking she tried to kill you once did you gary sighed and tossed his halfsmoked cigarette into the grate i suppose so he said wearily i dont know i think he did but maybe we all did maybe this miserable bloody family killed her two by midafternoon the sun had disappeared behind smokecoloured clouds and banks had turned his desk lamp on they sat in his office banks gary hartley and susan gay taking notes and waiting for a pot of coffee before getting started on the interrogation gary sitting in a hardbacked chair opposite banks looked frightened now he wasnt fidgeting or squirming but his eyes were filled with a kind of resigned mournful fear banks still not completely sure what had gone on in that large cold house wanted him to relax and talk fresh hot coffee might help while he waited banks glanced over the brief notes the forensic pathologist had made after his preliminary investigation of the scene hed estimated time of death at not less than two days and not more than three for three days then perhaps since shortly after bankss and richmonds visit the poor frightened kid in front of them had sat in the cold ruin of a room smoking and drinking knowing the corpse of his father lay rotting upstairs in the heat of an electric fire the doctor hadnt called he had no reason to as long as mr hartley had a full prescription of pain killers and someone to take care of his basic needs rigor mortis disappeared greenish discolouration of the abdomen the report read reddish veins in neck shoulders and thighs no marbling as yet the temperature would have speeded the process of decomposition considerably banks realized also the air was dry and some degree of mummification might have occurred if the old man had lain there much longer banks suspected that cause of death was starvation gary had simply left him to die but it would be a while before more exact information about cause and time could be known older persons decompose more slowly than younger ones and thin ones more slowly than fat ones bodies of diseased persons break down quickly stomach contents would have to be examined and inner organs checked for the degree of putrefaction all very interesting banks thought but none of it really mattered if gary hartley confessed finally pc tolliver arrived with the coffee and styrofoam cups susan poured gary a cup and pushed the milk and sugar towards him he didnt acknowledge her banks walked over to the window and glanced out at the grey market square then sat down to begin he spoke quietly intimately almost to put the boy at ease earlier gary you seemed confused you said you supposed that you had killed caroline then you told me you think your father killed her can you be a bit clearer about that im not sure i i why not tell me about it the night you killed her start at the beginning i dont remember try its important gary screwed up his eyes in concentration but when he opened them he shook his head its all dark all dark inside and it hurts where does it hurt gary my head my eyes everywhere he covered his face with his hands and shuddered banks let a few seconds pass then asked how did you get to eastvale what to eastvale did you go by bus or train did you borrow a car gary shook his head i didnt go to eastvale i wasnt in eastvale then how did you kill caroline ive told you i dont know he hung his head in his hands i just dont know what happened to your father gary hes dead how did he die did you kill him no i didnt go near him did you stop going up to his room did you stop feeding him i couldnt go not after caroline not after i knew i thought about it and i carried on for a while but i couldnt he looked at banks his eyes pleading you must understand i couldnt not after she was dead so you stopped tending to him he killed her but he couldnt have gary he was an invalid bedridden he couldnt have gone to eastvale and killed her suddenly gary banged the metal desk with his fist susan moved forward but banks motioned her back ive told you it wasnt in eastvale gary yelled how many times do i have to tell you caroline didnt die in eastvale but she did gary come on you know that he shook his head he killed her and i killed her too susan looked up from her notes and frowned tell me how he killed her banks asked i dont know i wasnt there but he did it like like oh christ she was just a child just a little child and he put his head in his hands and sobbed shaking all over banks stood up and put a comforting arm over his shoulder at first gary didnt react but then he yielded and buried his head in bankss chest banks held on to him tightly and stroked his hair then when garys grasp loosened he extricated himself and returned to his chair now he thought he understood why gary was talking the way he was now he knew what had happened now he understood the hartley family but he still had no idea who had killed caroline hartley and why three when susan gay got to the crooked billet at six oclock james conran wasnt there casting around for a suitable place to sit she caught the eye of marcia cunningham the costumes manager who beckoned her over marcia seemed to be sitting with someone but a group of drinkers blocked susans view susan elbowed her way through the afterwork crowd loosening her overcoat as she went it was cold outside and enough snow had fallen to speckle her shoulders but in the pub it was warm she took off her green woolly gloves and slipped them in her pocket then when she reached marcia removed her coat and hung it on a peg by the bar she noted that the buttons of the pink cardigan marcia was wearing were incorrectly fastened making the thing look askew theyve not finished yet marcia said what with it being so close to first night or should i say twelfth night james thought an extra half hour might be in order especially with the new maria they didnt need me so he asked me to pass on his apologies if i saw you hell be in a little later thank you susan smoothed her skirt and sat down how rude of me marcia said indicating the woman beside her susan gay this is sandra banks then she put her hand to her mouth silly me im forgetting you probably know each other already susan certainly recognized sandra with her looks she would be hard to miss that determined mouth lively blue eyes long blonde hair and dark eyebrows she possessed a natural elegance susan had always envied her and felt awkward and dowdy when she was around yes susan said weve met once or twice good evening mrs banks please call me sandra sandra was just finishing up some work in the gallery so i popped in and asked if shed like a drink susan noticed that their glasses were empty and offered to get a round when she came back there was still no sign of james or the others she didnt know how she was going to maintain small talk with sandra banks for the next twenty minutes or so especially after the emotional scene she had just witnessed between banks and gary hartley she felt embarrassed strong emotion always made her feel that way and when banks had hugged the boy close she had had to avert her gaze but she had seen her bosss expression over the back of the boys head it hadnt given much away but she had noticed compassion in his eyes and she knew from the set of his lips that he shared the boys pain luckily marcia saved her in appearance rather like one of those plump ruddycheeked characters one sees in illustrations of dickens novels she had an ebullient manner to match any closer to catching those vandals she asked conscious of sandra watching her susan said not yet im afraid a couple of kids did some damage to a youth club in the north end and we think its the same ones weve got our eye on them do you think youll ever catch them susan caught sandra smiling at the question and could hardly keep herself from doing the same her discomfort waned slightly instead of feeling resentful under scrutiny she was beginning to feel more as if she had an ally sandra had been through it all knew what it was like to be police in the public eye but susan knew she would still have to be cautious sandra was after all the detective chief inspectors wife and if susan made any blunders they would certainly be passed on to banks hard to say she replied weve got a couple of leads and several likely candidates thats about all what she hadnt said was that they had at least found a pattern to the kind of places the kids liked to wreck most of them were community centres of some kind never private establishments like cinemas or pubs as there was a limited number of such social clubs in eastvale extra men had been posted on guard their instructions were to lie low blend in and catch the kids in the act rather than stand as sentries and scare them off soon they might put a stop to the trail of vandalism that had cost the town a fortune over the past few months it was such a mess marcia said shaking her head all those costumes ruined i almost sat down and cried anyway i took them home and now ive a bit of time im sorting through the remnants to see if i cant resurrect some ive put a couple together already i hate waste that sounds a hell of a job said sandra i dont think i could face it oh i love sewing fixing things making things it makes me feel useful and i see what ive done at the end job satisfaction i suppose though its a pity theres no pay to match sandra laughed id offer to help but ive got two left thumbs when it comes to sewing i cant even get the bloody thread through the needle poor alan has to sew his own buttons on susan tried to imagine detective chief inspector alan banks sewing buttons on a shirt but she couldnt its all right marcia said keeps me out of mischief these cold winter evenings since franks been gone i find i need to do more and more to occupy myself marcias husband died six months ago sandra explained to susan aye said marcia just like that he went good as new one moment then bang curtains and never had a days illness in his life didnt drink and gave up his pipe years ago only sixty he was susan shook her head it does seem unfair whoever told us life would be fair love nobody did thats who anyway enough of that walking out with mr conran are you susan felt herself blushing well i i i know marcia went on its none of my business tell me to shut up if you want im just an old busybody thats all now susan couldnt help laughing weve been out to dinner a couple of times and to the pictures thats all marcia nodded i wasnt probing into your sex life lass just curious thats all whats he like when hes out of his directors hat he makes me laugh theres a few in that theatre over there could do with a laugh or two susan leaned forward marcia you know that girl who was killed caroline hartley was there really anything between her and james not that i know of love marcia answered just larked around thats all besides she was one of them wasnt she not that i well you know what i mean yes but james didnt know that none of you did still marcia insisted nothing to it as far as i could see oh he had his eye on her all right what man wouldnt maybe not your playboy material but dangerous as dynamite nonetheless what makes you say that sandra chipped in i dont really know maybe its hindsight i just get feelings about people sometimes and i knew from the start that one was trouble still it looks as if she meant trouble for herself mostly doesnt it is james conran a suspect sandra asked your husband seems to think so susan said but everyone who had anything to do with caroline hartley is a suspect arent you worried about getting involved with him sandra asked a bit i suppose i mean not that i think james is guilty of anything just that being involved might blur my objectivity its an awkward position to be in thats all besides she laughed hes my old teacher it feels strange to be having dinner with him i like him but im keeping him at arms length at least until this business is over good for you sandra said anyway i dont see as it should matter the chief inspector went off to london with veronica shildon and id say shes a prime suspect susan realized too late what she had implied and wondered if an attempt to backtrack and make her meaning clear would only make things worse all sandra said was im sure alan knows what hes doing and susan could have sworn she noticed a ghost of a smile on her face i know im sorry i didnt meant to imply just its all right sandra said i just wanted to point out that what hes doing isnt the same im not criticizing you i dont suppose i understand his methods yet im not sure i do either sandra laughed suddenly susans world turned pitch black she felt a light pressure on her brow and cheeks and she could no longer see sandra and marcia the bustling pub seemed to fall silent then a voice whispered in her ear guess who james she said and her vision was restored four banks felt unusually tired when he got home about eight oclock that evening the paperwork was done and gary hartley had been sent back to harrogate to face whatever charges could be made sandra had just got home herself and both children were out over a dinner of leftover chicken casserole sandra told him about her evening with susan and marcia in turn banks tried to explain gary hartley to her hed always hated caroline all his life she was the bane of his existence she used to tease him torment him torture him and he never had any idea why she even tried to drown him once to cap it all she left home and he got lumbered with looking after his invalid father who made it perfectly clear that he still preferred caroline when you look at it like that its not a bad motive for murder wouldnt you say did he do it sandra asked banks shook his head no not literally when she told him what had happened when her mother had been in hospital having him he suddenly realized why she hated him she wanted to apologize make up even if she could but garys sensitive its not something you can really work out in your mind christ most people dont even talk about it and caroline had blanked out the memory for years it was always there though under the surface shoving and cracking the crust gary just reacted emotionally he was overwhelmed by what she said and suddenly his whole world was turned upsidedown all his anger had been pointed in the wrong direction at her for so long he killed his father he sat in his room downstairs and let the old man starve to death sandra shivered good god she was right to be so appalled banks thought it was an act of utmost cruelty the kind for which a public ignorant of the facts might demand a return of the noose but still he couldnt forget garys pain and confusion he couldnt help but feel pity for the boy no matter what atrocity he had committed he gave sandra the gist of their discussion i can see what he meant when he said her father had killed her she said but why implicate himself too you said he didnt do it but he blamed himself for being born if you like after all thats when it started thats when caroline was left alone with her father he couldnt give us any concrete details of the crime because he hadnt done it but in his mind he was responsible all he could say was that it was all dark to him dark and painful i dont understand sandra said frowning i think he was describing being born banks said dark dark and painful my god and you said caroline tried to drown him too yes he was about four and she was twelve he cant remember the details clearly of course and theres no one else alive to tell what happened but he thinks his mother left him for a moment to fetch some clean towels she left the bathroom door open and caroline walked in he said he remembers how she pulled his feet and his head went under the water the next thing he knew he was up again in his mothers arms gasping for air and caroline was gone nobody ever spoke about it afterwards he must have been terrified of her he was and he didnt know why she was treating him that way she didnt know either he turned in on himself to shut it all out is he insane sandra asked not for me to say hes in need of help certainly just imagine the hatred of all those years boiling over finding its true object at last all the humiliation his own life ruined knowing he was only secondbest to his sister the only wonder is he didnt do it sooner it took carolines murder and the truth about her childhood to set him free banks remembered the slouching figure that had shuffled out of his office after telling everything he would be under care in harrogate now perhaps going through the whole story again at the hands of less sympathetic interrogators after all look at what hed done but gary hartley wouldnt be hanged he wouldnt even be sent to jail he would first be bound over for psychiatric evaluation then he might well spend a good part of his life in mental institutions which was better it was impossible for banks to decide garys life was blighted just as his sisters had been though unlike caroline gary hadnt even managed to snatch his few moments of happiness then who did kill caroline hartley sandra asked banks scratched his head im buggered if i know im pretty sure we can rule out gary now and her friends in london when caroline moved on she always seemed to burn her bridges which leaves well unless were dealing with a psycho were back to the locals ivers and his girlfriend arent homefree yet whatever they told us they lied to us at the start and patsy janowski has a good motive for corroborating everything ivers might claim she loves the man and wants to hang on to him and then theres the amateur crowd ive been intending to have another talk with teresa podmore and veronica shildon sandra asked susan gay seems to think youve been overlooking her susans prejudiced are you sure youre not banks stared at her dont you know me better than that just asking he shook his head officially shes a suspect of course but veronica shildon didnt do it i must be overlooking something any idea what banks brought his fist up slowly to his temple damned if i know then he stood up hell its been a rough day im having a stiff scotch then im off to bed he poured the drink and went into the hall to his jacket when he came back he said and im having a bloody cigarette as well house rule or no house rule one the wind numbed banks to the marrow when he got out of his car near the lobster inn the following afternoon it was january only three days to twelfth night the sky was a pale eggshell blue with a few wispy grey clouds twisting over the horizon like strips of gauze but the sun had no warmth in it the wind kicked up little white caps as it danced over the ruffled water and slid up the rough sea wall right onto the front banks dashed into the pub there already ensconced in front of the meagre fire sat detective sergeant jim hatchley pint in one hamlike hand and a huge foulsmelling cigar smouldering between two sausageshaped fingers of the other banks thought he had put on weight his bulk seemed to loom larger than ever the sergeant shifted in his seat when banks came over and sat opposite him miserable old bugger saves all his coal till evening he said by way of greeting gesturing over at the landlord who sat on a high stool behind the bar reading a tabloid bigger crowd then you see banks nodded hows married life treating you cant complain shes a good lass i could do without being at the bloody seaside in winter though plays havoc with my rheumatism didnt know you had it nor did i never mind just wait till spring youll be the envy of us all then everyone will want to come and visit you on their weekends off aye maybe well have to see about renting out the spare room for bed and breakfast carols got some fancy ideas about starting a garden too sounds like a lot of back breaking work to me and banks knew what hatchley felt about work the dreaded fourletter word back breaking or not im sorry to lumber you with this jim he said especially on your honeymoon thats all right gets me out of the house were not spring chickens you know cant expect to be at it all the time he winked besides a man needs time alone with his pint and his paper banks noticed a copy of the sun folded in hatchleys pocket from the little he could see it looked to be open at page three an attractive new wife and he still ogled the naked pagethree girl old habits die hard the landlord stirred his newspaper began to rustle with impatience clearly it was all very well for him to be rude to customers but customers were not expected to be rude to him by warming themselves in front of the sparse flames for too long without buying a drink banks walked over and the paper rose up again covering the mans beady eyes two pints of bitter please banks said and slowly the paper came to rest on the bar with a whycanteveryoneleavemealone sigh the man pulled the pints and plonked them down in front of banks holding his other hand out for the money as soon as he had done so banks paid and walked back to sergeant hatchley anything come up banks asked reaching for a cigarette hatchley pulled a cigar tube from his inside pocket have one of these christmas present from the inlaws havana nice and mild banks remembered the last cigar he had smoked one of dirty dick burgesss tom thumbs and declined best stick with the devil you know he said lighting the cigarette as you like well hatchley said theres nowt been happening around here ive been up with carol a couple of evenings for a drink like and noticed that ivers and his fancy woman in here once or twice tall chap in need of a hair cut looks a bit like that irish bloke from camelot richard harris after a bad night and that lass of his young enough to be his granddaughter id say still it takes all sorts lovely pair of thighs under them tight jeans and a bum like two peaches in a wet paper bag anyroad theyd come in about nineish nod hello to a few locals knock back a couple of drinks and leave about ten ever talk to them no they dont know who i am they keep themselves to themselves too the local constables a very obliging chap ive had him keeping an eye open and he says theyve done nothing out of the ordinary hardly been out of the house are they still in the running banks nodded theres a couple of problems with the timing but nothing they couldnt have worked out between them between them yes if they killed caroline hartley they must have been in it together its the only way they could have done it but youre not sure they did no im just not satisfied with their stories what about their motive that i dont know the husband had one clearly enough but the girl didnt share it itd have to be something we dont know about money i dont think so caroline hartley didnt have much it would have to be something more obscure than that perhaps shes the kind whod do anything for him just to hang on to him maybe or they didnt do it could be that too or maybe youre overcomplicating things as usual banks grinned maybe i am so what now hatchley asked a quick visit just to let them know we havent forgotten them me too yes but theyll recognize me theyll know me in future it wont do them any harm to know were keeping an eye on them come on sup up grudgingly sergeant hatchley drained his pint and stubbed out his cigar still another ten minutes left in that he complained take it with you never mind hatchley followed banks out into the sharp wind thin ice splintered as they made their way up the footpath to iverss cottage from which a welcoming plume of smoke curled and drifted west hatchley groaned and panted as they walked banks knocked this time ivers himself answered the door come in sit down sit down he said hatchley took the bulky armchair by the mullioned window and banks lowered himself into a wooden rocker by the fire have you caught him ivers asked the man who killed caroline banks shook his head afraid not ivers frowned oh well patsy patsy some tea if youve got a minute patsy janowski came in from her study glared at bankss right shoelace and went into the kitchen how do you think i can help you again ivers asked im not sure banks said first id just like to go over one or two details shall we wait for patsy with the tea they waited banks passed the time talking music with ivers who was excited about the harmonic breakthroughs he had made over the past two days hatchley hands folded in his lap looked bored finally patsy emerged with a tray and put it down on the table in front of the fire she wore jeans with a plain white shirt the top two buttons undone banks noticed hatchley take a discreet look down the front as she bent to put the tray down she didnt seem pleased to see banks and if either of them recognized sergeant hatchley they didnt show it this time patsy was surly and evasive and ivers seemed open and helpful luckily banks had learned never to take anything at face value when tea was poured he began with the questions its the timing thats important you see he opened can you be any clearer about what time you delivered the christmas present mr ivers im sorry i cant sometime around seven im sure of that and you stayed how long no more than five minutes thats rather a long time isnt it what do you mean people have funny ideas about time about how short or long various periods are id say five minutes was a bit long to spend with someone you didnt like on an errand like that why not just hand over the present and leave maybe it wasnt that long ivers said i just went in handed it over exchanged a few insincere pleasantries and left maybe two minutes i dont know banks sipped some tea then lit a cigarette patsy legs curled under her on the rug in front of the fire passed him an ashtray from the hearth what pleasantries he asked what did you say to each other as i said before i asked how she was how veronica was made a remark about the weather and she answered me politely i handed over the record told her it was something special for veronica for christmas then i left wed at least reached a stage where we could behave in a civilized manner towards one another you said it was something special something like that how did she react ivers closed his eyes for a moment and frowned she didnt really i mean she didnt say anything she looked interested though curious that may be why she opened it if she did banks said almost to himself did she seem at all strange to you did she say anything odd ivers shook his head no did she seem to be expecting someone how would i know she certainly didnt say anything if she was was she on edge did she keep glancing towards the door did she give the impression she wanted you out of the way as soon as possible id say yes to the latter ivers answered but no to the others she seemed perfectly all right to me what was she doing doing yes when you called you went into the front room didnt you was she listening to music polishing the silver watching television reading i dont know nothing i eating perhaps there was some cake on the table i remember that what was she wearing i cant remember claudes hopeless about things like that patsy cut in half the time he doesnt even notice what im wearing taking in the stooped lanky figure of the composer in his usual baggy clothes banks was inclined to believe her here was the genius so wrapped up in his music that he didnt notice such mundane things as what other people said did or wore on the other hand ivers obviously had a taste for attractive women in different ways both veronica and patsy were evidence enough of that and what redblooded male would forget a woman as beautiful as caroline hartley answering the door in her bathrobe surely a man with a taste for so seductive a woman as patsy janowksi couldnt fail to remember or to react but then ivers knew caroline he knew she was a lesbian perhaps it was all a matter of perspective banks pressed on what about you ms janowski can you remember what she was wearing i didnt even go into the house i only saw her standing in the doorway can you remember it looked like some kind of bathrobe to me a kimonostyle thing dark green i think the colour was she was hugging it tight around her because of the cold what time did you arrive after seven i left here about twenty minutes after claude how long after seven im not sure i told you before maybe about a quarter after twenty past what were you wearing wearing patsy frowned i dont see what thats just answer please she shot his right lapel a baleful glance jeans boots and my furlined jacket how long is the jacket it comes down to my waist patsy said looking puzzled look i dont would you say that caroline was expecting someone else someone other than you i couldnt say really did she react as if she had been expecting someone else when she saw you standing there at the door did she show any disappointment no not especially patsy thought for a moment she was real nice given who i am im sorry but it all happened so quickly and i was too concerned about claude to pay much attention did she seem nervous or surprised to see you anxious for you to leave quickly no not at all she was surprised to see me of course but thats only natural and she wanted to shut the door because of the cold why didnt she ask you in patsy looked at the hearth she hardly knew me besides all i had to ask her was whether claude was there and she said he wasnt yes and you believed her patsys tone hardened she spoke between clenched teeth of course i did are you sure he wasnt still in the house ivers leaned forward now wait let her answer mr ivers sergeant hatchley said caroline said hed gone she said hed just left the record and gone i hadnt any reason to believe she was lying was she in a hurry to get rid of you ive told you no everything was normal as far as i could tell but she didnt invite you inside doesnt that seem odd to you ms janowski youve already said it was so cold on the doorstep that caroline hartley had to hold her robe tight around her wouldnt it have made more sense to invite you in even if just for a few minutes after all mr ivers here says he only stayed for five minutes are you trying to suggest that i did go inside patsy exploded just whats going on in that policemans mind of yours are you accusing me of killing her because if you are youd better damn well arrest me right now and let me call my lawyer theres no reason to be melodramatic ms janowski banks said im not suggesting anything of the kind i happen to know already that you didnt enter the house patsys brow furrowed and some of the angry red colour drained from her cheeks then i i dont understand did you hear music playing no i cant remember any and you didnt ask to go inside to look around no why should i i knew he wouldnt still be there if veronica wasnt home the point is banks said that mr ivers could have been in the house couldnt he youve just confirmed to me that you didnt go in and look ive told you he wouldnt could he have been inside she looked at ivers then back to banks thats an unfair question the goddamn duke of edinburgh could have been inside for all i know but i dont think he was the thing is banks said that nobody saw mr ivers leave caroline hartley didnt invite you in even though it was cold and you didnt insist on seeing for yourself that doesnt mean anything ivers burst out and you know it it was pure bloody luck on your part that anyone noticed me arrive or patsy you cant expect them to be watching for me to leave too maybe not but it would have made everything a lot tidier and if youre suggesting that caroline didnt let patsy in because i was there have you considered that she might have been hiding someone else have you thought about that yes mr ivers ive thought about that the problem is no one else was seen near the house between your visit and ms janowskis he turned to patsy when you left did you notice anyone hanging around the area i dont think so concentrate it could be important ive asked you before to try to visualize the scene did you see anyone behaving strangely or anyone who looked furtive suspicious out of place pasty closed her eyes no im sure i didnt except what im not very clear there was a woman where the end of the street it was dark there snowing and she was some distance away from me but i remember thinking there was something odd about her i dont know what im damned if i can think what it was think banks encouraged her the timing was certainly right patsy had called at about twenty past seven and the killer if indeed the last observed visitor was the killer only two or three minutes later there was a good chance that they had passed in the street patsy opened her eyes its no good it was ages ago now and i hardly paid any attention at the time its just one of those odd little things like a déjà vu did you think you knew this woman recognized her no it wasnt anything like that id remember that it was when i got to king street she was crossing over as if she was heading for the mews we were on opposite sides and i didnt get a very close look it was something else just a little thing im sorry chief inspector really i am especially she added sharply as any information i might give could get us off the hook i simply cant remember if you do remember anything at all about the woman banks said no matter how minor a detail it might seem to you call me immediately is that clear patsy nodded and youre not off the hook yet not by a long chalk banks gestured for hatchley to get up a lengthy task that involved quite a bit of heaving and puffing then they left banks almost slipped on the icy pathway but hatchley caught his arm and steadied him just in time well said the sergeant stamping and rubbing his hands outside the lobster inn thats that then i dont mind doing a bit of extra work you know he said glancing longingly at the pub even when im supposed to be on my honeymoon i know its not my case but i wish youd fill me in on a few more details banks caught his glance and interpreted the signals fine he said over a pint hatchley beamed well if you insist two susan love could i have a word of course susan and marcia were sitting in the crooked billet with the entire cast of twelfth night after rehearsal it had gone badly and those who werent busy arguing were drowning their depression in drink james didnt seem too concerned susan thought watching him listen patiently to malvolios complaints about the final scene but he was used to it hed directed plays before she shifted along the bench to let marcia cunningham sit beside her what is it marcia looked puzzled im not sure its nothing really at least i dont think it is but its very odd police business well it might have something to do with the breakin you did say to mention anything that came up go on but thats just it you see love it doesnt make sense marcia susan said why dont you just tell me get it off your chest marcia frowned its hard to explain youd probably think i was just being silly if i told you cant you pop around and have a look for yourself i dont live far away what now whenever you can spare the time love marcia looked at her watch ill have to be off in a few minutes anyway susan recognized a deadline when she heard one now she was with cid she was never really off duty she wouldnt get anywhere if she put personal pleasure before the job however fruitless the trek to marcias might seem and the vandalism was her case a success so early in her cid career would look good what could she do but agree as marcia couldnt be induced to say any more susan would have to put james off and go with her it wouldnt take long marcia had assured her so she wouldnt have to cancel their dinner date just postpone it for half an hour or so james would understand he certainly had plenty to occupy himself with in her absence all right susan said ill come with you thanks love it might be a waste of time but well wait till you see susan told james she had to nip out for a while and would be back in half an hour or so then she buttoned up her winter coat and left with marcia they walked northeast along york road past the excavated preroman site where the little burial mounds and hut foundations looked eerie under their carapace of moonlit ice its just down here marcia led susan down a sloping street of prewar semis opposite the site though the house itself was small it had gardens at both front and back and a fine view of the river and the green from the kitchen window the furniture looked dated and worn and swaths of material lay scattered here and there along with stacks of patterns and magazines in the untidy living room marcia didnt apologize for the mess her sense of disorder susan realized didnt stop at the way she dressed on the mantelpiece above the electric fire stood a framed photograph of marcias late husband a handsome man posing on the seafront at some holiday resort with a pipe in his mouth marcia switched on the fire susan took off her coat and knelt by the reddening element rubbing her hands she could smell dust burning as it heated up sorry its so cold marcia said we wanted central heating but since my frank died i just havent been able to afford it i dont have it either susan said i always do this when i get home she stood up and turned what is it youve got to show me marcia dragged a large box into the centre of the room its this remember i told you yesterday i was patching up some of the damage those hooligans did to the costumes susan nodded well i have look she held up a long pearl gown with shoulder straps and plunging neckline susan looked closely but surely cut to shreds it was marcia said look she pointed out the faint lines of stitching of course youd never get away with wearing it for a banquet at the ritz but itll do for a stage performance even the nobs in the front row wouldnt be able to see how it had been sewn back together youre a genius marcia susan exclaimed touching the fabric you should have been a surgeon marcia shrugged cant stand the sight of blood anyway it was just like doing a jigsaw puzzle really and she showed susan more dresses and gowns she had resurrected from the box of snippedup originals that so untidy a person should be able to bring such order out of chaos astonished susan you didnt bring me here just to praise you did you she said finally i dont mean to be rude but i told james id be back in half an hour sorry love marcia said just got carried away thats all forgot how impatient young love is susan blushed marcia the point yes well marcia reached into the box and took out a simple burgundy dress this is the point i worked on this one all afternoon she held it up and susan could see that the sleeves had been cut off up to elbowlevel and a large patch of the front around the breasts was also missing i dont understand she said havent you finished ive done all i could love thats the point this is it all there was i still dont understand and you a copper too its simple i managed to sort out the bits and pieces of the other dresses here and patch them together as youve seen susan nodded but when it came to this one i couldnt find all the pieces some of themve plain disappeared disappeared wake up lass yes disappeared ive looked everywhere even back at the centre to see if theyd fallen on the floor or something not a trace but it doesnt make any sense susan said slowly who on earth would want to steal pieces of a ruined dress my point exactly marcia said thats why i asked you to come here and see it for yourself who would do such a thing and why there has to be a simple explanation marcia nodded yes but what is it your lot didnt take any for analysis or whatever did they susan shook her head no they must have dropped out somewhere maybe when you were bringing the box home i looked everywhere im telling you love if thered been pieces i wouldve found them susan couldnt help but feel disappointed it was hardly an important discovery certainly not one that would lead to the identity of the vandals but marcia was right in that it was mystifying it was slightly disturbing too when susan picked up the dress and held it in front of her she shivered as if someone had just walked over her grave it looked as if the arms had been deliberately cut off rather than torn and two circles of fabric around the breasts had been snipped out in a similar way shaking her head susan folded the dress and handed it back to marcia three chief inspector banks have you any news no news banks said maybe a few questions come in veronica shildon led him into her front room it looked larger and colder than it had before as if even all the heat from the fiercely burning fire in the hearth couldnt penetrate every shadowy corner two small threadbare armchairs stood in front of the fire christine cooper let me have them until i get around to buying a new suite veronica said noticing banks looking at them she was going to throw them out banks nodded after veronica had taken his coat he sat in one of the armchairs and warmed himself by the flames its certainly more comfortable than a hardbacked chair he said can i offer you a drink she asked tea would do nicely veronica brewed the tea and came to sit in the other armchair placed so they didnt face each other directly but at an angle that required a slight turning of the head to make eyecontact the fire danced in the hollows of veronicas cheeks and reflected like tiny orange candle flames in her eyes i dont feel i thanked you enough for letting me come to london with you she said crossing her legs and sitting back in the chair it cant have been an easy decision for you to make anyway im grateful somehow seeing ruth dunne gave me more of caroline than id had if you can understand that banks who had more than once spent hours with colleagues extolling the virtues and playfully noting the faults of deceased friends knew exactly what veronica meant somehow sharing memories of the dead seemed to make them live larger in ones mind and heart and veronica had had nobody in eastvale to talk to about caroline because nobody here had really known her banks nodded i dont really know why i am here to tell the truth he said finally nothing i learned in london really helped now its early evening on a cold january day and im still no closer to the solution than i was last week maybe im just the cop who came in from the cold veronica raised an eyebrow frustration certainly more than that tell me she said slowly am i i mean do you still believe that i might have murdered caroline banks lit a cigarette and shifted his legs the fire was burning his shins ms shildon he said weve no evidence at all to link you to the crime we never have had everything you told us checks out and we found no traces of bloodstained clothing in the house nor did there appear to be any blood on your person unless youre an especially clever and coldblooded killer which i dont think you are then i dont see how you could have murdered caroline you also appear to lack a motive at least i havent been able to find one im comfortable with but surely you dont take things at face value no i dont its a simple statistic that most murders are committed by people who are close to the victim often family members or lovers given that youre obviously a prime suspect there could have been a way certainly if youd been planning the act there could also be a motive we dont know about caroline could have been having an affair and you could have found out about it so you still think i might have done it banks shrugged its not so much a matter of what i think its maybe not probable but it certainly is possible until i find out exactly who did do it i cant count anybody from carolines circle out including me including you god what a terrible job it must be having to see people that way all the time as potential criminals how can you ever get close to anyone youre exaggerating its my job not my life do you think doctors go around all the time seeing everyone as potential patients for example or lawyers as potential clients of the latter im quite certain veronica said with a quiet laugh but as for doctors the only ones ive known get very irritated when guests ask their advice about aches and pains at cocktail parties anyway banks went on people create their own problems what do you mean everyone lies evades or holds back the full truth oh you all have your own perfectly good reasons for doing it protecting carolines memory covering up a petty crime unwillingness to reveal an unattractive aspect of your own personality inability to face up to things or simply not wanting to get involved but cant you see where that leaves us if were faced with several people all closely connected to the victim and they all lie to us one of them could conceivably be lying to cover up murder but surely you must have instincts you must trust some people yes i do my instincts tell me that you didnt kill caroline but id be a proper fool if i let my heart rule my head and overlooked an important piece of evidence thats the trouble trusting your instincts can sometimes blind you to the obvious already ive told you too much does your instinct tell you who did kill her banks shook his head and flicked a column of ash into the fire unfortunately no gary hartley confessed in a way but he told her what had happened in harrogate veronica sat forward and clasped her hands on her lap as he spoke the poor boy she said when hed finished is there anything i can do i dont think so hes undergoing psychiatric tests right now but the point is whatever he did do he didnt kill caroline if anything towards the end when he knew the full story he felt pity for her it was his father he turned on with years of pentup hatred i still cant imagine what torture it must have been for both of them the old man unable to help himself unable to get out of bed starving and lying in his own waste and gary downstairs getting drunk and listening to the feeble cries and taps growing fainter knowing he was slowly killing his own father banks shuddered there are some things it doesnt do to dwell on perhaps but none of this gets us any closer to carolines killer its the why i cant understand veronica said who could possibly have had a reason for killing caroline that we dont know banks sipped some tea i thought it might have had something to do with her past but neither ruth dunne nor colm grey the father of her child had anything to do with it unless theres a very obscure connection such as a dissatisfied customer come back to wreak revenge which hardly seems likely all we can surmise is that it was someone she knew and someone who hadnt planned to kill her how do you know that there was no sign of forced entry and the weapon it just came to hand but she didnt know many people veronica said surely that would be a help it is and it isnt if she didnt know many people very well then how could she offend someone so much theyd want to kill her why do you say offend maybe youre wrong perhaps she found out something that someone didnt want known or she saw something she shouldnt have but according to what everyone tells me yourself included she wasnt acting at all strangely prior to her death surely if something along those lines was bothering her she should have been veronica shook her head i dont know she could have been holding back pretending for my sake but you didnt get that impression your instinct didnt tell you so no then i never known whether to trust my instincts or not ive made mistakes we all have banks said but youre right to consider other motives we shouldnt overlook the possibility that someone had a very practical reason for wanting her out of the way the problem is it just makes the motive harder to get at because its less personal lets say to be absurd that she saw two spies exchanging documents in the first place how would she know they were doing anything illegal and in the second how would they know she was a threat he shook his head that kind of thing only happens in books real murders are much simpler in a way at least as far as motive is concerned but not necessarily easier to solve gary hartley might have had a deepseated reason to kill his sister but he didnt do it your estranged husband had a motive too he blamed caroline for the separation but he seems happy enough in his new life with patsy why would he do anything to ruin that on the other hand who knows what people really feel what do you mean he could have done it if patsy janowski is in it with him or is lying to protect him he delivered the record we know that for a fact as to who put it on the turntable veronica shook her head slowly claude couldnt murder anyone oh he has his moods and his rages but hes not a killer anyway do you really think the music is important its a clue of some kind but it didnt mean what i thought it did i believe caroline opened it out of curiosity she wanted to know what claude thought was so special to you beyond that your guess is as good as mine maybe she would even play a little of it again to satisfy her curiosity but i cant believe shed leave the arm up so it would repeat forever veronica smiled thats just like caroline she said quietly such curiosity you know she always wanted to shake all her christmas presents it was well nigh impossible to stop her opening them on christmas eve banks laughed i know my daughters the same veronica shook her head such a child in some ways banks leaned forward what did you say about caroline i said she was such a child in so many ways yes banks whispered yes she was he remembered something ruth dunne had said to him in london he tossed his cigarette end into the fire and finished his tea does it mean something veronica asked it might do he stood up if it does ive been a bit slow on the uptake look id better go now much as id like to stay here and keep warm ive got work to do im sorry its all right you dont have to apologize i dont expect you to keep me company thats not part of your job banks put the empty teacup on the table its not a task i despise he said but there are a few points i have to review back at the station when you find out veronica said twisting the silver ring around her middle finger will you let me know youd find out soon enough no i dont want to find out from the papers i want you to let me know as soon as you find out no matter what the time day or night will you do that for me is this some sort of desire for revenge do you need an object to hate no you once told me i was far too civilized for such feelings i just want to understand i want to know why caroline had to die what the killer was feeling we might never know that she put her hand on his sleeve but you will tell me wont you when you know promise ill do my best banks said veronica sighed good what about the record banks said at the door technically its yours you know veronica leaned against the doorjamb and wrapped her arms around her to keep warm i can live in this house she said especially when i get it redecorated and bring new furniture in but do you know something i think that if i ever heard that music again id go insane banks said goodnight and veronica closed the door it was a shame he thought that such a glorious and transcendent piece of music should be associated with such a bloody deed but at least he thought he now knew why the record had been left playing if not who had put it on four susan systematically picked the strips of glittering silver tinsel from her tiny artificial christmas tree carefully she replaced each flimsy strand on the card from which it came to put away for next year she did the same with the single string of lights and the red and green coloured balls the only decorations she had bought when she had finished with the tree she stood on a chair and untapped the intricate concertinas of coloured crêpe paper she had draped across the ceiling and folded them together apart from the father christmas above the mantelpiece a threedimensional figure that closed like a book when you folded it in half that was it when she had put all traces of christmas in the cupboard susan stood in the centre of her living room and gazed around somehow even without all the festive decorations she had dashed out and bought at the last moment the place was beginning to feel a little more like a home there was still a lot to do framed prints to buy perhaps a few ornaments but she was getting there already she had found time to buy three records highlights from madame butterfly the four seasons and a recording of traditional folk music the kind she had heard a few times at university many years ago the opening chords of autumn were playing as she walked into the kitchen to make some cocoa james hadnt seen the inside of her flat yet she would have to invite him soon if he was going to keep on taking her to dinner not that he paid susan always insisted on going dutch but something held her back perhaps it was the same thing that had held her back so far from stopping in at his place for a nightcap damn it all the man had been her teacher at school and that was a difficult image to throw out still at least she would make sure she had a few more books and records when she did invite him she wouldnt want him to think she lived in such a cultural vacuum she poured out her cup of cocoa and sat down to listen to the music curling her feet under her in the small armchair if she was honest with herself she decided her resistance to james had little to do with the fact that he had been her teacher and was only partly related to his involvement in the case as far as susan was concerned veronica shildon was guilty and it was simply a matter of proving it of finding evidence that she had returned earlier than she said and murdered her lover such a distasteful word susan thought when applied to a relationship like theirs out of jealousy selfdisgust or some other powerful negative emotion either that or the estranged husband had done it because caroline had corrupted and stolen his wife so although james and the theatre crowd were officially suspects susan couldnt believe that any of them were really guilty no it was something else that kept her at arms length from james she had for some reason stayed away from sexual relationships over the past few years and again if she was honest it wasnt only because of her career that was important to her yes but many women could manage both a lover and a career some of her colleagues and stranger still a couple of the more charming villains she had nicked had asked her out but she had always said no somehow they had all been too close to home she didnt want to be talked about around the station she had dated occasionally but had never been able to commit herself to anything she supposed that as far as the men were concerned there always seemed to be a million things she would rather be doing than being with them and they were right because of that she had spent too many evenings alone in her soulless flat but also because of that she had passed all her examinations and her career was flourishing she certainly found james attractive as well as charming and lively company he was a great ham had a fine sense of the dramatic but there was more to him than that an intensity and a kind of masculine selfassurance he would probably make a fine lover so why was she avoiding the inevitable her excuse was the case but her real reason was fear fear of what she asked herself he hadnt even tried to touch her yet though she was sure she had seen the desire in his eyes was she afraid of enjoying herself of losing control of feeling nothing she didnt know but if she was to change her life in any way at all she would have to find out and that meant confronting it so when the case was over a skin had formed on the top of her cocoa she had never liked that ever since childhood that sweet and sticky skin made her shudder when inadvertently she had sipped without looking and it had stuck like a warm spiders web to her lips carefully using her spoon she pushed it to the edge of the cup dredged it out and laid it in the saucer for some reason that photo of marcia cunninghams handsome husband with his pipe at a rakish angle came into her mind he reminded her of james just a little not his looks but his expression she found herself looking at the mantelpiece now that the father christmas was gone it seemed so empty she would like to have a photo or two there but of whom not her family that was for certain james much too early for that yet herself the graduation picture from police college it would do for a start then she remembered the dress marcia had dragged her all that way to look at there was a puzzle to be sure no doubt the vandals would have an explanation when and if they were caught still it was a strange thing for someone to do maybe they had taken strips of material to fasten around their foreheads as rambo headbands or something there was no telling what weird fantasies went on in the adolescent mind these days susan put her cup down the record had finished and even though it wasnt late she decided to go to bed and have an early night there was still that american tome on homicide investigation for bedtime reading or should she do a little advance reading of shakespeare from the cutprice complete works she had picked up at w h smiths in a couple of days it would be twelfth night the first night of the play she just hoped that no police business came up to stop her from attending james seemed so much to want her there even though her knowledge of shakespeare left a lot to be desired and she was looking forward to the evening she couldnt see how any of the present cases would get in her way there wasnt much else they could do on the caroline hartley murder until they got new evidence or until banks took his head out of the sand and gave veronica shildon a long hard objective interrogation besides susan was only a helper a notetaker on that one and as for the vandals until they were caught redhanded there wasnt much to be done about them either picking up the heavy complete works from her bookshelf she wandered off to bed five a message for you sir sergeant rowe called out as banks walked into the police station after his visit to veronica shildon he handed over a piece of paper it was a woman called patty jarouchki i think sounded american anyway she left her number said for you to call her as soon as you can banks thanked him and hurried upstairs to his office grabbing a black coffee on the way the cid offices were quiet the tapping of a keyboard from richmonds office the only sign of life he picked up the phone and dialled the number sergeant rowe had given him patsy janowski answered on the third ring you had a message for me banks said yes remember you asked me to try and recall if id noticed anything unusual in the area yes well its not really i mean its not clear at all but you know i said there was a woman the one crossing king street yes what about her i didnt get a good look or anything im sure it wasnt anyone i knew but i do remember she was walking funny in what way just funny did she have a limp a wooden leg no no it was nothing like that at least i dont think so a strange kind of walk some people have them bowlegged knockkneed not even that she was just struggling a bit there was snow on the ground oh i knew i shouldnt have called you its still not clear and its probably nothing i feel stupid banks could imagine her eyes ranging about the room resting on the tongs by the fire the old snuffbox on the mantelpiece you did right he assured her but ive told you nothing really it might mean something if you think of anything else will you stop accusing yourself of idiocy and call me he could almost hear her smile at the other end of the line all right she said but i dont think itll get any clearer banks said goodnight and broke the connection for a moment he just sat on the edge of his desk coffee in hand staring at the calendar it showed a wintry scene in aysgarth wensleydale finally he lit a cigarette and went over to the window outside beyond the venetian blinds the market square was deserted the christmastree lights still twinkled but nobody passed to see them it was that time of year when everyone had spent too much and drunk too much and seen too many people now most eastvalers were holed up in their houses keeping warm and watching repeats on television the days depression was still with him and the mystery of caroline hartleys death was still shrouded in fog there had to be some way of making sense of it all banks told himself he must have overlooked something the only solution to his bleak mood was mental activity as he stood at the window looking down on the forlorn christmas lights he tried to recreate the sequence of events in his mind first of all he discounted the arrival of yet another visitor after the mysterious woman at seven twenty he also accepted that by the time patsy janowski had called and talked to caroline hartley briefly at her door claude ivers was busy doing his lastminute shopping in the centre and getting ready to head back to redburn and veronica shildon was shopping too a woman perhaps the same one patsy said walked strangely knocked at carolines door and was admitted to the house what had happened inside had the woman been an exlover or a jilted suitor had she called to remonstrate and ended up losing her temper and killing caroline presumably there could have been sex involved after all caroline had been naked and the kind of sex she was interested in wouldnt oblige by leaving semen traces for the forensic boys to track down there was just no way of knowing carolines life had been full of mysteries a breeding ground for motives as a working hypothesis banks accepted that the crime was spur of the moment rather than a planned murder the use of the handy knife and the lack of precaution about being seen or caught by veronica who had been likely to arrive home at any moment seemed to point that way and unless caroline had been involved in some unknown criminal activity the odds were that passion of one kind or another lay at the root of her death after the murder came the clearing up the killer had washed the knife removed any possible fingerprints she might have left and either put the vivaldi record on the turntable or lifted up the arm given the savage nature of the wounds the killer must also have got blood on her own clothing if she had removed her coat before the deed she could easily have covered her bloodspattered clothing with it and destroyed all evidence as soon as she got home banks went to refill his coffee mug and returned to his office something in patsy janowskis sketchy description of the woman bothered him but he couldnt think what it was he walked to the filing cabinet and dug out the reports on interviews with caroline hartleys neighbours nothing much there helped either the details were vague as the evening had been dark and snowy again he read through the descriptions of the mystery woman mr farlow had said she was wearing a midlength light trenchcoat with the belt fastened he had seen her legs beneath it and perhaps the bottom of a dress she had been wearing a headscarf so he had been able to say nothing about her hair mrs eldridge had little to add but what she remembered agreed with farlows account despite the coffee banks was getting tired it really was time to go home there was nothing to be gained by pacing the office he slipped on his camelhair overcoat and put the walkman in his pocket after hed walked down the stairs and said goodnight to sergeant rowe at the front desk he hesitated outside the station under the blue lamp and looked at the queens arms a rosy glow shone warmly from its smoky windows but no he decided best go home and spend some time with sandra it was a clear quiet night he would leave the car in the station car park and walk the mile or so home he put the headphones on pressed the button and the opening of poulencs gloria came on as he walked on the crisp snow down market street he looked at the patterns frost had made on the shop windows and wished that the odd bits and pieces of knowledge he had about the hartley case could make similar symmetrical shapes they didnt he began to walk faster christ his feet were cold he should have worn sheepskinlined boots or at least galoshes but he had never really thought about walking home until the impulse struck him then something leaped into his mind as he turned into his culdesac and saw the welcome lights of home ahead something that made him forget his cold feet for the last hundred yards patsy janowksi had said the woman walked strangely she couldnt explain it any better than that but mr farlowe said he was sure the visitor was a woman because he had seen her legs below her long coat if that was the case then her legs were bare she either wasnt wearing boots at all or she was wearing very short ones it had been snowing quite heavily that evening since about five oclock and the snow had been forecast as early as the previous evening so even a woman going to work that morning would have known to take her boots even before the snow the weather had been grey and cold most of december had been linedboots and overcoat weather now why would a woman be trudging around in the snow without boots at seven twenty that night banks wondered she could have been in a hurry and simply slipped on the first pair of shoes that caught her eye she could have come from somewhere she hadnt needed boots but that didnt make sense in such weather most people wear boots to work then change into more comfortable shoes when they get there when its time to leave they slip back into their boots for the journey home the woman might have arrived by car and parked close by the nearest space where patsy said she and ivers parked was a fair distance to walk in the snow without boots the woman might have driven to carolines found she couldnt park any closer and ended up having to walk farther than shed bargained for which meant it could have been someone who didnt know the area well given what patsy had said about the walk it sounded as if the woman had probably been wearing pumps or high heels most likely the latter that would explain her odd walk trying to make ones way through four or five inches of snow in high heels would be difficult indeed and wet was it then someone who had nipped out of a local function committed the murder and dashed back before she was missed there had probably been a lot of parties going on that night hatchleys wedding reception among them it couldnt have been anyone from there of course as banks knew most of the guests but it was an interesting avenue to explore if he could find someone who had been at such a function that night someone who had a connection with caroline hartley then maybe hed get somewhere feeling a little more positive about things he turned off the tape and went into the house one teresa pedmore rented a twobedroom house on nelson grove in a pleasant enough area of town south of the castle close to the river the houses were old but in good repair and their inhabitants though only renting took pride in adding individual touches to the outside trim a low blue gate led to teresas house where her matching door was edged in white lace curtains hung in the windows teresa professed to be surprised to see banks though he was never sure what to believe when dealing with actors faith could have told teresa about the visit banks had paid her earlier though he thought it unlikely that would have meant confessing what she had said about teresa the front door led straight into the living room cream and red striped wallpaper covered the walls where a number of framed prints hung banks who had learned what little he knew about art from sandra recognized a constable landscape a stubbs horse and a lowry perhaps the most striking thing about the room though was that it was furnished with antiques a welsh dresser a queen anne writing desk regency table and chairs the only contemporary items were the tan threepiece suite arranged in a semicircle around the hearth and a small television set remembering the importance of the music banks looked around for evidence of a stereo but could find none teresa gestured towards one of the armchairs and banks sat down he was surprised by her taste and impressed with her farmgirl looks the blushes of red in her creamy cheeks her wavy chestnut hair framed a rather chubby heartshaped face with a wide full mouth an oddly delicate nose that didnt quite seem to belong and thick brows over large almond eyes she certainly wasnt goodlooking in the overtly sexual way faith green was but the fierce confidence and determination in her simplest movements and gestures more than compensated she was as tall and wellshaped as faith and wore a white silky blouse and kneelength navy skirt she picked up an engraved silver box from the low table and offered him a cigarette lighting it with an old lighter as big as a paperweight it was years since banks had been offered a cigarette from a box and he would certainly never have expected it in a small rented terrace house in eastvale the cigarette was too strong but he persevered his lungs soon remembered the old days of capstan full strength and rallied to the task almost before he had a chance to say yes or no teresa was pouring amber liquid from a cutglass decanter into a crystal snifter as she handed banks the glass the edges of her wide mouth twitched up in a smile i suppose youre wondering where i get my money from she said policemen are always suspicious about people living above their means arent they she sat down and crossed her long legs banks swirled the glass in his hand and breathed in the fumes cognac ave you living above your means he asked she laughed a low murmuring sound how clever of you not at all it only looks that way the furniture isnt original of course i just like the designs the look and feel of it and one day believe me ill have real antiques i think the only valuable objects in the room are the decanter and the cigarette box and they belonged to my grandfather family heirlooms the lowry is a genuine too a present from a distant wealthy relative as for the rest cognac and what have you what can i say i like to live well i dont drink a lot but i drink the best i make decent money i dont run a car i have no children and my rent is reasonable banks who wondered why she was telling him all this nodded as if he were suitably impressed perhaps she was trying to paint a picture of herself as someone who had far too much class and refined sensibility to commit so tasteless an act as murder he sipped the cognac courvoisier vsop he guessed maybe she was right i suppose you think i should have stayed on the farm she went on married a local farmer and started having babies she made a dismissive gesture with her cigarette for christs sake banks thought do i look so old that people immediately assume im a fuddyduddy still teresa couldnt have been more than twentytwo or twentythree there were sixteen or seventeen years between them which made it technically possible for him to be her father he just didnt feel that old and he could certainly understand young people wanting to escape what they felt to be claustrophobic social backgrounds what do you want to do he asked act of course she reminded banks of sally lumb another albeit younger dales hopeful he had met during the steadman case eighteen months ago the memory made him feel sad such dreams often turn to pain but what are we if we dont dream banks asked himself and at least try to make them come true james is trying to fix things so i get a part in weymouth sands hes doing the script for the bbc you know he knows all the casting people its terribly exciting the dales accent was still there despite the evidence of elocution lessons and it made the upperclass phrase terribly exciting sound very funny indeed more cognac banks noticed his snifter was empty he shook his head no no thanks its very good but id better not teresa shrugged she didnt press him fine cognac is after all very expensive youre still on good terms with james conran then banks asked her eyebrows rose why shouldnt i be i heard rumours youd had a falling out who told you that are they true its that common little tramp faith isnt it was james conran paying too much attention to caroline hartley the name stopped teresa in her tracks she reached for another cigarette from the box but didnt offer banks one this time its easy to exaggerate things she continued quietly everyone argues now and then ill bet even you argue with your wife dont you but it doesnt mean anything did you argue with james conran over caroline her eyes flashed briefly then she drew on her cigarette tilted her head back and blew out a long stream of smoke through narrow nostrils what has faith been saying about me she asked ive got a right to know look banks said i havent told you who passed on the information nor am i going to its not important what counts is that you answer my questions and if you wont do it here you can come down to the police station and answer them you cant make me do that teresa leaned forward and flicked off a column of ash surely what did you do after the rehearsal on december the twentysecond what i i came home straight home no i did some christmas shopping first look what time did you get home what is this are you trying to imply i might have had something to do with caroline hartleys death im not implying anything im asking questions banks pulled out one of his own silk cuts and lit up what time did you get home i dont know how can i remember it was ages ago did you go out again no i stayed at home and worked on my role you didnt have a date with mr conran no we i were you still seeing him at that time of course i was as a lover thats none of your damn business she mashed her cigarette out and clasped her hands in her lap when did you and mr conran stop being lovers im not answering that but you did stop there was a pause then she hissed yes before caroline hartleys murder yes and did caroline have anything to do with this parting no it was completely amicable on both sides things just didnt work out that way wed never been very deeply involved anyway if you know what i mean a casual affair you could call it that though neither of us is married and caroline hartley came between you teresa scratched her palm and looked down am i right banks persisted look teresa answered what if i say you are it doesnt mean anything does it it doesnt mean id kill her im not a fanatically jealous woman but every woman has her pride anyway it wasnt caroline i blamed was conran having an affair with caroline she shook her head i dont think so we didnt know she was gay but even so there was something about her something different elusive she could keep the men at bay while seeming to draw them to her its difficult to explain no i dont think he even saw her outside rehearsals and the pub that seemed to square with what veronica shildon had said but he was attracted to her a bit smitten you might say said teresa that was what annoyed me him chatting her up in public like that when everyone could see the way he looked at her that kind of thing but then james is like that he goes after anything in a skirt am i to take it you dont care for him any longer not as a man no as a professional i respect him a great deal thats a very neat distinction surely you sometimes have to work with people you respect but dont like did you argue over his attentions to caroline i told him to stop drooling over her in public i found it embarrassing but that was only a part of it what i said before was true it wasnt much of a relationship to begin with it had run its course do you think youll get this part in weymouth sands james still appreciates me as an actress she said which is more than he does that gossipy bitch who told you all about my personal life whos that faith bloody green obviously theres no need to be coy you know damn well it was her who told you and i can guess why why why do you think because she couldnt get him herself did she try teresa gave banks a disdainful look youve met faith chief inspector what do you think the answer is but conran wasnt interested it appears not any reason not that i know of not his type perhaps too much woman too aggressive i dont know im just guessing what did he think of her did they have any arguments if shes been trying to imply i had a good reason for killing caroline hartley its probably because she had an even better one banks sat up why over her interest in conran teresa sniffed no it wasnt that i think she soon realized that her tastes run to rougher trade than james it was just that she had to try like she does with every man no it was something else that happened tell me teresa leaned forward and lowered her voice dramatically it was after rehearsal that night the night caroline was killed what happened most people left early because it was close to christmas but james wanted to spend half an hour or so with faith and myself just getting the blocking right our parts are large and very important you see anyway james wanted faith to stay behind so i left first but i forgot my scarf and it was cold outside so i came back i dont think they heard me i was in the props room you know where we leave our coats and bags and i heard voices out in the auditorium im not a naturally nosy person but i wondered what was going on anyway to cut a long story short i walked a little closer and listened and guess what what teresa smiled they were arguing i bet she didnt tell you about that did she what were they arguing about caroline hartley as far as i could gather james was telling faith that if she didnt do a better job of learning her lines hed give her part to caroline what was faiths reaction she walked out in a huff i had to be quick to hide behind a door without being seen can you remember their exact words i can remember what faith said to james before she left she said youd do anything to get into that little sluts pants wouldnt you i wish id been there to see his face of course he cant have meant it about giving her part away james would know quite well there wasnt enough time for caroline to take over faiths role he was just trying to get her to try a bit harder what happened after that i dont know as soon as faith had left i got out of there pretty quickly i didnt want to be caught snooping where was conran still in the auditorium as far as i know could he have left by the front door teresa shook her head no we always use the back during rehearsals the fronts kept locked after the gallery closes unless theres some sort of an event on who has the key to the back door only marcia and james from the dramatic society as far as i know usually one or the other would be last to leave james more often than not as marcia was always first to arrive and she tended to disappear to the pub early if she knew she wasnt needed what time did this argument occur six maybe a little after what were you wearing teresa frowned and sat back in her chair what do you mean what clothes were you wearing me jeans a leather coat my wool scarf same as usual for rehearsals what about footwear i had my boots on it is winter after all i dont see what and faith i cant remember i doubt i paid much attention what did she usually wear jeans skirt and blouse dress she usually wore a skirt and blouse she is a teacher believe it or not she came straight from school but i dont know for sure what she was wearing that day what about her overcoat what she always wore i suppose which is a long coat like a light raincoat with epaulettes but lined belted yes and her footwear how should i know was she wearing boots or shoes boots i should think because of the weather but you cant be sure no i cant say i pay faiths feet much attention why didnt you tell me all this earlier banks asked teresa sighed and shifted in her chair i dont know it didnt seem all that important and i didnt want any trouble anything spoiling the play it was bad enough with caroline getting murdered when i heard about her being gay i was sure her death must have had something to do with her private life that it didnt involve any of us i know i sound hard but this play is important to me believe it or not if i do well the tv people will hear about me banks stood up i see and as for faith teresa went on i know i sounded bitchy right now but it was only because i was annoyed at what shed said to you shed no right to go talking about my personal life but shes not a killer not faith and certainly not over a petty incident like that banks buttoned his overcoat and headed for the door thanks very much he said youve been a great help and he left her reaching for another cigarette from the engraved silver box damn them all he cursed as he walked out into the cold night of course faith could have killed caroline perhaps not over a petty matter such as the argument teresa had described but there could have been another reason a woman like caroline hartley whether intentionally or not causes violent emotion in all who come into contact with her even veronica shildon had admitted to banks that shed never understood lust until she met caroline faith could have simmered for a while after the row it would certainly have been a blow to her pride and then if she had something else against caroline too she could have gone to visit her and remonstrate faith certainly worked hard at her mae west role but what if it was just an act what if her true inclination lay elsewhere or she leaned both ways it didnt seem likely that james conran would kill the goose he hoped would lay a golden egg he had high hopes for caroline as an actress and he was sexually attracted to her as a woman he didnt know she was gay given his masculine pride and confidence he probably assumed that she would come around eventually it was just a matter of time and persistence still there might have been something else in the relationship that banks didnt know about caroline had seemed to bring out the worst in both faith and teresa how could he be sure either of them was telling him the truth instead of feeling that he had cleverly played one off against the other he was beginning to feel that he might be the one who had been played cursing actors he pulled up in front of his house feeling nothing but frustration two the bell was ringing in the distance all around lay dark jungle snakes slithered along branches phosphorescent insects hummed in the air and squat furry creatures lurked in the lush foliage but the bell was ringing in the dark and she had to find her way through the jungle to discover why there were probably booby traps too holes lightly covered with grass matting that would give way under her weight to a thirtyfoot drop onto sharpened bamboo shoots and she was at least half awake now the jungle had gone a figment of the night the ringing was coming from her telephone in the living room hardly a dangerous journey after all though one she was loath to make being so comfortably snuggled up under the warm blankets she looked at the bedside clock two twentythree in the morning bloody hell and she hadnt got to bed until midnight slowly without turning on the light she made her way through to the livingroom by touch she fumbled the receiver and put it to her ear susan mmm sergeant rowe here sorry to disturb you lass but its important at least it might be whats happened weve caught the vandals how no wait im coming in give me fifteen minutes right you are lass theyll still be here susan replaced the receiver and shook her head to clear the cobwebs luckily she hadnt drunk too much at dinner she put on the livingroom light squinting in the brightness then went into the bathroom and splashed cold water on her face there was no time for makeup and grooming just a quick wash a brush through the hair and out into the cold quiet night with luck there would be fresh coffee at the station holding her coat around her she shivered as she got into the car it started on the third try driving slowly because of the ice she took nearly ten minutes to get to the car park behind the station she nipped in through the back door and walked to the front desk theyre upstairs sergeant rowe said any background information aye tolliver and wilson caught them trying to jemmy their way into the darby and joan club on heughton drive our lads had enough sense to let them jemmy open the lock and step over the threshold before pouncing a slight altercation ensue sergeant rowe stopped and smiled at his use of jargon in which said officers managed to apprehend the suspects in other words they put up a bit of a fight but came off worst do we know who they are rob chalmers and billy morley both spent time in remand homes how old are they were in luck ones eighteen the other seventeen susan smiled not a case for the juvenile court then have they been cautioned charged and cautioned weve jot the jemmy and the gloves they were wearing bagged and ready for testing and theyre not saying owt been watching american cop shows like the rest refuse to talk till theyve seen their lawyer lawyers i ask you and i assume said lawyers are on their way rowe scratched his bulbous nose bit of trouble tracking them down i think we might manage it by morning good where are they interview rooms upstairs tollivers with one wilsons with the other right susan poured herself a mug of coffee and went upstairs still feeling the same thrill as she had on her first day in cid she took a few sips of the strong black liquid hung her coat up in the office then took a quick glance in her compact mirror and applied a little makeup at least now she didnt look as if she had got straight out of bed satisfied she smoothed her skirt ran her hand through her curls took a deep breath and walked into the first interview room pc tolliver stood by the door a bruise by the side of his left eye and a crust of blood under his right nostril sitting or rather slouching behind the table legs stretched out arms behind his head was a youth with dark oily slickedback hair as if he had used half a jar of brylcreem he was wearing a green parka open over a torn tshirt and faded grubby jeans susan could smell beer on his breath even at the door when he saw her walk in he didnt move she ignored him and looked over at tolliver all right mike ill mend whove we got robert s chalmers age eighteen unemployed previous form for assault damage to property theft all as a juvenile a real charmer susan winced in acknowledgement of his joke bad puns were a thing with pc tolliver susan sat down tolliver went to the chair by the small window in the corner and took out his notebook hello robert she said forcing a smile fuck off the animosity that came from him was almost overwhelming susan tensed up inside determined not to react on the outside she remained calm and cool he had acted in this hostile way partly because she was a woman she was sure a thug like chalmers would take it as an insult that they sent a small woman rather than a burly man to interrogate him he would also expect to be able to deal with her easily to him women were probably creatures to be used and discarded there wouldnt be any shortage of them in his life he was goodlooking in a surly james dean early elvis presley way his upper lip permanently curved in a sneer i hear youve been attempting to gain unlawful entry to the darby and joan club she said whats the problem cant you wait till youre sixtyfive very funny its not funny robert its aggravated burglary do you know how much time you can get for that chalmers glared at her im not saying anything till my lawyer gets here it might help you if you did cooperation wed mention that in court i told you i aint saying nothing i know you bastards youd fit me up with a verbal he moved in his chair and susan saw him wince slightly with pain whats wrong robert bastard over there beat me up he grinned dont worry love he only bruised a rib or two he didnt damage my tackle susan bit her tongue be sensible robert like your friend william susan saw a flicker of apprehension in the boys eyes but they quickly regained their hardbitten look and he laughed im not stupid you know love he said pull the other one susan stared at him long and hard and made her assessment was it worth pushing at him she decided not hed been through this kind of thing too many times before to fall for the usual tricks or to scare easily maybe his accomplice would be softer she stood up right ill just go and have another word with your mate then hell be able to fill in all the details that should give us enough though hardly anything perceptible changed in chalmerss expression susan somehow knew that what she had said worried him not that the other had talked he wouldnt fall for that but that billy morley was less tough more nervous more likely to crack chalmers just shrugged and resumed his slouch gritting his teeth for a second as he shifted he put his hands in his pockets and pretended to whistle at the ceiling susan went to the next room stopping to lean against the wall on the way to take a few deep breaths no matter how often she came across them people like chalmers frightened her they frightened her more than the people who committed crimes out of passion or greed she could hear her fathers voice going on about the younger generation in his day the story went people were frightened of coppers they respected the law now though they didnt give a damn theyd as soon thump a policeman and run she had to admit there was a lot of truth in what he said there had always been gangs youngsters had always been full of mischief and sometimes gone too far but they certainly used to run when the police arrived now they didnt seem to care why had it happened was television to blame partly perhaps but it was more than that maybe they had become cynical about those in authority after reading about too many corrupt politicians perverted judges and bent coppers everyone was on the fiddle nothing really mattered any more but it wasnt susans job to analyse society just to get the truth out of the bastards taking a final deep breath she walked into the next office to confront billy morley this lad guarded by pc wilson who sported a small cut over his left eye seemed a little more nervous than his friend skinny to the point of emaciation he had a spotty weasly face and dark beady eyes that darted all over the place he was sitting straight up in his chair rubbing his upper arm and licking his thin lips you the lawyer he said hopefully this bastard here nearly broke my arm hit me with his stick you were resisting arrest pc wilson said i wasnt doing nothing of the kind i was minding my own business aye said wilson you and your jemmy its not mine its well asked wilson he folded his arms im not saying anything by this time susan had sat down and arranged herself as comfortably as she could in the stiff bolteddown chair first she gave pc wilson the signal to fade into the background and take notes then she took a good look at morley he didnt frighten her nearly as much as chalmers basically she thought he was weak especially alone he was also the younger of the two chalmers she suspected was a true hard case but morley was just a follower and probably a coward at heart chalmers had known that and the knowledge had flitted across his face for a moment being a woman would put susan at an advantage with someone like morley who probably jumped each time his mother yelled im not your solicitor william susan said im a detective constable ive come to ask you a few questions its a serious charge youre facing do you understand that what do you mean aggravated burglary under section ten of the theft act you could do life add to that resisting arrest assaulting a police officer and im pretty sure any judge would come down hard on you bollocks thats crap you cant get life he shook his head not just for i dont believe you its true william youre not a juvenile now youre an adult no more fun and games but but nothing im telling you william it doesnt look good do you know what aggravated burglary means morley shook his head susan clasped her hands on the table in front of her it means committing a burglary while carrying an offensive weapon what offensive weapon the jemmy susan was interpreting the law with a certain amount of licence aggravated burglary usually involved firearms or explosives she shook her head the best we could do for you is drop the charge to going equipped for stealing thats thirteen years then theres malicious damage to property whichever way it cuts william youre in a lot of trouble you can only help yourself by talking to me morley pinched his long sharp nose and sniffed i want my lawyer what were you after susan asked did someone tell you there was money there we werent after no money we im not saying anything till my law your solicitor may be some time william solicitors like a good nights sleep they dont enjoy getting up at two thirty in the morning just to help a pathetic little creep like you itll be better if you cooperate morley gaped at her as if her insulting words delivered in such a matter of fact even tone had pricked him like darts i told you he stammered i want susan rested her hands on the table palms down and spoke softly william be sensible for once in your life look at the facts we already know the two of you broke into the darby and joan club you used a jemmy itll have your fingerprints on it you must have handled it at some time its being tested right now and therell be fibres we can match with the gloves you were wearing too we also have two very reliable witnesses pc wilson here and his colleague caught you redhanded theres no getting around that solicitor or no solicitor weve followed correct procedure so far youve been warned and charged right now were reviewing your options so to speak he hit me morley whined hes broke my arm i need a doctor for a moment susan thought that might be true morley was pale and his sharp narrow brow looked clammy then she realized it was fear look at his eye william she said nobodys going to believe he attacked you for no reason morley fell silent for a while susan could almost hear him thinking trying to decide what to do itll go easier for you if you tell us what you were up to she said gently perhaps you were only trespassing that would never wash she knew trespassing in itself wasnt an offence except in certain special circumstances such as poaching and espionage and breaking the lock of a club with a jemmy was a long way from simple trespass still it wouldnt do morley any harm to let him look on the bright side he remained silent chewing at the edge of his thumb whats wrong william are you frightened of robert is that what it is she was about to tell him chalmers had already talked tried to put the blame on him but realized just in time that such a ploy could ruin any advantage she had he might suspect a trick then no doubt having seen such tactics used on television and her carefully constructed house of cards would fall down theres nothing to be afraid of youll be helping him too ten seconds later morley took his thumb from his mouth and said we werent burgling anything that wasnt it at all what were you doing there then susan asked just having fun what do you mean fun you know it was something to do smashing things and stuff it wasnt no aggravated burglary or whatever you call it you cant charge us with that it looks like burglary to us william are you trying to tell me you were going to vandalize the place we werent going to take anything or hurt anyone nothing like that were you going to cause damage just a bit of fun why what do you mean why why would you want to do such a thing i dunno morley squirmed in his chair and grasped his arm again fucking hurts that will you please not use language like that in front of me william susan said i find it offensive answer my question why did you do it no reason do you have to have a fucking reason for everything i told you it was just fun thats all ive told you once susan said mustering as much quiet authority as she could i dont like that kind of language learn some manners morley tried hard to glare at her but he looked more ashamed and defeated than defiant was it the same kind of fun you had in those other places susan asked what other places come on william you know what i mean this isnt the first time is it morley remained silent for a while then said quietly still rubbing his arm i suppose not suppose all right no its not but we never hurt anyone or anything susan could taste success her first real case she was only assisting on the hartley murder but this one was all hers if she could wrap up a fourmonth problem of vandalism with a neat confession it would look very good on her record as she listed the dates and places vandalized over the past few months mostly youth clubs and recreation centres morley nodded glumly at each one until she mentioned the community centre come again he said eastvale community centre night of december the twentysecond morley shook his head you cant do us for that one what are you saying im saying we didnt do it thats what come on william whats the point in denying it itll all be taken into account youre doing yourself no good he leaned forward spittle collected at the corners of his mouth because we didnt f because we didnt do it thats why i wasnt even in eastvale that night i spent christmas with my mother down in coventry i can prove it call her go on susan took the number what about robert how should i know but i didnt do it he wouldnt do it by himself would he stands to reason rob now wait a minute wait a minute he was out of town too he was down in bristol with his brother over christmas we didnt do it im telling you susan tapped her pen on the desk and sighed true it didnt make sense for the lad to lie at this point when he had confessed to everything else damn just when she thought she had got it all wrapped up that meant there must be two sets of vandals one down one to go she stood up take his statement will you john ill go and make out a report for the chief inspector well check the alibis for the community centre job tomorrow morning as she passed the room where robert chalmers was being held she almost went in for another try but there was nothing more to learn instead she carried on down the corridor to her office three of all the times to come pestering me its opening night tonight dont you know that how did you even know id be here normally id be at school at this time i know banks said i phoned they told me youd taken the day off you did what faith green was really pacing now arms folded under her breasts she wore purple tights and a baggy hiplength sweater with red and blue hoops around it her silver hair and matching hoop earrings flashed in the morning sunlight that shone through her large picture window how dare you she went on do you realize what damage that could do my career it doesnt matter that im guilty of nothing just a hint of police around that place and the smell sticks why dont you sit down banks perched at the edge of his armchair faintly amused by faiths performance it certainly differed from his last visit his amusement however was overshadowed by irritation she stopped and glared at him am i making you nervous good banks leaned back in the chair and crossed his legs remember last time i called i asked if youd noticed anything odd about the rehearsal on december the twentysecond faith resumed pacing again stopped in front of the greta garbo poster as if seeking inspiration and said with her back to banks so were you telling me the truth im not in the habit of lying itd be easier if you sat down banks said oh all right damn you faith flounced towards the sofa and flung herself on to it there she said with a pout does that suit you fine i must say youre not quite as welcoming as you were last time faith looked at him for a moment trying to gauge his meaning that was different she said finally i didnt see why we had to have such a boring time just because you were asking silly questions and this time i should be rehearsing going through my lines im tense enough as it is youre upsetting me how asking questions again banks sighed all right how about if i stop asking and start telling and he relayed what teresa had told him about the argument between faith and james conran the further he got the paler faiths face turned and the more angry her eyes became who told you this she demanded when hed finished that doesnt matter it does to me it couldnt have been james surely the last thing hed do is make himself look bad she paused then slapped the arm of the sofa of course how stupid of me it was teresa wasnt it she must have stayed behind and eavesdropped i thought shed been behaving oddly towards me lately did you tell her what i told you look it really doesnt the snooping bitch shes no right no right at all and neither had is it true banks asked its none of her but is it true business to listen to my private so it is true faith hesitated looked over to garbo again and sighed deeply all right so we had a row ive got nothing to hide its nothing new happens all the time in the theatre its the timing that interests me most banks said you could conceivably have been angry enough at caroline hartley to stew over it for a couple of drinks then go pay her a visit you didnt know she lived with anyone faiths jaw dropped when she finally spoke it was in a squeaky uncontrolled voice far different from her stage speech are you suggesting that i killed the damn woman over some stupid argument with the director of a smalltown play you did call her a little slut i think that suggests a bit more than a tiff over a part in an amateur production dont you its just a figure of speech a why did you call her a slut faith was it because conran fancied her but he didnt fancy you is that why you told me about him and teresa too out of jealous spite for the first time faith seemed speechless but it didnt last long finally redfaced she stretched out her arm dramatically and pointed at the door out she yelled out you wretched insulting little man out calm down faith banks said i need answers is that why faith let her arm fall slowly and sat in silence for a few moments contemplating the upholstery of the sofa what if i did call her a slut she said finally heat of the moment thats all and ill tell you something the way i felt at the time if id killed anybody it would have been our bloody philandering director its unprofessional letting your prick rule your judgment like that it happened with teresa it was happening with caroline but it didnt happen with you huh do you think i really cared about that ive no trouble finding a man when i want one a real man too not some artsyfartsy wimp like james conran but maybe he hurt your pride some people dont handle rejection well or perhaps it wasnt conran that really bothered you was it caroline herself faith stared at him then spoke slowly look you asked me about that the last time you were here i told you im not a lesbian i told you i could prove it to you do you want me to prove it now she sat up crossed her arms and reached for the bottom of her sweater banks held his hand up no he said im not asking you to prove it and quite honestly its not really the kind of thing you can prove is it faith let her hands drop but remained sitting crosslegged on the sofa you mean you think im bi banks shrugged well you cant prove that either can you we might be able to if we talk to the right people faith laughed my exlovers well good luck to you darling youll need it what did you do after the argument banks asked came home like i said she put her hand to her brow quite honestly i was shagged out dear faith seemed to have regained her composure since her outburst or at least her poise she pushed her fringe back from her eyes and managed a brief smile as she went on look chief inspector i know you have to catch your criminal and all that but its not me and ive got a lot of work to do before curtain tonight besides i need to be calm relaxed youre making me all flustered ill blow my lines be a darling and bugger off you can come back some other time if you want banks smiled i shouldnt worry about being nervous ive heard a bit of anxiety adds an edge to a performance faith narrowed her eyes at him for a moment as if wondering whether she was being had well she went on if thats all far from it you argued with james conran in the auditorium am i right yes what happened next i left of course i dont put up with that kind of treatment not from anyone and you went straight home i did was anyone else in the centre at the time well obviously teresa bloody pedmore was but i didnt see her anyone else faith shook her head are you sure i told you i didnt see anyone but then i didnt see them all leave either there are plenty of cubbyholes behind the stage as you know quite well the whole bloody cast could have been hiding there and listening for all i know but as far as you know the only person there was james conran and you left him in the auditorium faith nodded a puzzled expression on her face and teresa i suppose if she saw me leave yes banks said and teresa what were you wearing that evening to rehearsal yes faith shrugged same as i usually wear i suppose when i come from school which is theyre very conservative you know blouse skirt and cardigan is required uniform how long was the skirt she arched her eyebrows why chief inspector i didnt know you cared she stood up with exaggerated slowness and put the edge of her hand just below her knee about that long she said then she shifted her weight to her left leg dropping her right hip in a halfcomic halfseductive pose as i said theyre very conservative what about your overcoat what is this can you tell me i can do better if itll get you out of here quicker she walked to the hall cupboard and pulled out a long heavily lined garbardine its not quite warm enough for this weather weve been having lately she said but itll do until someone buys me a mink what about footwear she raised one eyebrow you are getting intimate arent you whatever will it be next i wonder footwear boots of course what do you think id be wearing in that weather bloody high heels she laughed tell me have you a shoe fetish or something banks smiled and got to his feet no sorry to disappoint you thank you very much for your time ill see myself out but faith followed him to the door and leaned against the frame arms loosely folded you know chief inspector she said i am very disappointed in you i might be persuaded to change my mind but it would take a lot of doing ive never been so insulted and abused by a man as ive been by you but the funny thing is i still like you she took him by the elbow and steered him out the open door and now you really must go banks headed down the corridor and turned when he heard faith calling after him chief inspector will you be there tonight will you be watching the play ill be there banks said i wouldnt miss it for anything and he went on his way one the community hall was surprisingly full for the first night of an amateur production banks thought there they all sat chattering and coughing nervously before the play started a party of fourthformers from eastvale comprehensive present under sufferance friends and relatives of the cast a group of pensioners members of the local literary institute the old boiler groaned away in the cellar but it didnt seem to be doing much good there was a chill in the hall and most people kept their scarves on and their coats draped over their shoulders banks sat beside sandra their seats compliments of james conran were front and centre about ten rows back further ahead banks could make out susans blonde curls the director himself sat beside her occasionally leaning over to whisper in her ear he could also see marcia talking animatedly to a greyhaired man beside her it was almost seven thirty banks eyed the motheaten curtain for signs of movement much as he enjoyed shakespeare he hoped the performance would not last too long he remembered an actor telling him once in london that he didnt like doing hamlet because the pubs had always closed by the time it was over banks didnt think twelfth night was that long but a bad performance could make it seem so finally the lights went off abruptly there being no dimmer switch in the eastvale community centre and the curtains began to jerk open rusted rings creaked on the rail the audience clapped then made themselves as comfortable as they could in the mouldedplastic chairs if music be the food of love play on give me excess of it that surfeiting the appetite may sicken and so die so spoke the duke and the play was underway the set was simple banks noticed a few wellplaced columns drapes and portraits gave the impression of a palace banks recognized the music played on a lute as a dowland melody fitting enough for the period though he was no shakespeare expert banks had seen two other performances of twelfth night one at school and one in stratford he remembered the general plot but not the fine details this time he noticed too many cast members shouted or rushed their lines and mauled the poetry of shakespeares language in the process on the other hand the groupings and movements on stage constantly held the attention the way people faced one another or paced about as they talked kept everything in motion from what little he knew of directing banks assumed that conran himself was responsible for this occasionally a member of the audience would shift in his or her seat and there were quite a few present suffering from coughs and colds but on the whole most people were attentive when an actor or actress hesitated over lines waiting for a prompt nobody laughed or walked out faith and teresa were good they had the poise and the skill to bring off their roles even if it was difficult to believe in faiths masquerade as a man in their scenes together though there was an obvious tension perhaps because faith knew who had told banks about her row with conran and teresa knew who had told him about her jealousy over caroline hartley ironically this seemed to give an edge to the performances especially to violas initial rudeness on their first meeting the ambiguity of their relationship viola dressed as a man courting olivia on her brothers behalf soon absorbed banks to hear faith complimenting teresas beauty was an odd thing indeed but to watch their love blossom was even stranger for banks this had a dark side too he couldnt help but think of caroline and veronica knowing as the characters themselves did not that both viola and olivia were female maria the role that caroline would have played was an added reminder of the recent tragedy during the intermission banks felt distracted he left sandra chatting with some acquaintances and nipped out on to north market street for a cigarette in the icy cold the dim gaslights glinted on the snow and ice and even as he stood a gentle snowfall began flakes drifting down like feathers he shuddered flicked his halfsmoked cigarette end into a grate and went back inside the vague connection between the play and reality was beginning to make banks feel very uneasy by the fourth act his attention began to wander to thoughts of his recent interviews with faith and teresa and the pile of unread paperwork in his intray including a report on the arrest of the vandals that susan had stayed up half the night to prepare then his attention would return to the play in time to hear the clown and malvolio chatting about pythagorass opinion of wild fowl or sebastian in raptures about the pearl olivia had given him he couldnt maintain lasting concentration there was something in his mind a glimmer of an idea disparate facts coming together but he couldnt grasp it couldnt see the complete picture yet there was an element still missing by the final act bankss back and buttocks hurt and he found it difficult to keep still in the hard chair surreptitiously he glanced at his watch almost ten surely not long to go even before he expected it true identities were revealed everybody was married off except for malvolio and the clown began to sing when that i was and a little tiny boy with hey ho the wind and the rain a foolish thing was but a toy for the rain it raineth every day then the music ended and the curtains closed the audience applauded the cast appeared to take bows soon the formalities were all over and everyone shuffled out of the hall relieved to be leaving the hard seats time for a drink banks said to sandra as they fastened their coats on the front steps sandra took his arm of course champagne its the only civilized thing to do after an evening at the theatre except go for dinner there arent any restaurants open this late maybe gibsons fish and sandra pulled a face and tugged his arm ill settle for a lager and lime and a packet of cheese and onion crisps a cheap date banks said now i know why i married you they set off down north market street to the queens arms which was much closer to the front exit of the community centre than was the usual cast wateringhole out the back the crooked billet it was only twenty past ten when they got there enough time for a couple of pints at least the pub was quiet at first but many of the theatre goers following banks and sandra seemed to have the same idea about a drink and it soon got crowded by then banks and sandra had a small dimpled coppertopped table near the fireplace where they warmed their hands before drinking they discussed the play against a background buzz of conversation but banks still felt uneasy and found it hard to concentrate instead he couldnt help but put together what he knew about the caroline hartley murder trying different patterns to see if he could at least discover the shape of the missing piece alan what oh sorry what the hells up with you i asked you twice what you thought about malvolio banks sipped some beer and shook his head sorry love i feel a bit distracted theres something bothering you isnt there yes she put her hand on his arm about the case its only natural after seeing the play isnt it after all caroline hartley was supposed to be in it its not just that banks couldnt put his thoughts into words all he could think of was the woman who walked strangely in the snow and vivaldis burial music for a small child and there was something about the play that snagged on his mind not the production details or any particular line but something else something obvious that he just couldnt bring into focus faith and teresa he didnt know all he knew was that he felt not only puzzled but tense too the kind of edginess one has before a storm breaks often he knew that feeling signalled that he was close to solving the case but there was even more this time a sense of danger of evil he had overlooked suddenly he became aware of someone tapping him on the shoulder it was marcia cunningham hello mr banks she said wondered if id find you here id have thought youd be at the crooked billet with the rest banks said marcia shook her head it was all right during rehearsals but i dont know if i can handle the firstnight postmortems besides im with a friend she introduced banks to the trim middleaged man standing behind her albert there was one more chair at the table and banks offered his as well to the two newcomers they demurred at first then sat banks leaned against the stone fireplace last orders called cyril the landlord last orders please in the scramble for the bar banks managed to get in another round when he got back to the table marcia cunningham was chatting to sandra i was just saying to sandra she repeated that i was wondering if youd solved the little mystery of the dress pardon the dress the one with the pieces missing im sorry marcia banks said ive no idea what youre talking about marcia frowned but surely young susan must have told you whatever it is i can assure you she didnt it was her case anyway ive been far too preoccupied with the caroline hartley murder marcia shrugged and smiled at albert well i dont suppose its very important really why dont you tell me anyway banks asked realizing he might have been a little abrupt he remembered what veronica shildon had said about people asking doctors for medical advice at cocktail parties sometimes being a policeman was much the same you were never off duty weve caught the vandals you know he added marcia raised her eyebrows you have have they told you why they did it i havent had time to read susans report yet but dont expect too much people like that dont have reasons you and i can fathom oh i know that mr banks i was just wondering what they did with the pieces thats all banks frowned im sorry i dont follow marcia took a sip of mild and launched into her story albert sat beside her still and silent as a faithful retainer his thin face showed an intricate pattern of pinkish blood vessels just below the skin he nodded from time to time as if in support of what marcia was saying what do you make of it then marcia asked when shed finished banks looked at sandra who shook her head its odd behaviour for vandals ill give you that he said i cant think of any reason then he suddenly fell silent and the other images that had been haunting him formed into some kind of order vague and shadowy as yet without real substance but still something resembling a pattern thats if he went on after a pause look marcia do you still have it the dress of course its at home could i see it any time you want theres nothing more i can do with it how about now now well i dont know i she looked at albert who smiled is it really so important alan sandra asked putting a hand on his arm it might be he said i cant explain yet but it might be all right marcia said we were going home in a minute anyway its not far my cars parked behind the station ill give you a lift banks said he turned to sandra ill see you no you wont im coming with you im damned if im walking home alone all right they grabbed their coats and made for the door two what did you think of it james asked susan after they had carried their drinks to a table for two in the crooked billet his eyes were shining and he seemed to exude a special kind of energy susan thought that if she touched him now she would feel an electric shock like the ones she sometimes got from static i enjoyed it she said i thought the cast did a terrific job as soon as shed spoken she knew she had said the wrong thing even before jamess eyes lost a little of their sparkle it wasnt that she hadnt mentioned his direction but that her comment had been hopelessly pedestrian the trouble was she knew nothing about shakespeare beyond what james himself had tried to teach her at school what a confession and she had forgotten all that she hadnt got far reading twelfth night at home either the language was too difficult for her to grasp much of what was going on next to james with all his knowledge and enthusiasm she felt inadequate james patted her arm it could have been better he said especially the pacing of the third act that scene and susan sat back with relief to listen he hadnt wanted intelligent comments after all just someone to sound out his theories on that she could do and for the next twenty minutes he asked for it it wasnt so difficult when he got technical she found she could easily remember scenes that had seemed dull awkward or overlong and james confirmed that there were good reasons for this things he hoped to put right before the next performance tomorrow night occasionally she drifted off into thoughts of work her interviews with chalmers and morley the torn dress she hadnt yet told banks about the damn nuisance of having even more vandals to chase but she put her lack of concentration down to tiredness after all she had been up most of the night before and all day at eleven twenty glasses empty and no prospect of another drink james asked if susan fancied a nightcap back at his house a drink and a talk with a friend what could be wrong with that she couldnt put him off forever besides she needed to relax she still felt nervous about being alone with him but she reached for her coat and followed him out into the night anyway it was just for a drink after all she wasnt going to let him seduce her they pulled up in the alley at the back of the house where james parked his car and entered through the back door susan made herself comfortable in the armchair by the fire while james busied himself with drinks in the kitchen before he settled he put a compact disc of beethovens pastoral symphony on makes me think of spring he said sitting down somehow if i close my curtains and relax i can almost believe winters over it soon will be susan said she felt herself relaxing becoming warm and heavylimbed perhaps when the good weather comes we could take a ride out into the dale now and then james suggested or even venture a little further afield a short hike and a pub lunch sounds marvellous susan murmured believe it or not ive hardly ever made time to take advantage of the countryside you know what they say all work and no play susan laughed james sat on the floor by her knees his shoulder resting against the armchair so he could look at her when they talked it was closer than she would have liked just yet but not uncomfortably so hows business anyway he asked caught any big criminals lately susan shook her head then she told him about the previous evening so were still hot on the trail of your vandals she said cupping the large glass of brandy in both hands theyre a strange lot can you imagine why any young yob would snip up a dress and then run away with some of the pieces what susan explained what marcia had told her and what she had seen so marcia still has the dress then he said whats left of it whats she going to do with it i dont know susan answered she was feeling drowsy and vulnerable from the heat and the brandy i suppose i should take it in for analysis you never know never know what what you might find she looked down at the top of his head why are you so interested anyway james just curiosity thats all i suppose they must have had some reason for doing it maybe one of them cut himself and used it as a bandage another drink susan looked at her glass no thanks id better not already she felt that warmth tiredness and alcohol were making her let her guard down more than she cared to and she certainly didnt want to lose control busy day at the nick tomorrow susan laughed who knows excuse me while i get one of course while he was gone susan listened to the music she could have sworn she heard a cuckoo in one section but doubted that anyone as serious as beethoven would use such a frivolous gimmick perhaps one of them was a fetishist james suggested after he had sat down at her feet again and liked to wear only little bits of womens clothes dont be silly james i dont see why you have to keep harping on about it its nothing youd be surprised the things people like to dress up in like you in that policemans uniform that day thats different that was just a joke i didnt mean to suggest you were kinky or anything susan said but didnt you tell me you were just a little bit shy of making a direct approach to a woman yes well actings in my blood i suppose hamming it up maybe there are deeprooted psychological reasons i dont really know he shrugged susan laughed youre always doing melodramatic things like that dressing up arranging for that singer in marios a real practical joker arent you i told you james said a little irritably im just a bit insecure it helps especially with women yes as soon as susan realized what she had said a tiny shiver went up her spine she could feel the chill as palpable as the winter night outside fall between them james fell silent and susan sipped at her brandy thinking and not liking what she thought jamess penchant for playacting and dressing up the vandals denial of breaking into the community centre jamess attraction to caroline the burgundy dress no it couldnt be not possibly it was too absurd but her thoughts suddenly spanned two cases it was like hotwiring a car the engine jumped to life now she could think of at least one good reason why the dress had been cut up the way it had before long she became aware of a slight tickle up the side of her leg she looked down and saw that james was touching her very gently she shifted in her seat not too abruptly she hoped and he stopped the music ended and susan finished what little she had left in her glass id better be going she said sitting forward in her chair dont go just yet james said its been such a wonderful evening i dont want it to end susan laughed didnt he feel the same unease she did maybe not better for her that he didnt she must act naturally then investigate her vague fears later from a more secure position surely she would then discover how absurd they were no doubt the beer and brandy had caused her imagination to run wild it was most important now though that she make an early exit without letting james see that she entertained any suspicions at all dont be such a romantic she laughed therell be plenty of other evenings she tried to sit up but he was on his knees blocking her way james whats the harm in it he said leaning forward towards her he put his hands on her shoulders and she pushed them off if this is what a first night does to you she said trying for a light tone but she couldnt think of a way to end her sentence finally he moved aside and she managed to get to her feet she felt as if she were treading on thin ice did he know what she was beginning to suspect how could he was it obvious that she was humouring him and trying to get out fast all she knew was that she had to stay cool and get out of here maybe then she would be able to dismiss her fears but she couldnt stay not after the frightening images had started in her mind crazy or not she had to talk seriously to banks about james no matter how difficult it might be to swallow her pride and her feelings dont sulk she said tousling his hair it doesnt suit you damn you he said jerking away from her touch anger flashed in his eyes whats wrong with you dont you think im man enough for you youre just like her arent you susan felt as if she had been thrust under a cold shower every nerveend tingled she edged closer to the door like who james she asked quietly he turned to face her and she could see that he knew it was too late you know damn well who im talking about dont you i dont even know what youre talking about susan lied somehow she thought if she didnt say the name there was still a chance dont lie you cant fool me i can tell i can tell what youre thinking youve been toying with me leading me on all this time trying to get me to confess its all been a game hasnt it he moved quickly so that he was standing between susan and the door dont be stupid she said i dont know what you mean and move out of the way please i want to leave conran shook his head slowly youre thinking about me and caroline arent you there was no point pretending any longer susan looked at him and said you went to her didnt you that night it was an accident conran pleaded it was a ghastly accident james youve got to no thats where youre wrong no i dont it was all an accident all that stupid bitchs fault and suddenly he didnt look like the james she knew any longer not at all like the james she knew and thought she trusted three the four of them stood in marcia cunninghams front room and looked at the remains of the dress who would do something like that sandra asked thats the point banks said no casual vandal would go to such trouble at least not for any reason we can think of but it must have happened then marcia said id have noticed if it had been done before and certainly no one from the cast would have done it im not saying it was done before banks said what im saying is that its possible vandals didnt do this then who look at this banks passed the dress to sandra who studied the remains of its front look at those spots what are they paint could be but i dont think so theyre hard to see because the dress is so dark and we cant be sure not without forensic examination but if im right what are you getting alan sandra asked youre not making much sense you know the last person entering caroline hartleys house was a woman according to all our witnesses and patsy janowski said she saw a woman who walked funny at the end of the street i thought it was because she might have been wearing high heels but thats stupid sandra said in that weather exactly are you suggesting that the killer wore this dress marcia asked i cant believe it she pointed at the dress and thats thats blood the way caroline hartley was stabbed banks said there was no way the murderer could have avoided blood stains if she was wearing the dress it would have been easy enough to put her raincoat on again and get away from the scene get time to think i dont think the murder was planned not right from the start but then there was still a bloodstained dress to explain why not simply cut off the sleeves and the stained front then stage a breakin and cut up the other dresses that would raise much less suspicion than just doing away with the dress altogether if our killer had done that marcia would have missed it and started to wonder what might have happened but how could the killer know that marcia would be so diligent as to try and sew them back together again but that means marcia said slowly that the killer was someone who knew about our costumes someone who had access to them it means yes said banks and if she was wearing shoes not boots what does that suggest we dont have any boots marcia said not that i know of shoes yes but not boots the killer couldnt find any suitable boots to complete the disguise so had to make do with womens shoes i still dont understand marcia said it was the play gave me the idea that and what patsy said all that stuff about a woman walking funny and a play about confused identity couldnt it have been a man dressed as a woman would any of the shoes have been big enough well yes of course marcia said we have all kinds of sizes but why why would anybody dress up and do that we dont know banks said a sick joke maybe someone knew caroline was a lesbian someone who wanted her badly do you have a plastic bag i think so somewhere marcia gestured vaguely her brows knit together theres one in the larder by the newspapers love said albert who had remained silent until now ill go and get it albert brought the bag and banks put the dress in it what about the breakin marcia asked it could have been staged later when the killer discovered what hed done banks looked at his watch its after eleven thirty he said lets try the crooked billet and see if theyre still there who asked marcia susan and conran banks said i assume they are together he turned to marcia when did you tell susan about this dress the other day she couldnt make anything of it thats hardly surprising does james conran know i havent told him marcia said has susan i dont know i mean shes seeing him she might have mentioned it why banks looked at sandra i dont want to alarm anyone he said but if im right wed better try to find susan right away excuse us marcia albert and he took sandra by the arm and led her to the door but why sandra asked because i think james conrans the killer banks said on their way down the path i think he wanted caroline hartley so badly he went over to the house to see her i dont know why he dressed up or what happened in there but hes the only one in the society apart from marcia who had access to the prop room they got in the car and banks cursed the ignition until it started on his fourth attempt dont you see he said as he skidded off according to faith and teresa conran was the last one to leave the centre and even if he did go to the pub he had a key he could have easily gone back there and changed why do you think he was paying so much attention to susan he wanted to know how the investigation was going how close we were my god said sandra poor susan four james blocked susans way she asked for it you know he said she was nothing but a prickteaser then she then she what susan felt real fear now like ice in her spine her mind was racing in search of a way out if only she had told banks about the dress then maybe he would have been able to put two and two together before she had if only she could keep conran talking if only you know what he said it turned out she didnt like men she was just playing leading me on just like you were playing me for a fool thats not true stop lying its too late now what are you going to do james asked what do you think turn me in cant you let it go dont be an idiot what is it with you susan just what makes you tick professional all the way something like that susan muttered but it doesnt really matter any more does it you could forget this ever happened james said moving forward and reaching for her hand she noticed a sheen of sweat on his forehead and upper lip she snatched her hand away no i couldnt dont be a bloody fool james let me go dont make things worse he was still rational she thought james was no madman just troubled she could talk sense to him and he might listen the main problem was that he was highly strung and at the moment in a state of near panic she would have to be very careful how she handled him where do you want to go he asked to the phone she said calmly conran stood aside and let her pass but no sooner had she picked up the receiver than he grabbed it from her and pulled her back into the front room no he said i cant let you im not going to jail not just because of that perverted slut dont you see it wasnt my fault dont be a fool james whats the alternative conran licked his lips and looked around the room like a caged animal i could get out of here go away youd never have to see me again just dont try to stop me i have to you know that i mean it i dont want to hurt you look we could go together ive got some money saved up wherever you want we could go somewhere warm james susan said softly youve got a problem you dont necessarily have to go to jail maybe you can get help a doctor what do you mean problems i dont have any problems conran pointed at his chest me you tell me ive got problems she was the one with the problem not me im not queer im not a homosexual im normal his face was flushed and sweaty now and he was breathing fast susan wasnt sure if she could talk him down and persuade him to give himself up not if he didnt want to nobody says youre not normal she said cautiously but youre obviously upset you need help let me help you james im not going with you he said and if you phone i wont be here when your friends arrive youre making it worse susan said at least if you come in with me itll look good its no use running well get you in the end you know we will i dont care im not going to jail you dont understand i couldnt live in jail the things they do in there ive heard about them he shuddered i told you james it might not mean prison perhaps you can get help in a hospital no theres nothing wrong with me im perfectly normal ill not have doctors poking about in my head susan got up and walked towards the front door she held her breath as she turned her back on him before she even got to the hallway she felt his hands around her neck they were strong and she couldnt pry them apart because he was standing behind her all she could do was wriggle and it didnt help she flailed back with her hands but met only empty air she tried to swing her hips back into his groin but she couldnt reach him her throat hurt and she couldnt breathe she lashed back with one foot felt it connect and heard him gasp but his grip never slackened she felt all the life and sensation going out of her body like water down the drain her knees buckled and he let her sink forward to the floor his hands still locked tight around her throat the blackness had seeped in everywhere now she thought she could hear someone hammering on the door then she heard nothing at all five ill call an ambulance and stay with her sandra said kneeling over susan banks nodded and dashed back to the cortina he had heard conrans car start up as they broke in there was only one way his back lane led and that was to the main swainsdale road once there he could turn back towards eastvale or head out into the dale as banks negotiated the turns he radioed for help from eastvale and from helmthorpe which had one patrol car if conran didnt turn off on one of the side roads at least they could make sure the main road was blocked and he could get no further than the dales largest village at the junction conran turned left into swainsdale the cortina skidded on a patch of ice banks steadied it he knew the road like the back of his hand narrow for the most part with drystone walls on either side it dipped and meandered treacherous in the icy darkness he kept conrans taillights in view about a couple of hundred yards ahead when he got closer he put his foot down conran did the same it was almost like racing through a dark tunnel or doing a slalom run snow was piled almost as high as the walls at the roadsides beyond the fields stretched up the daleside an endless swath of dull pearl in the moonlight conran screeched through fortford almost losing control as he took the bend by the pub the cars side scraped against the jutting stones in the wall and sent a shower of sparks out into the night banks slowed and the cortina took the turn easily he knew there was a long stretch of straight road before the next bend conran had gained a hundred yards or so but once around the corner banks put his foot down and set about catching up the red taillights drew closer banks glanced ahead for landmarks and saw the drumlin within the six leaning trees silhouetted by the moon about a mile in front of them just before that there would be another kink in the road he was right behind conrans car now but there was no easy way to stop him he couldnt pull in front in such conditions on a narrow road if he tried conran would easily be able to nudge him into the wall all he could do was ride his tail and push hoping conran would panic and make a mistake a few moments later it happened either through ignorance or just plain panic conran missed the bend banks had already slowed enough to take it but instead he eased on the brake as he watched conrans car slide up the heaped snow in slow motion take off the top of the drystone wall spraying sparks again as it went and land with a loud thud in the field banks turned off his engine the silence after the accident was so deep he could hear the blood ring in his ears on a distant hillside a sheep bleated an eerie sound on a winters night banks got out of the car and climbed the wall to see what had happened there was very little damage as far as he could tell by the moonlight conrans car lay on its side the two free wheels spinning conran himself had managed to get the passenger door open and was now struggling up the hillside thighdeep in snow the farther he went the deeper the snow became until he could move no more banks walked in his wake and found him curled up and shivering in a cot of snow he looked up as banks came towards him please let me go he said please i dont want to go to jail i couldnt stand being in jail banks thought of caroline hartleys body and of susan gay laid out on the floor her face purple think yourself bloody lucky we dont still have hanging he said and dragged conran up out of the snow one only the sound of thin ice splintering underfoot accompanied banks on his way to oakwood mews later that night eastvale was asleep tucked up warm and safe in bed and not even the faint sound of a distant car disturbed its tranquillity but the town didnt know what had gone on between caroline hartley and james conran in that cosy firelit room with the stately music playing it didnt know what folly irony and pride had finally erupted in blood banks did sometimes as he walked he thought that his next step would break the crust over a great darkness and he would fall he told himself not to be ridiculous to keep going apart from the dim amber light shed by its widely spaced blackleaded gas lamps oakwood mews was as dark as the rest of the side street at that time of night not one light showed in a window easy banks thought for a murderer to creep in and out unseen now for a moment he stood by the iron gate and looked at number eleven should he it was two thirty in the morning he was tired and veronica shildon was no doubt fast asleep she wouldnt be able to get back to sleep after what he had to tell her sighing he opened the gate he had a promise to keep he pressed the bell and heard the chimes ring faintly in the hall nothing happened so he rang again and stood back a few seconds later a light came on in the front upstairs window banks heard the soft footsteps and the turning of the key in the lock the door opened an inch or two on its chain when veronica saw who it was she immediately took off the chain and let him in i had an idea it was you veronica said will you give me a few moments she pointed him towards the living room and went back upstairs banks turned on a shaded wall light and sat down embers glowed in the grate it was cool in the room but the memory of heat at least remained banks unfastened his heavy coat but didnt take it off in a few minutes veronica returned in a blue and white track suit she had combed her hair and washed the sleep out of her eyes sorry she said but i cant stand sitting around in a dressing gown it always makes me think im ill let me put this on and she switched on a small electric heater its bar shone bright red in no time can i offer you a cup of tea or something given the night ive had banks said a drop of whisky would be more welcome that is if you have any of course please forgive me if i dont join you id prefer cocoa while veronica made her cocoa banks sipped the scotch and stared into the embers it had all been so easy once they had got back to the station wet clothes drying over the heater in the cramped office steam rising conran spilling his guts in the hope of some consideration at sentencing now came the hard part veronica sat in the armchair near the electric fire and folded her legs under her she cradled the cocoa mug in both hands and blew on the surface banks noticed that her hands were shaking i always used to have cocoa before bed when i was young she said its funny they say it helps you sleep although its got caffeine in it do you understand that suddenly she looked directly at banks he could see the pain and fear in her eyes im prattling on arent i she said i assume youve got something important to tell me or you wouldnt be here at this time she looked away banks lit a cigarette and sucked the smoke in deeply are you sure you want to know he asked no im not sure im frightened id rather forget everything that happened but i never got anywhere by denying things refusing to face the truth all right now he was there he didnt know where to start the name just the bald name seemed inadequate but the why was even more meaningless veronica helped him out will you tell me who first she asked who killed caroline banks flicked some ash into the grate it was james conran veronica said nothing at first only the nerve twitching at the side of her jaw showed that she reacted in any way how did you find out she asked finally i was slow banks replied almost too slow given carolines life her past i was sure there was a complex reason for her death there were too many puzzles gary hartley ruth dunne colm grey me banks shrugged i didnt look close enough to home was there a complicated motive banks shook his head no i was wrong some crimes are just plain i was going to say accidents but thats not really the case stupid perhaps certainly pointless and often just sheer bad luck go on as far as the evidence was concerned we knew that conran was attracted to caroline but theres nothing unusual about that she was a very beautiful woman we also found out he tended to prefer her over other actresses in the cast which gave rise to a certain amount of jealousy caroline dealt with normal male attention by doing what she knew best what shed learned on the game teasing flirting stringing them along it was an ideal way for her because it deflected suspicion away from her true sexual inclinations he looked at veronica who was staring down into the murky cocoa and it kept them at a distance many flirts are afraid of real contact its just a game but as i said i was looking for deep complex motives something to do with her family her time in london her way of life as it turns out her death was to do with all those things but not directly concerned with any of them another drink veronica had noticed his glass was empty and went to refill it banks didnt object embers shifted with a sigh in the fire place it was much warmer now the electric fire had heated the room banks took his coat off what happened veronica asked handing him the tumbler on december the twentysecond after rehearsal everyone went their separate ways caroline came straight home took a shower and made herself comfortable in the living room with a cup of tea and some chocolate cake your husband called with the present which caroline opened because he had said it was something special and she wanted to know what could be so special to you im sure she intended to rewrap it before you found out im speculating of course no one but caroline was in the house at this time so well never know all the details but i think im right it couldnt have happened any other way anyway shortly after claude ivers left patsy janowski arrived checking up on him she thought he was still involved with you veronica sniffed and shifted position banks went on she spoke to caroline briefly at the door very briefly because it was cold and caroline was only wearing her bathrobe then she left on her way down the street she saw a woman who appeared to be walking oddly heading across king street but thought nothing of it by then it was dark and the air was filled with snow it was difficult to look up and keep your eyes open without getting them full of cold snow what about james conran veronica asked how does he fit in i was getting to that it had been a particularly difficult rehearsal he had insulted faith green by telling her that caroline could play her part better and teresa pedmore was probably still angry at him for being so obvious about his lust for caroline in public by this time he was pretty well besotted with her and hes one of those types whos like a little boy who breaks things when he doesnt get his own way because of the bad atmosphere everyone went their separate ways including caroline after he locked up conran went to the crooked billet and drank several double scotches very quickly his row with faith made him want caroline all the more after all he thought he was doing for her he was getting very impatient that she didnt seem to be keeping up her end of what he thought was the bargain then he had an idea he was always a bit of a theatrical type the kind who got dressed up and recited the boy stood on the burning deck at parties when he was a kid so he thought that as a joke hed dress up as a woman and go and see caroline twelfth night as you know is about a woman who passes herself off as a man and thats where he got the idea it would make her laugh he thought if he passed himself off as a woman and when you make women laugh you soften them and break down their reserve also hed had enough drinks to make it seem a good idea and to make him feel brave enough he knew where she lived but he didnt know that she lived with anyone he went back to the community centre only he and marcia cunningham from the dramatic society had keys to the back door chose a dress a wig and found some womens shoes that fit him but it must have been an uncomfortable walk for him the shoes were a little too tight and pinched his toes and its very hard to walk in high heels in the snow i should imagine especially if youre a man thats what patsy janowski noticed but she didnt realize what it meant he said caroline seemed to recognize him laughed and let him in she had no reason not to apparently hed done things like that in rehearsal dressed up played practical jokes clowned around so as far as she was concerned it wasnt out of character for him she may have been puzzled by his visit even worried that you would come back and wonder what was going on but as far as she knew she had no reason to fear him veronica grimaced and massaged her right calf banks took a sip of fiery scotch are you sure you want me to go on he asked it isnt very pleasant i didnt expect it to be veronica said ive got a touch of cramp thats all its not what youre saying thats making me grit my teeth i want to know everything but i think ive changed my mind about that drink she limped to the cocktail cabinet poured herself a glass of sherry and sat down again carefully please go on ill be fine conran was a little drunk and wanting his oats caroline must have seemed especially inviting dressed only in her bathrobe eventually it happened conran made a pass and caroline ducked it according to him she made some reference to the way he was dressed and told him she preferred real women she accused him of playing some kind of sick joke he was stunned he had no idea when he started to protest she laughed at him and told him the clothes suited him maybe he ought to consider going after some of the men in the cast then he hit her she fell back on the sofa stunned by the blow and her robe fell open he said he couldnt help himself he wanted her and if rape was the only way he could get what he wanted then so be it he had to have her right there veronica was gripping the sherry glass tightly her face pale banks paused and asked if she was all right yes she whispered go on she closed her eyes he couldnt do it banks said there she was a beautiful naked woman just what hed dreamed about ever since hed met her and he couldnt function he says he doesnt remember the next part very well everything was red inside his eyes he said and then it was done he saw what had happened hed picked up the knife from the table and stabbed caroline when the rage passed and the realization dawned he didnt panic he started thinking clearly again he knew he had to find some way of covering his tracks first he washed the knife and rinsed the blood off his hands when he went back into the room he was horrified by what hed done he said he sat down and just stared at caroline crying like a baby thats when he saw the record shed opened he knew the piece because hed had a lot to do with church choral music ever since he was young he knew that the laudate pueri was played at the burial services of small children thats another reason i should have thought of him sooner but then almost anyone could have known the significance of the music or someone might simply have thought it sounded right but i dont understand veronica said why did he play it he said he put it on as a genuine gesture that caroline had always seemed childlike in her ways and in her enthusiasms and she seemed to him especially like a child now as she lay there so the music was for caroline veronica asked yes a kind of requiem it was right there in front of him he was hardly going to search through the whole collection for something else especially as it seemed so fitting veronica looked down into her sherry glass and said quietly then maybe i can listen to it again go on you have to remember too veronica that conrans a theatre director he has a sense of the dramatic a feel for arrangement he told me that when he had stopped crying for what hed done he began to see the whole thing as a scene or a tableau of some kind and the music seemed right what hed done wasnt real to him any more it was a part of a drama and it needed the appropriate soundtrack next he made sure hed tidied everything up then he left he noticed the stains on the dress but could do nothing about them at least his coat would cover him up until he got home and formed a clear plan he was just about to burn the dress when he had a better idea he knew it would be missed if he simply destroyed it marcia was in charge of costumes and he knew she was careful and diligent that was when he came up with the idea of a breakin theres been a lot of vandalism in the area lately and he saw it would make a perfect cover for getting rid of the evidence remember he had no idea he would end up killing anyone and ruining the dress when he first put it on and went out but now he had a serious problem he went back later that night careful not to be seen this time broke in scrawled a little of the usual graffiti and snipped up the dresses he also replaced the wig and the shoes which hed cleaned carefully when he got home he snipped his coat into small pieces and burned them in a metal wastebin a bit at a time after that he cut the sleeves and part of the front off the dress hed worn and burned them too he missed a few tiny spots but the dress was a dark burgundy colour so they were very difficult to see and that was it all he had to do was try to stay cool when the questions started that was easy enough for someone with actors training especially as he seemed so able most of the time to divorce himself from the reality of what hed done it had been an act a role like any other and there was no reason why we should connect the breakin with the murder how did you catch him veronica asked it was partly the play at least that started me thinking about the possibility of someone dressing up and there were a few other clues that report about the woman visitor wearing high heels on such a snowy night the vandals denying that they had wrecked the community centre marcia being unable to find the missing pieces of that particular dress not to mention that i was running out of other suspects but he didnt tell victoria that susan gay had known about the cut up dress for two days and hadnt thought it important enough to mention nor that he hadnt read her report on the vandals until conran had already been caught he had been too concerned about susan to stop in at the station and check and as it turned out his instinct had been right how is she veronica asked when banks had told her about the scene at conrans house shell be all right sandra acted quickly and got her breathing she wont be talking or eating real food for a while how does she feel i dont know sandras still with her at the hospital along with superintendent gristhorpe shes sedated right now but when she comes round shell probably be very hard on herself he shrugged i dont know how shell deal with it and he didnt susan had made mistakes yes but mistakes that could be easily understood everyone new to the job made them after all why on earth should she link a partially destroyed dress to a murder but no matter what anyone said she would go on believing that she should have linked them should have known but she should at least have passed on the information and verbally too not only in a routine report that might get stuck at the bottom of the chief inspectors intray for days especially when he was busy on a murder investigation and banks should have read the report in a perfect world he would have done but police perhaps more than anyone else get notoriously behind in their paperwork and so mistakes are made susans career hung in the balance and banks couldnt guess which way it would go certainly he would support her as far as he could but it would be her own decisions and actions that counted in the long run her own strength it all seems so pointless veronica said so absolutely bloody senseless it was banks agreed murder often is he put down his glass and reached for his coat im glad you told me she said i mean im glad you came right away like you said you would what are you going to do now ill go back to bed dont worry about me i probably wont be able to sleep but your jobs over you dont have to take care of me i mean in the future have you any plans veronica uncurled her legs and got to her feet rubbing her calves to restore the circulation i dont know she said maybe a holiday or maybe ill just struggle on with work and life ill manage she said attempting a smile im a survivor banks fastened his coat and headed for the door veronica held it open for him once again she said thank you for coming on impulse banks leaned forward and kissed her cool forehead she gave him a puzzled look then smiled he hesitated on the path and looked back at her he could think of nothing else to say if conran were mad his actions might have been easier to explain or to dismiss madmen did strange and evil things and nobody knew why it just happened that way but he wasnt mad he was highly strung egotistical with a deeprooted fear of his own latent homosexuality but he wasnt mad he had sat at that desk in bankss office and spilled his heart out for over an hour before banks disgusted with the mans whining selfpity had left the task for phil richmond to finish veronicas face shadowed by the halls soft light looked drawn but determined she held herself stiffly arms crossed yet there seemed a supple strength in her limbs to match the strength in her spirit perhaps that was why he liked her she tried she wasnt afraid to face things she made an effort at life at the end of oakwood mews banks remembered the walkman in his pocket he needed music not so much as the food of love but as something to soothe the savage breast the tape he had in was at the last movement of messiaens quartet for the end of time that eerie fractured and haunting music would do just fine for the walk home in his other pocket he felt the catapult he had confiscated from the kid on the riverbank and forgotten about he walked up to the market square listening to the music piano chords sounded like icicles falling and the violin notes stretched so tight they felt as if they would snap any second as he walked he thought about veronica shildon who had tried to face some difficult truths and start a new life he thought about how that life had been shattered just like the ice under his feet by a stupid drunken pointless act lust beyond reason and about how she would go about putting it together again veronica was right she was a survivor and shakespeare was right too lust often is murderous bloody full of blamesavage extreme cruel not to trust banks passed the police station with hardly a glance sometimes the formality of the job and its cold calculated procedures just didnt reflect what really happened the pain people felt the pain banks felt perhaps the rites and rituals of the job the forms to be filled
