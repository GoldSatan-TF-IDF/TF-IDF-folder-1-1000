jonathan kellerman survival of the fittest book in the alex delaware series to my parents david and sylvia kellerman special thanks to detectives paul bishop and vic pietrantoni and to dr j david smith hooray for hollywood brass stars with celebrities names were inlaid in the sidewalk but the stars of the night were toxin merchants strongarm specialists and fifteenyearolds running from family values turned vicious open twentyfour hours a day gojis welcomed them all the coffee shop sat on the north side of hollywood boulevard east of vine between a tattoo parlor and a thrashmetal bar at am a mexican boy was sweeping the sidewalk when nolan dahl pulled his cruiser into the front loading zone the boy lacked documentation but the sight of the policeman didnt alter his rhythm cops could care less about inmigración from what the boy had observed after a month no one in la cared much about anything nolan dahl locked the blackandwhite and entered the restaurant sauntering the way only pounds of young muscular cop laden with baton belt radio flashlight and holstered ninemillimeter could saunter the place smelled rancid and the aisle of deep red carpet between the ducttaped orange booths was stained beyond redemption dahl settled at the rear allowing himself a view of the filipino cashier the next booth was occupied by a twentythreeyearold pimp from compton named terrell cochrane and one of his employees a chubby sixteenyearold mother of two named germadine batts formerly of checkpoint oklahoma fifteen minutes ago the two had sat around the corner in terrells white lexus where germadine had rolled up a blue spangled legging and shot fifteen dollars worth of tar heroin into a faltering ankle vein now nicely numbed and hypoglycemic she was on her second diluted jumbo coke sucking ice and fooling with the pink plastic stirrer terrell had mixed heroin and cocaine into a speedball and was feeling as perfectly balanced as a tightrope walker he slouched forked holes in his cheeseburger simulated the olympic logo with five flaccid onion rings while pretending not to watch the big blond cop nolan dahl couldnt have cared less about either of them or the five other things scattered around the bright room elevator rock played softly a slim pretty waitress the color of molasses hurried down the aisle and stopped at nolans booth smiling nolan smiled back waved away a menu and asked for coconut cream pie and coffee please new on the night shift asked the waitress shed come from ethiopia five years ago and spoke beautiful english with a pleasant accent nolan smiled again and shook his head hed been working hollywood night shift for three months but had never patronized gojis getting his sugar rush from a dunkin on highland recommended by wes baker cops and doughnuts big joke never seen you before officer dahl well he said lifes full of new experiences the waitress laughed well hmm she left for the pastry counter and nolan watched her before shifting his blue eyes making contact with terrell cochrane scruffy thing nolan dahl was twentyseven and had been formed to a large extent by tv before joining the force his notion of pimps had been red velvet suits and big hats with feathers soon hed learned you couldnt prepare for anything anything he scanned terrell and the hooker who had to be a minor this month the pimp was into coarse oversized insipid plaid shirts over black tshirts abbreviated cornrows above shaved temples last month had been black leather before that african prince the cops stare bothered terrell hoping it was someone else under scrutiny he looked across the aisle at the three transsexuals giggling and whispering and making a big deal out of eating french fries he eased back to the cop the cop was smiling at him a weird smile almost sad what did that mean terrell returned to his burger feeling a little out of balance the ethiopian waitress brought nolans order and watched as he tasted a forkful of pie good he said though the coconut tasted like bad piñacolada mix and the cream was gluey he was a practiced culinary liar as a kid when his mother had served swill hed said delish along with helena and dad anything else officer dahl not for now thanks nothing youve got okay just let me know nolan smiled again and she left terrell cochrane thought that smile one happy fucker no reason for a cop to be happy ceptin he busted some rodney with no video going nolan ate more pie and again aimed his smile at terrell then he shrugged the pimp looked sideways at germadine by now nodding halfcomatose into her coke few minutes more bitch then back outside for more gravelknee the cop ate the rest of the pie finished his coffee and his water and the waitress was there right away with refills bitch after bringing terrells and germadines food shed mostly ignored them terrell lifted his burger and watched her say something to the cop the cop just kept smiling and shaking his head the bitch gave the cop his check and the cop gave her money and she turned all grinny a twenty keep it was the reason fuckers always tipped big but this all that smiling must be celebrating something the cop looked into his empty coffee cup then something came out from under the table his gun he was smiling at terrell again showing him the gun the cops arm stretched terrells bowels gave way as he ducked under the table not bothering to push down on germadines head though hed had plenty of practice doing that the other patrons saw terrells dive the transsexuals and the drunken longhaul truck driver behind them and the toothless senile ninetyyearold man in the first booth everyone ducked except the ethiopian waitress whod been talking to the filipino cashier she stared too terrified to move nolan dahl nodded at the waitress smiled she thought a sad smile whats with this guy nolan closed his eyes almost as if he were praying opening them he slid the ninemillimeter between his lips and sucking like a baby fixed his gaze on the waitresss pretty face she was still unable to move he saw her terror softened his eyes trying to let her know it was okay the only way a beautiful black final image god this place smelled crappy he pulled the trigger helena dahl gave me a mourners account the rest i got from the papers and from milo the young cops suicide merited only two inches on page with no followup but the flashpoint violence stayed with me and when milo called a few weeks later and asked me to see helena i said that one any idea yet why he did it nope thats probably what she wants to talk about rick says dont feel obligated alex shes a nurse at cedars worked with him in the er and doesnt want to see the inhouse shrinks but its not like shes a close friend has the department done its own investigation probably you havent heard anything those kinds of things are kept quiet and im not exactly in the loop only thing ive heard is the kid was different quiet stuck to himself read books books i said well theres a motive for you he laughed guns dont kill introspection does i laughed back but i thought about that helena dahl called me that evening and i arranged to see her in my home office the following morning she arrived precisely on time a tall handsome woman of thirty with very short straight blond hair and sinewy arms exposed by a navy blue tank top the tank was tucked into jeans and she wore tennies without socks her face was a lean oval wellsunned her eyes light blue her mouth exceptionally wide no jewelry no wedding ring she gave my hand a firm shake tried to smile thanked me for seeing her then followed me the new house is set up for therapy i take patients in through a side door crossing the japanese garden and passing the fish pond people usually stop to look at the koi or at least comment but she didnt inside she sat very straight with her hands on her knees most of my work involves children caught up in the court system and a portion of the office is set aside for play therapy she didnt look at the toys this is the first time ive done this her voice was soft and low but it carried some authority an er nurse would make good use of that even after my divorce i never talked to anyone she added i really dont know what i expect maybe to make some sense of it i said gently you think thats possible you may be able to learn more but some questions can never be answered well at least youre honest shall we get right into it if youre ready i dont know what i am but why waste time its you know about the basic details i nodded there was really no warning dr delaware he was such a then she cried then she spilled it out nolan was smart she said i mean seriously smart brilliant so the last thing youd think hed end up being was a cop no offense to ricks friend but thats not exactly what comes to mind when you think intellectual right milo had a masters degree in literature i said so nolan was an intellectual definitely how much education did he have two years of college cal state northridge psychology major as a matter of fact he didnt finish he had trouble finishing things maybe it was rebellion our parents were heavily into education maybe he just got sick of classes i dont know im three years older was already working by the time he dropped out no one expected him to join the police the only thing i can think of is hed gotten politically conservative real lawandorder but still the other thing is he always loved sleaze sleaze spooky stuff the dark side of things as a kid he was always into horror movies really gross stuff the grossest his senior year in high school he went through a stage where he grew his hair long and listened to heavy metal and pierced his ears five times my parents were convinced he was into satanism or something was he who knows but you know parents did they hassle him no that wasnt their style they just rode it out tolerant unassertive nolan always did what he wanted she cut the sentence short whered you grow up i said the valley woodland hills my father was an engineer worked at lockheed passed away five years ago my mother was a social worker but never worked shes gone too a stroke a year after dad died she had hypertension never took care of it she was only sixty but maybe shes the lucky one not having to know what nolan did her hands balled any other family i said no just nolan and me he never married and im divorced no kids my ex is a doctor she smiled big surprise gary s a pulmonologist basically a nice guy but he decided he wanted to be a farmer so he moved to north carolina you didnt want to be a farmer not really but even if i did he didnt ask me along her eyes shot to the floor so youre bearing all this alone i said yup where was i oh the satanic nonsense no big deal it didnt last long and then nolan got back to normal teenage stuff school sports girls his car did he maintain his taste for the dark side probably not i dont know why i brought that up what do you think about the way nolan did it using his service gun she winced i meant so publically in front of all those people like saying screw you to the world maybe that was his message i thought it was theatrical she said as if she hadnt heard was he a theatrical person hard to say he was very goodlooking big made an impression the kind of guy you noticed when he entered a room did he milk that maybe a bit when he was a kid as an adult the truth is dr delaware nolan and i lost touch we were never close and now more tears as a little kid he always enjoyed being the center of attention but other times he didnt want anything to do with anybody just crawled into his own little space moody a family trait she rubbed her knees and looked past me my dad underwent shock therapy for depression when nolan and i were in grade school we were never told what was going on just that he was going into the hospital for a couple of days but after he died mom told us how many treatments did he have i dont know three maybe four when hed come home hed be wiped out fuzzy about remembering like what you see in headinjury patients they say ect works better now but im sure it damaged his brain he faded in middle age took early retirement sat around reading and listening to mozart he must have been severely depressed to get ect i said must have been but i never really saw it he was quiet sweet shy what was his relationship with nolan there wasnt much of one that i could see even though nolan was gifted he was into typical macho stuff sports surfing cars dads idea of recreation was she smiledreading and listening to mozart did they have conflict dad never had conflict with anyone how did nolan react to your fathers death he cried at the funeral afterward we both tried to comfort mom for a while then he just drifted away again she pinched her lower lip i didnt want nolan to have one of those big lapd funerals gun salutes all that crap no one at the department argued like they were happy not to deal with it i had him cremated he left a will all his stuff is mine dads and moms stuff too im the survivor too much pain i backtracked what was your mother like more outgoing than dad not moody on the contrary she was always up cheerful optimistic probably why she stroked out holding it all inside she rubbed her knee again i dont want to make our family sound weird we werent nolan was a regular guy partying chasing girls just smarter he got as without working what did he do after dropping out of college bummed around worked different jobs then all of a sudden he calls me announces hes graduated from the police academy i hadnt heard from him since mom died when was this about a year and a half ago he told me the academy was a joke mickey mouse hed graduated high in his class he said hed called me just to let me know in case i happened to see him drive by in a car i shouldnt be freaked out was he assigned to hollywood from the beginning no west la thats why he thought i might see him at cedars he might come in to the er with a suspect or a victim in case i happened to see him what shed described was less a family than a series of accidental pairings what kind of jobs did he work before he joined lapd construction auto repair crewing on a fishing boat off santa barbara that i remember because mom showed me some fish hed brought her halibut she liked smoked fish and he had some halibut smoked what about relationships with women he had girlfriends in high school but after that i dont know can i walk around sure she got up covered the room in small choppy steps everything always came easy to nolan maybe he just wanted to take the easy way out maybe that was the problem he wasnt prepared for when things didnt come easy do you know of specific problems he was having no no i dont know anything i was just thinking back to high school i used to agonize over algebra and nolan would waltz into my room look over my shoulder and tell me the answer to an equation three years younger he must have been eleven but he could figure it out she stopped faced a bookshelf when rick silverman gave me your name he told me about his friend on the force and we got into a discussion of the police rick said it was a paramilitary organization nolan always wanted to be noticed why would he be attracted to something so conformist maybe he got tired of being noticed i said she stood there for a while sat back down maybe im doing this because i feel guilty for not being closer to him but he never seemed to want to get close even if you had been close you couldnt have prevented it youre saying its a waste of time to try to stop someone from killing themselves its always important to try to help and many people who are stopped never attempt again but if someones determined to do it theyll eventually succeed i dont know if nolan was determined i dont know him she burst into loud racking sobs when she quieted i handed her a tissue and she snatched it and slapped it against her eyes i hate this i dont know if i can keep doing this i said nothing looking to the side she said im his executor after mom died the lawyer handling our parents estate said we should each write a will she laughed estate the house and a bunch of junk we rented out the house split the money then after my divorce i asked nolan if i could live there send him half the rent he wouldnt take it said he didnt need it didnt need anything was that a warning sign before i could answer she stood again how much more time do we have twenty minutes would you mind if i left early shed parked a brown mustang off the property out on the bridle trial that snakes up from beverly glen the morning air was hot and dusty the smell of pines from the neighboring ravine piercing and cleansing thanks she said unlocking the car would you like to make another appointment she got in and lowered the window the car was spotless empty except for two white uniforms hanging over a rear door can i get back to you i need to check the oncall schedule patients version of dont call me ill call you of course thanks again dr delaware ill be in touch she sped away and i returned to the house thinking about the meager history shed given me nolan too smart to be a cop but plenty of cops were smart other characteristics athletic macho dominant attracted to the dark side fit the police stereotype a few years bumming around before seeking the security of a city job and a pension rightwing political views id have liked to hear more about that shed also described a partial family history of serious mood disorder a cop judged different by his peers that could add to the alienation brought about by the job nolans life sounded full of alienation so even though his sister was understandably shocked no big surprises so far nothing that came close to explaining why nolan had sucked his gun at gojis not that i was likely to get any closer to it because the way shed left told me it would probably be a oneshot deal in my business you learn to make do with unanswered questions milo called two days later at am they just gave me another cold one alex im not sure i can pay you though we did get brownie points on the last thing so maybe the last thing was the murder of a psychology professor stalked and stabbed a few yards from her home in westwood thinking it unsolvable after months of no leads milo s superiors had handed it to him as punishment for being the only openly gay detective in lapd wed learned a few secrets about the victim and hed managed to close the file well i dont know i said why the hell should i do you any favors he laughed because im such a pleasant fellow i simulated a gameshow buzzer try again because youre a shrink and committed to unconditional acceptance dont go on jeopardy whats the case i heard him sigh a kid alex fifteen years old oh i know how you feel about that but this is an important one if you have any time at all id appreciate tossing things around sure i said come over right now he showed up carrying a box of files wearing a turquoise polo shirt that proclaimed his gut wrinkled brown jeans scarred beige desert boots his weight had stabilized at around most of it distributed around the middle of his sixthree frame his hair was freshly cut in his usual style though to use style in conjunction with milo was a felony clipped short at the sides and back shaggy on top sideburns to the earlobes gray was winning the battle with black and the sideburns were nearly white hes nine months older than i am and sometimes looking at him reminds me time is passing he put the box down on the kitchen table his pocked face was chalky and his green eyes lacked spark a long night or several of them looking at the refrigerator he frowned need i spell it out solid or liquid i said been working on this since six so both youre the doctor he stretched and sat heavily and i heard the chair creak i fixed him a cold roast beef sandwich and brought it over along with a quart of milk he ate and drank quickly and exhaled noisily the box was filled to the top looks like plenty of data dont confuse quantity with quality pushing his plate away he began removing bound folders and rubberbanded stacks arranged them neatly on the table the victim is a girl named irit carmeli fifteen slightly retarded thirteen weeks ago someone abducted her and killed her during a school field trip up in the santa monica mountains some nature conservancy owned by the city her school goes there every year the idea is to get a little beauty into the kids lives are all the kids retarded all with some kind of problem its a special school he ran a hand over his face as if washing without water heres how it lays out the kids were dropped off near the entrance by a chartered bus and hiked about a halfmile into the park it gets thickly wooded pretty quickly but there are marked pathways for novice hikers the kids ran around for an hour or so had snacks bathroom breaks then reboarded almost two hours had lapsed by then they called roll irit wasnt there they went looking for her couldnt find her d westside division who sent a couple of units but they couldnt find her either and called for k backup it took half an hour for the dogs to get there another half to sniff her out the body was about a mile away lying in a pine grove no overt signs of violence no ligature striations no subdermal hemorrhaging no swelling no blood except for the positioning they would have assumed shed had a seizure or something like that sexual positioning no show you in a second the coroner found bruising on the hyoid and the sternohyoid and the pharyngeal muscles no sexual assault strangulation i said why no external marks coroner said you can get that when the chokeforce is spread out over a broad area using a soft ligature like a rolledup towel or a clothed forearm gentle strangulation they call it grimacing he removed the top file and flipped it open to two pages of snapshots in plastic stripfasteners some were of the surrounding forest the rest were of the girl thin and fairhaired she wore a white tshirt with lace trim around the neck and sleeves blue jeans white socks pink plastic shoes very thin pipecleaner limbs the elbows prominent as if recently enlarged by a growth spurt i would have guessed her age at twelve not fifteen lying on her back brown earth beneath her arms at her sides feet pressed together too symmetrical to have fallen arranged i studied a facial closeup eyes closed mouth slightly parted the dirtyblond hair long and very curly and spread on the ground more arrangement someone taking the time playing back to the fullbody shot her hands were next to her thighs palms up curled open as if asking why insipid olivegray shadows washed across the pale face like brushstrokes light filtering through the trees above my chest felt clogged and i started to close the file then i noticed something small and pink near the girls right ear whats that hearing aid she was also deaf partially in one ear totally in the other jesus i put the file down irit carmeli is that italian israeli her fathers a honcho at the israeli consulate which is why the departments inability to develop a single lead in three months is problematic three months i said i never read about it in the papers it wasnt in the papers diplomatic pull sounds like a very cold case any colder and id be wearing fur any gut impressions he took his time with her i said meaning he probably abducted her fairly soon after she arrived whens the last time anyone saw her no ones sure from the moment they let them off the bus it was chaos kids running all over the place that was the point of the conservancy the school had gone there before thought it was a safe place for the kids to run loose and explore howd the murderer get in without being noticed probably a backroad the place is full of them on three sides access from the valley side santa monica and from sunset theres a thick belt of trees between the hiking area and the nearest road so youd need to know your way around meaning the piece of shit was familiar with the area either hiked or drove if he drove he parked at a distance because the roads closest to the murder scene were clean no tracks he parks walks through the trees finds a spot where he can see the kids watches i said any tracks on more distant roads nothing that could be identified because you get heavy enough traffic to blur everything and i cant tell you they checked every square inch of the park early because in the beginning it wasnt a crime scene it was a missing kid in addition to the ks and the teachers and the park rangers her father came over with a whole posse of consulate people and everything got pretty much trampled what about at the scene itself not a trace of anything physical except for a few pieces of straw that the lab says came from a broom looks like the scumbag swept up the area around her a neat one i said compulsive that fits the way he arranged the body i forced myself to look at the photographs again picturing a fiendish face bent over the girl but thats not the way it was it always came down to people not monsters arranging manipulating sweeping up strangulation and positioning are usually sexual i said no assault at all nothing she was a virgin and you know how sex fiends usually position spreading the legs displaying the genitals this was just the opposite alex first time i saw the pictures she looked unreal like a doll playing with dolls my voice was low and hoarse sorry for dropping this one on you he said how retarded was she the file says slightly abducted without a sound and carried a mile from the group how much did she weigh eighty pounds so were talking someone strong i said is the theory that she wandered off the path just happened to be unlucky thats one of them the other is that he picked her for some reason as far as no sound he could have clamped his hand over her mouth and carried her away though if he did clamp it wasnt hard no finger marks not a bruise anywhere so no evidence of any resistance on her part he shook his head was she mute as well as deaf she spoke but not clearly and her main language was hebrew but she had the capacity to scream i assume he finished the milk and crushed the carton watching til he found a victim i said stalking the herd and picking off a weak one how many other kids were in the group fortytwo plus four teachers and two aides some of the kids were in wheelchairs and needed close supervision another reason the kids who could run around had lots of freedom still i said all those people and no one saw anything he shook his head again and pointed to the files everyones been talked to twice three times teachers the bus driver kids to the extent they could talk how often do they come to the conservancy once a year for the past five was the trip prearranged with the park he nodded lots of schools come up there so someone familiar with the park would know disabled kids were due to visit easy victims the first guys on the case gorobich and ramos interviewed every park and school employee as well as former employees the only criminal records they found was some old dui stuff on a couple of the gardeners and their alibis all checked out sounds like they were thorough both were competent and a kid victim plus a diplomat father made the case highpriority but they came up with nada and last week they got pulled and transferred to auto theft calls from above so now theyre trading two detectives for one i said i know youre good but yeah yeah i asked the same thing lieutenant just shrugged and said what sturgis you mean youre not a genius only thing i can think of is the israelis figure all the teamwork scuts been done they want to keep it lowkey so some arab terrorist wont get ideas and declare open season on other consulate kids as to why me he shrugged maybe they heard about the devane solve so youre supposed to clear it quickly but quietly i said quite a mandate it has that smell of futility alex for all i know someones setting me up for a fall lieutenant was sure smiling a lot he drummed his fingers on the box i picked out the second file page after page of transcripted interviews with family members teachers lots of stiff wordy cop prose lots of pain seeping through but no revelations i put it down so he said anything else a planner a sneak maybe an outdoors type physically strong possibly a history of child molestation voyeurism exposure smart enough to wait and watch and to sweep up maybe meticulous in his personal habits he didnt assault her so the thrill of the chase probably did it for him stalking and capture picking the weak one out of the herd i said if he did choose irit why with all those other kids what made her the target good question you dont think it could be something to do with her fathers position the father claims no and my feeling is if it was political the israelis would take care of it themselves being a diplomats daughter i said did she have any special security training did her disabilities cause her to be especially gullible gorobich said he asked the father that but the guy brushed him off kept insisting the murder had nothing to do with irit personally that la was a hellhole full of homicidal nuts no one was safe and because he was a vip no one pushed that and basically gorobich and ramos agreed with him it didnt look like anything the kid had brought on herself more like some twisted fuck watched her and snatched her and dispatched her and cleaned up afterward like you said playing big fucking game god i hate when its a kid he got up and paced opened the fridge looked inside closed it peered out the kitchen window have you met the parents yet i said i put a call in today waiting for an appointment three months with no progress i said the grief may have turned completely to rage it may be even more difficult to approach them yeah he said ill tackle that later meanwhile trees dont have feelings so how about taking a look at the scene it was less than a halfhour drive a right turn off sunset past the brentwood intersection with pacific palisades no signs sometimes people who love nature dont think other people should disrupt it a suburban street lined with middlesized ranch homes led to a brushshaded singlelane road that kept narrowing a school bus would be scraped by branches the gate was steel painted ballparkmustard yellow latched but not locked the first sign orange cityissue specified visiting hours opening time was an hour away i got out released the latch returned to the unmarked and we drove through more foliagebanked asphalt we pressed on rolling on dirty hardpack now as the brush turned to pines cedar cypress sycamore trees planted so close together they formed deep green walls nearly black just the faintest delineation of branch and leaf anyone or anything could hide back there the road ended in a spoonshaped clearing faded white lines marked off a dozen parking spots and milo slid into one behind the lot was a tenfoot strip of dry clipped grass upon which sat three rickety picnic tables a udrive mower and several fastened lawn bags stuffed shinyblack beyond the grass more forest i followed milo over the lawn to two signs one atop the other marking the mouth of a dirt path that dipped into the trees above nature hike please stay on trail an arrow pointed left below a picture board behind cloudy plastic displayed leaves berries acorns squirrels rabbits blue jays snakes a warning under the western rattler that when the days grew long and hot the serpents came crawling out for action we began descending the drop was gentle and the trail was terraced in spots soon other paths appeared steeper skinnier branching from the side the trees remained so dense only short portions of walkway resisted the shadows we walked quickly not speaking i was imagining theorizing and the look on milo s face told me he was doing the same ten minutes later he stepped off the trail and entered the forest the pine smell was much stronger here almost artificial like room freshener and the ground beneath our feet was littered with needles and cones we walked for a long time before he stopped at a small clearing that bore no distinction not even a clearing just the space between huge old pines with gray corrugated trunks trunks all around like greek columns the space felt enclosed an outdoor room a crypt someones idea of a death chamber i said so but milo didnt reply i looked around listened bird calls distant insects scattering nothing to see but trees no backroads i asked him about that he hooked a thumb over his shoulder the forest ends about three hundred yards back though you cant see it from here theres an open field then roads then mountains and more roads some eventually link up with highways but most deadend i traipsed around all yesterday walking and driving saw nothing but squirrels couple of big hawks circling hawks so i stopped to check maybe there was something else dead down below nothing no other predators i stared in the direction hed indicated no breaking light not even a suggestion of exit what happened to the body i said buried in israel the family flew over stayed for a week or so came back jewish mourning rituals take a week he raised his eyebrows i said i worked the cancer ward he paced around the clearing looking huge in the dark vaultlike space secluded i said only a mile from the bus but secluded it had to be someone who really knew this place well problem is that doesnt narrow it down very much its public access there are always hikers too bad there were none around that day on the other hand maybe there were he stopped pacing what do you mean the news blackout how would anyone have known to come forward he thought about that gotta talk to the parents though its probably too late maybe you can get them to compromise milo report the murder without identifying irit by name though i agree its unlikely to pay off after all this time he kicked a tree hard muttered walked around some more looked in all directions said anything else i shook my head and we retraced our steps to the parking lot the udrive mower was in use now a darkskinned man in a khaki uniform and pith helmet riding back and forth on the grass strip he turned briefly and kept riding the brim of the helmet shaded his face waste of time said milo starting up the unmarked and backing out you can never tell got time to read some of the files thinking of irit carmelis face i said plenty of time the observer they hadnt paid him any attention he was sure of that waiting until the unmarked car had been gone for twenty minutes he got off the mower tied off the last of the leaf bags got back on and coasted down toward the park entrance stopping a short distance behind the yellow gates he pushed the machine back to the side of the road the park service had never missed it loose procedures very loose the girls misfortune good find the mower a bonus added to the uniform as always the uniform worked perfectly do manual labor in official garb and no one notices you his car a gray toyota cressida with false plates and a handicapped placard in the glove compartment was parked three blocks down a ninemillimeter semiautomatic was concealed in a box under the drivers seat he was lean and light and walked quickly ten feet from the vehicle he disarmed the security system with his remote looked around without appearing to got in and sped off toward sunset turning east when he got there same direction theyd gone a detective and a psychologist and neither had given him a seconds notice the detective was bulky with heavy limbs and sloping shoulders the lumbering trudge of an overfed bull the baggy gnarled face of a bull no a rhinoceros a depressed rhinoceros he looked discouraged already how did that kind of pessimism square with his reputation maybe it fit the guy was a pro he had to know the chance of learning the truth was slim did that make him the sensible one the psychologist was a different story hyperalert eyes everywhere focused quicker and smaller than the detective five ten or so which still put him three inches above the dark man restless he moved with a certain grace a cat hed gotten out of the car before the detective turned the engine off eager achievementoriented unlike the detective the psychologist appeared to take care of himself solidly built curly dark hair a little long but trimmed neatly clear fair skin square jaw the eyes very pale very wide such active eyes if he was that way with patients how could he calm them down maybe he didnt see many patients fancied himself a detective with his blue sportcoat white shirt and pressed khaki pants he looked like one of those professors trying to come across casual that type often faked casual pretending everyone was equal but maintaining a clear sense of rank and position the dark man wondered if the psychologist was like that as he drove toward brentwood he thought again of the mans rapid forward walk lots of energy that one all this time and no one had even gotten close to figuring out what had happened to irit but the psychologist had forged forward maybe the guy was an optimist or just an amateur too ignorant to know better milo dropped me off and returned to the west la station as i headed up the stairs to the front entrance i heard the whine of robins table saw from out back and detoured through the garden to her studio spike our little french bulldog was basking near the door a mound of blackbrindled muscle melting into the welcome mat he stopped snoring long enough to raise his head and stare i rubbed his neck and stepped over him like the house the outbuilding is white stucco compact and simple with lots of windows and a tile roof shaded by sycamore boughs lateral sunlight flooded the clean airy space guitars in various stages of completion were positioned around the room and the spicy resin smell of crisply cut wood seasoned the air robin was guiding a hunk of maple through the saw and i waited to approach until she finished and turned off the machine her auburn curls were tied up in a knot and her apron was filmed with sawdust the tshirt beneath it was sweaty as was her heartshaped face she wiped her hands and smiled i put my arm around her shoulder and kissed her cheek she turned and gave me her mouth then pulled away and wiped her brow learn anything no i told her about the park the leafy vault her brown eyes got huge and she flinched every parents nightmare what next milo asked me to look over the files its been a while since you got involved in something like this alex true better get to work i kissed her forehead and stepped away she watched me go by the end of three hours i learned the following mr and mrs zev carmeli lived in a leased house on a good street in beverlywood with their now only child a sevenyearold boy named oded zev carmeli was born in tel aviv a career foreignservice officer his wife liora was four years younger born in morocco but raised in israel employed as a hebrew teacher at a jewish day school on the west side the family had arrived in la a year ago from copenhagen where carmeli had served for three years as an attaché at the israeli embassy two years before that hed been assigned to the embassy in london and had obtained a masters degree in international relations at london university he and his wife and oded spoke english fluently irit said her father had spoken very well considering all the quotes were from the father the girls health problems had followed an influenzalike illness at the age of six months carmeli referred to his daughter as a little immature but always wellbehaved the term retarded never came up in the files but an educational summary report supplied by her school the center for development indicated multiple learning problems bilateral hearing impairment including total deafness in the right ear and mild to moderate developmental delay as milo had said carmeli was adamant about having no enemies in los angeles and brushed off all questions about his work and the political situation in the middle east detective e j gorobich wrote vs father stated that his job is coordinating events for the consulate i asked for an example and he said hed organized an israel independence day parade last spring when i inquired about any other events hed coordinated he stated there were lots of them but that the parade was a main one when i inquired about possible connections between what had happened to his daughter and his occupationalpolitical position andor activities he became noticeably agitated and stated this wasnt political this was a madman its obvious that you have many madmen in america the center for development was a small private school in santa monica specializing in children with mental and physical handicaps tuition was high and studentteacher ratio was low a school bus had picked irit up each morning at am and dropped her off at pm mrs carmeli taught mornings only and was always home to receive her daughter younger brother oded was enrolled at the school that employed his mother and attended classes til four before the murder hed been taken home by car pool or a consulate employee since the murder mr or mrs carmeli picked him up irits academic records were skimpy no grades no quantitative testing an assessment by her teacher kathy brennan that she was making excellent strides brennan had been interviewed by gorobichs partner detective harold ramos witness stated she feels all torn up and guilty about what had happened to v even though shed gone over the events of the day over and over and hadnt found anything she could have done differently except watch v every second of the day which would have been impossible because there were fortytwo children at the park including some who needed extraspecial care wheelchairs pushed on the paths etc ms brennan also stated that going to the park was a regular thing for the school theyd been doing it for years it was always considered a safe place where kids can just run around for a while and be kids without being watched every second as to whether or not shed seen anything suspicious witness stated she hadnt even though shed been racking her brain witness then stated that deceased was a really nice kid so sweet no problems ever why do the nice ones always have to suffer immediately following this ms brennan broke down and was tearful when asked if she was aware of other nice ones suffering she stated no no you know what i mean all the kids are nice they all have problems its just not fair that someone would do this to a child next came facetoface meetings with every teacher and aide present at the field trip as well as the teachers whod remained at school the principal a dr rothstein the bus driver alonzo burns and several of irits classmates no transcripts of the talks with the children were included instead gorobich and ramos offered fortytwo nearly identical summaries witness salazar rudy nine yo blind interviewed in presence of parents denies any knowledge witness blackwell amanda six yo braces on feet not retarded interviewed in presence of mother denies any knowledge witness shoup todd eleven yo retarded in wheelchair interviewed in presence of mother denies any knowledge end of that folder a thicker one contained interviews with every employee of the park and the results of a doortodoor canvass of the surrounding neighborhood twentyeight employees nearly one hundred neighbors gorobich and ramos had telephonically recontacted every one of them two weeks later with the same results no one had seen or heard anything or anyone unusual in or around the park i reread the coroners files wincing at the term gentle strangulation before moving on to a beefy computer printout the cover stamped with the seal of the state department of justice in sacramento violent crime information network five separate lists of names followed each tabbed labeled with an acronym and subheaded catchment area for all five sections the parks zip code and three adjoining codes were typed on a dotted line sar sex registration shop sexual habitual offenders acas child abuse reports isu mos related to violent crimes srf persons on probationparole from cdccya five databases filled with names and information on sex offenders i counted names some overlaps circled in red ninetyseven offenders including four of the overlaps had been rearrested and were in custody two turquoise circles identified a pair of child murderers out on parole one living three miles from the park the other in bell gardens gorobich and ramos had interviewed both killers immediately and verified strong alibis for the day of the murder the detectives then enlisted the help of three other investigators two civilian clerks and three volunteer police scouts to locate the criminals still out there though none of the names on the doj lists matched any of the park workers neighbors teachers the principal or the bus driver thirtyone men were missing in violation of parole and warrants were issued for their rearrest a handwritten note reported eleven already apprehended the others were contacted and presented alibis of varying strength a note by ramos indicated no strong suspects because no mo matches to this homicide were found among any of these individuals and given the lack of assault and other sexual patterning it is still not clear that this was a sexual homicide i read the mo file carefully with the exception of a few exhibitionists the child molesters had all played with bruised penetrated or somehow made physical contact with their victims and the vast majority had been previously acquainted with their victims daughters sons nieces nephews grandkids stepkids the children of girlfriends drinking buddies neighbors both of the alibied murderers had killed children known to them one had beaten a girlfriends twoyearold daughter to death with his fists the other a woman had intentionally scalded her own son in the bathtub nearly two hundred predators roaming free in this relatively small area why only four zip codes because the detectives couldnt be everywhere and you had to draw the line somewhere would doubling tripling quadrupling the area have accomplished much la was a countrysized sprawl ruled by the car give a stalker some gas money and coffee and he could go anywhere hop on the freeway weave nightmares be back in bed in time for the evening news munching chips and masturbating eyes glued to the headlines hoping for fame aimless driving was one characteristic of sexual sadists but irit hadnt been tortured still maybe we did have a traveler someone who liked the backroads maybe this killer was up in alaska by now fishing salmon or strolling the boardwalk in atlantic city or in new orleans hunkered down in a french quarter club eating gumbo watching for all their numerical precision the printouts seemed primitive i put them down and picked up the next file thin and black still thinking of two hundred predators in four zip codes what kind of society let people who raped and beat children back out on the streets its been a long time alex inside the black file were aerial photographs of the murder scene fluffy greenblack patches of treetop as distant and artificial as an architects design sketch tan laces at the upper periphery the roads capillaries feeding mountains gullies the city sprawl beyond facing the photos was a crisp white letter on fbi stationery dear detective gorobich correspondence from fbi special agent gail gorman of the bureaus behavioral sciences regional unit in san diego gorman acknowledged receipt of the aerial shots the crimescene data and the completed questionnaire but regretted that insufficient information existed for a definitive profile of the killer however she was willing to guess that he was most likely male white over thirty of average to aboveaverage intelligence nonpsychotic probably compulsive and perfectionistic presenting a neat clean unremarkable appearance probably employed at the present though possibly with an inconsistent or checkered job history with regard to the crime being sexual in nature she repeated the disclaimer of insufficient data and went on to say that despite the obvious organization of the crime the lack of sadistic or vicious elements mitigate against a sexual homicide as does the absence of obvious or covert sexual activity at the scene however should future homicides bearing precisely these signature elements show themselves we would be interested in hearing about them the letter ended by suggesting that victim characteristics should be explored further age ethnicity specific disabilities while this homicide might very well turn out to have been committed by an opportunistic or premeditated stranger the possibility that the victim knew the perpetrator cannot be ruled out and in fact should be looked into though once again this is only a suggestion not a conclusion factors mitigating against victimperpetrator acquaintance include leaving the body faceup in a location where it would eventually be found factors mitigating for acquaintance include the use of diffuseforce gentle strangulation and other evidence of care and time taken to avoid brutalization and degradation of the body average to aboveaverage organized compulsive perfectionistic that meshed with my first impression a planner someone who took pride in setting things up and watching the elements fall into place taking his time spiriting irit a mile from the bus so hed have time it implied a certain relaxation selfconfidence arrogance someone who believed he was clever because hed gotten away with it before no mo match existed in any of the state files had he evaded detection by concealing other bodies going public now more confident i let my mind dance around the data someone who craved control because hed been controlled as a child perhaps brutally maybe he was still under someones thumb a worker bee or submissive spouse faking selfconfidence needing release employed possibly a checkered history agent gorman using sound psychological logic because psychopaths achievements nearly always lagged behind their own inflated selfimages leading to dissonance tension the need for release the ultimate control i thought of a killer id met in graduate school a strangler as it happened locked in a back ward of county general hospital waiting for the court system to evaluate his sanity a professor who earned extra money as an expert witness had taken us to the killers cell a gaunt almost skeletal man in his thirties with sunken cheeks and wispy black hair the strangler lay on a cot restrained by wide leather straps one of my classmates asked him what it felt like to kill the gaunt man ignored the question at first then a slow smile spread across his lips and they darkened like paper held to a flame his victim had been a prostitute whom he hadnt wanted to pay hed never known her name what it feels like he finally said in a disturbingly pleasant voice it feels like nothing its no big fucking deal you stupid asshole its not actually doing it anyway its being able to do it asshole the power opportunistic or premeditated had irits killer known about the annual field trip in advance or was he just aware that the park was frequented by schoolkids were the carmelis right about irits victimization being one of those wrongtimewrongplace horrors of chance that give atheists fuel predator leering as the school bus unloads feeling sweet contentment the way a fox might as it views chicklets hatching every parents nightmare picking a weak one out of the herd but why irit special agent gorman had suggested the girls disabilities but irits problems werent obvious to the casual observer on the contrary shed been an attractive child no shortage of other kids with more conspicuous handicaps was that the cue the fact that she looked normal then i remembered the hearing aid on the ground despite all the care taken to arrange the body not an accident the more i thought about it the more certain i became leaving the pink disc behind a message communicating what i grabbed up the mo file again looked for crimes committed against deaf people nothing had the hearing aid told him irit was the easiest target of all less likely to be aware as he came up behind her less likely to scream she wasnt mute but maybe hed assumed she was gentle strangulation the phrase disgusted me care and time taken to avoid degradation of the body no sex at the scene but perhaps hed gone elsewhere to get off masturbating to memories as sex killers usually do but sex killers often used trophies to trigger memories clothing jewelry body parts the breasts were a favorite irits body had been left pristine nothing taken posed almost primly expressly unsexual as if the killer wanted the world to know she hadnt been touched that he was different or maybe he had taken something something unobtrusive undetectable a few strands of hair or had the souvenirs been the images themselves photos snapped at the scene and pocketed for later i pictured him faceless standing over her tumescent with power arranging posing snap snap creating a tableau a hideous art form polaroids or a private darkroom where he could modulate optical nuance a selfstyled artiste taking irit far enough from the path so no one would hear the click see the flash cleaning up obsessive but not psychotic you have many madmen in america i reread sa gormans letter everything else in the box for all the hundreds of pages something was missing the carmelis friends and neighbors hadnt been interviewed neither had mrs carmeli and her husband had been contacted only twice both times briefly respect for the grieving or softglove treatment for a diplomat now months later a dead end my head hurt and my lungs burned id been at it for nearly three hours as i got up to make coffee the phone rang the operator at my service said a ms dahl is on the line doctor ill take it thanks dr delaware its helena i just got my oncall schedule for the week so i thought id try for an appointment do you have anything in two days maybe around ten in the morning i checked several court reports were due how about eleven eleven would be fine thank you hows everything going helena oh about as well as can be expected i guess im going through a point where i really miss him more than i did right after anyway thanks for seeing me bye bye i wrote down the appointment so much for clinical predictions what was the chance i could do better for a dead girl how fard you get milo asked the next morning it was am and we were drinking orange juice in my office all of it i lifted the offender printout new system funded by sacramento in response to the victims rights movement great idea but so far reporting procedures are sloppy and lots of cities la included dont have a system in place also most cops are scared of computers so the best way to get info is still the horn and teletypes whatd you think of the fbi letter nothing i disagree with but agent gormans careful not to commit herself so what else is new i told him my conception of the murderer the possibility that photos had been taken polaroids or a darkroom he said a professional photographer or a serious amateur someone with artistic pretensions theres something pretentious about the crime milo fussy arranging the body sweeping up a psychopath who wants to believe hes something else but all thats predicated upon it being a sex crime you dont think it was gorman may be right about its having something to do with irits background rather than being just a random thing when gorobich and ramos did something they were thorough its what they didnt do thats off all those interviews with park neighbors but none in beverlywood the father talked to twice the mother not at all he wiped his face a family thing most kids are killed by relatives something about these parents comes across creepy just how little attention theyve received and how little information theyve offered a parent hiding in that forest it would have to be the father cause the mother wouldnt be strong enough to carry irit that far and i know for sure it wasnt the father because when the call came in about irits being missing he was at the consulate in a meeting okay i said any other relatives besides the younger brother dont know he put his big hands on the side of the box and rocked it its too weird anyway alex when relatives kill kids you know its almost always at home or some family outing ive never heard of them stalking like this i know gorobich and ramos didnt turn over every rock but they claim there was nothing off about the carmelis just parents destroyed by the worst possible scenario add vip to the picture and you could see why they wouldnt want to pry too hard makes sense i said get a callback from mr carmeli yet nope and i cant wait to tackle that one little old moi crashing the halls of diplomacy the image made me smile what he said the tie the tie was a limp narrow strip of bluegreen pseudosilk too short to stretch the hump of his belly and flippedup at the tip perfect with the beigeandblackstriped shirt and the faded olive sportcoat i used to think he didnt know better but a month ago robin and i had gone with him to the art museum and he had looked at the pictures the way someone who understands pictures does talking about how much he liked the ashcan painters why fauvism stank because of the vulgar colors after all these years i was beginning to suspect the way he dressed was intentional a distraction so people would think him inept the tie i said could cause an international incident why are you planning a dropin you know me mr spontaneous when soon as possible want to come along no doubt youve got a diplomatically correct foulard in fact do you have one to lend me more orange juice too long as youre up i lent him a conservative paisley and we took the unmarked the israeli consulate was on wilshire near crescent heights on the top floor of a faceless seventeenstory tower the first three floors were parking lot and milo drove in ignored the wait for valet sign and pulled into a space near the elevator pocketing the keys he shoved a bill at the flustered attendant flashed his badge and called out have a nice day we rode up the interior halls were narrow white free of decoration topped by a low gray waterspotted acoustical ceiling the carpeting was mint green with a faint dot pattern both needed cleaning and wallpaper seams had come loose in spots lots of doors mostly white and blank at the end of the corridor was a tv camera aimed at the last door a brown plastic sign announced the presence of the consulate and the israeli tourist office and spelled out hours for visa applications just to the right was another plaque the blueandwhite israeli flag and below that a plateglass window with a steel document tray a call button and a speaker a young blackhaired man in a blue blazer white shirt and tie sat behind the glass his features were sharp and his hair was thick and cropped to the skull he was reading a magazine and didnt look up until milo pushed the button yes mr carmeli do you have an appointment middle eastern accent milo produced the badge again drop it in please the badge hit the tray and slid into the reception booth a steel shutter dropped over the slot the guard inspected the badge looked at milo held up a finger got up and disappeared the magazine was sports illustrated behind the booth was a nest of white cubicles and i could see two women and one man working at computers a few travel posters hung on the walls everything looked just a bit off cloudy refracted through the inchthick glass the young man came back a moment later hes in a meeting this is about the young man smiled and held up a finger again but he said hell be out soon he sat down and returned to the world of soccer doing us a big favor mumbled milo a lowpitched whine sounded above the camera rotated aiming at us milo pushed the button again and the young man looked up my badge mr carmeli has it we stood in the hall as the guard read a heavy black woman in blue blazer and gray slacks came from around the corner and walked down the hall glancing at doors she saw us and turned around three minutes passed four five the guard picked up a phone listened put it back down five more minutes until one of the white doors opened and a tall pale man came out into the corridor stooped with round shoulders he wore a gray nailhead doublebreasted suit baby blue shirt and maroon tie the shirts collar was too big and the suit bagged his cheeks were sunken and the bones of his hawk face were oversized and painfully obvious wavy brown hair was neatly trimmed and thinning at the crown he wore heavy blackframed eyeglasses zev carmeli handshakes were cursory his fingers were long and very cold the glasses were bifocals thirtyeight but he looked ten years older milo started to speak but carmeli interrupted him by returning the badge and turning to point down the hall leading us to another of the white doors he unlocked it and motioned us into a windowless room set up with a brown sofa danish teak coffee table with brass ashtray a pair of chrome and browntweed armchairs blue carpeting still nothing on the walls behind the couch was another white door doublebolted milo and i took the chairs as carmeli relocked the outer door reaching in his coat he placed a hardpack of dunhills and a matchbook that said learn at home to be a court reporter on the table he sat down on the couch and lit up inhaling for a long time while studying the grain of the tabletop his movements were slow and steady as if everything required careful planning he kept smoking finally looked at us his eyes were as black as the eyeglass frames still and flat as a stain the room fogged with nicotine then i heard an air conditioner kick in and smoke began rising toward a duct in the ceiling carmeli hiked his trousers up over black socks his fingertips were stained amber so he said to milo you are the new detective lighter accent than the guards middle east tempered by uppercrust london milo sturgis sir pleased to meet you carmeli glanced at me this is dr delaware said milo our psychological consultant i expected some reaction but carmeli gave none finally he raised the flat black eyes til they met mine another lungful of smoke good morning doctor everything on delay everything an effort id met too many families of dead children to be surprised you will be analyzing the murderer doctor i nodded and anything else that bears analyzing said milo carmeli didnt react were sorry for your loss sir have you learned anything not yet sir i just got the files i thought id start by touching base and touching base said carmeli softly we are playing baseball your predecessors touched base with me as well unfortunately they struck out milo didnt answer the cigarette was only halfsmoked but carmeli crushed it out both of his feet were flat on the ground he drew them closer to the couch and his knees pointed sharply through his trousers the shirt collar at least one full size too big his adams apple unusually sharpedged like a blade threatening to rip through his neck a thin man whod lost lots of weight new cigarette i noticed the dark smudges under his eyes his fingers squeezing the paper cylinder so tightly it was almost an l the other hand rested on the couch curled into a fist a nohitter he said so we are touching base what would you like to know mr sturgis first of all is there anything you want to tell me carmeli stared at him anything said milo thats occurred to you since detectives gorobich and ramos spoke to you continuing to stare carmeli straightened the bent cigarette then lit up and shook his head a very soft no emerged from clenched lips nothing then ill ask a few questions sir please understand that some of them may be repet carmeli cut him off with a wave of the cigarette smoke ribboned ask ask mr sturgis your work sir the middle east situation im sure you receive threats carmeli laughed without changing the shape of his mouth im not james bond detective my title is deputy consul for community liaison did your predecessors tell you what that means they said something about organizing events the israel independence day parade parades israelbond luncheons meetings at synagogues talking to hadassah ladies do you know what hadassah is milo nodded dear ladies said carmeli lovely people who plant trees in israel when wealthy donors want to have lunch with the consul general i arrange it when the prime minister comes to town to meet with the wealthiest of donors i organize his itinerary doubleoeight license to cater the free hand shot through his thinning hair so youre saying you never encounter im saying theres nothing controversial or dangerous about my work mr sturgis im saying what happened to my daughter had nothing to do with my work or my wifes work or our family and i dont understand why the police simply cant accept that his voice had risen but remained soft he leaned his head to the right as if loosening a neck kink the black eyes were unflinching he smoked some more hungrily then again he said ive dealt with your department in the course of my duties oh instead of elaborating carmeli smoked aggressively sometimes said milo we have to be annoying to do our job properly do you yes im afraid asking the same questions over and over ask whatever you please but if you persist in emphasizing my work the answer will be the same im a bureaucrat no exploding pens still sir being israeli you have enemies two hundred million of them though were now on the road to peace right now carmeli smiled then how can you be sure this wasnt political despite your duties youre a representative of the israeli government carmeli didnt answer for several moments looking at his shoes he rubbed the toe of the left one political crimes are based upon hatred and the arabs hate us and there are thousands of arabs in this city some of them with strong political views but the goal of even the most violent terrorist is to send a message in a way that will attract attention not one dead child mr sturgis a busload of children copious amounts of blood disarticulated limbs tv cameras recording every agonized cry bombs that make noise mr sturgis literally and figuratively several years ago when the palestinians in gaza and the west bank discovered that throwing rocks at our soldiers made them international heroes they began phoning the wire services to give journalists advance notice of impending riots once the film crews showed up he clapped his hands and ash scattered landing on the table his trousers the floor your predecessors detective informed me that the crime was unusual in its lack of violence do you agree with that milo nodded carmeli said that alone convinces me there was nothing political about it that alone said milo is there something else that convinces you interpreting my phrasing mr sturgis i thought he was the psychologist speaking of which have you developed any theories yet doctor not yet i said are we dealing with a madman i glanced at milo he nodded outwardly i said the killer probably looks quite sane and internally hes a mess but clinically hes not mad mr carmeli more likely hes what we call a psychopath someone with a serious character disorder selfcentered lacking normal emotional responses no empathy an incomplete conscience incomplete he has a conscience he knows right from wrong but chooses to ignore the rules when it suits him he rubbed his shoe again and sat up the black eyes narrowed youre describing evil and youre telling me he could be any man on the street i nodded why does he kill doctor whats in it for him relief of tension i said he flinched smoked everyone experiences tension his tension may be especially strong and his wirings off but these are just guesses mr carmeli no one really understands what leads what causes this supposed tension a sexual warp but i didnt say that possibly a gap between who he thinks he is and the way he lives he may pride himself on being brilliant believe hes entitled to fame and fortune but hes probably an underachiever youre saying he kills to feel competent its possible mr carmeli but killing a child makes him feel competent killing makes him feel powerful as does eluding capture but why a child at root hes a coward so he preys upon the weak his head snapped back as if struck the cigarette shook and he jammed it into his mouth smoking he played with a cuff button stared at me again as you said these are guesses yes but if theres any truth to them the killing wont stop will it because his tension wont simply disappear its possible also said carmeli he may have murdered before he turned to milo if thats so why havent the police discovered similar crimes his voice had risen and the words tumbled out snubbing out the second cigarette he used his index finger to shape the ashes on the table into a thin gray line milo said this may be a beginning sir a first crime the killer began with my irit its possible why said carmeli suddenly plaintive why irit we dont know yet sir thats one of the reasons im here to how extensively have you looked for other murders mr sturgis very extensively but were still in the process the process the process your predecessors said theres no central crime computer in california i was incredulous so i checked and verified it carmeli shook his head absurd your department claims to be israel has a population of five million and our crime situation is much less severe than yours and we centralize our files excepting political incidents we experience fewer than a hundred murders per year thats comparable to a busy weekend in los angeles right milo smiled not quite a bad month then according to the mayors office los angeles had one thousand and four murders last year other american cities are even worse thousands and thousands of murders in this vast country without centralized files how can you hope to access information its tough sir we do have some central i know i know the fbi said carmeli ncic various state logs i know but reporting procedures are slipshod and inconsistent and theres tremendous variation from city to city milo didnt answer its chaos isnt it detective you really dont know if similar crimes have occurred and youre unlikely to ever know one thing that might help in that regard sir would be publicizing the crime i understand your reluctance but again said carmeli clenching his jaws back to me us what could you possibly expect to gain by publicizing the crime other than subjecting my family to more pain and possibly endangering the children of my colleagues endangering them how mr carmeli either by inspiring the murderer to kill another israeli child or giving someone else ideas go after the zionists at that point we would be feeding terrorist fantasies he shook his head again no theres no point mr sturgis besides if this killer has struck before its been somewhere other than los angeles right why do you say that mr carmeli because surely even with your slipshod procedures you would have heard about it no surely child murders arent that routine even in los angeles no murders are routine to me sir so youd know if there were others wouldnt you assuming the crime was reported carmeli squinted in confusion why wouldnt it be many crimes arent murders that look like accidents often arent but the death of a child said carmeli are you telling me there are places in this city where parents wouldnt report the death of a child there are sir said milo softly because many child homicides are committed by parents carmeli went white milo began to rub his face but stopped himself what im saying sir is that we cant assume anything at this point and going public could jog someones memory a crime that was similar in some crucial way could emerge maybe years ago maybe in another city because if we get good media coverage the exposure would reach other cities but i can also see your point about the danger and to be honest i cant promise it would do any good carmeli breathed rapidly several times and placed his hands on the couch your honesty is laudable now i will be frank with you not a chance the riskoutcome ratio isnt good i wont have another childs death on my conscience so what other avenues will you pursue ill ask lots of questions could i ask you a few more yes said carmeli weakly he reached for a third cigarette picked up the matchbook but didnt light up immediately but if theyre about our family life ill simply tell you what i told the others we were happy a happy family we never appreciated how happy we were the black eyes closed then opened flat no longer something burned within back to the political issue for a second sir said milo no doubt the consulate gets threats do you save them im sure we do but thats not my area do you have any objection to turning over copies i can ask if you tell me whose area it is ill be happy to ask myself no ill do it carmelis hand began to shake your comment about parents killing their own children if you were implying i wasnt of course not please forgive me if i offended you i was just explaining why some crimes dont get reported the black eyes were now moist carmeli removed his glasses and wiped them with the back of one hand my daughter was a very special girl raising her was challenging and i believe we loved her more because of it we never hurt her never lifted a finger against her if anything we spoiled her thank god we spoiled her he put the glasses back on slapped his hands back down on the couch what other questions do you have hardened voice id like to know more about irit mr carmeli in what way the kind of child she was her personality the things she liked and disliked she liked everything a very agreeable child kind happy always laughing always wanting to help i assume youve got gorobichs files yes then i dont need to go over the details of her medical condition as a baby she had a fever that did damage slipping his hand under his jacket he drew out a large calfskin billfold inside were slots for credit cards a photo sat in the first one and he slipped it out and showed it to us without relinquishing it walletsized headshot of a beautiful smiling child in a white dress with puff sleeves jewish star necklace the same fair curly hair and flawless skin the same face a mature face no outward sign of retardation in the death picture shed looked younger in this one sparked by the joy of life she could have been anywhere from twelve to seventeen this was irit detective not the images in your files how long ago was this taken said milo this year at school could i have a copy if i can find one carmeli pulled the snapshot back protectively and returned it to the billfold did she have friends sir of course at school children her own age were too quick for her what about friends in the neighborhood not really any older kids whod bothered or bullied her why because she was different it happens no said carmeli irit was sweet she got along with everybody and we sheltered her he blinked hard lit up milo said how hard of hearing was she she had no hearing in the right ear about thirtypercent function in the left with or without the hearing aid with without the aid she could barely hear at all but she seldom used it why not she didnt like it complained it was too loud gave her headaches we had it adjusted several times but she never liked it actually i he buried his face in his hands milo sat back now he rubbed his face a moment later carmeli sat up inhaling the third cigarette he talked through the smoke she tried to deceive us about it wearing it when she left the house then pulling it out the moment she got on the school bus or if not then in class or losing it we went through several replacements we had her teachers make sure she wore it so she began leaving it in her ear but switching it off sometimes she remembered to switch it back on when she came home but usually she didnt so we knew she was a sweet child mr sturgis innocent not good at sneaking but she did have a will we tried reasoning with her bribing her nothing worked finally we came to the conclusion that she preferred not hearing being able to shut the world out create her own world does that make sense to you doctor yes ive seen that i said my wife has too shes a teacher in london she worked at a school for special children said many kids with problems enter their own private worlds still we wanted irit to know what was going on around her we never stopped reminding her to use it so that day said milo even though she was wearing it you dont know if it was switched on my guess would be that it was off milo thought rubbed his face again thirty percent in one ear at best so even with the aid its likely she couldnt hear much of what was going on around her no not much carmeli smoked and sat straighter was irit very trusting i said he took a deep breath you need to understand doctor that she grew up in israel and in europe where things are much safer and children are much freer israels safer said milo much safer mr sturgis your media play up the occasional incident but outside of political terrorism violence is very low and in copenhagen and london where we lived later she was also relatively free despite being the child of a diplomat i said yes we lived in good neighborhoods here in los angeles a good neighborhood means nothing nothing prepared us for this city certainly irit was trusting she liked people we taught her about strangers the need to be cautious she said she understood but she was in her own way she was very smart but also young for her age her brother is only seven but in some ways he was the older child more sophisticated hes a very gifted boy would irit have gone with a stranger id like to think no am i sure he shook his head id like to speak to your wife said milo well be talking to your neighbors as well to find out if anyone noticed anything unusual on your street no one did said carmeli i asked them but go ahead ask them yourself in terms of my wife however i insist on drawing some ground rules you may not imply in any way that she could be responsible the way you implied with me mr carmeli do i make myself clear detective his voice was loud again and his narrow torso had tensed the shoulders up as if he was prepared to strike out sir said milo i have no intention of adding to your wifes stress and im sorry if i offended you not a hint said carmeli i wont permit you to speak to her otherwise she has experienced enough pain in her life do you understand yes sir ill be present when you speak to her and you may not talk to my son hes too young has no business with the police milo didnt answer you dont like this said carmeli you think im being obstructionistic but its my family not yours he sprang up stood at attention eyes fixed on the door a dignitary at a boring but important function we rose too when can we meet mrs carmeli said milo ill call you carmeli strode to the door and held it open be brutally honest mr sturgis do you have any hope of finding this monster ill do my best mr carmeli but i deal in details not hope i see im not a religious man never attend synagogue except for official business but if there is a life after death im fairly certain im going to heaven do you know why why because ive already been to hell descending in the elevator milo said that room wonder if gorobich and ramos merited his private office putting some distance between the murder and his work distance is a big issue for him isnt it can you blame him i said losing a child is bad enough without attributing it to your career choice im sure he considered the political angle right from the beginning the entire consulate probably did and they decided it wasnt a factor as you said if they thought it was theyd handle it themselves and what carmeli said about terrorism as attentionseeking backs that up the same thing applies to counterterrorism send a message someones out for your kids come down hard and fast and with enough publicity to provide strong deterrence and something else carmelis demeanor wasnt that of a man whos achieved even the slightest closure hes hurting milo starving for answers he frowned and we havent given him any maybe thats another reason he doesnt like the department what do you mean that crack about having worked with us before someone probably screwed up on his parade or something sticking with the baseball analogies im starting out with two strikes against me the car was where wed left it he gave the parking attendant another tip backed out and drove down the exit ramp traffic was heavy on wilshire and he waited to turn left that room he said again did you see the way the smoke got sucked up into the ceiling maybe hes not james bond but my mossad fantasies are taking over and i keep flashing images of secret tunnels up there all this cloakanddagger crap license to cater i said and cynical old me thinks protesting too much any other impressions of him no just what i said no special antennatwang why he shrugged i can understand his wanting to keep distance between the murder and his job but dont you think he could have been a little more forthcoming like volunteering to turn over the consulates crank mail not that i blame him i guess from his perspective were clowns who havent done squat he made the turn changing the subject i said the hearing aid i keep thinking it was left there deliberately maybe the killers telling us thats why he chose her telling us a gameplayer theres a gamelike quality to it milo malignant play and what carmeli told us about irits turning off the hearing aid retreating to her own private world would have made her a perfect target for children private worlds often mean overt selfstimulation fantasizing talking to themselves strangelooking body movements the killer could have watched and seen all that first the hearing aid then irit wandering away from the others acting preoccupied lost in fantasy he pulled her out of her script and into his wandered off he said so maybe were just talking real bad luck a mixture of bad luck and victim characteristics a moment later something else hit me theres a whole other possibility i said it was someone who knew her knew that even when she wore the aid she turned it off and was easy to sneak up on he drove slowly jaws knotted squinting at more than sunglare we traveled for three blocks before he spoke so back to the old acquaintance list teachers the bus driver and neighbors no matter what carmeli says ive seen too many girls brutalized by supposed friends and acquaintances the wholesome kid down the block who up til then only cut up cats and dogs when no one was looking that why you asked about bullies in the neighborhood i asked because at this point i dont know what else to ask but yeah the thought did occur to me that someone could have had it in for her she was retarded deaf jewish israeli choose your criterion someone had it in for her but took care not to violate the body hes twisted youre the shrink his voice was husky with irritation i said the mo files you gave me didnt classify by victim characteristic other than age and sex if you can get hold of the information id look into murders of deaf people handicapped people in general handicapped defined how alex lots of our bad guys and their victims wouldnt win any iq contests is a dope fiend who ods and blasts himself into a coma handicapped how about deaf blind crippled documented retardation if that doesnt get too unwieldly victims under eighteen and strangled he put on speed that kind of information is obtainable theoretically given enough time and shoe leather and cops from other jurisdictions who cooperate and have decent memories and keep decent records thats for la county if the killers new to the region did the same thing two thousand miles away the chances dwindle and we already know from gormans letter that nothing about the crime tipped off the fbi computers meaning theres no vicap match even if we do find another case itll be unsolved and if the bastard swept up just as thoroughly were not any further along forensically pessimism i said is not good for the soul sold my soul years ago to whom the bitch goddess success then she cut town before paying off he shook his head and laughed what guy gets his statistics straight from the mayors office you see any career boost coming out of this one lets put it this way i said no he laughed harder your honesty is laudatory doctor at robertson he stopped at a red light and touched his ear her own little world he said poor kid a few moments later hear no evil that night i didnt sleep much robin heard me tossing and asked what was wrong too much caffeine the observer the neighborhood was worse than he remembered nice houses on his friends street big by his standards most of them still decently maintained at least from what he could see in the darkness but to get there hed passed through boulevards lined with pawnshops liquor stores and bars other businesses to be sure but at this hour they were all shuttered and the street was given over to girls in minimal clothing and guys drinking out of paper bags night sounds music car engines laughter now and then rarely happy people hanging out on corners or halfconcealed in the shadows darkskinned people with nothing to do he was glad the toyota was small and inconspicuous even so occasionally someone stared as he passed watching him hands in pockets slouching the halfnaked girls paraded up and down or just stood at the curb their pimps out of eyeshot but no doubt waiting he knew all about that kind of thing knew all the games his friend had told him not to be shocked and hed come equipped the ninemillimeter out of its box beneath the seat and tucked on the left side of his waistband where he could draw it out quickly with his gun hand his gun hand nice way to put it so here he was reasonably ready for surprises but of course the key was not to be surprised suddenly his thoughts were drowned out by music from a passing car big sedan chassis so low it nearly scraped the asphalt kids with shaved heads bobbing up and down throbbing bass beat not music words chanting shouting to electric drums ugly angry rant that passed for poetry someone shouted and he looked around and checked his rearview mirror a siren shrieked in the distance got louder the ultimate danger he pulled to the curb and an ambulance passed and dopplered to silence silence had been irits world had she been cued into some internal universe able to feel the vibrations of her own heartbeat hed been thinking about her all day and into the night imagining and supposing and replaying the scene but when he began the drive to his friends house he forced himself to stop because he needed to concentrate on the present still so many distractions this city this neighborhood all the changes dont be shocked he turned off onto a nightblack side street then another and another until he found himself in a completely different world dim silent the big houses austere as bureaucrats his friends house looked the same except for the for sale sign staked in front it was good hed caught him in time surprise he pulled into the driveway behind the dark van touching the gun he looked around again got out alarmed the car and walked up the flowerlined pathway to the paneled front door ringing the bell he uttered his name in response to the shouted who is it the door opened and he got a face full of smile hey he stepped in and the two of them embraced briefly to his friends left was an old mahogany mail table against the wall on it a large manila envelope yeah thats it thank you i really appreciate it no problem got time to come in coffee sure thanks for that too his friend laughed and they went into the kitchen of the big house the envelope in his hand stiff and dry the guy had come through taking risks but when had anything worthwhile ever come easy he sat and watched as his friend poured coffee saying easy drive over no problem good told you it got bad things change yeah but they rarely improve so youre back in the game from the looks of it weve got plenty to talk about that we do the hand stilled black right good memory not as good as it used to be the hand paused again maybe thats for the better its affecting my work said helena i see a suicide attempt wheeled into the er and i want to scream idiot i watch the surgeons open a gunshot wound and start thinking about nolans autopsy he was so healthy you read the report i called the coroner until someone spoke to me i guess i was hoping theyd find something cancer some rare disease anything to justify it but he was in the pink dr delaware he could have lived a long time she began crying pulled a tissue from her purse before i could get to the box the damn thing is she said catching her breath ive thought about him more in the last few weeks than all the years before combined shed come straight from the hospital still wearing her uniform the white dress tailored to her trim frame her nametag still pinned i feel guilty dammit why should i feel guilty i never failed him because he never needed me we didnt depend on each other we both knew how to take care of ourselves or at least i thought so independent always even when we were little kids we went our separate ways different interests we didnt fight we just ignored each other is that abnormal i thought of all the genetically linked strangers whod passed through my office siblings are thrown together by chance anything from love to hate can follow well nolan and i loved each other at least i know i loved him but it was more of a i dont want to say family obligation more of a general bond a feeling and i loved his good qualities she crumpled the tissue the first thing shed done upon arriving was hand me insurance forms then shed talked about the coverage the demands of her job taking time to get around to nolan good qualities i said his energy he had a real she laughed i was actually going to say love for life his energy and his intelligence when he was young eight or nine the school tested him because he was goofing off in class turned out he was highly gifted something like the top halfpercent and hed been tuning out because he was bored im not stupid but im not even remotely in that league maybe im the lucky one being gifted was a burden for him its crossed my mind because nolan didnt have much patience and i think that had to do with his intelligence no patience for people people things any process that moved too slowly once again this was back when he was a teenager he may have mellowed when he was older i remember him always railing about something mom telling him honey you cant expect the world to go at your pace could that be why he became a cop to fix things fast if he did that could have been a problem helena there are very few fast fixes in cop work just the opposite cops see problems that never get solved last time you said something about conservative political views that could have led him to police work maybe although once again thats the last phase i knew about he could have been into something completely different he changed philosophies often all the time there were times he outliberaled mom and dad radical really just about a communist then he swung back the other way was all this in high school i think it was after the satanic phase probably his senior year or maybe his freshman year in college i remember his reading maos little red book reciting from it at the table telling mom and dad they thought they were progressive but they were really counterrevolutionary then for a while he got into sartre camus all that existential stuff the meaninglessness of life one month he tried to prove it by not bathing or changing his clothes she smiled that ended when he decided he still liked girls the next phase was i think it was ayn rand he read atlas shrugged and got totally into individualism then anarchy then libertarianism last i heard hed decided ronald reagan was a god but we hadnt talked politics for years so i dont know where he ended up sounds like adolescent searching i guess it was but i never went through it always middleoftheroad the boring child howd your parents react to nolans changes they were pretty cool about it tolerant i dont think they really ever understood nolan but i never saw them put him down she smiled sometimes it was funny the passion he put into each new phase but we never made fun she crossed her legs maybe the reason i never went through any of that was i felt nolan was so unpredictable that i owed it to mom and dad to be stable sometimes it did seem that the family was divided into two segments the three of us and nolan i always felt close to my parents she swiped at her eyes with the tissue even when i was in college id go places with them go out to dinner with them even after i was married and nolan wasnt part of that nolan stopped hanging out with us when he was twelve he always preferred to be by himself do his own thing now that i think about it he always kept his life private alienated i guess so or maybe he just preferred his own company because he was so smart which is another reason becoming a cop seems so strange whos more establishment cops can be pretty alienated as a group i said living with all that violence the usthem mentality doctors and nurses develop an usthem too but i still feel part of society and you dont think nolan did who knows what he felt but life must have been pretty damn bleak for him to do what he did her voice was tight dry as kindling how could he dr delaware how could he get to the point where he didnt feel tomorrow was worth waiting for i shook my head dads depressions she said maybe its all genetic maybe were just prisoners of our biology biology is strong but there are always choices for nolan to make that choice he must have been profoundly depressed wouldnt you say men sometimes do it when theyre angry cops sometimes do it when theyre angry angry about what work ive been trying to find out more about his work record see if he went through any bad work situations i called the police department to get hold of his file and they referred me to his original training officer a sergeant baker hes at parker center now he was nice enough said nolan had been one of his best trainees thered been nothing out of the ordinary he couldnt understand it either i also went after nolans medical records contacted the department insurance office and used some of my nursing skills to pry them loose back when i was still hoping for a disease nolan hadnt been treated for any medical conditions but he had seen a psychologist for two months before he died up til a week before so something was wrong a dr lehmann do you know him first name roone lehmann i shook my head hes got an office downtown i left him several messages but he hasnt called back would you have any problem calling him no but he may not break confidentiality do dead people have confidentiality its an open question but most therapists dont breach even after death i guess i knew that but i also know that doctors talk to doctors maybe lehmann would be willing to tell you something ill be happy to try thank you she handed me the number one question that i have helena is why nolan transferred from west la to hollywood did sergeant baker say anything about that no i didnt ask him why is that strange most officers consider west la a plum and nolan went from the day shift to the night shift but if he liked excitement he could have wanted an assignment with more action could be he did like action roller coasters surfing motorcycling why why why all these whys its stupid to keep asking questions that cant be answered isnt it no its normal i said thinking of zev carmeli she laughed a jarring sound i saw this cartoon in the paper once that viking hagar the horrible hes standing on a mountaintop with rain and lightning all around holding his hands up to the heavens shouting why me and down from the heavens comes the answer why not maybe thats the ultimate truth dr delaware what right do i have to expect a smooth ride you have a right to ask questions well maybe i should do more than ask theres still nolans stuff to go through ive been putting it off but i should start when youre ready im ready now after all its all mine now he left everything to me she made an appointment for next week and left i called dr roone lehmanns number and gave my name to his service asking for the office address seventh street said the operator reciting a number that put it near flower in the heart of the downtown financial district unusual location for a therapist but if he got lots of referrals from lapd and other government agencies i guess it made sense just as i hung up milo called his voice charged with some kind of energy got another case retarded girl strangled pretty quick not from the files alex im talking brandnew here and now caught the radio call a few minutes ago and im headed over to southwest division western near twentyeighth if you come by now you might get a look at the body before they take it away its a school booker t washington elementary southwest division was twenty miles and a universe away from the park where irit carmeli had lost her life i took sunset to la cienega headed south down san vicente and picked up the santa monica freeway east at la brea exiting at western i covered the next few blocks of inner city with relative speed few cars were on the street as i passed shuttered buildings and burnedout lots that hadnt been rebuilt since the riots and maybe never would be the sky was very pale gray almost white looked as if it had given up on blue washington elementary was old duncolored and cruelly graffitied set on acres of potholed playground the entire property was surrounded by twelvefoot chainlink fencing that hadnt prevented vandals from pretending they were artists i parked on twentyeighth near the main gate wide open but guarded by a uniform squad cars technical vans and the coroners station wagon had converged at the south end of the playground between the monkey bars and the swings yellow tape divided the lot in two on the northern half children ran and played under the eyes of teachers and aides most of the adults watched the activity across the field few of the kids did and the yard was filled with laughter and protest the scrappy doggerel of childhood no media cars yet or maybe a murder down here just wasnt good enough copy it took a while to get past the uniform but finally i was allowed to make my way to milo he was talking to a grayhaired man in an olive suit and writing in his notepad a stethoscope hung around the other mans neck and he talked steadily without visible emotion two black men with badges on their sportcoats stood twenty feet away looking at a figure on the ground a photographer snapped pictures and techs worked under the swing set with a portable vacuum brushes and tweezers other uniforms crowded the scene but they didnt seem to have much to do among them was a short bearded hispanic man around fifty wearing gray work clothes as i came closer the black detectives stopped chatting and watched me one was fortyish five nine and softheavy with a head shaved clean bulldog jowls and a dyspeptic expression his jacket was beige over black trousers and his tie was black printed with crimson orchids his companion was ten years younger tall and slim with a bushy mustache and a full head of hair he wore a navy blazer cream slacks blue tie both had analytic eyes milo saw me and held up a finger the black detectives resumed their conversation i took a look at the dead girl on the field not much bigger than irit lying the same way irit had been positioned hands to the sides palms up feet straight out but this face was different swollen and purplish tongue extending from the lower left corner of the mouth the neck circled by a red puckered ring of bruise her age was hard to make out but she looked in her teens black wavy hair broad features dark eyes some acne on the cheeks lightskinned black or latino she wore navy sweatpants and white tennis shoes a short denim jacket over a black top dirty fingernails the eyes open staring sightlessly at the milkcolored sky the tongue lavendergray huge behind her a foot of rope hung from the top bar of the swing set the end cut cleanly no breeze no movement the coroner left and milo approached the black detectives while waving me over he introduced the heavy one as willis hooks his partner as roy mclaren pleased to meet you said hooks his hand was baked leather mclaren nodded he had clear nearly coalblack skin and clean features turning back to look at the dead girl he set his jaw and chewed air was she left that way or cut down i said cut down said milo why my first thought was she looks like irit the position he turned to the body and his eyebrows rose a millimeter irits yours said hooks milo nodded she was arranged just like that well unless the janitors our killer i dont see any big deal about that the janitor cut her down i said uhhuh hooks pulled out his pad school custodian excuse me guillermo montez that older mexican guy in the gray uniform showed up for work at seven this morning mopped the main building first then came out here to pick up trash from the yard and found her ran back to get a knife and cut her down but she was dead had been for several hours said the rope was thick it took work dr cohen said shed been dead at least three or four hours by then maybe more said milo cohens usually pretty close said mclaren so she was killed sometime during the night i said but the suns been out since six no one driving or walking by saw her apparently not said hooks or maybe someone did he turned to milo tell me more about yours milo did hooks listened with his finger to his mouth apart from the retardation i dont see any big parallels he looked at his partner mclaren said no i wouldnt call this gentle strangulation ours wasnt raped said milo cohen told me there were no obvious signs of rape with yours either so far said mclaren but who knows janitor says her pants were up but maybe the bad guy pulled them up coronerll get in there and let us know for sure the strangulation said milo from the size of the ligature burn the rope could have actually killed her as opposed to his doing it some other way first and then stringing her up hooks said could be it would be tough stringing up someone who struggled even a small girl but if she was flying maybe we know she used crack who was she i said local girl named latvinia shaver said hooks patrol officer idd her before we got here but i know her myself from working vice a couple of years ago a pro said milo shes been busted for it but i wouldnt call her a pro just a street girl nothing cooking up here he tapped his bald head nothing to do all day so she gets into trouble maybe does some guy for a vial or some spare change big crack habit patrol officer said nothing big that she was aware of but hold on lets ask her he went over to the uniforms and pulled a short slim woman away from the group officer rinaldo he said meet detective sturgis and dr delaware whos a psychological consultant officer rinaldo knew latvinia just a bit said rinaldo in a subdued voice from the neighborhood she looked to be twentyfive with hennaed hair pulled into a ponytail and thin pained features that seemed to be aging quickly what do you know besides her tricking for dope said hooks not a bad kid said rinaldo basically but she was retarded how retarded said milo i think she was eighteen or nineteen but she acted more like twelve or even younger the familys pretty messed up she lives with a grandmother or maybe its an older aunt over on thirtyninth people constantly going in and out crack house i dont know for sure but it wouldnt surprise me she has a brother up in san quentin used to be big in the trayone crips name dont know that either sorry i just remember that cause the grandmother told me about him said she was glad he was gone so latvinia wouldnt be influenced she frowned the lady seemed to be trying hooks wrote something down any gangster boyfriends or known acquaintances said mclaren rinaldo shrugged as far as i could see she didnt hang with anyone in particular no gang i mean more like whoever was around basically she was pretty promiscuous she drank too cause i caught her woozy a few times with bottles of malt and gin bust her for it rinaldo blushed no i just took it away and tossed it you know how it is out here sure do said hooks anything else in her funpack probably but i never saw anything worse i mean she didnt shoot heroin far as i know she have any kids not that i heard about but maybe she was pretty easygoing you know easy to con like a kid with a grownup body so who knows be interesting if she was pregnant said hooks cant wait to see the autopsy on this one he glanced back at the body not that shes showing small lady small mclaren agreed cohen estimated five one ninety yeah she was small said rinaldo anyone could have hurt her any ideas about who did not a one so no known enemies not that i heard overall she was a pretty nice kid but anyone could have conned her like i said she was retarded im still trying to get a feel for how retarded said hooks i dont know exactly sir i mean she could talk and make sense and at first glance she didnt look weird but once you talked to her you realized she was immature like a twelveyearold maybe even younger ten eleven despite all her fooling around she was kinda innocent another blush not a hard kid you know was she in any program said mclaren special school that kind of thing i dont think she was in school period i just used to see her on the streets walking around hanging sometimes i had to tell her to get moving go home she winced the thing is sometimes she didnt put on enough clothes no underwear or bra and sometimes shed wear real filmy seethrough clothes or leave her shirt unbuttoned when id say what on earth are you doing girl shed giggle and button up advertising for business said mclaren i always thought she was just acting stupid said rinaldo whether or not she was advertising said hooks going around like that she probably got business im sure said rinaldo no boyfriend said mclaren not to my knowledge no gangsters in her social life at all the brothers all i know youd have to ask her grandmother well do that said hooks whats the home address dont know the exact number but its on thirtyninth a couple of blocks east of here green house old one of those big wooden ones converted to rooms chainlink fence in front and cement instead of grass i know because i took her home one time when she had a short dress and no panties the wind was blowing the dress up and i just wanted to get her inside she blinked grandmothers on the second floor when latvinia was busted said hooks were you the arresting officer me and my partner kretzer we pulled her twice for soliciting both times she was out late over on hoover near the freeway onramp getting in the way of traffic east ramp or west west trying to snag a beverly hills guy maybe said mclaren rinaldo shrugged when was this said hooks last year december i think it was cold and she had on a quilted jacket but no top underneath hooks wrote so i can get her personal info from the files probably not it was a juvey bust sealed she was just short of eighteen and i told her she was a lucky girl if its just the home address you need i can take you there the address is a good place to start said hooks he looked at mclaren you want the younger man said sure he and rinaldo walked away got into a blackandwhite and drove toward the south gate see any dramatic parallels yet hooks asked milo not really yours was a diplomats kid israeli diplomat nothing in the news on anything like that they hushed it up milo told him carmelis rationale well said hooks he could be right but i dont know sounds like a fun one yeah where you going with this willis the usual if we get lucky itll be some dirt lives next door if not who knows she didnt exactly lead a sheltered life milo glanced across the yard those kids are looking at the body would have been worse if the janitor didnt get here and they saw it swinging interesting reaction his cutting her down four parallel lines in hookss forehead deepened civic volunteerism maybe he listens to the mayors speeches hold on he made his way halfway to the crowd in a quick rolling gait caught the eye of the man in the gray uniform and motioned him over the janitor came over licking his lips if you got a minute again sir said hooks this here is mr montez the custodian nodded up close i saw he was closer to sixty with a prizefighters battered face and a coarse gray beard five seven and broadshouldered with thick stubby hands and oversized feet detective sturgis said milo holding out his hand montez shook it his eyes were bloodshot i know you told your story sir said milo but if you dont mind id like to hear it again montez looked up at him and put his hands in his pockets i come to work at seven oclock he said in clear but accented english i clean the main building and bungalow b like always then i come out to sweep like always i sweep early cause sometimes people leave shi things on the yard i dont want the kids they should see what kinds of things liquor bottles crack vials sometimes condoms needles even used toilet paper you know so people get into the schoolyard at night all the time montezs voice rose they get in do parties do dope shootings three months ago three guys got shot dead last year two guys terrible for the kids who got shot said milo gangsters i dunno hooks said wallace and sangiorgios case driveby through the fence turning back to montez what do they usually do cut through the lock the chain or they just climb over all the time any idea the last time the chain was cut said milo who knows said montez we used to change the locks all the time now the school they dont have money for books my grandchildren go here you live around here sir no i live in willowbrook my daughter and her husband they live here on thirtyfourth the husband he work over at the sports arena they got three kids the two here and one baby milo nodded so you came out and started sweeping and saw her right away i see her said montez hanging there he shook his head and pain danced across his face the tongue shaking his head again did you realize she was dead right away said milo that tongue sure what else so you cut her down sure why not i figure maybe maybe what montez stared at him licked his lips again maybe its stupid but i dunno maybe i figure i help her i dunno guess it was the way she was hanging i didnt want no kids to see it my grandchildren and she was always a nice kid i wanted her to look nice you knew her said hooks latvinia sure everyone know her she crazy she came round here a lot not inside on the street he tapped his temple she live on thirtyninth few blocks from my daughter everyone see her walking around no clothes a little not right no clothes at all said hooks when montez looked confused he added she walked around totally naked no no said montez a little clothes but not enough you know another tap not right you know but happy all the time happy yeah laughing montezs eyes hardened i do something wrong cutting her down no sir i go out i see her up there think the kids see that my grandchildren go get a knife from the supply closet he slashed empty space how long have you been working here sir said milo nine years before that i worked over at dorsey high twelve years used to be a good school there same problems now milo hooked a thumb at the body when you saw latvinia hanging were her clothes the way they are now what do you mean were her pants up when you saw her hanging yeah what you think i no sir were just trying to find out what she looked like when you saw her the same said montez angrily zactly the same pants up the same i get a knife cut her down and put her on the ground maybe a miracle she not dead but she dead i call the way you placed her said milo montezs eyes were uncomprehending arms at her side said hooks like you wanted her to look nice sure said montez why not why shouldnt she look nice hooks let him go and we watched as he returned to the schools main building what do you think he asked milo any reason to doubt his story not really but im going to do a background on him and if the girl was raped ill try to get some body fluids he smiled some thanks for the good samaritan huh but weve seen plenty of those turn out not so good right thing is though if hes the bad guy why would he do her right here where he works focus attention on himself bloodshot eyes said milo maybe he was up late yeah said hooks but no booze on his breath and he said he works two jobs this during the day parttime at a liquor store on vermont at night says he was at the store last night that should be checkable did he look hinky to you if hes dirty hes ready for the oscar he gazed through the fence at twentyeighth street then took in the traffic on western somebody driving or walking by could very well have seen her swinging but you heard what he said about all the crap goes down on the schoolyard unlike mr montez people around here dont volunteer much if it was some dirt next door said milo wonder why hed take the trouble to hang her here who knows said hooks maybe they ran into each other around the corner made a date headed over here to consummate montez said he finds condoms all the time techs have any idea when the chain was cut just that it wasnt fresh which is also consistent with montez the school keeps using a broken chain cause the minute they put a new one on someone slices it yeah said hooks nothing like security for our youngsters he looked at the body again maybe it does mean something bringing her here the bad guy making some kind of statement such as i hate school hooks smiled that narrows it down huh pull in all the bad students milo gave a short hard detective laugh and hooks laughed too fleshy jowls undulating the four wrinkles smoothed put your hands up punk he said making a fingergun lemme see your gradepoint average two ds and an f off to the lineup he chuckled some more exhaled anyway except for strangulation and both being retarded i still dont see any parallels with your case strangulation retarded and no rape said milo we dont know for sure if there was no rape said hooks but if there wasnt any no assault at all thats interesting right willis how many sex fiends dont do anything to the body maybe but who knows what goes on in assholes heads maybe hanging her got him off he watched her dangle came in his pants went home had sweet dreams i remember one few years back guy got off on playing with their feet killed em first set em up on their beds played with their feet that was enough to get him off what do you think of that doctor something for everyone i said this guy the foot guy he didnt even have to yank the monkey just playing with the toes did it for him i had a foot guy too said milo but he didnt kill just tied em up and played probably woulda killed if hed kept on probably you could probably sit down and dig up lots of stories about perverted stuff hooks stiffened and shot milo a quick embarrassed look milos face remained still anyway if mac and i come up with something well let you know ditto willis yeah a young white cop jogged over excuse me detective he said to hooks coroners driver wants to know if we can transport the vic you got anything more you want to do milo nope go ahead hooks said the officer hustled back delivered the word and two morgue attendants came forward with a gurney and a black body bag i noticed movement from the north end of the playground a few teachers had come closer to the tape and were watching while drinking coffee school days said hooks i was born on thirtysecond we moved to long beach when i was three otherwise i woulda gone here the attendants got the body into the bag and lifted it on the gurney as they wheeled her away the white cop turned his attention to the ground and called over another uniform a tall black man even darker than mclaren then he jogged back to us its probably nothing sir but you might want to take a look at what said hooks already moving something under the body we followed him over the black uniform had his arms folded and his eyes were aimed at a small scrap of white paper maybe two inches square its probably nothing the first cop repeated but it was under her and theres something typed on it i saw the letters hooks squatted dvll that mean anything to anybody the cops looked at one another no sir said the first maybe the devil said the second any gang using that moniker shrugs all around and since when do gang bangers type muttered hooks okay youre the eagle eye officer bradbury do me a favor and check that graffiti on the school buildings over there see if the same thing comes up anywhere yes sir as bradbury approached the yellowtape border the teachers backed away but they watched as he scanned the graffiti dvll said hooks mean anything to you milo nope me neither and seeing as she was laid down by the janitor it was probably just something lying there on the cement before she got here maybe a piece of school memo or something the paper remained motionless in the static metallic air should i not bother to tell the techs said the black cop no tell them to bag it take a picture said hooks we wouldnt want to be accused of shoddy police work by some scumbag lawyer would we milo drove out to the street and parked behind my seville ah he said looking in the rearview mirror finally the games begin behind us a tv van from a local station had just pulled up disgorging a geartoting crew that sprinted for the gate as the uniform checked with hooks a small gray car pulled away from the curb and passed us the driver hispanic and wearing the same institutionalgray montez had on glanced at us for an instant and continued to western a diplomats kid on the west side and a crackkid down here said milo what do you think some physical resemblance between irit and latvinia both of them retarded death by strangulation no sexual assault on irit no evidence so far of an assault on latvinia and the position of the body but latvinia wasnt strangled with broad force and the janitor moved her the janitor you like him sure because he was there and because he moved her sparing the grandchildren i said janitors clean up janitors use brooms something else alex he cuts her down arranges her respectfully but doesnt tuck the tongue back in her mouth hooks asked him about that and he said when he realized she was really dead he didnt want to mess things up make sense to you the average person seeing a hanging body would probably run for the phone but if montez is actionoriented a family man with strong attachments to the school it could fit but so does another scenario montez has a date with latvinia he admitted knowing her they meet on the schoolyard because its his turf he kills her hangs her then realizes students are going to show up soon maybe there isnt enough time to get rid of the body so instead he plays hero or it was colder there was enough time to get rid of the body but he left her there because he got off on thumbing his nose at us on being a hero thinks hes smart a pretender just like you said like those firefighters who torch stuff and show up to hold the hose another thing i said montez wears a uniform his is gray and the park worker i saw mowing at the conservancy was wearing beige but someone else might not draw the distinction his eyes narrowed irit to her it might have connoted someone official someone who belonged and could be trusted most people relate to uniforms that way montez he said well if theres anything to learn about him hooks is as good a detective as any that piece of paper i said dvll mean something to you no im sure its nothing what hooks said a scrap of school memo he turned to me what alex it just seemed too cute move the body and there it is nothing like that was found near irit according to the files meaning sometimes i said small things get overlooked he frowned you think montez or whoever killed latvinia left a message or it was in her pocket and fell out either when she was hung or when montez cut her down he rubbed his face ill get to the morgue and look at the evidence bags personally that is if the stuff hasnt been returned to the family speaking of which carmeli called me this morning said he has copies of the consulate crank mail i should come by and pick them up ill do it around five after i play phone tag to see if anyones got deaf or retarded victims that look interesting if i drop the letters off this evening could you analyze them be happy to for what its worth quick cooperation on carmelis part attitude adjustment maybe he was impressed cause i brought along a psychologist sure i said that and the tie i got home at twothirty robin and spike were out and i drank a beer went through the mail paid some bills helena dahl had phoned an hour and a half ago not long after her session leaving her work number and dr roone lehmann had returned my call the cardiac care unit clerk told me helena was in the middle of a procedure and couldnt come to the phone leaving my name i phoned lehmann this time no service an answering tape with a low drybutmellow male voice picked up and as i introduced myself the same voice clicked in this is dr lehmann thanks for getting back to me doctor certainly officer dahls sister called too but i thought id speak with you first what exactly is she after some understanding of why he killed himself i sympathize he said of course but can we ever really understand true i said did nolan leave any clues was he despondent or profoundly depressed overtly suicidal or making oblique cries for help not when i saw him dr delaware but hold on he was off the line for thirty seconds came back sounding rushed im sorry something came up and i cant talk at length right now not that i could anyway even though the patients dead and even though the courts have been hacking away at confidentiality im one of those oldfashioned fellows who takes our vows seriously is there anything you can tell me that might help her i said anything he repeated drawing out the word hmm let me think on that do you ever get downtown i could give you a few moments because id rather not discuss these things on the phone a police case and all that the current climate one never knows where the media lurks do you see lots of police cases enough to be cautious of course if its too much of a problem to drive all the way no problem i said when let me check my calendar i do want to emphasize that i cant promise anything until i go over the file and id prefer not to speak to the sister directly please tell her we talked sure have you had problems with these types of cases not as a rule ounce of prevention and all that theres something you might want to consider doctor as the sisters therapist the search for understanding is normal but the value of digging things up varies from case to case you dont think this case merits it what im lets just say officer dahl was an interesting fellow anyway ill leave it at that for the moment ill be in touch an interesting fellow warning me some dark secret that helena was better off not knowing i thought of what id learned about nolan mood swings sensation seeking sudden shifts to political extremes had he stepped over the line in the course of police work something best left unexplored something political on the fringe a police case and all that the current climate videotaped beatings of suspects cops sitting around as rioters torched the city bungling of evidence in major cases case after case of felonious cops caught in the act lapd was as popular as an abortionist at the vatican the media lurking had lehmann been involved in other cop cases that had left him gunshy whatever the reason he was definitely trying to steer me away from a psychological autopsy of nolan the department hadnt argued when helena had chosen to skip the fulldress funeral eager to move things along nolan bright different because he read books alienated the switch from west la to hollywood because he liked action illegal action had he gotten himself into something that left suicide the only option as i thought about it helena phoned sounding breathless rushed i said busy we just had a patient infarct in the middle of an angio big artery the cardiologist hadnt known about hes rotorootering one and the other jams up but hes okay the patient things have quieted down the reason i called is right after our session i went over to nolans apartment all motivated to go through his stuff maybe find something she paused and i could hear her inhale and blow it out i went to the garage first and it was fine but someone broke into the place dr delaware it was a wreck they took his stereo and his tv his microwave all his flatware a couple of lamps pictures off the walls probably some clothes too someone must have come with a truck and loaded up oh boy i said im sorry lowlifes her voice shook scumbags no one saw anything they probably did it at night its a duplex just nolan and the landlord and shes a dentist out of town at a convention i called the police and they said it would take at least an hour to get there i had to be at work by three so i gave my number and left what can they do anyway write a report and file it the damage is already done even if the bastards come back theres nothing to take except nolans car god why didnt i think of that his fiero in the garage either they didnt see it or they didnt have time and are coming back god ive got to go back there get someone to take me so i can drive the fiero over to my place so many things to handle the lawyer just called me about the final papers robbing a cop this damn city his rent is paid up for the month but eventually im going to have to clean everything up and go back there would you like me to go with you youd do that sure thats so nice but no i couldnt its okay helena i dont mind i just youre serious wheres the apartment midwilshire sycamore near beverly i cant leave right now too many iffy patients maybe midshift if were staffed enough if they take the damn car before then fine tonight then i cant impose on you to come out late dr delaware its no problem helena im a night person im not sure exactly when ill be free call me when you are if im free ill meet you there if not youre on your own okay she laughed softly okay thanks so much i really didnt want to go alone have a minute i said unless someone else starts dying i spoke with dr lehmann whatd he say as we expected nothing because of confidentiality but he did agree to reread nolans file and if he comes up with something he feels comfortable discussing hell meet with me silence that is if you want me to helena sure she said sure thats fine i started might as well finish milo chomped a dead cigarillo and carried the consulate crank letters in an oversized unlabeled white envelope a years worth he said remaining out on the terrace what do they do with the old ones dont know this is what carmeli gave me or rather his secretary still havent gotten past the hall yet thanks alex back to the phones no luck yet lots of callbacks pending hooks has started to work on montez so far the guys clean totally just to be careful i doublechecked the offender files nothing see you he patted my shoulder and turned to leave milo are you aware of any scandals brewing in the department west la or hollywood specifically he stopped short no why cant say oh he said the dahl kid someone badmouthed him do you know something i shook my head im probably overreacting but his therapist implied i shouldnt ask too many questions no reason confidentiality hmm nope nothing that ive picked up and even though im not mr popular if it was something bigtime i think id know okay thanks yeah happy analysis i emptied the envelope on my desk a square of blue paper was stapled to each letter saying la and listing the date received fiftyfour letters the most recent three weeks ago the oldest eleven months most were short viciously to the point anonymous three main themes israelis are jews and hence the enemy because all jews are part of a capitalist bankermasonictrilateral commission conspiracy to dominate the world israelis are jews and hence the enemy because all jews are part of a communistbolshevikcosmopolitan conspiracy to dominate the world israelis are the enemy because theyre colonial usurpers who stole land from the arabs and continue to oppress the palestinians lots of misspellings more disorganized handwriting than id seen in a long time the third group israel versus the arabs contained the most grammatical errors and awkward phrases and i assumed some of the writers were foreignborn five of the letters in group also carried references to murdered palestinian children and i set those aside but no specific warnings of revenge upon consulate children or other israelis and no references to dvll i shifted to the envelopes examining the postmarks all california twentynine had been mailed within la county eighteen from orange county six from ventura one from santa barbara of the five with allusions to children four were local one from orange county another read runofthemill racial venom and i couldnt see any way to connect it to irit the office door opened and robin came in with spike as i scratched his neck her eyes lowered to the letters fan mail i said she read a sentence turned away vile were these sent to the girls father to the consulate i began scooping up the letters dont quit on my account she said no im finished dinner i was going to ask you i could cook you want to wouldnt mind feeling useful if you dont mind quick and simple how about lamb chops weve got some frozen ill steam some corn salad wine ice cream the works babe wine and the works my girlish heart swoons concentrating on the grill helped me relax we ate outside slowly quietly and ended up in bed an hour later at seventhirty robin was in the tub and i lay atop the sheets ten minutes later helena called and said i can get away now but you really dont have to bother i went into the bathroom and told robin well she said youve already done your good deeds here so why not sycamore was an attractive shaded street just west of hancock park full of highstyle duplexes dating from the twenties nolan dahls building was of that vintage but a plain cousin white lumpy stucco no architectural embellishments narrow windows like wounds a few yucca plants pushing up against the front window a fuzzy square of lawn it gave no hint of falling victim to anything but tight budgeting i got there two minutes before helena drove up sorry had some discharge forms to finish hope you havent been waiting long just arrived waving a key she said his is the downstairs unit we walked to the front door a business card had been slipped between the door and the jamb and she pulled it out detective duchossoir she read well thanks for showing up guy they never called me for a statement what a joke she unlocked the front door turned on a light and we stepped into disarray dimmed by heavy gold velvet curtains that looked as old as the building the living room was nicesized with beamed ceilings and offwhite walls but it smelled of old dust and sweat and looked like a war zone the furniture the burglars had left was upended and damaged broken legs on wooden folding chairs a brown corduroy sofa with naugahyde trim turned onto its arms the bottom slashed open the wounds exposing coils and stuffing a cheap ceramic lamp lay shattered on the green shag carpet white grit littering the pile nothing on the walls but dark rectangles where something had once hung in the dining area a card table had been tossed against the wall cracking the plaster more folding chairs in the tiny kitchen drawers were open most of them emptied to the yellow paper lining nolans meager collection of crockery was strewn all over the lumpy linoleum floor as helena had said no flatware the refrigerator an old white admiral too small for the nook provided could have come from a thrift shop i opened it empty nolan had adopted the basic lonely bachelor lifestyle i knew it well once upon a time they got in here through the kitchen door said helena pointing to a tiny service porch past an empty garbage can a window was set into the rear door and the glass had been punched out crudely the edges were still ragged after that it had been easy to reach in and release the lock simple lock no dead bolt not much security i said nolan always prided himself on taking care of himself probably felt he didnt need it she picked up a broken bowl put it down looking drained gazing past the mess and seeing how her brother had lived we walked down a low narrow hall past a small greentiled bathroom with an empty medicine cabinet toothbrush and paste and wadded towels on the floor the shower was dry looks like they took the medicine too i said if there was any nolan was never sick didnt even take aspirin at least when i knew when he lived at home two bedrooms the first was totally empty curtained to gloom helena stared in from the doorway before forcing herself to continue the one where nolan had slept had a kingsized mattress and box spring that took up most of the floor space a fourdrawer fakewood dresser another thriftshop candidate had been pushed away from the wall all the drawers pulled out and tossed on the floor underwear socks shirts were scattered like buckshot an aluminum tv stand stood near the foot of the bed but no set remained rabbitear antenna in the corner the black quilted bedspread was drawn back from sweatstained white sheets and the mattress had been yanked halfway off the box two rumpled pillows sat propped against the wall like ghosts pummeled to unconsciousness a disc on the wall above the bed said a clock had once hung there and that was it the thing i dont get she said is where all his books are cause thats one thing he always had plenty of he just loved to read do you think the burglars could have taken them literate criminals i said were any of them valuable collectors stuff i wouldnt know i just remember nolans room at home books all over the place so you were never here no she said as if it were a confession he used to have a place out in the valley and i was there a few times but after he joined the department he moved to the other side of the hill she shrugged and touched the bedspread its possible i said that he gave his books away why would he do that sometimes people contemplating suicide give away things that are important to them its a way of formalizing the final step oh her eyes misted and she turned away and i knew she was thinking he didnt give them to me there could be another reason helena you said nolan changed points of view pretty suddenly if the books were on politics something he no longer believed in he could have decided to get rid of them whatever lets get out of here see if the cars still here more care had been taken in the rear garden than in front wellpruned apricot and peach trees and several flowering citrus that perfumed the air the garage was a double helena pushed up the lefthand door a pullcord to the right illuminated the narrow lathewalled space the fiero was bright red covered with a fine coat of dust sitting on halfdeflated tires a while since it had been driven i went over and looked at the drivers door deep gouges near the lock and the window was cracked but not broken they tried helena panicked or ran out of time she came over and sighed ill have it towed the rest of the garage was taken up by a wooden workbench bracket shelves of paint cans and dry brushes a bicycle with one wheel an airless basketball several cardboard boxes under a crumpled wet suit the pegboard above the bench was empty his tools are gone she said he had them since high school he went through an artistic phase wood carving convinced mom and dad to get him a complete set expensive stuff soon after he lost interest maybe there are books in those boxes over there she went over to check tossing the black neoprene aside five cartons the top one unsealed empty she said this is a waste oh hold on look at this she lifted a second box heavy from the way her arms tensed still taped using the house key she tried to slit the binding without success i took out my pocketknife and cut deeply she gasped inside were several large leatherette albums in a variety of colors the top one was black and said photographs in gold script helena flipped it open to faded color snapshots under plastic sheets she turned pages quickly almost frantically the same image in varying forms heavyset mother ectomorph father two pretty blond children trees in the background or ocean a ferris wheel or just blue sky helena no older than twelve in any of them had family life stopped then our family albums she said ive been looking for these since mom died never knew he had them she turned another page dad and mom they looked so young this is so she shut the book ill look at them later she lifted the box and carried it out to her mustang placing it on the front passenger seat she slammed the door well at least i got something thank you dr delaware sure ill have the car towed tomorrow she placed a hand on her chest the fingers shook nolan took the albums from moms house without saying a thing why didnt he tell me why didnt he tell me anything the next morning at ten dr roone lehmann called ive been going through nolans file hows the sister doing hanging in i said its rough yes well he was a complex young man complex and bright oh helena told me he tested gifted i see interesting is she gifted as well shes an intelligent woman no doubt well if youd like to come by the office say around noonish i can give you twenty minutes but i cant promise it will be earthshattering thanks for your time its part of the job isnt it minutes later milo phoned coroner says no sexual assault on latvinia hooks says montez the janitor is alibied for the time of her murder good alibi not perfect but sometimes its only criminals who come up with perfect alibis working at the liquor store from seven til eleventhirty the owner verifies says montez has an impeccable work record then home to the wife and kids two older daughters both of whom were up all three of them swear he went to bed shortly after midnight the wife is certain he never left the house she got up at am to go to the bathroom saw him there his snoring woke her up again at five the wife i said yeah but montez is solid as they come married thirtyfive years vietnam service record no criminal activity not even traffic tickets the school principal says he gets along great with everyone always willing to go the extra mile really does care about the school and the students told hooks cutting the body down was exactly the kind of thing montez would do a couple of years ago a kid choked on something and montez did the heimlich maneuver and saved him a genuine hero wait theres more hooks located an old army buddy of montezs a neighbor on the same block apparently montez fended off a horde of cong rescued six other soldiers lots of medals now one thing i remember clearly is cong stringing up bodies we cut them down all the time so that could be another reason in terms of latvinia hooks and mclaren talked to the grandmother and she said the girl was incorrigible going out at all hours wouldnt listen to reason no steady boyfriends no gang she hung out with just not too bright easygoing and gullible and sometimes shed just start acting weird dancing and singing pulling up her blouse neighbors said latvinias rep was a girl you could talk into anything any drugs in her system tox results arent back yet and the coroner said there were no needle marks on the body but her nasal passages were significantly eroded and there was some scarring on her heart so coke for sure im still looking for deafgirl murders in other divisions and ive also been checking on that dvll note nothing so far it probably was a random scrap nothing in irits evidence bag no personal effects in irits evidence bag everything was returned to the parents and the evidenceroom log lists no pocket contents of any kind is returning clothes on an unsolved standard procedure no but with no semen or body fluids or any other evidence and carmeli being a big shot i can understand why it happened pause yeah its a screwup but at this point id settle for a bad guys lawyer jumping up and down on it going to ask the carmelis to look at the clothes think its worth it probably not but why risk another omission yeah ill bring it up when i speak to the mother left a message with carmeli respectfully requesting blah blah blah but havent heard back for all i know the clothes have already been buried do jews bury the clothing dont know whatever okay ill call you if anything interesting comes up thanks for listening send me a bill i set out for downtown avoiding the freeway and taking sunset wanting to feel the city from bel air to skid row entering hospital row made me think of my days at western pediatrics hospital my induction into a world of suffering and occasional redemption heroics too i thought of guillermo montez saving all those lives in asia winning all those medals now a janitor working a second job at echo park la became latin america then the downtown skyline came into view behind a cloverleaf of highway blue steel and white cement and the pure gold of reflective glass towers incising a curdledmilk sky lehmanns seventh street office was in a lovely sixstory limestone building one of the older ones in a circumscribed part of the district where pinstripe and filofax predominated and the homeless and diseased were invisible i parked at a nearby paylot and walked over the entire ground floor of the building was taken up by an insurance company with its own entrance to the right was a separate foyer for the rest of the structure generous and chilly charcoal granite with gold deco trim two goldcage elevators a tobaccoandaftershave smell a carved walnut reception desk with no one behind it the directory said floors and were occupied by a private bank called american trust and the fourth by something called the city club accessed by private elevator key only the rest of the tenants were investment firms lawyers accountants and on the top story roone lehmann phd listed as a consultant unusual setting for therapy and lehmann wasnt advertising that he was a psychologist for the sake of treatmentshy police officers and other reluctant patients one of the cages arrived and i rode up six flights the corridor ceilings were high white ringed with garland molding the hallways oakpaneled and carpeted in maroon wool printed with tiny white stars the office doors were oak too and identified by small silver plaques that had been buffed recently soft characterless music flowed from invisible speakers hunting prints hung on the walls and fresh flowers in glass vases sat on oiled pembroke tables every twenty feet far cry from the plainwrap ambience of the israeli consulate lehmanns office was in a corner neighbored by multiplepartner law firms his name and degree on silver again no occupation i tried the door locked an illuminated button off to the right glowed emberorange against the wood i pressed it and was buzzed immediately into a very small brownwalled anteroom furnished with two blue wingback chairs and a stiffly upholstered deep green queen anne sofa a glasstopped chinoiserie coffee table bore the wall street journal the times and usa today artless walls reluctant light from two overhead recessed spots another button on the inner door over a please ring in sign before i reached it the door opened dr delaware dr lehmann the drymellow voice more muted than it had been over the phone almost sad i shook a soft hand and we studied each other he was in his fifties tall and roundshouldered and softlooking with shaggy white hair and thick flattened features bushy eyebrows bore down on fatigued lids brown eyes worked their way through a squint he wore a doublebreasted navy blazer with gold buttons gray flannel slacks white shirt loosely knotted pink tie white pocket square carelessly stuffed black wing tips rumpledlooking though the clothes were perfectly pressed and expensive cashmere blazer working buttonholes on the cuffs said handtailored singleneedle stitching on the shirt collar the tie was silk mesh he motioned me in the rest of the suite consisted of a small walnutpaneled bathroom and a huge butteryellow office with a high molded ceiling and distressed herringbone oak flooring that had lifted in places a frayed blue persian rug that looked very old spread diagonally over the wood two more blue wingbacks and a filigreed silver table formed a conversational area at the rear of the room between them and the desk was an empty expanse of rug then a pair of black tweed armchairs closer to a massive cherrywood desk two victorian mahogany bookshelves were crowded with volumes but the glass doors to the cases spat back glare from a pair of windows obscuring the titles the windows were narrow and high cut at the outer corners by ruby velvet pullback drapes offering rectangles of city view great view a newer building would have offered a full wall of transparency when this one was built the vista had probably been smokestacks and beanfields the yellow walls were silk no credentials no diplomas nothing that identified the purpose of the office lehmann motioned me to take one of the black armchairs and sank behind the cherry desk the top was green leather with goldtooled edges and on it were a brown calfskin folding blotter silver inkwell letter knife and pen cup and a curiouslooking silver contraption with a flamboyantly engraved crenellated top envelopes extended from compartments probably some kind of message rack lehmann ran his finger along the edge interesting piece i said document holder he said georgian it sat in british parliament two hundred years ago repository for history theres a hole at the bottom where it was screwed into the clarks desk so no one could make off with it he used both hands to lift it and show me i said found its way across the ocean anyway family piece he said as if that explained it spreading his hands flat on the blotter he looked at a thin gold watch officer dahl it would help me to understand what you already know about him ive been told he was bright and mercurial i said not your typical cop cops cant be bright they can be and are helena his sister described him as someone whod read sartre and camus i may be stereotyping but that isnt what you generally think of as typical lapd material though if you work extensively with the police youd know better his hands flew upward and the palms drifted toward each other and touched silently each year my practice brings fewer surprises dr delaware dont you find it harder to resist seeing patterns sometimes i said did the department refer nolan to you another pause nod may i ask why the usual he said adjustment problems the work is extremely stressful what kinds of work problems was nolan having he licked his lips and white hair tumbled across his forehead pushing it away he began playing with his pink tie flicking the tip with a thumbnail over and over finally he said nolan was having both personal problems and difficulties related to work a troubled young man im sorry i really cant be more specific why had i driven across town for this he looked around the big ornate room mercurial is the term helenas or yours i smiled ive got a live patient dr lehmann my own confidentiality issues he smiled back of course you do i was simply trying to lets put it this way dr delaware if youre using mercurial as a euphemism for affective disorder id understand that very well very well letting me know without saying so that nolan had suffered from mood swings depression only or manicdepression i guess its too much to ask if were talking unipolar or bipolar does it really matter im sure shes not seeking a dsm iv diagnosis true i said do any other euphemisms come to mind he tucked the tie in and sat up straighter dr delaware i sympathize with your situation with the sisters its only natural that shed seek answers but you and i both know shell never get what shes really after which is what survivors always crave absolution as i said understandable but if youve dealt with lots of similar cases you know that leads them off the track they havent sinned the suicide has in a manner of speaking im sure helena is a lovely woman who adored her brother and now shes torturing herself with shouldhaves and couldhaves pardon my audacity but id say your time with her would be better spent guiding her toward feeling good about herself rather than fathoming the workings of a very troubled mind was nolan too troubled to do police work obviously but that never became clear never his voice had climbed and a flush had spread under his jaw snaking downward and disappearing under his collar had he missed a danger sign covering his own rear its a tragedy all around thats really all i have to say he stood dr lehmann i wasnt implying but someone else might and i wont have it any therapist worth his salt knows theres absolutely nothing that can be done if an individuals serious about destroying himself look at all the suicides that take place on psychiatric wards with full supervision he leaned toward me one hand tugging down at a cashmere lapel tell your patient that her brother loved her but his problems got the best of him problems shes better off not knowing believe me much better off staring at me sexual problems i said he waved me off tell her you spoke to me and i said he was depressed and that police work may have exacerbated the depression but didnt cause it tell her his suicide couldnt have been prevented and she had nothing to do with it help her plaster her emotional fissures thats our job to patch assuage massage inform our patients theyre okay were couriers of okayness through the anger came something i thought i recognized the sadness that can result from too many years absorbing the poison of others most therapists experience it sooner or later sometimes it passes sometimes it settles in like a chronic infection guess we are i said among other things sometimes it gets difficult what does massaging oh i dont know he said one chooses ones job and one does it thats the key to being a professional theres no point complaining when the going gets tough the therapist gets tougher i wondered if hed used the chinup approach with nolan the department would approve of something like that he smiled after all these years i find the work enriching how many years is that sixteen but its still fresh perhaps its because my first career was in the business world where the philosophy was quite different its not enough for me to succeed you must fail brutal i said oh quite policemen are easy by comparison he walked me to the door and as i passed the bulky bookshelves i was able to make out some of the titles organizational structure group behavior management strategies psychometric testing out in the waiting room he said im sorry i havent been able to reveal more the entire situation was bleak let the sister maintain her own image of nolan believe me its far more compassionate this unspeakable pathology he displayed i said its directly related to the suicide very likely so was he feeling guilty about something he buttoned his blazer im not a priest dr delaware and your client wants illusion not facts trust me on that as i got back on the elevator i felt as if id been rushed through an overpriced tasteless meal now it was starting to repeat why had he wasted my time had he intended to say more but changed his mind knowing he was professionally vulnerable because hed missed something crucial fear of a lawsuit would make helena and me a major threat not talking to me at all would be seen as unreasonable obstructionism but if he was covering why even hint around at nolans serious problems wanting to find out what i knew the lift opened at to let in three hefty men in gray suits and eyeglasses their jovial chatter ceased the moment they saw me and they turned their backs as the taller one slipped a key into the city club slot after they exited the elevator took a while to kick in and i had a view of whiteandblack checkerboard marble floor polished wood walls softly lit oil landscapes riotously colored mixed flowers in obsidian urns a tuxedoed maitre d smiled and welcomed them forward they entered the club talking again laughing behind them silverware clattered and redjacketed black waiters hurried by with covered dishes on trays as the elevator filled with the smell of roast meat and rich sauce the gilded door slid shut silently i drove west taking the freeway this time still thinking about lehmann strange bird and an oldworld quality to his demeanor british pronunciations hed said the right things but was unlike any therapist id ever met as if reciting for my benefit analyzing me some psychologists and psychiatrists the bad ones make a game of it believe me shes much better off not knowing strange bird strange location consultant all those books on management and psychological testing nothing on therapy practicing beyond the boundaries of his competence was that why he was edgy if so how had he gotten lapds business no big mystery there politics as usual who you knew the custommade cashmere the studied carelessness and oldmoney furnishings a consultant with family connections downtown connections could mean big business a stream of referrals from the police department and other government agencies a potential flood of referrals because though lapd maintained a few psychologists on staff most of their time was spent screening applicants and teaching hostage negotiation and they were chronically overworked something else milo had told me once that cops considered the inhouse shrinks tools of the brass were cynical about assurances of confidentiality often reluctant to seek them out for help except when filing for stress disability something lapd officers had engaged in for years at a notorious rate now even worse in the postriot era meaning lots of money could be made contracting to field complaints the unspoken directive from the department would be find them healthy which would explain lehmanns selfdescription as a courier of okayness and why he might have been reluctant to acknowledge warning signs in nolan had the young cop come to him with a history of mood swings and alienation complaining of crushing job pressures only to receive tough love one does ones job thats the key to being professional now lehmann wanted to quash any budding inquiry let the dead rest his reputation too when i got home i looked him up in my american psychological association directory no listing none in any of the local guilds or healthcare provider rosters either which was odd if he was a contractor but maybe lapd referrals alone gave him enough business and he didnt need to solicit other sources or maybe he really was old money choosing psychology as a second career for personal fulfillment rather than income respite after years in the heartless world of business the big office and leather desk and books the trappings of doctorhood simply props to help him fill the hours before he rode down for a rubdown at the club i phoned the state medical board and confirmed that roone mackey lehmann was indeed duly licensed to practice psychology in california and had been for five years his degree was from a place called new dominion university and hed done his clinical training at the pathfinder foundation neither of which id heard of no complaints had ever been filed against him nothing irregular about his certification i thought about him some more realized there was nothing i could or should do bottom line he was right if nolan had been adamant about leaving this world no one could have stopped him serious problems my question about sexuality had evoked a meaningful silence so maybe that had been it a bleak situation the sister better off not knowing leading me to the main question what would i tell helena i called her at the hospital but she wasnt in not at home either and i left a message and phoned milo at the station new insights he said sorry no actually im calling about nolan dahl what about him if youre busy wish i was been on the phone all day and the closest case ive got to irit is a retarded thirteenyearold boy abducted a year ago in newton division body never found but his sneakers were full of dried blood left in front of the newton station no lightbulboverthehead feeling but im driving over later to look at the actual file what about dahl i just met with his therapist fellow named roone lehmann ever hear of him no why he got the referral through the department and i got the feeling he was on some lapd list could be is there some other reason youre asking about him i told him so you think maybe he botched dahls treatment and is covering his ass he implied that nolan had serious problems that helena doesnt want to know about meaning if he missed the boat it was a big one exactly and hes an odd one milo works in a building with bankers and lawyers labels himself a consultant but doesnt spell out what he does but hes duly licensed no checkered history so maybe im being paranoid i would like to know why nolan went to see him would the department keep records if it was something to do with the job they sure would but good luck getting hold of it especially now that he killed himself if he put in for a stress pension or some other compensation thered be a record of that but once again things get lost when it suits the right people thats another thing i said if he was under stress whyd he transfer from west la to hollywood you got me maybe he got tired of scumbag celebrities and their battered wives my thought was he craved action liked taking risks i told him about the breakin at nolans apartment the cheap lock on the back door no big surprise he said cops can be supersecurity freaks or they become danger freaks and get lax if the public knew how many times we got victimized the confidence level would sink even lower if thats possible but if nolan craved danger why would he buckle he grunted your field not mine sounds like were both running the blindalley marathon id offer to ask around about his records but it would be a waste of time one person who might be able to tell you something would be his training officer helena already spoke to him and he was baffled by the suicide name a sergeant baker wesley baker dont know the first name helena said hes at parker center now thats wes baker his voice changed softer guarded you know him i said oh yeah interesting what is wes baker training rookies again i didnt know but we dont have much contact with the boys in blue listen alex this isnt the best time or place to have this discussion lemme get over to newton check out the yearold abduction file and if nothing else comes up i can drop by this evening if youll be home no plans not to be i said realizing id been home for nearly an hour and hadnt gone back to see robin if i go out ill call you fine im heading over to the east side now sayonara robin was taking off her goggles when i walked in and she reached for the vacuum cleaner at the sight of the hose spike began barking furiously he despises the industrial age canine luddite when he saw me he stopped cocked his head started to trot forward then changed his mind and returned to attacking the vacuum canister robin laughed and said stop she tossed a milkbone in a corner and spike went after it we kissed how was your day she said unproductive yours quite productive actually she tossed her curls and smiled dont hate me because youre beautiful that too she touched my cheek what went wrong alex nothing just lots of seek and very little find that little girls murder that and another case a suicide that will probably never be explained she put her arm through mine and we left the studio spike at our heels breathing excitedly milkbone crumbs dotting his pendulous flews i dont envy you she said dont envy what hunting for explanations she showered and changed into a charcoalgray pantsuit and diamond stud earrings and said how about meat that argentinian place wed tried a few months ago baked garlic appetizers i said not very social it is if we both indulge sure ill eat a whole bowl afterward we can tango or lambada whatever and fume up each others faces suddenly she swooned into my arms ah alessandro she set spike up with water and snacks while i changed and left messages at milos west la desk his home in west hollywood and the number he used for his afterhours privateeye business blue investigations hed begun the moonlight gig several years ago after the department took him off duty for punching out a superior whod endangered his life and banished him to the parker center dataprocessing office in hopes of nudging him off the force hed managed to regain his detective position and it had been a while since hed solicited private work but hed held on to the exchange symbol of freedom i supposed or insecurity for all the talk of diversity and open recruitment the role of a gay detective was far from comfortable had that been nolans problem never married but he was only twentyseven relationships with women in the past but as far as helena knew nothing recent as far as helena knew which wasnt very far at all i thought of nolans apartment mattress on the floor no food in the fridge the dingy furniture even accounting for the trashing not exactly a swinging bachelor lair a loner flirting with all sorts of philosophies shifting from one political extreme to the other had selfdenial been the latest or had he divested himself of material pleasures because he just didnt care anymore or wanted to punish himself lehmann had used the word sin but when id asked him about guilt hed said he wasnt a priest somewhere along the line had he judged nolan had nolan judged himself passed sentence and carried out the execution for what i pictured the young cop in gojis surrounded by the night denizens hed been assigned to rein in drawing out his service gun putting it in his mouth symbolic as so many suicides are final fellatio stripping himself bare in front of other sinners policemen committed suicide more frequently than civilians but few did it publicly ready robin called from the door oh yeah i said lets tango the observer the psychologist his presence complicated matters attend to him or sturgis sturgis was the professional but so far all the big policeman had done was stay in his office all day on the phone probably predictable the psychologist was a bit more adventurous hed gone on two outings perhaps he could be used to advantage the first trip had been to that duplex on sycamore to meet the pleasantlooking but tensefaced blond woman her tension made him think patient some kind of onthestreet therapy of course there was another possibility a girlfriend the guy was stepping out on the woman with the auburn hair who lived with him a beauty some kind of sculptress hed seen her carrying blocks of wood from her truck to the rear of the house he watched the psychologist and the unhappy woman talk then go inside the duplex liaison with one while the other one chipped away the blond woman was trim and nicelooking but nothing like the sculptress and the two times hed seen the sculptress with the psychologist the affection had seemed genuine touching each other a lot that eagerness but logic had little to do with human behavior terrible things had taught him about the selfdestructive element that ran through the human soul like a polluted stream they stayed inside for twenty minutes then went out to the garage the psychologist didnt seem to be relating to her in a romantic way but maybe they were having a rough time no there was no hostility she was talking and he was listening as if he cared attentive but maintaining distance professional distance so she probably was a patient or a sister it definitely didnt look romantic he copied down the license plate number on the blond womans mustang waited til the two of them had driven off then sauntered to the rear of the duplex in his electricians uniform and let himself through the rear door by popping an absurd lock pretty clear why the woman had looked so miserable burglarized he poked around in the debris found utility bills with the name nolan dahl on them that matched the address later that night after a coldsandwichandbottledwater dinner and some praying with insufficient conviction he turned on his computer hacked into the department of motor vehicles file and ran the womans license plates helena allison dahl thirty years old blond hair blue eyes an address in woodland hills exwife of the burglarized nolan so where was nolan or maybe the guy was an irate husband whod ruined his own place to get back at the wife shed call her therapist for something like that one thing seemed likely nothing to do with murder which made sense sturgis would be concentrating fulltime on irit but the psychologist would have a whole other life to him irit would be just another consultation tentative conclusion outing number didnt relate to any of his concerns neither as far as he could tell did the second one downtown terrible traffic all the way and following the psychologists green cadillac at a discreet distance had been difficult another challenge was finding parking for the van near the lot the psychologist chose without losing sight of that curly head for too long getting into the limestone building though was easy no guard and the electricians uniform gave him that air of belonging the van too uniforms and vans hed spent so much of his life in them his main prop for the building was a nice little toolbox whose contents could serve as more than props he carried it in his good hand and kept the bad one in his pocket because why attract unnecessary attention he made it to the lobby just as the psychologist entered the elevator watched the lift rise to the top floor moments later up there himself he examined the doorplates trying to figure out where the guy had gone law firms accountants investment bankers and one phd another psychologist the sign said only consultant roone m lehmann phd one consultant visiting another unless the psychologist was a major investor and had come to check out his holdings unlikely the guy lived nicely but not extravagantly lehmann the consultant was the best bet he copied the name down for a dmv run ducked around a corner that gave him a view of lehmanns door pulled out his electric meter and unscrewed an overhead light fixture if any of the woodpaneled doors had opened he was ready to probe and tinker and look official nothing happened until nearly a half hour later when the psychologist stepped into the hall out of lehmanns office lehmann a big flabbylooking whitehaired guy with bushy eyebrows watched delaware depart with no friendliness in his eyes stood there looking unhappy til delaware was on the elevator delaware seemed to surround himself with unhappy people occupational hazard finally lehmann went back inside the meeting had lasted twentyeight minutes brief consultation about something relevant to him he screwed the fixture back in and put the meter in the box under the top tray of tools was a ninemillimeter automatic not the one from the car but the identical model fully loaded wrapped in black felt with all the gear he was lugging he was a metal detectors dream so few buildings had metal detectors even government buildings last week an employee of the citys electronicrepair plant had come to work with a machine pistol and mowed down six coworkers so much madness and violence but people continued to pretend otherwise crime and denial he understood that back home in the silence he played the dmv listed roone m lehmann phd fiftysix six one as living in santa monica the thomas guide map placed the address in one of the canyons that led down to pacific coast highway not all that far from irit another of lifes little coincidences it was pm and time to switch gears he phoned the west la station and asked for sturgis a few moments later the big policeman came on the line he hung up so the guy was still staying put dedicated civil servant back to the psychologist probably useless but since the girl on the playground nothing interesting had happened and he had to keep busy keeping busy was his nature it helped fight off the loneliness he drove to beverly glen and parked a ways down the road from the narrow pathway that curled up to the psychologists and the sculptresss modern white house as luck would have it eighteen minutes later the green cadillac nosed out onto the glen and sped by him he caught a blur of two goodlooking smiling faces ten minutes later he was at the front door ringing the bell with a gloved good hand from inside a dog barked from the sound of it a small dog dogs could be dangerous but he liked them hed once had a dog that he loved a friendly little spaniel with a black spot over one eye a man had brutalized the animal and hed killed the man in front of the dog the dog recovered though he was never quite as trusting three years later a bladder tumor finished him off yet another loss he examined the door lock dead bolt a good brand but a common one and he had masters for it the eighth key he tried worked and he was inside nice place inside too high airy ceilings white walls some art good furniture a couple of persian rugs that looked to be quality a highpitched alarm warning buzzer sounded as the dog raced forward small and cute dark brindle with ridiculous ears and a flat face that couldnt be taken seriously some kind of bulldog a miniature it charged his pants snarling and howling and scattering spittle deftly he picked it up heavier than it looked he needed two hands to keep it at arms length as it struggled carrying it to a bathroom he locked it in and it butted the door over and over the alarm buzzer still going the keypad by the door flashing red probably less than a minute before the alarm bells kicked in but no worry there police response in los angeles was slow sometimes nonexistent and in a remote area like this with no close neighbors to complain there was nothing to worry about things had gotten to the point where only blood brought the police out and even then not with much enthusiasm he walked around the house quickly but calmly able to block out the noise smelling lemon wax looking for a target the more he thought about it the greater was his conviction that choosing the psychologist was the way to go whether or not the guy could do any direct good he had access to sturgis and was thus a conduit two birds with one shot now the bells were clanging very loud but it didnt bother him the alarm company would be phoning soon if no one answered theyd call the police in this case the west la station but sturgis up in the detective office would be unaware some uniformed officer would take the call jot down the details eventually maybe someone would drive by crime and denial what he had to do wouldnt take long anyway he wasnt without some guilt breaking and entering wasnt part of his selfimage but priorities were priorities when he was finished he let the dog out of the bathroom we never got to dance the call came just as we were thinking about dessert and i took it behind the bar of the restaurant this is nancy from your service dr delaware sorry to bother you but your alarm company has been trying to reach you for a while and they finally figured to call us the alarm went off i sounded calm but was feeling a needlestab of panic notdistantenough memories of intrusion the old house reduced to cinders around an hour ago the company records it as a circuit break at the front door theyve called the police but it might be a while before anyone gets there an hour and the police havent gotten there yet im not sure would you like me to phone them no thats okay nancy thanks for letting me know im sure its nothing doctor we get this kind of thing all the time mostly theyre false alarms before i returned to the table i reached milo back at west la going to take advantage of our friendship i said how about getting a patrol car to go by my house why he said sharply i told him ill go myself where are you melrose near fairfax well leave in a minute meet you there get any dinner down all of it we were just about ready to order dessert order it im sure its a false call probably i said but no even if i could eat robin couldnt spikes there yeah he said but whod steal him robin didnt relax fully until we pulled up to the front and she saw milo standing outside on the landing giving the okay sign spike was next to him and milo looked like a dogwalker an absurd notion it made me smile the front door was open the interior lights burning we rushed up the steps spike tugged milo let go of the leash and the dog met us halfway youre okay said robin sweeping him up and kissing him he returned the affection and let me know with a look who was top dog we entered the house when i got here the front door was locked said milo bolted had to use my key no windows jammed nothing messed and that safe you keep in the bedroom closet hasnt been touched so it looks like a false contact the company tomorrow and have them come out and check the system only thing out of sorts is this guy i rubbed spike behind the ears he harrumphed turned away and resumed licking robins neck muscling in on your lady said milo you going to stand for that we drifted into the kitchen robins eyes were all over the place seems fine to me she said let me just check the jewelry i keep loose in my drawer she was back in a moment still there had to be a false alarm good thing i said we didnt exactly get quick protection from the department hey said milo count yourself lucky you didnt get a falsealarm citation protect and cite anything that brings in revenue robin said lets have dessert here you up for ice cream milo he patted his middle aw shucks i shouldnt no more than three scoops and only a quart of chocolate sauce she laughed and left spike trotting along milo scuffed one shoe with the other something in his eyes made me ask if hed learned anything in east la the victim was a kid named raymond ortiz iq of seventyfive overweight some coordination problems very bad eyesight cokebottle glasses he was on a school outing in a park at the east end of newton division tough place known as a gang hangout drugs the usual the theory is that he wandered away from the group and got grabbed never been found but two months later his bloodfilled sneakers were left near the front door of the newton station resting on top of an old newspaper clipping about the disappearance raymonds blood was on record at county hospital because hed participated in a retardation study and they got a perfect match jesus i said poor poor kid in some ways its so much like irit but in others its nothing like irit i know with irit and with latvinia we had the body but no blood with this one blood and no body and the blood implies something other than strangulation at least not gentle strangulation i hate that term milo me too pathologists are such dispassionate bastards arent they i thought about what hed told me even with the differences weve got two retarded kids snatched out of a school group in a park what better place to snatch a kid alex parks and malls are favorite stalking zones and this park was nothing like the nature conservancy no trails no surrounding wilderness your basic innercity place poorly kept up bums and junkies on the grass and they took kids there for a field trip an outing not a field trip the school was being painted and they wanted to get the kids away from the fumes the parks a few blocks away they were taking them there every day the entire school went they brought them a few grades at a time raymond was with the specialed kids and they were grouped with the first and second graders so there were lots of smaller children and the killer chose raymond without wilderness what did he use for cover there are some big trees behind the public rest rooms the most logical scenario is raymond went to the john and got dragged into a stall either killed right there or incapacitated they never found any of his blood in the john but he could have been killed cleanly the blood for the shoes taken later whatever happened no one saw it none of his blood does that mean someone elses like i said its a drug place junkies use the stalls to fix there were bloodspecks all over the place at first they thought it would be a lead but no match to raymond the samples are on file if they ever get a perp but why should the perp have bled they also dusted for prints found matches to a few local bums with sheets but all of them had solid alibis and none of them had a history of pedophilia or sex crimes thinking of the boy trapped in a fetid stall i felt my stomach knot up whats the theory about how the killer got him out of the park the parking lots about thirty feet behind the bathrooms with the trees in between a nice green barrier if the assholes car was nearby he could have carried raymond tossed him in driven off what time of day did this take place late morning between eleven and noon broad daylight i said same as irit so damned brazen you said raymond was chubby how much did he weigh hundred and ten or so but short four seven heavier than irit i said once again a strong killer hows the case classified open but very cold not a single lead the entire year the main newton d on the case is an older guy named alvarado very good very methodical he began the same way we did on irit hauled in and interviewed sex offenders he also grilled all the gang bangers known to hang out at the park they said theyd never hurt a poor little kid which is bullshit they kill poor little kids in drivebys all the time but raymond was actually a popular kid because his older brothers were bangers in vatos locos and dad had been too vl rules that area and the family was wellrespected but couldnt that be a possible motive i said some internecine gang thing and raymond was used to get a message across to the vatos had the brothers or the father gotten on anyones bad side were they involved in the drug trade alvarado looked into that the father served some time years ago but hes straight now works as an upholsterer downtown and the brothers are lowstatus punks not particularly aggressive sure they use like all their buddies but theyre not kingpins and as far as alvarado could learn they hadnt pissed anyone off bigtime plus if it had been a gang message some sort of revenge would have been taken alvarados feeling right from the start was a sex crime because of the park setting the john the shoes left at the station to him that was a taunt a powertrip sicko trying to show how smart he was at the polices expense make sense it makes a lot of sense i said remembering the businessworld adage dr lehmann had quoted this afternoon its not enough that i succeed you have to fail yeah he was brazen all right he said arrogant bastard to me sending the clipping also meant he got off on the publicity was hoping to stir things up how much publicity did the abduction create couple of small articles in the times couple of larger ones in el diario more than latvinia shavers gotten by the way all those media leeches came up with was a thirtysecond story on the late news that night no followup which raises a question i said i can see him killing irit to get publicity but then why do latvinia exactly i dont see enough of a match to consider these anything but three separate cases did the shoes stir up the case again nope alvarado never released anything to the press why not to hold something back in case the asshole ever gets caught i asked about the dvll thing and alvarado said it didnt ring any bells so that scrap of paper probably was just trash three separate cases i said you disagree no i said not yet but the similarities do bear consideration the choice of retarded teenagers picking them out of a crowd in raymonds and irits cases and in latvinias from plenty of other girls working the street i keep picturing the same kind of psychopath for each smug meticulous confident enough to spirit a victim away in broad daylight or leave her in a public place like the schoolyard leaving the body out in the open in two instances and a bodysurrogate bloody shoes in another sneaky but an exhibitionist a showoff taken with himself which isnt profound because every psychopath is selfobsessed theyre like cookies out of a cutter same power lust same extreme narcissism same need for excitement and total disregard for others seen one psychopath seen em all in terms of their inner motivation that happens to be true i said psychologically theyre flat banal boring think of all the creeps youve put away any fascinating souls he thought about that not really emotional black holes i said no there there their crime techniques differ because of individual quirks not just mo because the same killer can change his method if its not psychologically important to him yet still have a trademark yeah ive seen that rapists wholl switch back and forth from a gun or a knife but always talk to their victims the same way you see any trademark here just retarded kids with various disabilities i said i suppose that could indicate some twisted notion of eugenics culling the herd though his basic motive would still be psychosexual give me a sheet of paper and your pen sitting down at the breakfast table i drew a grid and filled it in as milo watched over my shoulder the asterisks are matches milo said yes wheres the ethnicity match all three were minorities i said a racist killer he said it also fits with the eugenics thing as does the fact that all three were only mildly retarded functioning very well teenagers meaning capable of reproduction he tells himself hes cleansing the gene pool hes not just some lust killer which is why he doesnt assault the victims him he said one killer hypothetically usually lust killers prey on their own race the conventional wisdom used to be always until crossracial serial killers started showing up and murder and rape have been used for years as part of racial and ethnic warfare he scanned the chart again park and schoolyard both are public places where kids congregate i cant help thinking leaving latvinia on that yard had some kind of meaning maybe to terrify the schoolkids the next morning expand the violence culling he shook his head just presenting another perspective for arguments sake he picked up the chart and ran his finger down the middle truthfully alex what i see is lots of partials very little that goes across the board and one killer operating out of three jurisdictions what better way to evade notice than by moving around i said it would lessen the chance of a connection being discovered because how often do detectives from different divisions get together it could also be part of the thrill by killing all over the city he expands his sphere of influence rules the city so to speak the killer king of la he frowned okay lets stick with the onekiller hypothesis for arguments sake raymonds abduction was a full year before irit latvinia three months after you say hes compulsive not much even spacing there assuming no murders took place between raymond and irit and even if they didnt with lust crimes the drive often accelerates as the victims pile up or he killed out of town but lets assume he operates only in la and raymond was his first even with his arrogance he would have been apprehensive pulling back to see if the investigation turned anything up when it didnt he left the shoes when that didnt get any attention he struck again in a safe place like the conservancy and that success bolstered his confidence so he repeated sooner meaning the next one could be even sooner shoving his hands in his pockets he began to pace something else i said if raymond was his first maybe he removed the body to use it kept it for two months until he thought he was finished with it or and this is sickening until it wasnt usable anymore at that point he disposed of it keeping the shoes and whatever else as mementos maybe he was still at a point where he wanted to quit but after a while the shoes no longer worked for him as sexual stimuli so he delivered them to newton division with the clipping to revive some of the powerthrill that was temporary too and he went stalking driving around the city looking for another outdoor setting some place that evoked raymonds murder but different enough to avoid detection of a pattern he stopped pacing first a boy then girls hes ambisexual remember he doesnt have sex with them the thrill is the stalking and capture thats why he took raymond but not irit and latvinia by then he was less impulsive had learned what really turned him on youve got some mind doctor thats what you pay me for when you pay me he tapped a foot and studied the rug i dont know alex its a clever construction but there are still too many differences im sure youre right i said but heres another thought all three kids were murdered in public places perhaps because the killer or killers finds that erotic or he has no access to an indoor killing spot homeless no i doubt it hes got a car and i still see him as middleclass neat and clean i was thinking just the opposite a family man living an outwardly wholesome and conventional life maybe with a wife or a livein girlfriend even children of his own a nice cozy domestic setup where thered be no convenient place to play with a dead body what about a van he said you know how many of these assholes love vans a van might work but sooner or later hed have to clean it up if im right about his being a family man with a job it would be sooner not a ninetofive job alex because he gets away in the middle of the day probably not i said someone with flexibility selfemployed an independent contractor or a work schedule with revolving shifts maybe a uniform some kind of repairman or park maintenance worker a security guard one thing id do is crossreference the personnel lists for the conservancy and the park where raymond was killed if you come across someone who switched jobs from east la to the palisades ask him lots of questions he pulled out his pad and made a note and keep looking for other retarded victims other divisions robin came in with three bowls and set them down milo folded the chart id made and slipped it in the pad here you go boys chocolate syrup for you milo but the only flavor we had was vanilla no prob said milo the virtue of simplicity at ninethirty i walked milo down to his unmarked he lagged behind me on the stairs and his footsteps were halting and deliberate going home i said nope back to the office gonna call every goddamn nightshift detective in every goddamn division look for any remotely possible matches if i dont get any thatll tell me something too he opened the car door thanks for the input now let me tell you about sergeant wes baker we were classmates in the academy two of the oldest guys in the class he might have been the oldest maybe thats why he started off thinking we were kindred spirits or maybe it was because i had a masters degree and he fancied himself an intellectual and you didnt want to be kindred with him what are you a shrink i didnt want to be kindred with anyone at that place still tucked deeply in the closet waking up with my jaws clenched so tight i thought my face would break every day i memorized another section of the penal code shot bullseyes on the range did handtohand the whole macho bit after vietnam no big challenge but it was like someone else going through it i felt like an impostor was sure id be found out and lynched so i kept to myself avoided afterhours with the other recruits didnt have to pretend to be a pussy hound and smile through the fag jokes why i didnt quit i still dont know maybe after the war i couldnt find any alternatives that seemed better a sudden frightening grin spread across his face and thats my confession father back to wes baker he was a relative loner too because he considered himself above it all mr experience he saw me reading vonnegut and got the idea we could relate because he was into books philosophy zen yoga politics psychology always eager for a meaningoflife discussion i pretended to go along which was easy because he liked to talk and i know how to listen he told me his life story in weekly installments hed knocked around a bit traveled everywhere peace corps worked oil rigs and cruise ships taught school in the inner city beentheredoneit he was always complaining he couldnt get a bridge foursome at the academy that for the other guys poker was an intellectual challenge he kept trying to buddy up inviting me over i kept declining politely finally midway through the course he asked me to his place to watch a rams game and i agreed wondering if he was gay too but his girlfriend was there cute little grad student from the u and her friend a budding actress my date he smiled again this time with some pleasure noreen great legs flat voice maybe the silent era would have treated her better wes cooked up this indian banquet chutneys and curries whatever okra which to me is snot from the ground chicken in a clay pot he served some esoteric beer from bombay that tasted like horse piss the game was on the tube but it never got watched because wes nudged us into a debate on east versus west who really enjoyed the greater quality of life then he got down on the floor and demonstrated yoga positions trying to show how they could be used to subdue suspects without undue violence gave a whole lecture on the history of martial arts and how it related to asian religion his girlfriend thought it was fascinating noreen got sleepy sounds like a fun evening real chortle fest after that night i was friendly to him but really kept my distance the guy was too intense for me and life was hard enough without having to deal with all his cosmic bullshit he must have sensed it because he cooled off too and eventually we were just nodding hello in the hall then avoiding each other completely about a week before graduation i happened to be having one of my few nights out dinner at a place in west hollywood with a guy id met at a bar older guy an accountant also struggling he ended up divorcing his wife had a massive heart attack shortly after and died at fortytwo anyway wed been at this place on santa monica and when we came out some cars were stopped at a red light the guy put his arm around my shoulder i wasnt comfortable being public and i moved away he laughed it off and we walked to the curb to cross the street just then i got that backoftheneck feeling when someones watching you turned and saw wes baker in a little red sports car looking right through me with this sothatexplains it expression when my eye caught his he pretended he didnt see me and jackrabbited the moment the light turned green a week later someone busted into my locker and filled it with a stack of gay porn a huge stack including some really nasty s and m stuff i could never prove it was baker but who else and a couple of times i caught him staring at me in a weird way studying me like i was some kind of specimen you wondered about his sexuality i said maybe he was cruising west hollywood for a reason was worried that youd seen him and the locker was a bestdefenseisanoffense bit could be but i think it was plain old homophobia not very tolerant for an intellectual since when do the two go hand in hand and to me hes a pseudointellectual alex surfing the philosophical wave of the week maybe he is latent i dont know for obvious reasons i couldnt afford to make an issue of it so i just stayed away i didnt see him again for a long time then around five years ago he made sergeant and got transferred to west la and i thought oh shit here come problems but there werent any he made a point of coming up and saying hi milo long time no see hows everything mr jovial i couldnt shake the feeling that he was putting me on patronizing me but ds and uniforms dont have that much contact and his path never crossed mine a few months ago he got kicked upstairs to parker center some sort of administrative job if he fancies himself an intellectual i said how come he stayed in uniform and didnt try for detective maybe he likes the streets putting the cosmic yoga choke hold on bad guys maybe its the image tailored duds gun baton stripes some blues think detectives are paperpushing wusses or could be he likes training rookies easing little bluebirds out of the nest in some ways he sounds like nolan selfstyled scholar trying on different philosophies i dont imagine the department operates like a computer dating service but two guys like that getting together seems awfully coincidental im sure its not baker would have been in a position to pick and choose ive been wondering if the suicide had something to do with the job but baker told helena hes baffled the baker i knew would have had an opinion the baker i knew had an opinion about everything thinking about lehmanns reticence and wondering who else shared it i said maybe ill talk to him myself getting involved in this one huh when rick sent the sister to you he thought it would be a quickie why he said she was a nononsense gal all business move em up get em out id had the same feeling about helena had been surprised when shed called for a second appointment she hadnt returned todays calls though suicide changes things i said true i called the departments personnel office and lehmann is on their shrink referral list along with a bunch of others but thats all i can get on him dont spend any more time on it youve got your hands full big hands he growled and held them out palms up for big man with big job me go back to cave now try not to fuck up bigtime i laughed he got in the car and started the engine lest i blanket you in total pessimism zev carmeli called me just before i left for newton said i could talk to his wife tomorrow at the family home i told him i might be bringing you along wondered if hed give me some grief over that psychoanalyzing the wife but he didnt in general he seemed more cooperative as if he finally believed i was on his side have you the time and inclination when five oclock should i meet you there probably best cause i dont know where ill be they live on bolton drive he gave me the address shifted the unmarked into drive coasted ten feet then stopped when you talk to wes baker bear in mind that knowing me will not earn you gold stars i can live with that risk what a pal the next morning i reviewed irits file again learning nothing the theories id spun for milo last night seemed nothing more than random shots i wasnt any further along on nolans suicide either some elements of the typical problem cop were there alienation isolation family history of depression possible job stress the dark secrets lehmann had intimated but trying to explain selfdestruction on the basis of a collection of symptoms is like saying people got poor by losing money lehmanns caginess had accomplished just the opposite of what hed hoped piquing my interest what milod told me about baker was intriguing but before i talked with him i wanted helenas goahead and she still hadnt returned my messages i tried the hospital again and was told shed called in sick last night no one answered at her home huddled under the covers sleeping off a nasty virus should i call baker anyway if i asked questions and told him nothing of substance thered be no breach of confidentiality but grief was a psychic tide ebbing and flowing in response to the magnet of memory and helenas sickness could be something of quite a different nature emotional withdrawal nothing healed but time and sometimes that didnt work either the last time id seen her shed taken home the family snapshot albums memory overload i decided to try baker hed probably refuse to talk to me anyway a parker center desk officer told me sergeant baker had a day off and i left my name and number expecting nothing but barely an hour later as i sat typing a childcustody report my service called and said he was on the line dr delaware wesley baker returning your call what kind of doctor are you clipped businesslike he was older than milo but sounded in his thirties an aggressive young lawyer thanks for calling back sergeant im a psychologist looking into the death of nolan dahl looking into it at whose request officer dahls sister a psychological autopsy nothing that formal just trying to get some closure he said im not surprised she called me a few weeks ago trying to get some answers poor woman i was extremely upset by nolans suicide myself disappointed that i couldnt tell her much because nolan and i hadnt worked together for some time and i didnt want to give her information that might be irrelevant she sounded depressed its good she got professional help irrelevant in what way pause not being a professional i wasnt sure what would be therapeutic and what would be harmful youre saying nolan had some problems that could upset her nolan was an interesting kid complex the same term lehmann had used in what way hmm listen i dont feel right getting into this without thinking it through im off today planned to get a little sailing in but if youll give me a little time to collect my thoughts you can come by my boat well see what turns up i appreciate that sergeant whens a good time for you how say noon if were both hungry we can grab some lunch you can even pay fair enough wheres your boat marina del rey shes called satori im docked right near the marina shores hotel he gave me the slip number if im not there it means the winds died and i had to tie up and use the engine one way or the other ill be there the boat was thirty feet of sleek white fiberglass with gray trim tall masts the sails tied satori painted on the hull in black script edged with gold the sky over the marina was baby blue rubbed with chalk dust not much wind at all the craft and its neighbors barely bobbed and i wondered if baker had even gotten out of the harbor just a moments walk away the rear balcony of the marina shores hotel extended over the footpath that ribboned the edge of the dock early lunchers sat nursing iced drinks and forking seafood a wall of chainlink sectioned the hotel property from the rental slips but it was unlocked and i walked through satori i knew it had something to do with zen and had looked it up before leaving a state of intuitive illumination maybe sergeant wesley baker could illuminate nolans death he came out from below before i reached the boat drying his hands with a white towel five nine stocky but without visible body fat he wore a white lacoste polo shirt pressed black jeans and white deck shoes looking every year of his age around fifty but a wellputtogether fifty he had a durable tan short dark brown hair silvering at the temples square broad shoulders and wellmuscled hairless arms his head was slightly small for the blocky torso the face round vaguely childlike despite sun seams and assertive features large goldframed eyeglasses were turned to ray guns by the midday sun a successful businessman on his day off he waved i climbed aboard and we shook hands doctor wes baker up for lunch how about the hotel sure let me lock up and ill be right up he was gone for a moment came back carrying a large black calfskin billfold more like a purse really and he carried it in one hand we got off the boat and headed for the hotel he walked very slowly as if every movement counted like a dancer or a mime swinging his arms looking from side to side a faint smile on thin wide lips behind the glasses his eyes were brown and curious if he was planning to hide facts it wasnt making him tense glorious day isnt it he said beautiful living up here you give up space i make do with four hundred square feet and the marinas as congested as the city but at night when things quiet down and theres a clear view out to the ocean the illusion of infinity more than makes up for all that satori i said he chuckled satori is an ideal but youve got to keep trying do you sail infrequently im comparatively new to it myself did some work on boats when i was a kid but nothing that taught me how to operate a serious craft i got into it a few years ago trial by ordeal a few knocks on the noggin and you learn to watch out for the boom nolan did some work on boats too he nodded santa barbara fishing boats he did some abalone diving too didnt care for any of it oh he didnt have a taste for manual labor we climbed the stairs to the dining patio a sign said please wait to be seated and the hosts lectern was empty two dozen tables covered in navy blue linen dotted the brickfloored terrace three were occupied crystal and silver played with the sun the east wall was glass that looked into an empty dining room also he said killing fish turned him off said baker looking around killing period he was a nonviolent kid had become a vegetarian the year before entering the academy probably the only vegetarian cop i ever met hey max a chinese maitre d emerged from inside the hotel black suit black shirt black tie and a wide professional smile full of distress hello mr baker your tables ready we were shown to a waterside table big enough for four but set for two i could smell brine and boat fuel and someones sautéed lunch nonviolent i said yet he chose police work baker unfolded a navy napkin and placed it on his lap theoretically there shouldnt have been a conflict the goal of the police officer is to reduce violence but of course thats not reality removing his glasses he looked through them blew off a speck of something and put them back on the reality is that police work entails being constantly submerged in violence take a sensitive kid like nolan and the result can be disillusionment did he talk about being disillusioned not in so many words but he wasnt happy always kind of down depressed looking back maybe but he showed no clinical signs he stopped at least that id know being a layman what i mean is his appetite seemed fine and he was always on the job ready to go he just never laughed or got happy as if hed been dipped in some kind of protective coating emotional lacquer to avoid getting hurt he shrugged im out of my element here im as puzzled as everyone by what he did a young waiter brought french bread and asked for our drink order vodka and tonic said baker doctor iced tea im ready to order too the calamari salads great if you go for seafood sure i said two then and lets go with a nice white he looked up at the waiter the young mans expression said his last audition hadnt gone well do you still have that bear cave sauvignon blanc in stock the eightyeight i believe so if you do bring us a bottle if not whats in the same league theres a good blackridge sauvignon blanc whatevers reasonable the doctor here is paying yes sir the waiter left and baker sniffed his finger ah a fine nose pretensions of peach and old leaves and the faintest hint of up he broke off some bread and chewed slowly what nolan did has been bothering the hell out of me on two levels most important of course the act itself the waste but also narcissistically why didnt i see it how long did you work with him three months day after day he was the fastest learner ive ever seen an interesting kid different from other rookies id had but nothing that led me to believe he was highrisk how much do you know about police suicide i know its on the rise sure is the rates probably doubled in the last twenty years and those are only the acknowledged ones throw in guys taking excessive risks accidents that really arent other undetermined deaths and you probably double the count again accidents i said suicide by work sure he said cops like doing it that way because it spares the family the shame the same thing happens with the people cops deal with some profoundly depressed character gets drunk or dusted stands in the middle of the street waving a gun and when the patrol car arrives instead of dropping it he points it at the windshield he pulled an imaginary trigger we call that suicide by cop only difference is the characters family hires a lawyer sues the city for wrongful death and collects depression and litigation make a great combination dr delaware do cops litigate too i said he took off his glasses and stared reflectively out at the harbor live ones do doctor stress pensions all that good stuff lately the departments been clamping down why does the sister want to sue casual tone and he was looking at his bread plate not that i know i said shes just looking for answers not blame in the end its the suicide whos to blame isnt it no one else put that gun in nolans mouth no one else pulled the trigger were there signs beyond his not being the life of the party not that i saw he took things seriously took his work seriously i saw that as positive he was no slacker our drinks arrived as baker tasted his i said besides being a fast learner how was nolan different from the other rookies his seriousness his intelligence were talking major bright doctor wed go on code s breaks and hed whip out a book start reading what kinds of books the penal code politics newspapers and magazines too he always brought something not that i minded id rather read a good book any day than talk about the usual cop stuff whats that harleys corvettes guns and ammo he had a sports car little red fiero did he never mentioned it exactly the point when we were out cruising he concentrated on work when we broke he didnt make small talk intense i liked that did you choose to train nolan because he was smart no he chose me when he was still at the academy i was over there to give a lecture on rules of arrest afterward he came up to me and asked if id be his to when he graduated said he was a quick learner wed get along fine baker smiled shook his head and spread thick bronze hands on the tablecloth the sun was beating down i could feel the heat on the back of my neck pretty damn audacious i figured what he was really after was a west la placement but i was intrigued so i told him to come to the station after shift and wed talk he rubbed the tip of his nose the very next day he showed up on the dot not pushy at all just the opposite deferential i asked him what hed heard about me he said i had a reputation for being intellectual i said for being a to whod show him the way things really were he shrugged he was smart but i didnt know how hed do on the street i figured it would be interesting so i said id see what i could work out in the end i decided to take him because he seemed the best of the lot bad class the usual he said the academys not harvard affirmative action has made things more variable nolan did well his size helped people tended not to mess with him and he never bullied anyone or lorded it over the characters by the book did he ever talk politics no why just trying to get as full a picture as possible well he said if i had to guess id say his politics were conservative simply because you dont find too many flaming liberals in the department was he waving any klan flags no id asked about politics not racism so he got along well with the people you policed as well as anyone what about other policemen did he socialize much a couple of times he and i had dinner other than that i dont think so he stuck to himself would you say he was alienated from the other rookies cant answer that he seemed comfortable with his own lifestyle did he ever tell you what led him to become a cop he put the glasses back on before i took him on i asked him that and he said he wouldnt spin me some yarn about helping people or being a new centurion he just thought it might be interesting i liked that an honest answer and we never discussed it again in general he was a closemouthed kid all work eager to learn the ropes my policing style is to make lots of arrests so most of the time we were pursuing calls aggressively but no john wayne stuff i stay within bounds and so did nolan he looked away the fingers remained on the table but their tips had whitened sensitive topic so there were no egregious problems on the job none any alcohol or drug abuse he was healthoriented worked out afterhours at the station gym jogged before shift but a loner i said he looked up at the sky he seemed content any women in his life wouldnt surprise me he was a goodlooking kid but no one he mentioned nope that wasnt nolans style look doctor you need to understand that the police worlds a subculture that doesnt tolerate weakness you need real symptoms to justify seeking help my job was to teach him to be a cop he learned fine and functioned fine the waiter brought our lunch and the wine baker went through the tasting ritual said pour and our glasses were filled when we were alone again he said i dont know that we should toast to anything so how about a generic cheers we both drank and he waited for me to begin eating before approaching the calamari sawing each squid in half and studying the forked morsel before popping it into his mouth wiping his lips with the napkin every third or fourth bite he sipped his wine very slowly someone sent him to therapy i said or maybe he sent himself when was he in therapy i dont know the therapist is reluctant to discuss details one of the department psychologists a private one dr roone lehmann dont know him he looked away again ostensibly at some gulls diving the harbor but hed stopped chewing and his big eyes were narrow therapy i never knew that his jaws began working again any idea why he transferred from west la to hollywood he put his fork down by the time he transferred id moved to headquarters an administrative carrot theyd been dangling in front of me for a while revising the training curriculum i have no great love for paperwork but you cant keep saying no to the brass so you didnt know about his transfer thats right after the training period you and nolan lost contact he looked at me it wasnt a matter of losing contact breaking off some major fatherson relationship the training periods timelimited nolan learned what he needed to learn and went out into the big bad world i found out about the suicide the day after it happened police grapevine my first reaction was to want to wallop the crap out of the kid how could someone that smart be so stupid he speared a calamari the sister what does she do shes a nurse did nolan ever talk about her never mentioned her the only thing he said about his family was that both his parents were dead he pushed his plate away half the calamari were gone what do you think about the way he did it i said so publically pretty bizarre he said what do you think could he have been making a statement such as i shrugged had nolan shown any exhibitionistic tendencies showing off not in the course of duty oh he was into his body getting buffed tailoring the uniform but lots of young cops are that way i still dont know what you mean by a statement you mentioned before that cops always tried to minimize the shame of suicide but nolan did just the opposite made a spectacle of himself almost a public selfexecution he said nothing for a long time lifted his wineglass drained it refilled and sipped youre suggesting he punished himself for something just theorizing i said but youre not aware of anything he might have felt guilty about not something on the job did his sister tell you anything along those lines i shook my head nope he said that just doesnt make sense the waiter approached im finished said baker i seconded the motion declined dessert and handed over my credit card baker took out a big cigar and wet the tip mind no against restaurant rules he said but they know me here and i sit where the wind carries it away he inspected the tight brown cylinder handrolled biting off the tip he placed it in his napkin and folded the linen over the scrap taking out a gold lighter he ignited the cigar and puffed bitter but not unpleasant smoke filled the space between us before dissolving baker eyed the boats in the marina and sat back catching sun puff puff i thought of how hed likely stuffed milos locker full of porn supreme waste he said it still bothers me but sitting there smoking and drinking wine cleanly shaved face buttered by sun he looked the picture of happiness i left him on the terrace with his cigar and the rest of the wine just before i stepped onto the pathway that led back to the hotel parking lot i stopped and watched him smile as he said something to the maitre d man at leisure no clue hed been talking about the death of a colleague would it have bothered me had milo not warned me about him for all his open manner hed told me less than dr lehmann nolan had been an isolated smarterthanusual cop who played it by the book none of the serious problems lehmann had alluded to on the other hand baker had been nolans training officer not his therapist still it was my second facetoface meeting for no apparent reason people scurrying to protect themselves in the event of a lawsuit over what helena still hadnt called maybe shed decided that only nolan would understand what nolan had done if she dropped out of therapy it was out of my hands and on some level that didnt bother me because lehmann was right real answers were often unobtainable once home i tormented myself with a fasterthanusual run up the glen showered and changed and set out for beverlywood at fourfifteen reaching the carmeli home with ten minutes to spare for the five oclock meeting the house was a neatly kept singlestory ranch on a block full of them a negligible lawn sloped up to a used brick driveway parked on top were a blue plymouth minivan and a black accord both with consulate plates the curbs were empty save for two volvo station wagons and a suburban parked down the block and an electricalcompany van across the street other driveways hosted more vans and wagons lots of infant seats utility and fertility tucked east of the hillcrest country club and south of pico beverlywood had been developed in the fifties as a starter community for the families of junior executives on their way to senior partnerships and manses in brentwood and hancock park and beverly hills and some people still called it baja beverly hills la had essentially abandoned street maintenance but beverlywood looked manicured because of a homeowners society that set standards and kept the trees trimmed a private security company patrolled nightly the land boom of the seventies had raised housing prices to the halfmillion mark and the downslide had kept them at a level where striving families found themselves at the top of their dream nesting here permanently milo pulled behind me two minutes later he had on a bottlegreen blazer tan slacks white shirt and yellowandolive tartan tie green giant but not jolly finally managed to locate six more creeps from the initial mo files all moved to riverside and san berdoo none check out timewise and their pos andor therapists vouch for them nothing on dvll either so im ready to chuck that one into the garbage file at the house zev carmeli answered milos knock wearing a dark suit and a grim expression come in please there was no entry hall and we stepped right into a low narrow offwhite living room the deep green carpeting was amazingly similar in hue to milos jacket and for a second he looked like a fixture the tan couches and glass tables could have been rented the beige drapes drawn over the windows were filmy but most of the light came from two ceramic table lamps sitting on the largest couch was a beautiful brownskinned woman in her thirties with very long curly black hair and moist deepset black eyes her lips were full but parched her cheekbones molded so severely they seemed artificial she wore a shapeless brown dress that covered her knees flat brown shoes no jewelry her eyes were nowhere carmeli moved to her side and hovered and i fought not to stare not because of her beauty id seen irits death photos and here was the woman she might have become this is detective sturgis and dr delaware my wife liora liora carmeli began to stand but her husband touched her shoulder and she remained seated hello she said very softly struggling to smile but not getting close we both shook her hand her fingers were limp and her skin was clammy i knew shed resumed teaching school and couldnt be this depressed with her students so our visit had raked things up okay said carmeli sitting next to her and waving at some chairs on the other side of a glass coffee table we sat and milo went through one of those little detective speeches full of sympathy and empathy and possibility that he hates to deliver but delivers so well carmeli looked angry but his wife seemed to relate a bit shoulders straightening eyes focusing id seen that before some people usually women respond to him immediately he gets no satisfaction from it always worried that hell fail to produce but he keeps delivering the speech knowing no other way carmeli said fine fine we understand all that lets get on with it his wife looked at him and said something in what i assumed was hebrew carmeli frowned and tugged down at his tie they were both goodlooking people who seemed drained of their lifejuices milo said maam if theres anything you can we know nothing said carmeli touching his wifes elbow my husband is right theres nothing more we can tell you only her mouth moved when she spoke the brown dress tented and i could see no body contours beneath it im sure youre right maam said milo the reason i have to ask is sometimes things occur to people things they think are unimportant so they never bring them up im not saying thats actually the case here oh for gods sake said carmeli dont you think if we knew something wed tell you im sure you would sir i understand what you mean said liora carmeli since my iriti is gone i think all the time thoughts attack me at night especially i think all the time i am always thinking liora maspeek carmeli broke in i think she repeated as if amazed stupid things crazy things monsters demons nazis madmen sometimes im dreaming sometimes im awake she closed her eyes sometimes its hard to tell the difference carmelis face was white with rage his wife said the strange thing is iriti is never in the dreams only the monsters i feel that she is there but i cant see her and when i try to bring her face into the picture it flies away from me she looked at me i nodded iriti was my treasure carmeli whispered urgently to her in hebrew again she didnt seem to hear this is ridiculous he said to milo i request you to leave at once liora touched his arm the monster dreams are so childish black things with wings when iriti was little she was afraid of black winged monsters devils shedim we call them in hebrew baal zvuvthat means lord of the flies in hebrew like that book about the schoolboys it was a philistine god that controlled insects and disease beelzebub in english when iriti was little she had nightmares about insects and scorpions she would wake up in the middle of the night and want to come to our bed to help her i told her stories about shedim the bible how we the philistines were conquered and their stupid gods my culture my family is from casablanca we have wonderful stories and i told them all to her stories with children conquering monsters she smiled and she stopped being afraid her husbands hands were blanched fists she said i thought i was successful because iriti stopped coming to our bed she looked at her husband he stared at his trousers when irit got older said milo was she afraid of anything nothing nothing at all i thought id done a good job with my stories she let out a short barking laugh so savage it tightened my spine her husband sat there then shot to his feet and came back with a box of tissues her eyes were dry but he wiped them liora smiled at him and held his hand my brave little girl she knew she was different liked being pretty once when we lived in copenhagen a man grabbed her and tried to kiss her she was nine we were shopping for jeans and i was walking in front of her instead of with her because copenhagen was a safe city there was a museum there on the stroget the main shopping street the museum of erotica we never went in but it was always busy the danes are healthy about those things but perhaps the museum attracted sick people because the man enough said carmeli grabbed iriti and tried to kiss her an old man pathetic she didnt hear him she had her hearing aid off as usual probably singing songs songs said milo she sang to herself not real songs her own songs i could always tell because her head would move up and down she stopped doing that a long time ago said carmeli when this man grabbed her said milo how did she react she punched him and broke free and then she laughed at him because he looked so frightened he was a little old man i didnt even realize anything was wrong until i heard yelling in danish and turned around and saw two young men holding the old man and iriti standing there laughing theyd seen the whole thing said the old man was crazy but harmless irit kept laughing and laughing it was the old man who looked miserable that was denmark said carmeli this is america lioras smile vanished and she lowered her head chastened so you feel said milo that irit wasnt afraid of strangers she wasnt afraid of anything said liora so if a stranger i dont know she said suddenly crying i dont know anything liora said carmeli taking hold of her wrist i dont know she repeated maybe i dont know she broke free of her husbands grasp and faced the wall staring at the bare plaster maybe i should have told her other stories where the demons won so you needed to be careful maam oh please said carmeli disgusted this is idiotic i insist you leave he stomped to the door milo and i got up one more thing mrs carmeli he said irits clothes were they sent back to israel her clothes said carmeli no said liora we sent only she when we our customs we use a white robe her clothes are here she faced her husband i asked you to call the police and when you didnt i had your secretary call they arrived a month ago and i kept them carmeli stared at her bugeyed she said in the plymouth zev so i can have them with me when i drive milo said if you dont mind crazy said carmeli i am said liora smiling again no no no lili these questions more hebrew she listened to him calmly then turned to us why do you want the clothes id like to do some analyses said milo theyve already been analyzed said carmeli we waited months to get them back i know sir but when i take on a case i like to make sure make sure what that everything has been done i see said carmeli youre a careful man i try and your predecessors im sure they tried too loyal too said carmeli a good soldier after all this time the clothes being in my wifes car what use are analyses i never touched them said liora i never opened the bag i wanted to but carmeli looked ready to sting said only ah liora said ill get them for you may i have them back of course maam she got up and went outside unlocking the minivans rear hatch she lifted up a section and revealed the sparetire compartment next to the wheel was a plastic bag still bearing an lapd evidence tag inside was something blue rolled jeans and a white patch a single sock my husband already thinks ive gone crazy because ive started talking to myself like iritis singing carmeli stiffened then his eyes went soft liora he put his arm around her she patted his hand and moved away from him take it she said pointing to the bag as milo reached for it carmeli returned to the house watching him liora said maybe i am sick maybe i am primitive what will you be analyzing the first police told us there was nothing on it ill probably repeat whats been done said milo he held the bag in both hands as if it were something precious well she said goodbye nice to meet you thank you maam im sorry we upset your husband my husband is very tender you will return it absolutely maam can you say when as soon as possible thank you she said as soon as possible i would like to have it with me again when i drive she trudged back into her house and closed the door milo and i returned to our cars i love my job he said those light and airy moments the evidence bag was nestled against his barrel chest poor woman i said both of them looks like things arent great between them tragedy will do that any other insights about what i said her them hes protecting her and she doesnt want to be protected pretty standard malefemale pattern why i dont know the way she talked about being crazy primitive shes something about her made me wonder if she has a psychiatric history i stared at him like i said light and airy alex stalking her own child in the park and strangling her strangling gently could be a boyfriend ive seen that plenty of times guy develops a relationship sees the kids as impediments but no shes not a suspect i just think ugly by reflex his arm dropped and the bag dangled ive seen too many kids killed by mama cant be effective if i avoid the shadows true i said my guess is that she might have been wound up pretty tight a diplomats wife and has unraveled she probably used to put on a happy face suppress things now she says to hell with it he looked down at the bag what do you think about her keeping this in her car all this time a shrine there are all sorts of them she knew her husband would be offended so she created a private one but shes willing to risk his disapproval in order to cooperate offended he said she talked about her culture as opposed to his moroccan as opposed to wherever he comes from probably he looks european when i was in private practice i had a few israeli patients and the east versus west thing came up when israel was created it became a melting pot for jews and sometimes there was conflict i remember one family with just the opposite situation the husband was from iraq and the wife was polish or austrian he thought she was cold she thought he was superstitious maybe mrs carmeli didnt want mr to think she was engaging in primitive rituals maybe she just knew hed be grossed out by the clothes whatever the reason she had no hesitation telling you she had the bag one thing for sure im talking to the neighbors carmeli will freak but so be it worse comes to worst he gripes and they pull me off the case and someone else gets to feel useless i looked up the block the electricians van was the only vehicle at the curb are you really planning to run new lab tests maybe first things first i met him at the west la station upstairs in the detective room relatively quiet now with one other d a young black woman filling out forms she didnt seem to notice as milo sat at his metal desk cleared papers and placed the bag next to a stack of messages weighed down by a stapler he scanned the slips put them down then he put on surgical gloves and unsealed the bag removing the jeans first he turned each pocket inside out the denim gave off smells of earth mold and chemistry lab empty turning the pants over he pointed out some very faint brown stains that id have missed dirt from when she lay on the ground refolding the pants neatly he took out the white sock and its mate then a pair of white cotton underpants printed with small pink flowers the crotch cut away cleanly semen analysis he said next came tennis shoes he peeled the insoles free and peered inside saying the ortiz boys shoes were obviously bloody but lets check these out anyway size six and a half made in macao nada no blood surprise surprise a white cotton training bra caused him to pause for a second before removing the last garment the lacetrimmed white tshirt id seen in the photos the front was clean but the back bore brown stains too two breast pockets he put a thumb and forefinger inside the first looked inside moved on to the second and pulled out a small rectangle of paper the size of a fortunecookie slip aha dr sherlock a clueinspected by number then he turned the scrap over and his mouth dropped open typed neatly in the center were four letters dvll that night at ten we entered the rear partyroom of a bar and grill on santa monica boulevard four blocks west of the west la station the plainfaced redhaired hostess looked happy to see us and a bill slipped into her hand improved her disposition even further the room was big enough for a wedding party with asparagusgreen wallpaper and brown banquettes that were either real leather or fake dainty impressionist prints hung on the walls street scenes of paris the loire valley other places cops were unlikely to go but the only people in the room were three cops at the largest booth up against the back wall southwest division detectives willis hooks and roy mclaren drank iced tea and a chunky whitehaired man of nearly sixty wearing a houndstooth sportcoat and a black polo shirt nursed a beer as milo and i slid into the booth he introduced the older man as detective manuel alvarado newton division pleased to meet you doctor his voice was mild his skin was dark as a fieldworkers rough as bark thanks for coming on your night off manny a whodunit wouldnt miss it things are slow in saugus you live all the way out there said hooks fifteen years what do you do for fun out there grow stuff like plants vegetables the hostess reappeared is this the entire party this is it said milo food gentlemen bring the mixed appetizer thing when she was gone mclaren said gentlemen she obviously doesnt know us obligatory smiles all around hooks said your call was the biggest surprise ive had since my exwife told me i wasnt handsome anymore it surprised me too willis said milo alvarado took a pack of gum out of his jacket pocket and offered it around no one accepted and he unwrapped a stick and chewed dvll a common thread no ones ever heard of before we checked with every gangcop and banger and social worker and youth leader in our division said mclaren same at west la said milo fbi has nothing in vicap or any other files i went back through my copy of the ortiz file said alvarado your copy the original was missing just came back today some sort of storage screwup fortunately i always xerox no dvll message in the bathroom where my victim was probably taken and i copied down every bit of graffiti at the time im still trying to locate the boys shoes but from what i remember there was no writing in them at all just blood so i cant say mine belongs with yours and yours was a boy said hooks and we never recovered the body which is a big difference from both of yours not that pattern seems to mean a damn thing here said hooks west la diplomats kid and a midcity strawberry he shook his shaved head this is nutty twilight zone stuff right up your alley huh doc what do you think does dvll stand for some devil thing could be i said despite the differences latvinia and irit do have things in common mildly retarded nonanglo teenage girls the fact that the killer chose handicapped victims says he despises weakness in others and maybe himself a handicapped killer or someone preoccupied with strength and weakness domination it could mean powerlessness in his life a wimp who kills said mclaren his hands were huge and they closed around a spoon handle raymond ortiz was retarded too said alvarado but being a boy usually when they go for boys they dont go for girls usually said hooks when they go for innercity street kids they dont go for rich kids on the west side usually when they string one body up they dont leave the other one stretched out on the ground so if there is a pattern its eluding me he looked at me maybe the pattern here is deliberate avoidance of pattern i said to outsmart you guys serial killers often read up on police procedure collect truecrime magazines for stimulation this one could have used it for reference material learning the rules in order to break them varying his mo moving from district to district other surface variables what do you mean by surface said alvarado the core of the crimes will be consistent i said the trademark because sex killers are psychologically rigid crave structure in this case its retarded teens and leaving behind the dvll message that could be a private message for him or a taunt or both so far hes not advertising he left it so subtly he cant have expected anyone to find it one advantage for the good guys he doesnt know anyones made a connection that paper in your victims pocket milo said mclaren inspected by number was that preprinted or did he type that too that part looks preprinted said milo but with computers and desktop printers you cant tell i sent it over to the lab maybe they can clarify either way he brought it with him because the dvll part was in a different font the lab says probably a computer and i dont see anyone with killing on his mind bringing along a pc hey you never know said hooks they make those laptop suckers pretty small nowadays and the doctor here thinks maybe he took her picture so if he had a camera why not a laptop maybe he brought along a carful of stuff a vanful said alvarado those guys love vans yeah said hooks i always look for vans said alvarado on raymonds case i spent weeks checking out every van in the neighborhood parking tickets everything never found the killer but i did find quite a few set up as mobile bedrooms and one turkey who actually had handcuffs and burglary tools you bet said mclaren vans and longdistance truckers the wellequipped killer theres probably a mailorder catalog out there somewhere so said milo dvlls important to him but hes not ready to advertise i said either hes still a beginner and building up his confidence or hell never advertise too cowardly the fact that he chose especially vulnerable victims points to cowardice a knock sounded on the door and milo said come in sally the hostess wheeled in a twotiered cart full of platters fried wontons fried chicken fried shrimp fried egg rolls pigs in blankets shish kebobs on wooden skewers each piece of meat capped with fat miniature wedges of pepperoni pizza bowls of dip in various colors nachos pretzels potato chips mixed appetizers gentlemen sure why not said hooks i walked fifteen feet today from the lunch truck to my car musta burned up two calories sally served us and refilled the drinks thanks said milo were fine now no more interruptions she promised you want something stick your head out and holler the men helped themselves to food and it didnt take long for half the serving plates to empty i love this said hooks lifting a chicken wing feeling my arteries clog up as we speak your case milo said to alvarado you said the shoes are still missing the log says theyre in the evidence room but theyre not in the bin in the evidence room where theyre supposed to be which is no heartstopper milo its a yearold case weve always got storage problems stuff gets moved itll turn up ill let you know milo nodded anything else latvinia said mclaren we found lots of street creeps who knew her even a couple who admitted doing her but no one she hung with habitually the grandmother says she went out alone at night a lot the closest weve got to a hangout is that freeway onramp she got busted at she went there from time to time so anyone could have picked her up a west side commuter who did her in his car or van then brought her back to the school so we wouldnt figure out he was a west side guy when the ramps are busy he said or when the freeways metered you get panhandlers people selling flowers bags of oranges traffic balls up latvinias out there flashing skin some joker picks her up maybe someone noticed that someone stalled in the gridlock i was gonna see if some tv station would flash her pic though we couldnt get much exposure shes just a southwest hooker got in trouble then you told me about the gag order what gag order said alvarado my victims family said milo the israeli consulate they insist it stays out of the media for security reasons and theyve got major pull with the brass i checked again today with my loo and he says its come down from the mayors office dont mess with it so were all gagged said hooks alvarado said so does that apply to mine too im still not convinced its connected why said milo were you thinking of going to the spanish papers again no i just want to know the rules what exactly are the security concerns milo summed them up now with the tiein to latvinia it doesnt sound like a terrorist i explained that to my loo but he covered his ears course its not a terrorist said mclaren this is a freak retarded kids said hooks shaking his head so whats the plan said alvarado keep looking for leads keep in touch said milo alvarado nodded the shoes ill find them maybe well get lucky and hell make a mistake said hooks mclaren said our best friend good old human error assuming said milo that hes human the other detectives left and sally brought milo the bill typical cop tip she looked ready to kiss him he pocketed the credit slip but stayed seated and she left what do you think eight hands are better than two i said he frowned what i keep flashing to what you first said about raymond ortiz the impulsiveness of a first murder if thats true were right at the beginning of the killing curve dvll what the hell does it mean ill go to the u tomorrow and play with the computers sure thanks there was iced tea left in his glass and he drained it i asked where the mens room was he pointed across the room to a door in the righthand corner i pushed it open and on the other side was a pay phone the rear door marked emergency only the lav was small whitetiled spotless sweet with disinfectant drafty too an oftpainted casement window had been left partially open and i heard engine noise from outside then i noticed dry paint flakes on the sill recently opened window an alley ran behind the restaurant and a car was pulling into it a van headlights off but as it backed away it passed under the backdoor lamp gray or light blue ford econoline electricians logo id seen it or one just like it this afternoon parked across the street from the carmeli house the alley was narrow and the van had to manipulate a threepoint turn exposing a side panel i tried to force the window wider but it wouldnt budge straining i made out the name of the company hermes electric speedy service wingedmessenger logo an number i couldnt catch a van these guys love vans the econoline straightened and the tires rotated dark windows no view of the driver as it sped away i tried for the license plate managed to get all seven digits kept reciting them out loud as i fumbled for a pen and a paper towel from the dispenser milo got up so hard the table shook stalking us the carmelis hes that arrogant he hurried back to the bathroom area and shoved the emergency door open outside the air was warm and the alley smelled of rotted vegetables i could hear sirens probably from the station i handed him the paper towel hermes electric he said an electrician would wear a uniform one of those anonymous beige or gray things that could resemble a park workers electricians also carry lots of equipment so whod notice an extra camera in the back of the van and i remember something robin told me when we were rebuilding the house of all the tradesmen electricians tend to be the most precise perfectionistic makes sense he said slip up and get fried was the van at the carmelis the whole time yes we walked through the restaurant moving quickly past diners the unmarked was parked in front in a loading zone hermes i said the god of speed so weve got a fast little motherfucker on our hands he used the mobile digital terminal to connect to dmv then typed in the plate number the answer came back within minutes seventyeight chevy nova registered to p l almoni on fairfax so the asshole switched plates this is looking better and better im heading right over to the address looks like between pico and olympic the number on the side of the van was an so he lives in the city works in the valley has a personal car and a work van and switches plates around when he wants to play almoni that could be israeli too right i nodded juicier and juicier okay lets see what the state crime files and ncic have to say about him checking those data banks produced no hits he started driving clean record said milo a goddamn beginner like you said lets see how this asshole lives unless you want to go home my heart was pounding and my mouth was dry not a chance the east side of fairfax a dark relatively untraveled section of the avenue was filled with one shabby storefront after another every store closed except for an ethiopian restaurant with no drapes over the window inside three people sat concentrating on heaping plates the sign atop p l almonis address read notary public photocopy services mailboxes for rent we got out and looked through the window three walls of lockboxes a service counter in back goddamn mail drop said milo onward to his business we got back in the car where he phoned valley information waited said youre sure and wrote something down hanging up he gave a sour smile its a valley exchange all right but the address is in territory holloway drive in west hollywood welcome to the maze fellow rats holloway was a tenminute drive from the mail drop nice and convenient for the convoluted mr almoni west to la cienega then north just past santa monica boulevard and a left turn onto a quiet street filled with apartment buildings welldesigned buildings many of them prewar some concealed behind tall hedges i guessed almonis would be one of them only a short walk to sunset strip but insulated from the din and the lights i noticed a woman walking a huge dog its gait and hers long and confident tucked among the apartments was an old mediterranean mansion turned into a private school so dark it was hard to read addresses as milo searched for the right number i composed news copy in my head not much is known about almoni he was a quiet man residents in this comfortable neighborhood said suddenly he pulled to the curb bad guess hermes electrics home base was a newer welllit threestory structure with an unshielded brick face and glass doors leading into a bright mirrored lobby a short walk also to milo and ricks west hollywood house he was thinking the same thing clenched his jaw and said evening neighbor out of the car he studied a collection of parking signs on a lamppost bottom line permit parking only placing an lapd sticker on the dash he said not that itll help west hollywoods county territory the meterleeches they contract with could give a shit we walked up to the glass doors ten mailbox slots each with a call button number said i budzhyshyn hermes language school inc multitalented milo said squinting at his timex almost midnight no jurisdiction no warrant wonder if theres an inhouse manager here we go number hope hes not a morning person he fingerstabbed unit s button no answer for several moments then a thick male voice said yes police sir sorry to bother you but could you come down to the lobby please what milo repeated the greeting the thick voice said how do i know youre the police if you come down to the lobby ill be happy to show you identification sir if this is some kind of joke its not sir whats this all about one of your tenants trouble please come down sir hold on five minutes later a man in his late twenties came into the lobby rubbing his eyes young but bald with a light brown mustache and clipped goatee he had on a baggy gray tshirt blue shorts and house slippers his legs were pale coated with blond hair blinking and rubbing his eyes again he stared out at us through the glass milo held out his badge and the goateed man studied it frowned mouthed show me something else great muttered milo a picky one smiling he produced his lapd business card if the goateed man realized the department had no jurisdiction in west hollywood he didnt show it nodding sleepily he unlocked the door and let us in i dont understand why you couldnt come at a decent hour sorry sir but this just came up what did whos in trouble no real trouble yet sir but we have some questions to ask you about mr budzhyshyn mister budzhyshyn yes the young man smiled no such animal here unit is the home of ms budzhyshyn irina and she lives

laurel looked uncomfortable strictly speaking we dont allow tenants to conduct business out of their units but hers isnt any big deal she maybe sees a couple of guys a week and shes very quiet very nice which is why im sure you have the wrong information guys all her students are men laurel touched his beard i guess they have been oh no he laughed his teeth were stained brown from nicotine no

tiny flag here you go i was wrong its an escrow company metropolitan title on wilshire like i said on her application she put data manager im not comfortable giving information to you without her

visit at this hour well be sure to keep things quiet laurel blinked no excitement or anything no sir just talking a tiny mirrored elevator took us creakily up to the third floor and we stepped into a yellow hallway two units per floor number was on the left milo knocked nothing happened for several moments and he was about to knock again when the peephole brightened he showed his badge police ms budzhyshyn yes police yes wed like to talk to you maam to me husky voice thick accent yes maam could you please open the door police yes maam its very late im sorry maam but this is important yes maam you wish to talk to me about hermes electric maam the peephole shut the door opened she was forty or so five three and stout and barefoot wearing a white armani x sweatshirt over black sweatpants her brown hair was chopped short and her face was pleasant maybe pretty ten years ago with a small but bulbous nose shadowing full lips beautiful complexion rosy cheeks over ivory gray eyes searching and alert under precisely plucked brows shed opened the door just enough to accommodate her hips over her head was a darkened front room ms budzhyshyn said milo yes hermes electric onebeat pause i am hermes language school she said pronouncing it hoormeez she smiled is there problem well maam said milo were a little confused because your address also matches a company called hermes electric out in the valley really yes maam that is a mistake is it yes of course what about mr almoni she backed away from the door and narrowed the opening who almoni p l almoni he drives a van for hermes electric has a postoffice box not far from here irina budzhyshyn said nothing then she shrugged i dont know him really milo leaned forward and his foot slid closer to the door she shrugged again he said youre hermes and theyre hermes and their number is listed with your address no answer wheres almoni maam irina budzhyshyn stepped back farther as if to close the door and milo took hold of it if youre protecting him you could be in deep trouble i dont know this person no such guy its a fake name why does your boyfriend need one barking out the questions the stout womans lips blanched but she didnt answer what else is phony your language school the datamanager job at metropolitan title what do you really do for a living ms budzhyshyn whether or not you tell us well find out so save yourself some trouble right now irina budzhyshyn remained impassive milo forced the door wider and she sighed come in she said well talk some more she turned on a table lamp shaped and colored like a larva her living room was like thousands of others modest proportions low ceiling walltowall brown nylon forgettable furniture a folding card table and three folding chairs established a dining area behind a white formica counter was a pale oak kitchen please sit she said fluffing her short hair to no visible effect thats okay said milo gazing at a back doorway blocked by strings of wooden beads through it i saw an open bathroom door nightlight dimness underwear over a shower door how many other rooms back there one bedroom anyone there irina budzhyshyn shook her head i am alone would you like some tea no thanks milo took out his gun passed through the beads and turned left irina budzhyshyn stood there not moving not looking at me a minute later he returned okay tell us about hermes electric and mr p l almoni this time the name made her smile i need to make a phone call to who someone who can answer your questions wheres the phone in the kitchen anything else in there i should know about i have a gun she said calmly in the drawer next to the refrigerator but im not going to shoot you with a few quick strides he retrieved it chromeplated automatic loaded and ready im a woman living alone any other arms no and no p l almoni lurking in some attic she laughed whats funny theres no such person if you dont know him how can you be sure let me make the call and youll understand whore you going to call i cant tell you until after i make the call youre not a county sheriff so i dont even have to cooperate with you statement of fact no defiance but youre cooperating anyway yes its practical im going to call now you may watch me they went into the kitchen and he stayed right next to her towering over her as she punched numbers she said something in a foreign language listened said something else then handed the receiver to him as he pressed it to his ear his jaws bunched what when he was growling now i dont okay all right where he hung up irina budzhyshyn left the kitchen and sat on a couch looking content milo turned to me he was flushed and his shirt looked tight that was deputy consul carmeli were to meet him at his office in fifteen minutes sharp maybe this time well actually get past the goddamn hall wilshire was empty as we pulled up in front of the consulate building by the time we were out of the car someone was standing in front of the unlit lobby door he studied us then came forward into the streetlight young man in a sportcoat and slacks big shoulders big hands one of them carrying a walkietalkie his hair was dark and very short just like that of the guard behind the consulate reception window it could have even been the same man ill take you up he said in a flat voice striding ahead of us he unlocked the door and walked across the echoing lobby the three of us rode up to the seventeenth floor he looked bored the door opened on zev carmeli standing in the corridor he said bseder and the young man remained in the elevator and rode down carmeli was wearing a dark suit and white shirt no tie and he reeked of tobacco his hair had been watered and combed but several cowlicks sprouted this way he did an abrupt aboutface and led us to the white door of the same conference room this time we walked through and out the back into the cubicles of the work area office machines a water cooler corkboard full of memos the travel posters id seen through the reception window the fluorescent panels in the ceiling were off and light came from a single corner pole lamp nothing to distinguish the place from any other site of repetitivemotion injury carmeli kept going hunched arms swinging loosely til he reached a door with his name on it twisting the knob he stood aside and let us enter like irina budzhyshyns apartment his office was characterless with blue drapes over what i assumed were windows a wall of halfempty boardandbracket shelves a wooden desk with steel legs gray sofa and love seat a man sat on the love seat and when we came in he stood keeping his left hand in the pocket of his blue jeans late thirties to forty five seven around he wore a black nylon windbreaker pale blue shirt black athletic shoes his tightly kinked hair was black tipped with gray and trimmed to a short afro his face was lean very smooth caféaulait skin stretched tightly over finely molded features a strong nose was anchored by flared nostrils and his lips were wide full and bowed very light brown eyes golden really and shaded by long curved lashes arched eyebrows gave them the look of permanent surprise but the rest of his face contradicted that static unreadable probably middleeastern but he could have been latin or american indian or a lightskinned black man familiar for some reason had i seen him before he met my stare and volleyed it back no hostility just the opposite pleasant almost friendly then i realized his expression hadnt changed like a rorschach card his neutrality had led me to interpret milo was looking at him too but his attention shifted to carmeli as the consul passed behind the desk and sat down his big hands were clenched and i saw him open them forcing the appearance of relaxation during the ride over from holloway drive hed been silent driving much too fast he sat down on the sofa without being invited and i did the same the dark man with the golden eyes was still looking at us or past us still pleasantly blank suddenly i knew i had seen him and where driving away from latvinia shavers murder scene driving some kind of compact car a gray toyota just as the film crews arrived wearing a uniform like that of montez the custodian another image clicked in a darkskinned uniformed man had also been at the nature conservancy the day milo took me to view irits murder scene parkworkers uniform driving some sort of mowing machine leaf bags stacked on the grass a pith helmet had hidden his face following us no in both cases hed gotten there before anticipating us one step ahead because he had access to police information listening in somehow milod said carmelis attitude had seemed to change suddenly more cooperative because hed kept tabs knew milo was serious working hard i nodded at the dark man expecting no response but he nodded back milos big face was still full of curiosity and anger zev carmeli pulled out a cigarette and lit up not offering one to the dark man knowing the dark man didnt smoke knowing the dark mans habits the dark man remained still left hand in pocket carmeli puffed several times cleared his throat and sat up straight gentlemen this is superintendent daniel sharavi from the israeli national police southern district southern district said milo very softly what does that mean jerusalem and the surrounding areas said carmeli so on your map that includes southern california too sharavi leaned back in the love seat the windbreaker was unzipped and the flaps parted revealing a thin flat torso no shoulder holster no visible weapon and the bulge in his pocket was too small to be anything other than five fingers carmeli said several years ago superintendent sharavi headed a major investigation into a series of jerusalem sex killings called the butcher murders several years ago said milo must have missed that one serial murders are almost nonexistent in israel mr sturgis the butcher was the first in our history were a small country the impact was huge superintendent sharavi solved the killings thereve been none like them since congratulations said milo turning to sharavi must be nice to have spare time sharavi didnt move carmeli said superintendent sharavi is also familiar with los angeles because he was part of the security contingent that accompanied our athletes to the la olympics we would like you to work with him on the current murders murders said milo still facing sharavi plural not just your daughters sounds like youve kept abreast carmeli smoked and sanded his desk with the palm of his hand we are aware of developments ill bet you are said milo so wherere the bugs dashboard of my car my office phone heel of my shoe all of the above no reply probably in my house too i said the night the burglar alarm went off by listening in there theyd have access to lots of information but the superintendents been with us well before then i faced sharavi ive seen you twice at booker t washington elementary school the day latvinia shavers body was found and at the nature conservancy the day milo and i looked over the crime scene you were driving a mower both times you wore a uniform sharavis expression didnt change and he didnt answer milo said isnt that interesting striving for calm too the air felt ready to implode carmeli smoked hard and fast stopping only to look at the cigarette as if the act required concentration well said milo its sure good to meet a genuine expert a real backalley sleuth sharavi removed his hand from his pocket and placed it in his lap the upper surface was glossy with grayishbrown scar tissue and deeply caved as if a chunk of flesh and bone had been scooped out the thumb was atrophied and curled unnaturally and id overestimated the number of fingers the thumb was intact but all that remained of the index was a oneknuckle stump and the remaining three were wasted too not much more than bare bone with a pallid brown sheath he said i began looking into the case just before you came on detective sturgis his voice was youthful barely accented i hope we can put that aside and work together sure said milo one big happy family i trust you already crossing and uncrossing his long legs he shook his head so how many felonies have you racked up so far playing james bond superintendent sharavi is operating under full diplomatic immunity said carmeli hes protected from threats and prosecution ah said milo so its arranged mr sturgis arranged a working agreement to share and collaborate share said milo laughing christ show me yours i show you mine and if i say no carmeli didnt answer sharavi pretended to study his ruined hand let me guess said milo you put a call in to the mayors office and im off the case replaced with some lackey willing to share carmeli took a deep drag my daughter was murdered i was hoping for a more mature attitude on your part milo stood let me save you the trouble get yourself a mature guy and ill go back to dealing with ordinary homicides with ordinary obstructions no big loss to you since youve been following closely you know we havent made much progress bye shalom he started out and i followed carmeli said id prefer that you remain on the case detective sturgis milo stopped im sorry sir it just wont work out we left the office and were back at the door into the conference room when carmeli caught up with us milo turned the knob it wouldnt budge theres a master lock for the entire suite said carmeli kidnapping too i thought you guys rescued hostages im serious detective sturgis i want you on my daughters case you were assigned to it in the first place because i asked for you personally milos hand dropped from the knob i asked for you carmeli repeated because things had bogged down gorobich and ramos were nice men they seemed competent enough for routine cases but i knew this wasnt routine and it soon became clear that they didnt measure up nevertheless i gave them time because contrary to what you believe it was never my intention to obstruct all i want is to find the garbage who murdered my daughter do you understand that do you hed moved closer to milo closing the space between them the way exactly what id seen milo do with suspects thats all i care about mr sturgis results do you understand nothing else gorobich and ramos produced none so they what makes you think were removed and you were brought in i conducted some research the performance of robberyhomicide detectives at the west la station i wanted to know which detectives avoided the quick and easy and had a record of tackling atypical cases of those which detective had the highest solve rate for the past ten years things the department doesnt want made public the data was hard to obtain but i managed and guess what mr sturgis your name kept coming up your solve rate is eighteen percent higher than your nearest competitors though your popularity rating is considerably lower than his which is also fine im not running a social club in fact ive never seen statistics like that im sure you havent carmeli pulled out another cigarette and waved it like a conductors baton officially they dont exist so congratulations youre the winner not that it will help your career advancement you were also described as someone lacking in polish and good manners someone who doesnt give a damn about what people think of him someone who can be a bully puff puff there are also people in the department who believe you harbor violent tendencies i know about the incident in which you broke a superiors jaw my reading of that was that you were morally justified but that nonetheless it was a stupid impulsive act it bothered me but the fact that you havent done anything like that in over four years encourages me he came even closer looking milo straight in the eye the fact that you are gay encourages me as well because its clear that no matter how liberal a line the police department takes in public no matter how high the caliber of your work remains youll always be an outcast another long drag this is as high as youll go mr sturgis which for my needs is perfect someone aiming for the top someone cautious a careeristis exactly what i dont want some ambitionblinded monkey scampering up the administrative ladder looking over his shoulder every other second keeping his buttocks shielded he blinked my daughter was taken from me bureaucracy is the last thing i need do you understand do you if youre after results why make it so difficult for me to get info no no no said carmeli smoking and blinking through the haze in terms of reading my motivations youre not as astute as you think you are i havent hidden anything important from you id strip naked and parade down wilshire boulevard if it would bring the garbage who murdered my iriti to justice do you understand that i life has its ups and downs no one knows that better than israelis but losing a young child is an unnatural occurrence and losing one violently is an abomination one can never be prepared for it and one finds oneself unable to help those who he shook his head violently i dont want a team player milo using the first name as if used to it on the contrary come to me and inform me that youve found him that youve shot him or cut his throat and ill be a far happier man milo not happy not jocular or sunny or optimistic ive never been that sort even as a child i had a pessimistic worldview thats why i smoke sixty cigarettes a day thats why i work for a government but happier partial healing of the wound staunching the pus he touched milos lapel and milo allowed it you saw my wife being married to me holding things in has always been difficult for her now she finds herself unwilling to live a shadow life to put up with even the most trivial impositions she works and comes home and wont leave wont accompany me to functions even though i know she cant be blamed i get angry we fight my work helps me escape but hers forces her to look at other peoples children day after day ive told her to quit but she wont wont stop punishing herself he rocked on his heels it took thirtythree hours to give birth to irit there were complications she always felt guilty because of irits disabilities even though a fever caused them months later now her feelings are when i go home i dont know what to expect do you think i want a team player milo he let go of the lapel milos face was white as moonlight the skin around his mouth so tight the acne pits had compressed to hash marks the stress said carmeli has already taken its toll some things cant be fixed but my i want to know i want resolution so you want to use me as an executioner no god forbid stop reading between lines that bear no interpretation what i want is simple knowledge justice and now youll admit its not just for me and my family is it that girl on the schoolyard possibly the poor little boy in east la why should this monster kill more children final justice said milo i find him your boys finish him off carmeli stepped back stubbed out the cigarette and fumbled in his jacket for yet another one ill grant you your moment of outrage no one likes being watched least of all a detective but put your ego aside and stop being obstinate he lit up we bent some rules to obtain information fine now weve confessed im a diplomat not a terrorist ive seen what terrorists do and i respect the rule of law catch this piece of garbage and bring him to the bar of justice and if i cant then your solve rate drops and i seek other solutions as milo regarded him carmeli took in lungfuls of smoke and tapped his foot his eyes had turned wild and as if realizing it he closed them when they opened they were dead and the look on his face chilled me if you refuse me milo i will not make vengeful phone calls to the mayor or anyone else because vengeance is personal and you hold no interest for me personally only as a means to an end you might do well to adopt the same attitude think of me as a bureaucratic idiot curse me every morning for listening in on your conversations ill live with your curses but does your opinion of me mean irits murder doesnt deserve your best efforts thats the point mr carmeli youve been hampering my best efforts no i reject that i reject that absolutely and if you analyze the situation honestly you will too if the ortiz boys shoes were left with the police to get attention would giving the garbage more attention solve the problem be honest looking for an ashtray he found one in a nearby cubicle picked it up flicked i thought of the kitchen conversation hed heard my theories milos procedures now he was facetoface with milo again inches away holding his cigarette next to his trouser leg milo said listen im not gonna stand here and make a big deal out of this because youve been through it youve got serious rights here but im also not gonna let you control the investigation because of your outrage or who you happen to be youre out of your element you dont know what the hell youre doing granted the point is mr carmeli my job is a lot more perspiration than inspiration and if i do solve a few more cases than someone else its probably because i try not to get distracted and youve been distracting me right from the beginning youve been trying to call the shots and now all this espionage shit i just spent hours of investigative time chasing down your boy in there instead of looking for irits killer now you order me to adopt him and just not an order a request and one that could help you hes a very able detective im sure he is said milo but one case in a country where violent crime is rare has nothing to do with what were dealing with and now ive got to take time off from the investigation to figure out where he stuck his goddamn bugs not necessary said a quiet boyish voice i hadnt heard sharavi come out of the office but he was there hand in pocket again ill tell you exactly where they are great said milo wheeling on him very comforting he gave a disgusted look carmeli said we meant no harm milo the intention was always to be open eventually how eventually the surveillance was nothing personal and if you must blame someone blame me superintendent sharavi happened to be in the states on other business and i had him brought to la because gorobich and ramos were getting nowhere they talked to me those two but they never told me anything im sure you know what i mean milo didnt answer carmeli said i needed a starting point some basic information in my position can you honestly say you would have done any differently the idea all along was that if superintendent sharavi came up with something youd be the first to eventually what if dr delaware hadnt noticed that van in the alley would we have ever been told anything he faced sharavi screwed up didnt you james bond sharavi said yes with an utter lack of defensiveness milo shook his head licenseplate switches mail drop and a phony language teacher to hide your trail whats irina a fullfledged secret agent or just some freelance and who the hell is p l almoni carmeli smiled and hid it behind his smoking hand my mistake said sharavi i didnt appreciate dr delawares powers of observation underestimating dr delaware is no way to win at blackjack said milo hes a detail guy attuned to all the nuances obviously said sharavi he was the one who urged pursuing the dvll angle our first real break said carmeli waving his cigarette finally weve plugged it into all our databases here back in israel asia europe we have resources you dont if we pool this is no time to let egos get in learn anything from your databases milo asked him not yet but the point is the wider the net sometimes the wider the net the bigger the tangles mr carmeli he turned to sharavi so tell me superintendent is this conversation being taped too sharavis eyebrows arched higher he glanced at carmeli carmeli said no weve disconnected the recorders in the suite however you were recorded the first time we met milo allowed himself a tiny smile gut instincts confirmed from now on carmeli continued you have my word that no further surveillance will be conducted without your assuming there is a from now on said milo are you that egotistical said carmeli he turned to me when i address milo im including you doctor in light of the dvll angle and two other related murders were clearly faced with a psychopathologic killer so psychological input is called for im not trying to get between you and milo but whatever he decides the israeli consulate is willing to reimburse you for your time at a very generous rate the consulate is also willing to extend itself to you considerably because we know the deck is stacked against success and anything we can do to anything said milo youre saying the investigation gets the full clout of your office one hundred percent it always has full clout is yours to grant being only a social director license to cater carmeli was thrown off whatever is in my power ill carmelis eyes shifted over to sharavi the dark man said nothing im an arranger carmeli said i arrange all sorts of things milo and carmeli remained eye to eye each holding on to the stare as if it were precious carmeli moved away first ive said what i have to say he walked quickly back to his office and closed the door milo said how do we get out of here to sharavi sharavi reached behind the water cooler and something clicked as milo started for the door sharavi said in line with my promise to tell you everything heres something important someone wrote dvll in ballpoint pen in raymond ortizs right shoe small letters but discernible under the blood milos hands clenched again and a dragon grin stretched his mouth unnaturally you have them no theyre in the newton division evidence room some of the blood has flaked away over time and it appears to have been applied thinly probably with a brush there seem to be strokes but once you know what to look for the letters are clear a brush said milo painting with a childs blood said sharavi looking at me maybe he sees himself as an artist milo cursed silently one thing that interests me said sharavi is the fact that the writing was done first and then the blood was added so even back then when as dr delaware has pointed out he was still impulsive those letters leaving a message meant something to him and he planned carefully hes always had a definite agenda what else interests you said milo just the elements that youre aware of the variability in methods and body positioning the geographic scatter two girls one boy the lack of pattern to throw us off but despite that a pattern as dr delaware has suggested retardations obviously an issue so maybe dvll has something to do with that or handicaps in general d for defective defective devils something like that he took out his bad hand and looked at it until the match between irit and the shaver girl came up i was skeptical about dr delawares theory of linkage even now theres a disconnected feeling to these killings disconnected how i said i dont know the smooth face tightened and lines showed around the eyes not that my opinion means much i have only dealt with one serial killer in israel that makes me an expert here he shrugged howd you get the shoe said milo i didnt get it i got to it please dont ask more why not because i cant tell you open communication huh from now on the shoes are in the past with three killings on your hands maybe more why bother more at this level of subtlety said sharavi there could be dvll messages never detected dont you think milo didnt answer i understand your not trusting me said the dark man in your position id feel the same way cool it with the empathy superintendent thats dr delawares territory sharavi sighed all right would you like me to remove the bugs tonight or tomorrow where are they all in dr delawares home where else just there why should i believe you no reason said sharavi except i have no interest in lying to you check for yourself ill provide debugging equipment milo waved him off how many bugs are there in dr delawares home four in the phone receiver under the living room couch under the dining table and the kitchen table thats it hook me up to a polygraph if itll make you feel better polygraphs can be fooled sure said sharavi by psychopaths with abnormally low levels of arousal im not a psychopath i sweat do you all the time now shall i disconnect the bugs or do you want to do it yourself nothing complicated four little black discs that pop right off wheres the feed a phone at my place what else do you have there a police scanner various equip a scanner with tactical lines sharavi nodded what else the usual a fax machine computers youre hooked into all the police data banks i said dmv ncic yes state offender files too yes he turned to milo im aware of all the work youve done looking into alibis who else are you working with besides ms englishasasecondlanguage im working completely alone irina is employed by the consulate big shots daughter gets killed and they send just one guy im all they have said sharavi for this kind of thing just how big is carmeli hes considered very talented what kind of case was this butcher sexual psychopath organized a careful planner he murdered arab women runaways and prostitutes at first then he progressed to lessmarginal victims a woman whod just left her husband and was socially vulnerable he gained their trust anesthetized them then dissected them and dumped their bodies in hilly areas around jerusalem sometimes accompanied by pages from the bible another case with messages i said what was his we never had a chance to interview him but we suspect he had some kind of racist agenda possibly trying to cause a race war between arabs and jews the fbi was informed fully if youd like ill get you copies of the vicap case file you never had a chance to interview him said milo meaning hes dead yes how i killed him the golden eyes blinked selfdefense milo looked down at the damaged hand sharavi raised his arm and the limp flesh bobbed he doesnt get all the credit for this i was partially disabled in the sixday war he destroyed what function was left i would have preferred capturing him alive in order to learn from him but another blink after it was over i read all i could about people like him there wasnt much the fbi was just getting the vicap program started now they offer profiles but dr delawares point about profiles relying upon the past is welltaken whats to stop some clever boy from doing his reading too and using it against us us said milo policemen there is a certain contrived feeling to these killings dont you think selfdefense said milo so now youve been brought over to defend yourself against our guy no said sharavi im not a hired assassin im here to investigate irit carmelis death because consul carmeli thought i could be of use and consul carmeli gets what he wants sometimes he said you were in the states where new york doing what security work at the embassy selfdefense work security work you speak excellent english i said my wife is american is she here with you said milo sharavi gave a low soft laugh no wheres she from la lots of la connections said milo another point in my favor shall i disconnect the bugs ever been tapped yourself probably you dont mind no one likes the loss of privacy said sharavi you guys are big on that arent you gadgetry top security high tech but all the mossad crap didnt help your prime minister did it no said sharavi it didnt that was an interesting one said milo im no conspiracy buff but it made me wonder the guy shoots rabin in the back from two feet away next day theres video footage on tv showing him heckling rabin at a bunch of rallies frothing at the mouth having to be carried away and within hours of the assassination all his confederates are rounded up so he was well known to the authorities but the security guards let him get right next to the target interesting isnt it said sharavi whats your theory someone didnt like the boss there are people who agree with you another theory is that even experienced security people couldnt imagine a jewish assassin yet another is that the original plan was to use blanks make a public statement and the assassin changed his mind at the last minute in any case its a national disgrace and its caused me additional pain because the assassin was of yemenite descent and so am i shall i disconnect now or later or would you care to do it yourself later said milo i think id rather look at your place first sharavi was surprised why see how the hightech half lives will we be working together do i have a choice there are always choices said the dark man then my choice right now is to see your setup if you cant even give on that ill know what im dealing with sharavi touched his lip with his good hand and gazed up at milo the surprised eyes looked innocent sure he said why not he gave us an address on the block of livonia street and told us to see ourselves out and meet him then he slipped behind a partition and disappeared we drove south on la cienega passing one dark restaurant after another heading for olympic milo said he uses that hand as a prop handicapped detective on a case full of handicapped victims it could give the case another dimension for him despite what he says think hes really here to clean up the mess i dont know just between you and me and the dashboard alex that doesnt sound halfbad we catch the bastard the israelis finish him off no publicity no media bullshit no goddamn lawyers and the carmelis and godknowshowmany other parents get some closure he laughed some public servant i am the rule of law but someone whod do that to retarded kids he cursed painting with blood dvll in the shoes so raymonds a match too what bugs me is that its only luck that led us to the message and your hawkeye he laughed and it jarred me what you ever come across this butcher in your readings no bringing in a onecase homeboy he ran his hand over his face and looked at the dashboard clock jesus its after two already robin gonna be worried hopefully shes sleeping when i left for the meeting with the other cops i told her id be late why i was hoping for progress well we got some all right are you going to stay on the case if it means working with sharavi why should i give it up just because carmelis a control freak oh hell forget my righteous indignation the guy lost his daughter hes flexing whatever muscle hes got would i do differently if i had the clout not on your life and its bigger than just irit now another thing i said by working with sharavi you can coopt him those resources carmeli talked about yeah all sorts of surveillance toys but first we need someone to surveil we were south on robertson now at cashio he turned right and laughed again besides who better than me to work this puzzler right i do have the top solve rate in west la eighteen percent higher than the competition i said hoohah my mommy always told me id be tops mom knows best actually he said what she said was milo honey how come you stay in your room all day and dont go out anymore and what ever happened to that nice girl you used to date livonia was the first block west of robertson the block meant a left turn he cruised slowly only a mile or so from the carmelis house i said maybe the boss drops in for briefings he probably does thats why carmelis attitude changed sharavi told him you knew what you were doing or played him the surveillance tapes endorsement from big brother he said wonder if the neighbors know theyre living with james freaking bond the neighbors lived in small seventyyearold spanish houses nearly obscured by a twisted hedge of hollywood juniper sharavis pink bungalow sat behind a tiny lawn shaved to the dirt in the driveway was the gray toyota id seen at the schoolyard a porch light yellowed the wooden front door a small olivewood mezuzah was nailed to the sidepost before we could ring sharavi opened the door and let us in hed removed his windbreaker and was wearing the pale blue shirt and jeans the shirt was shortsleeved and his forearms were hairless thin but muscled laced with veins a wedding band circled the ring finger of the good hand there was an alarm panel just inside the living room and dining room were completely empty clean golden hardwood under white ceilings an unscreened spotless brick fireplace pleated blackout drapes over every window he waved us through a short narrow center hall past a kitchen with gray cabinets to the rear of the house something to drink he said passing a small bathroom the lights were on every room was lit showing us there was nothing to hide milo said lets see your gizmos sharavi surged past a bedroom queensized bed topsheet with a military tuck nightstand with nothing on it but a cheap lamp our destination was the second bedroom at the end of the hall metalsheet shutters on these windows a steellegged desk identical to zev carmelis was against the far wall and a black vinyl chair was wheeled up to it on the desk were a police scanner cb and shortwave radios irongray laptop computer laser printer battery backup fax machine and a paper shredder with an empty catch basket empty trash basket on the wooden floor stacked neatly between olivewood bookends was a collection of hardware and software manuals and boxes of backup tapes and cdroms next to the computer were two white phones three reams of paper and a pair of maroon velvet bags each with goldembroidered stars of david on top of the smaller bag was a crocheted skullcap dark blue with red roses along the border sharavi saw me looking at the bags prayer equipment he said shawl and phylacteries and prayer book i need all the help i can get what do you pray for said milo it depends said sharavi upon what you want upon how worthy i feel sharavi unzipped the larger bag drew out a folded square of white woolen cloth with black stripes see nothing dangerous having god on your side can be dangerous said milo or thinking you do sharavis arched eyebrows rose higher because im religious im a dangerous fanatic no im just saying i understand your resentment we had a bad beginning but why waste any more time on it you want to solve these cases and so do i in addition to the professional incentive i want to return to jerusalem to my wife and children milo didnt answer how many children do you have i said three sharavi returned the shawl to the bag i surveilled you because it was the only way to get information rude definitely unethical i could debate that but ill say yes but all in all no big crime because an innocent child was murdered three children now at the least ill live with my sins and i suspect you would too know me do you sharavi smiled well i have had a chance to learn about you milo said hah do they have standup comedy in jerusalem in israel said sharavi everyones a prophet its the same thing he touched the prayer bag youre effective detective sturgis and effective people focus on whats important thats not an attempt to kiss your rear just fact im going to get some coffee are you sure you dont want any positive he left us alone in the room i looked at the computer manuals and milo unzipped the second velvet bag black leather straps and boxes phylacteries i said inside are biblical i know what they are he said had a robbery case last year punks broke into a synagogue not far from here vandalized stole money from charity boxes ripped torah scrolls and these things too i remember the scene wondering what all those belts were doing there the old guy who took care of the place the sexton explained it to me then he broke down and cried said it reminded him of pogroms hed seen as a kid in europe catch them no theres also a guy cop named decker in the west valley whos a religious jew actually uses them himself i know because someone saw him at a police retreat getting up early to pray all wrapped up his wife got him into religion or something like that they call him the rabbi i helped him on a case couple of years ago israeli connections as a matter of fact maybe i should give him a call see if he knows carmeli or this joker another murder case i said missing family case that turned into murder i churned some paper for him no big deal he was decent but i dont trust him why not he got promoted to lieutenant i laughed he opened the closet no clothes on the rod on the shelf above it were several small crisplooking brown cardboard boxes and three oblong black canvas cases he hefted the first case opened it and slid out something black and metallic uzi barrel the rest is in here sticking his hand into the case he drew out submachinegun components inspected them put them back the other two cases contained a rifle with a telescopic sight and a doublebarreled shotgun both polished to a gleam the crisp cardboard boxes ten of them held ammunition ready for the battle said milo he left us here to show us hes got nothing to hide but thats bullshit hes got to have handguns and other stuff hes not showing us sharavi came back with a mug in his good hand wheres the ninemillimeter said milo and whatever other small stuff youre hiding im not hiding anything said sharavi everything in its proper place where where would you keep your small arms in the kitchen and the bedroom go see for yourself thats okay milo sauntered to the closet looks like youre ready for the big plo assault sure youre not thinking of doing some hunting no said sharavi i dont hunt he smiled though ive been known to fish what else is in your arsenal meaning my grenades rocket launcher and nuclear bomb no your heavy stuff sorry to disappoint you said sharavi this is it he sipped lowered the cup except for this removing a black disc the size of an m m from his pocket he handed it to milo who turned it over this is what i attached to your couch and tables dr delaware never seen one this small said milo cute japanese israeli the ones i installed at dr delawares are channeled to the phone on the left the other phones a conventional line and also connects to the fax i taped your conversations transcribed them destroyed the tapes gave the transcripts to carmeli covering your trail obviously not well enough sharavi shook his head using the van twice in one day was stupid must be jet lag how long have you been here in la five days a month in new york security work they called me over because of the trade center bombing verdicts we knew thered be a conviction expected some sort of reprisals i ended up watching some people in brooklyn people i knew from the west bank they do anything not yet i educated our new york staff was about to fly home when zevs call came do you know him from israel i said i know his older brother hes in the police deputy commander the familys prominent superintendent said milo whats the equivalent here probably a captain but theres no real equivalent its a small pond were all minnows how humble no said sharavi religious it accomplishes the same thing so carmeli calls you and you cant go back how old are your kids my daughters eighteen just started the army i have two younger sons the golden eyes squeezed shut for a moment family man said milo whatever that means maybe that gives you insights i dont have because youre gay you dont believe that and neither do i policemen are like anyone else a few genuine idiots at the bottom equally few high achievers the mediocre majority you a high achiever thats not for me to say any more ideas about this case my instincts tell me the defective angle should be looked into as well as the racial angle because all three victims were nonanglo but maybe thats because my case had racial aspects i need to make sure my limited experience doesnt narrow my perspective maybe its your destiny to deal with racist killers said milo your karma or whatever equivalent youve got in your religion mazal said sharavi have you heard the expression mazal tov this aint kansas superintendent sharavi smiled how about daniel okay i know what mazal tov is daniel good luck yes but mazals not really luck said sharavi its fate like karma rooted in astrology a zodiac sign is a mazal yemenite jews have a strong astrological tradition not that i believe in any of that to me it boils down to hard work and what god wants you to do god wants you on the case sharavi shrugged im here must be nice to have faith said milo sharavi wheeled the chair away from the desk raised his arm and let the bad hand flop on the headrest one way or the other i have to work the carmeli case milo will you let me do it with you rather than at crosspurposes hey said milo far be it from me to argue with god milo and i stayed at sharavis house until after three wearily establishing a division of labor milo would drive to newton division photograph raymond ortizs shoes and record the evidence in the growing case file then back on the phone to search for additional dvll crimes sharavi would use his computers to scan every available data bank for the same something else he said i could contact experts on crime against the handicapped all over the world didnt know there were experts on that said milo there may not be but there are specialists in neonazism racism that kind of thing you think this is political not per se said sharavi but the notion of eliminating the weak comes from somewhere maybe dvll will crop up in racist literature makes sense i said striking at the handicapped could be the killers own form of selective breeding eugenics since the berlin wall came down racist ideology has been circulating freely in europe said sharavi for obvious reasons we monitor it so i have my sources if similar crimes have been recorded if suspects have been arrested it could give us some understanding into our killers motives at least the motives he honors himself with honors said milo yeah because his main motive is sexual he took a sip of the coffee hed finally accepted from sharavi and the dark man nodded the asshole prides himself on mopping up the gene pool sure go ahead check out all that stuff his tone was agreeable but bland maybe it was fatigue maybe he was glad to keep the israeli busy the gene pool i said have either of you read the brain drain they both shook their heads popular psychology came out a few years ago the basic premise was iq means everything and stupid people mostly darkskinned people are overbreeding depleting our chromosomal resources the books answer was government control of fertility the smart should be paid to procreate those with low intelligence should be offered incentives to get sterilized it was a minor bestseller generated quite a bit of controversy i remember it said milo some professor you ever read it no i said but someone else might have our boy uses pop psych for justification everybody needs justification even sex crimes have a social context that makes sense said sharavi sex killers often go for prostitutes because prostitutes are at the bottom of the ladder and easier to dehumanize right from what ive seen every killer needs to dehumanize his victim in some way assassins soldiers sadists the social context said milo he deals with his twisted little brain by convincing himself hes cleansing the world of defectives his chin was resting in one hand and he kept it there looking down at the hardwood floor death by darwin he mumbled it would also fit with the notion of someone who thinks hes superior i said hes operating out of some eugenic fantasy so he doesnt carry out a sexual assault and takes care to arrange the body with what he considers respect only irits body he said raymond was reduced to bloody shoes i can buy the fact that the killer was just starting out honing his craft but what about latvinia she came after irit and he strung her up treated her rougher i dont know i said somethings off maybe hes just jumping around to avoid an obvious pattern no one talked for a while sharavi took a swallow from his third cup of coffee dvll he said thats the pattern he feels safe sharing lets get back to the uniform angle said milo in addition to it helping him snag victims he could also like it because hes a man on a mission maybe someone with a military background or a military wannabe if he served he may very well have a dishonorable discharge i said sharavi smiled weakly uniforms can be valuable being israeli milo asked him would irit relate in a special way to someone in uniform hard to say said sharavi in israel we have a citizens army almost everyone goes in for three years and returns for reserve duty so the countrys full of uniforms israeli children see that as normal irit has actually lived outside of israel for most of her life but being around embassies and consulates she was accustomed to guards its possible i dont really know much about her psychological makeup the carmelis didnt fill you in they told me the usual she was a wonderful child beautiful and innocent and wonderful silence milo said we could also be talking cop wannabes like that asshole bianchi to sharavi the hillside strangler yes i know bianchi applied to many departments got turned down and became a security guard which is a whole other angle said milo no one screens security guards you get excons psychos all sorts of fools walking around looking official some with guns youre right about that i said i had a case a few years ago childcustody dispute the father was a guard for a big industrial company out in the valley turned out to be flagrantly psychotic paranoid hearing voices the company had issued him pepper spray handcuffs a baton and a semiautomatic lets hear it for personnel screening okay so what do we have so far joe paramilitary with highiq fantasies and weird ideas about survival of the fittest a sex drive that goes out of whack every so often maybe photographic equipment by taking pictures for later usage and arranging the bodies in a way that throws us off he has his cake and he cut himself off gave a sick look rubbed his face hard rosy patches appeared on the pale scarred skin his eyelids were heavy and his shoulders sloped anything else sharavi shook his head what i can do i said is see if any eugenicrelated murders come up in the psychiatric literature who knows maybe dvll will crop up there sharavis fax machine began spitting paper he collected a single sheet and showed it to us paragraphs in hebrew milo said that sure clarifies it headquarters wants my weekly timelog precise accounting of my time been a bad boy said milo tardy sharavi smiled one needs to prioritize perhaps i should go to disneyland bring the chief superintendent back a mickey mouse hat crumpling the paper he tossed it into the trash basket two points said milo you have basketball in israel sharavi nodded managed to smile he looked exhausted too eyes sinking even deeper basketball but no sex killers huh what you pick and choose what you borrow from us i wish said sharavi if only we were that smart milo got up ill take those bugs out myself if its only the four you said only those then i can handle it he stared down at the smaller man you stay here and talk to interpol nazi hunters whatever once they were gone daniel locked the house activated the alarm and went to his bedroom where he sat on the edge of the mattress he indulged himself in a few minutes of loneliness before pushing away thoughts of laura and the children and assessing how it had gone sturgis didnt trust him one bit but still the situation was not bad considering his own stupidity the psychologist those active eyes hed had to notify zev about being found out but zev had been decent about it bigger things on his mind since irits murder everyone said he was a different man daniel understood the difference craving only one thing what was the chance of delivering listening in on sturgis and delaware had produced one good outcome hed learned that sturgis was bright and focused exactly the type of detective he enjoyed working with hed known a few guys like that one with a brilliant future but hed died horribly for no good reason sturgiss history his lapd file full of complaints striking out at the superior had prepared daniel for an outburst but no fireworks tonight delaware had remained very quiet the eyes going constantly the quintessential psychologist though he had spoken up from time to time asking about daniels accent wanting to know about daniels family like an intake at a therapy session in the rehab center after his first injuries hed spent time with psychologists and hated it less than hed expected years later on the job hed consulted them on the butcher case dr ben david had proved of some usefulness it had been a while since hed been analyzed though those active blue eyes pale appraising yet not as cold as they might have been sturgiss were green almost unhealthily bright what effect would they have on a suspect so much intensity the two of them so different and yet they had a history of working together efficiently friends too according to reports a homosexual and a heterosexual interesting daniel knew only one gay policeman and not well a sergeant major working out of central region nothing effeminate or overt about the man but hed never married never dated women and people who knew him from the army said hed been spotted one night going onto the beach in herzliyya with another man not a brilliant policeman that one but competent no one bothered him but the other officers shunned him and daniel was certain hed never advance sturgis was shunned too for daniel the issue was a religious one and that made it an abstraction for daniel religion was personal his relationship to god he cared nothing about what others did if their habits didnt infringe upon his liberties or those of his family his family in jerusalem it was morning but too early to call laura like many artists she was a nocturnal creature stifling her internal clock for years to raise babies and coddle her husband now that the kids were older shed permitted herself to revert staying up late sketching and painting and reading sleeping in until eight or nine feeling guilty about it too sometimes daniel still had to reassure her he was fine making his own coffee he drew his knees up closed his eyes and thought about her soft blond hair and beautiful face swaddled in topsheet puffy with sleep as he stopped to kiss her before leaving for headquarters oh i feel like such a bum honey i should be up cooking your breakfast i never eat breakfast still or i should give you other things tugging him down for a kiss then stopping herself my breath stinks no its sweet pressing his lips upon hers feeling her mouth parting the wedding of tongue with tongue he opened his eyes looked around the bare room in his talbieh apartment the walls were alive with color lauras paintings and batiks and the creations of her friends her artsy friends whom he seldom spoke to painting with blood what would laura say about that kind of art he never told her anything beyond the most general facts for twenty years of marriage that had worked fine twenty years by todays standards longevity not mazal or the result of some amulet or chant or blessing from a hakham gods grace and hard work submerging your ego to be half of a pair doing the right thing he wished he knew what that meant in this case the following morning as i drove to the u i realized helena still hadnt called put nolans suicide to rest i had plenty to do snagging a biomed computer terminal i logged into medline psych abstracts the periodicals index every other database i could find pulling up references on eugenics but finding none with any relationship to homicide collecting handfuls of bound journals i went looking for the brain drain the book was filed under intelligence measurement three copies two checked out the one left was thick rebound in crimson squeezed between manuals on iq testing a few books down the shelf i noticed a slim softcover entitled twisted science the truth behind the brain drain and i took that too finding a quiet corner desk on the tenth floor i searched every source for a dvll citation absolutely nothing but what i was learning kept me turning pages because the idea that some lives were to be nurtured and others eliminated for the good of society hadnt begun with the race hygiene program of the third reich nor had it died there selective breeding had appealed to the elite for centuries but it had earned scientific respectability in the europe and america of the late nineteenth century after being championed by a very respectable figure british mathematician francis galton unable to produce children himself galton had strong beliefs about survival of the ethnically fittest qualities such as intellect zeal and industriousness he reasoned were simple traits much like height or hair color and governed by basic rules of inheritance in order to improve society the state needed to collect detailed mental physical and racial information on every citizen issue certificates to the superior and pay them for breeding and encourage inferiors to remain celibate in galton coined the term eugenics from the greek meaning wellborn to describe this process galtons simplistic theories of intelligence were undermined by a rebirth of the works of gregor mendel the austrian monk who bred thousands of plants and found that some traits were dominant others recessive later research showed that most defective genes were carried by outwardly normal parents even vegetables didnt follow galtons simplistic model but mendels ability to measure patterns of inheritance spurred on galtons disciples and eugenics took hold of the academic mainstream so that by the twenties and thirties nearly all geneticists assumed mentally retarded people and other degenerates should be actively prevented from breeding these views made their way into public policy on both sides of the atlantic and by a harvard geneticist named east was actively promoting the reduction of defective germ plasm through segregation and sterilization one of easts main influences was someone id considered a sage of my chosen field id been taught that henry h goddard of the vineland training school in new jersey had been a pioneer of psychological testing what i hadnt known was that goddard claimed feeblemindedness was due to a single defective gene and enthusiastically volunteered to administer iq tests to thousands of immigrants arriving at ellis island in order to weed out undesirables goddards bizarre finding that over percent of italians hungarians russians and jews were mentally retarded was accepted without question by a wide range of intellectuals and legislators and in the us congress approved an immigration act curtailing the entry of southern and eastern europeans the bill was signed into law by president calvin coolidge who declared america must be kept american biological laws show that nordics deteriorate when mixed with other races and goddard wasnt alone chasing down footnotes and citations i came across the writings of another giant of psychology lewis terman of stanford developer of the stanfordbinet iq test though the french binet test had been developed to help identify children with learning problems so they could be tutored its american modifier declared his major goal to be curtailing the reproduction of feeblemindedness with a subsequent reduction in industrial inefficiency according to terman intellectual weakness was very very common among spanishindians and mexican families of the southwest and also among negroes their dullness seems to be racial children of this group should be segregated in special classes they cannot master abstractions but they can often be made efficient workers from a eugenic point of view they constitute a grave problem because of their unusually prolific breeding but the prime mover of the us eugenics movement was university of chicago professor charles davenport who believed that prostitutes chose their profession because of a dominant gene for innate eroticism davenports method of preserving the future of white america was castration of males of inferior ethnic groups castration not vasectomy he emphasized because while the latter prevented breeding it also encouraged sexual immorality davenports views influenced the law well beyond immigration statutes embraced as they were by many socialwelfare groups including some pioneers of the familyplanning movement the term final solution was first used by the national association of charities and corrections in the s and between and eugenic sterilization laws were passed in thirtytwo american states and in germany canada norway sweden finland iceland and denmark most enthusiastic among the selfappointed genetic janitors was the state of california where in an order to compulsorily sterilize all inmates of state hospitals judged sexually or morally perverted mentally ill or feebleminded got scalpels clicking four years later the law was broadened to include noninstitutionalized people suffering from marked departure from normal mentality in forced sterilization reached its highest sanction when a young unwed mother named carrie buck was sterilized against her will in virginia by virtue of a us supreme court decision written by oliver wendell holmes holmess decision not only allowed the procedure to be carried out but also praised it in order to prevent our being swamped with incompetence the principle that sustains compulsory vaccination is broad enough to cover cutting the fallopian tubes three generations of imbeciles are enough carrie bucks baby the third generation of imbeciles in question grew up to be an honor student carrie buck herself was eventually paroled from the virginia colony for feebleminded and epileptics and lived out her life quietly as the wife of a smalltown sheriff she was later found out not to be retarded the buck decision sped up the pace of forced sterilization and more than sixty thousand people mostly residents of state hospitals were operated on all across the us as late as the s in the carrie buck opinion was adopted as law in germany and within one year fiftysix thousand german patients had been sterilized by under the aegis of the nazis the number had climbed to two million for as hitler wrote in mein kampf the right of personal freedom recedes before the duty to preserve the race the demand that defective people be prevented from propagating equally defective offspring is a demand of the clearest reason and if systematically executed represents the most humane act of mankind after world war ii the tide began turning revulsion at the nazi atrocities but more important the demands of wartime service upon surgeons slowed down the rate of eugenic sterilization and though the practice continued for decades most eugenics laws were eventually reversed in the face of scientific debunking but the cause hadnt been abandoned far from it and sterilization seemed tame compared to some of the ideas being tossed about now i found myself swimming in an ethical cesspool calls for assisted suicide sliding quickly into recommendations that those with nothing to live for be put out of their misery a report from holland where physicianassisted suicide had been liberalized that as many as onethird of euthanasiasmercy killings had been carried out without patients consent an australian bioethicist proclaiming religion no longer the basis for making moral judgments and the sanctity of human life no longer a valid concept his alternative fellow ethicists should assign numerical quality of life measurements to people and parcel out health care based upon scores the retarded the handicapped the elderly the infirm would find themselves low on the list and be treated accordingly in the case of deformed and retarded babies a twentyeightday waiting period would be offered so parents could choose infanticide for a life that has begun very badly anyone who fell short on objective criteria of personhood rational thought and selfconsciousness could be killed without fear of penalty humanely gentle strangulation indeed britains national health insurance had recently put forth a policy offering free abortions to mothers of genetically defective babies rescinding the usual twentyfourweek limit and allowing termination til shortly before birth also in england the green partys annual conference proposed a very deliberate percent reduction in the uks population in the name of saving the planet leading critics to evoke memories of the nazi partys infatuation with ecology natural purity and antiurbanism the government of china was ahead of all this having long enforced population control through coerced abortion sterilization and starving orphans to death in staterun facilities in the us calls for prioritizing healthcare services in the age of tight dollars and managed care had led many to question whether the seriously ill and the genetically disadvantaged should be allowed to dominate healthcare expenditure i found a us news and world report article detailing the struggle of a thirtyfouryearold woman with downs syndrome to receive a lifesaving heartlung operation stanford university medical center had rejected her because we do not feel that patients with downs syndrome are appropriate candidates for heartlung transplantation as had the university of california at san diego because it judged her incapable of cooperating with the medical regimen her doctor disagreed and the publicity had forced both hospitals to reconsider but what of others languishing outside the media spotlight it reminded me of a case id seen years ago while working with child cancer patients at western pediatrics hospital a fourteenyearold boy diagnosed with acute leukemia by then a treatable disease with an excellent prognosis for remission but this leukemia patient was retarded and several interns and residents began grumbling about wasting their precious time i lectured to them with meager results because i wasnt an md wouldnt be administering chemotherapy and radiotherapy simply didnt understand what was involved the attending physician a passionate and dedicated man caught wind of the protest and delivered a diatribe about hippocrates and morality that silenced the grumblers but it had been a begrudging compliance what kind of doctors had those interns become who were they judging now quality of life id worked with thousands of children with birth defects deformities mental retardation learning disabilities chronic and painful and fatal diseases most experienced a full range of emotions including joy i remembered one little girl eight years old a thalidomide casualty no arms stunted flipper feet shining eyes an eagerness to embrace life better quality of life than some facelifted psychopaths id known not that it mattered for it wasnt my role to judge either the eugenecists argued that societys progress could be measured by the achievement of the gifted and in part that was true but what good was progress if it led to callousness cruelty cold judgments about deservedness a degradation of the godly spark in all of us whod be the new gods geneticists ethicists scientists had flocked to nazism in record numbers politicians hmo executives with bottomline obsessions and after we cleansed the world of one group of degenerates whod be next on the chromosomal hit list the flabby the charmless the boring the ugly scary stuff and the fact that psychology had once swallowed it whole disgusted me the racist swill propagated by goddard and terman still reverberated in my head both had been names uttered with reverence in the corridors of the psych tower like a child discovering his parents are felons i felt a cold dark pit open in my gut id administered countless iq tests had prided myself upon knowing the limitations of the instrument as well as the virtues properly done testing was valuable still the rotten spot id just found at the core of my fields golden apple made me wonder what else id missed despite all my education it was pm and id been in the library for five hours lunchtime but i had no appetite i picked up the brain drain the books sole premise became obvious within pages material success morality happy marriages superior parenthood all were caused by high g a supposed generalintelligence trait whose validity had been debated for years this author presented it as a given the book had a smarmy congratulatory tone addressing itself to you the highly intelligent reader the ultimate kissup virtue by association maybe that and a harnessing of uppermiddleclass anxiety during hard times could explain its bestsellerdom it sure wasnt the science because i came across page after page of faulty assumptions shoddy referencing articles the author claimed as supportive that turned out to be just the opposite when i looked them up promises to back up assertions with numbers that never appeared revival of galtons onegene theory of intelligence hundredyearold nonsense whod written this garbage the author bio at the back said a social scholar named arthur haldane phd resident scholar at the loomis institute in new york city no further credentials no book jacket on the library copy so no photo ugly stuff ugly times so what else was new my head hurt and my eyes ached what would i report to milo and sharavi pseudoscientific crap sold well what connection was there to three dead kids the killer watching stalking culling the herd with scholarly justification because some lives just werent worth living so he wasnt really a murderer he was a freelance bioethicist the only thing i hadnt gotten to was twisted science the critique of the brain drain and though i couldnt see what it could add i checked it out and took it home with me one message at my service milos home number but the caller was dr richard silverman rick and milo had lived together for years but he and i rarely spoke he was more prone to listening than talking reserved meticulous fit always welldressed he was a striking contrast to milos aesthetic impairment and some people saw the two of them as an odd couple i knew they were both thoughtful driven highly selfcritical had suffered deeply from being homosexual had taken a long time to find their niche both as individuals and members of a couple both buried themselves in bloody work rick spent over one hundred hours a week as a senior er physician at cedarssinai and their time together was often silent he said thanks alex hows everything great with you fine fine listen i just wanted to ask how helena dahls doing nothing confidential just if shes okay i havent seen her recently rick oh something wrong well he said she quit the hospital yesterday no explanation i guess whats happened to her could unnerve anybody its tough i said i met the brother once not through her he came in with a gunshot case never mentioned being her brother and i wasnt paying attention to nametags but someone told me later helena wasnt on duty no not that particular night anything unusual about him not really big guy young very quiet could have stepped right out of an lapd recruiting poster back when that was the type they recruited i was struck by the fact that he never bothered to ask for helena thought maybe he knew she was off but when i told her hed been in she looked surprised anyway i dont want to pry take care if you do see her say hi will do he laughed say hi to milo too youre probably seeing him more than i am this case the retarded kids its really disturbing him not that hes been talking about it but hes been tossing in his sleep it was twothirty i hadnt come up with a thing on the dvll killings robin was out for the afternoon the house was too damn big and the day seemed hollow id pushed helena and nolan to the back of my mind but ricks call got me ruminating again what had caused her to make such a complete break those family photos in nolans garage primal memories that strong she was tough and competent on the job but isolated in her private life more like her brother than shed realized had his selfdestruction gotten her wondering about where shed end up paths that hadnt been taken depression ran in families had i missed something i called her home the phone kept ringing and worstcase scenarios flashed through my head i thought about nolans showing up at the er never asking for her even when we were little kids we went our separate ways just ignored each other is that normal that kind of distance could pass for civility when lifes rhythms remained shallow but when things went bad it could lead to the worst kind of guilt parents dead abandoned by her husband when he moved to north carolina going to work each day at the er performing heroics coming home to had the reliable engine finally broken down i had nothing to do and decided to take a drive out to her house maybe id find her in a bathrobe on the sofa watching soap operas and stuffing her face with junk food maybe shed get angry at the intrusion and id feel like a fool i could live with that it took fortyfive minutes to reach the west end of the valley and another ten to find her address in woodland hills the house was a small yellow structure of no particular style on a hot wide side street lined with mature bottlebrush trees in full bloom red flowers and sticky patches from the trees littered the sidewalks and california jays dove among the branches the sun bore down through the haze and even though i couldnt hear the freeway i could smell it the front lawn was dry and needed mowing big shapeless margarita daisy bushes pushed up against the front porch no sign of her mustang in the driveway and the garage door was shut the mailbox was empty and my ring and knock went unanswered two cars in the driveway next door a white minivan and a white acura i went over there the ceramic plaque beneath the bell said the millers under a crucifix and looked homemade a window air conditioner played a waltz i rang and the brass cover on the peephole snicked back yes male voice my name is dr alex delaware im a friend of your neighbor helena dahl she hasnt been around for a while and some of us have been getting a little concerned um one second the door opened and cold air hit my face a couple in their late twenties looked me over he was tall dark bearded with a sunburned nose and wore a pink hawaiian shirt denim shorts no shoes the can of sprite in his hand was sweating but he wasnt the woman next to him was slim broadshouldered nicelooking with buttercolored multiflipped hair sporting two curlers on top an electric blue tshirt was tucked into black shorts and her nails were long and pearly white whos concerned about helena he said her friends people she works with at cedars no answer i said she quit her job without explaining why has she left town he gave a reluctant nod but didnt say more behind him was a neatly appointed living room homeshopping show on a big screen hawking a pearl necklace with matching earrings only left we just wanted to know how shes doing i said do you know about her brother he nodded he never came around at least not since weve lived here which is two years the woman said but they both grew up here it was their parents house southern accent helena said he was a police officer how strange what he did any idea where she is i said she said she was going on vacation said the man he took a drink from the can and offered it to his wife but she shook her head did she mention where no he said when did she leave whatd you say your name was i repeated it and held out my business card and my policeconsultant badge youre police too i work with them sometimes but that has nothing to do with officer dahl his posture loosened my works kind of related to police work i teach traffic school just opened my own business youre sure this doesnt have anything to do with him investigating his death for insurance or something like that absolutely not i said im just concerned about helena well she just went away to get some rest at least thats what she said and can you blame her i shook my head poor thing said the woman her husband stuck out his hand greg miller this is kathy pleased to meet you she left yesterday he said pardon the suspicion but you cant be too careful all the stuff that goes on nowadays were trying to get a block association together in order to look out for each other helena asked us to watch her house while she was gone crime problems in the neighborhood i said its not watts but its worse than youd think mostly stupid kid stuff now theyve got the white kids thinking theyre gang bangers too there was a party last week over in granada hills gang bangers showed up and when they didnt let em in they did a driveby sometimes i work nights so i taught kathy how to shoot and shes good probably gonna get an attack dog too sounds like serious problems serious enough for me he said i believe in prevention all we had til recently was kids driving by booming their stereos late at night speeding screaming throwing out bottles but the last few months thereve been burglaries even during the day while people are at work another glance between them she nodded and he said last burglary was helena as a matter of fact just two days ago with her brother and that you cant really blame her for wanting to take off right two days ago at night hers was a nighttime thing she went out to do some grocery shopping came back found the back door jimmied kathy and i were out thankfully they didnt hit us they took her tv and the stereo and some jewelry she said next day she was packed up and asking us to look after the house said shed had enough of la did she call the police no she said shed had enough of the police too i figured she meant her brother didnt want to push it even though i thought we definitely should call it in for block security but she was so stressed out of all the people for it to happen to said kathy she was so down to begin with and shes such a nice person mostly she kept to herself but she was always real nice any idea where she went i said nope said kathy she just said she needed a rest and we didnt want to be nosy she had a couple suitcases in the back of the car but i dont even know if it was a driving trip or she was heading for the airport i asked her how long shed be away but she said she wasnt sure shed call to let us know if it was going to be long if she does call would you like me to tell her you were by please i said and good luck with your block association lucks what you make it said greg god helps those who help themselves heavy traffic and bad tempers on the freeway ride back to the city as i sat in a jam just north of the sunset exit i thought of the luck of the dahl family both nolans and helenas homes defiled las burglary rate had skyrocketed but id never worshiped at the altar of coincidence and it made me edgy someone out to get them someone looking for something information about nolans death data helena had the family photo albums were all shed taken the day id gone with her to nolans place but maybe shed returned picked through the mess discovered something that had upset her enough to cancel her therapy quit her job and leave town or maybe it was just the final straw traffic started again then stopped honks lifted middle fingers shouted expletives civilization that night at eight robin and i were in the bath when the phone rang she faced me her hair up water reaching the bottoms of her breasts we played toesies the damn thing quieted later drying off i listened to the taped message its milo call me on the car phone i did and he said found another dvll case hollywood division before raymond ortiz seventeen months ago another poor kid i said how old no not a kid and not retarded either on the contrary i met him at a twentyfourhour coffee shop on highland north of melrose named boatwrights rockettothemoon architecture boomerangshaped counter three of the stools occupied by pieeating newspapernosers the hollywood strings on scratchy soundtrack he was in his usual cops back booth sitting opposite a darkhaired woman he waved and she turned she looked around twentyfive very thin pretty in a severe way she had a pointed chin and skislope nose ivory skin glossy black wedgecut hair glossy brown eyes her pantsuit was black in front of her was a big chocolate malt in a real glass milo had a napkin tucked under his chin and was eating fried shrimp and onion rings and drinking iced tea the woman kept watching me until i got two feet away then she smiled more the right thing to do than amiability scanning me from head to shoe as if measuring for a suit alex this is detective petra connor hollywood homicide petra dr alex delaware good to meet you said connor a little makeup added depth to eyes that didnt need any more she had very long very thin hands with warm strong fingers that squeezed mine for a second then flew back to the straw in her malt i slid in next to milo something to eat he said no im fine whats up whats up is detective connor is an eagle eye pure luck she said in a soft voice most of the time i never pay attention to memos most of the time theyre bullshit she smiled and twirled the straw oh yeah he said i forgot working with bishop you probably never hear sullied speech i dont but bishop does said connor her partners a mormon milo told me very smart very straight probably be chief one day petra and he picked up the case in question a while back hes currently off with the wife and million kids in hawaii so shes riding alone the whole thing amazes me she said being tied into a possible serial because ours wasnt even a murder just an iffy suicide not iffy enough to change the coroners verdict so we closed it as a suicide but when i saw your memo shaking her head she pushed the malt aside and dabbed at her lips the lipstick she left on the straw had brown overtones the black in her hair was real she was probably closer to thirty than twentyfive but not a line on her face who was the victim i said a twentynineyearold scientist named malcolm ponsico cellular physiologist recent phd from caltech supposed to be some kind of genius he lived in pasadena but was working at a research lab on sunset near vermont hospital row and thats where he did it so it was our case i used to work at western peds i said right there two blocks up place called plasmoderm they do skin research developing synthetic grafts for burn victims that kind of thing ponsicos specialty was cell membranes he killed himself with an injection of potassium chloride the stuff they use for lethalinjection executions did it while working late the cleaning lady found him at am slumped over his lab table big laceration right here where his head hit the edge she traced a line over wellformed black brows he fell on his head when he died thats how the coroner saw it wheres the dvll tiein he left it typed on his computer screen four letters right in the middle of the screen stu detective bishop and i figured it for something technical a formula but we asked around just to be careful in case it was some kind of coded suicide note no one at plasmoderm knew what it meant and it didnt show up in any of ponsicos computer files we had one of our dataprocessing guys check them out all numbers formulas no one seemed surprised by ponsico writing something only he understood he was that kind of guy major brain in a world of his own did he leave a message at his home no his apartment was in perfect order everyone said he was a nice person quiet kept to himself really into his work no one had noticed him being depressed and his parents in new jersey said hed seemed okay when he called them but parents often say that people hide things right he seemed okay i said thats not a ringing endorsement of his happiness his parents said hed always been a serious boy their word boy a genius theyd always let him do his own thing and hed always produced their word too theyre both professors i got the feeling it was a highpressure household it played out pure suicide ponsicos prints were all over the hypodermic and the potassium vial and the coroner said the position we found him in was consistent with selfinfliction said also it was a fairly quick death massive heart attack though ponsico could have made things easier on himself if hed taken a tranquilizer like the ones they give death row guys then again no one from the aclu was looking over ponsicos shoulder so what was iffy about it ponsicos former girlfriend another scientist at the lab named sally branch was convinced there was something wrong and kept calling us up asking us to keep snooping she said it didnt make sense ponsico had no reason to kill himself shed have known if there were something wrong even though she was a former girlfriend my thought exactly doctor and she also tried to cast suspicion on ponsicos new girlfriend so we figured it was jealousy then i met the new girlfriend and wondered she took a sip of water her name was zena lambert and she was weird shed worked as a clerk at plasmoderm but left a few months before ponsicos death weird how i said kind of nerdy but in a mean way snippy as in im smarter than you so dont waste my time even though she claimed to be grieving over ponsico an intellectual snob i said exactly which was funny because sally branch with her phd was downtoearth and here was this clerk who thought she was the endall still a bad personality doesnt make someone a suspect and we had absolutely nothing on her did sally branch give some reason for suspecting zena she said ponsico changed noticeably after he started dating her even quieter less social hostile all of which seemed logical to me hed be less social with sally because hed broken up with her did she say why he broke up with her all zena to listen to her zena swooped down like some harpy and stole him away she also said zena had gotten him into some kind of highiq club and hed become obsessed with his intelligence bigtime arrogant but that was it evidencewise and she gave me no motive for zena wanting to hurt him eventually i just stopped taking her calls now milos told me about these dvll murders someone getting rid of retarded people maybe a tiein with genetic cleansing so i have to wonder about that highiq group she shook her head though i still cant see any connection to ponsico unless he met your killer at the brainiac club and learned too much for his own good did zena get anothor job after she left plasmoderm i said bookstore in silverlake its in the file did sally give you a name for the club i said thinking about nolan dahl another highiq suicide meta she said you really think there could be a link i told the two of them what id learned in the library survival of the rotten she said reminds me of something my father once told me he was a professor in arizona physical anthropologist did research on wolves the desert he said there was a giant study going on the human genome project mapping every gene in the human body trying to figure out which traits are caused by what the ultimate goal is to collect detailed data on every one of us my dad said the upside potential for medical research was tremendous but it was also frightening what if insurance companies got hold of the information and decided to withhold coverage because of some mutation way back in the family tree or companies started refusing to hire someone because they were at elevated risk for cancer ten years down the line or said milo big bro identifies the mutations and kills off the carriers was plasmoderm involved in that kind of research no just skin grafts but even if they were it doesnt explain why ponsico would kill himself maybe he found out he had some incurable disease nope the coroner said he was perfectly healthy milo pulled out his pad meta sounds like greek it is said petra i went over the file before i came here and looked it up means change transformation something that breaks new ground brave new goddamn world said milo a bunch of arrogant geeks sit around theorizing about improving the species and one of them decides to put it into action both of them looked at me sure i said if you thought you were that superior you might start figuring the rules didnt apply out in the parking lot connor said i spoke to stu this morning he wont be back from maui for another week says to give you all our data she produced a file from a huge black bag and handed it to milo thanks petra no problem she flashed an abrupt white smile just promise that if i send around a memo youll read it we watched her drive away in an older black accord fairly new on the job said milo but shell go far so i guess the next step is for me to go over this then give you a look then have a talk with ponsicos two girlfriends its the best lead weve gotten so far i said saying nothing about nolan because i was still bound by confidentiality and there was no reason to violate we walked to the seville thanks for the library work alex have time to go back there and look up this meta outfit first thing in the morning sharavis wellequipped in the computer department planning to update him havent decided because anything i tell him goes straight to carmeli and how much do i want a grieving highpowered father to know at this point not that i can put him off too long hell if i dont cue him in hell probably start bugging the phones again he laughed cursed distractions by the way i think i figured out how sharavi got raymond ortizs shoes same way he got the file remember how the first time manny alvarado looked for it he couldnt find it seems a former newton captain just happened to drop in to visit the station a couple days before guy named eugene brooker one of the highestranked blacks in the department they used to think he was on his way to deputy chief but his wife died last summer and he retired and guess what he was a biggie on the same olympics security sharavi worked on so the israelis are connected to the department who knows where else no matter how aboveboard sharavi acts ill always figure hes holding something back you think his computers can help substantially i can get academic references from the library material thats been in the englishlanguage press but if metas an international group or if its been implicated in anything criminal overseas he could be useful he thought about that all this assumes metas some big deal for all we know its just a group of nerds getting together for chips and dip patting themselves on the back because god gave them smarts even if the killers one of them howre we going to pick him out of the group if theres a membership roster and we get it we could crosscheck with the sexoffender and mo files we can also see if any members present a clear opportunity or motive for the three killings like working at the park where raymond was abducted andor the conservancy park worker with a high iq underachiever i said thats the way ive seen it all along ponsicos second girlfriend the lambert woman sounds like an underachiever too clerking not that shes any big suspect because our boys definitely male and strong the way he carried irit and raymond trussed up latvinia i got in the car he said what do you think of that gene project connor talked about just what we need in the age of kindness milo some map that determines whose life is worth living so youre not willing to depend upon the good graces of intellectuals and insurance companies huh i laughed gang bangers and dope smugglers and backalley junkie muggers maybe but no not them at am after working since midnight daniel opened the shutters on the computer rooms windows and breathed in light putting on his phylacteries he prayed without feeling looking out at the tiny backyard clad in concrete hed spent most of the night on the phone accommodating the european and asian and middle eastern time zones making policeofficer small talk in four languages calling in favors making his way through the various lawenforcement bureaucracies that somehow never changed from city to city searching for dvll references murders with racial and ethnic overtones any hints of serial crimes linked to genetic cleansing any major changes in the policies of neonazi and nationalist groups and others who thought themselves superior quantity wasnt the problem plenty of information as democracy spread over europe more and more lunatics crawled out of their holes and gorged themselves on free speech but in the end he was left with no connections to the la murders nothing even close to a lead he cut his prayers short apologized to god wrapped up the tfillin and went into the small dark bathroom where he turned on the shower stripped and stepped in not waiting for the water to turn hot it took exactly two minutes fortyone seconds for the old pipes to kick in hed timed it yesterday arranged his morning schedule accordingly but this morning he endured the cold needles flogging himself for the futile night hed begun with heinzdietrich halzell at the berlin police whod informed him the racist presses continued to churn out the nasty stuff the moment the polizei got an injunction the slime just moved and started up again and stupid punks kept beating up turks and anyone else with a dark skin starting brawls desecrating graveyards apology in his voice deeply sorry the way only a german could be daniel had hosted him at a security conference in jerusalem last year a really decent guy but werent they always the ones who let themselves feel murders of retarded kids no heinzdietrich hadnt heard of anything like that dvll not in any of their files but hed ask around what was going on in la when daniel told him sketchily he sighed and said hed ask around seriously uri drori at the israeli embassy in berlin did some doublechecking and verified everything halzell had said daniel called him not because he didnt trust the german but because sometimes what you learned depended on who you were drori reported a slowly escalating rate of lowlevel incidents repeated almost word for word heinzdietrichs lament about the idiots popping up like toadstools it will never end dani the more democracy you have the more you get this shit but whats the alternative same story with bernard lamont in paris joop van gelder in amsterdam carlos velasquez in spain all the others no murders of defectives no dvll which didnt really surprise him these crimes seemed american though he couldnt explain why a wonderful country america huge and free and naive bighearted people always willing to grant the benefit of the doubt even after the trade center bombing you didnt see largescale antimuslim feelings the israeli embassy in new york tracked that kind of thing free country but what was the price last night taking a coffee break hed heard police sirens loud close looked out the same rear window and saw a helicopter circling low beaming down on backyards like some giant mantis scouting for prey his police scanner told him they were searching for an armedrobbery suspect holdup at beverly drive and pico a mile away right near zev carmelis place not far from the house on monte mar where laura had grown up her parents had sold it and bought two tiny condos beverly hills and jerusalem where they were now before hed left for the states his fatherinlaw had warned him be careful things have changed gene said total breakdown danny boy going to school can be hazardous to a kids health which was one reason gene had sold his big house in lafayette park heading for arizona no real reason for arizona except that it was warm and im not exactly worried about melanoma right gene looked old since luannes death his hair and mustache had turned snowwhite and his skin bagged an untimely death the poor woman had been only sixty when the massive stroke had knocked her to the floor of her kitchen gene discovering her another reason to sell the house high blood pressure a doctor friend of daniels told him blacks had more of it some said it was their diet others genetics his friend thought racism had a lot to do with it daniel understood that he couldnt count the times hed been called a dirty jew by arabs and because of his skin a nigger by all sorts of people when it happened he didnt react visibly but his heart pounded in his ears he wondered if gene was taking care of his diabetes cookies on the counter when hed gone there to pick up the ortiz file and the boys shoes said otherwise his friend had come through for him and daniel liked to think the favor had been good for gene too nothing but time on his hands poor guy hed called three times since returning the stuff offering to do whatever daniel needed but daniel wouldnt go to gene for any more favors the man was ill no reason to draw him in deeper if sturgis cooperated hed said he would but hard to tell sturgis would never score high on the trust index he stepped out of the shower just as the water warmed up dried off goosebumped amazed he hadnt felt any discomfort america democracy had begun in greece but its real home was here birthplace of official compassion too no country had been as kind as america now americans were paying for their compassion in driveby shootings the breakdown of rules and values childmurderers let out on parole same thing back home for all his countrys image as a tough little fighter state daniel knew israel as one big soft heart populated by survivors and rooters for the underdog with a reluctance to punish thats why victory doesnt sit well with us he thought why we end up the first country in history to voluntarily give back land won in battle in exchange for an illdefined peace with people who hate our guts hed watched during the intifada as the palestinian arabs made the most of israeli democracy staging rehearsed events masquerading as spontaneous shows of protest exaggerating the very real brutality of the occupation with hyperbole kids with rocks playing for the camera the press of course gobbled it up like a rich dessert day after day of photoop batontoskull and rubberbullet hailstorm broadcast worldwide while assad executed tens of thousands of potential enemies in syria and got maybe two lines of newsprint still who ever said life was fair hed rather live in a free society though sometimes and now he was thinking of elias daoud again resolutions tossed to the wind the gingerhaired christian arab from bethlehem had been his best homicide detective playing a major role in the butcher investigation never letting the dividedloyalties thing get in the way though it hadnt been easy no one but daniel had trusted him the closing of the butcher file got everyone on the team promotions but daouds had taken a bit more prodding of the pencil pushers daniel had been obdurate and finally daoud ended up a mefakeah southern divisions first arab inspector the raise in pay for a guy with seven kids had made it more than just another ribbon daoud was kept on daniels squad and daniel assigned him to the few nonpolitical homicide cases that came up old city gang stuff the drug and watermelon rackets nothing with any security overtones for daouds protection as well as for the brass daniel didnt want him branded a collaborator then the intifada heated up more rhetoric more audacity more violence the wall of fear broken down vermin scurrying through the rubble religious militancy found new life too and christians in bethlehem and nazareth and everywhere else christian remembered beirut and grew less vocal many of them bribing their way across the border to jordan and onward to families in europe and the states one morning in the midst of a serious investigation into the ramai gangs role in the hashish trade with daoud scheduled to give a progress report everyone waiting in a restaurant on king george street the guy didnt show right away daniel knew something was wrong the man was a walking wristwatch he dismissed the griping detectives called daouds house got a disconnected line the usual twentyminute drive to bethlehem took him less than fifteen before he got to the city outskirts he saw the military jeeps and the police ford escorts blue lights flashing people milling around the simmering feel of an impending riot he showed his badge and made his way past grim faces to daouds house police tape had been wrapped around the little limestone cube and chickens circled the muddy ditch that passed for a yard no more olivewood crucifix in daouds window when had that changed it had been a long time since daniel had been there now he realized what a sorry place it was objectively not much better than the hovel in yemen where daniels father had been born but the promotion had allowed daoud to finish payments on it the guy had been so proud the uniform at the door warned him not to go in for his own sake but he did anyway thinking of daoud the young fat wife daoud loved madly and plied with chocolates seven little kids the kids gone no one knew where months later daniel found out theyd somehow showed up with relatives in amman but that was as far as the information went daoud and the fat wife still here slaughtered like sheep for the market sliced trussed dismembered tongues severed the wife a leaking bag of yellow adipose eyes rolled back daoud castrated his penis hacked off the organ stuffed in his mouth hatchets the medical examiner said and long knives probably six or seven attackers a midnight blitz flies so many flies arabic scrawl on the wall in blood god is great death to collaborators he drove back to french hill kept his feelings to himself always constantly completely like the dead sea flat and bitter yielding nothing organic wanting to be dispassionate when he asked to run the investigation into the slaughter so his superiors would consider it of course they refused saying it was an arab issue he could never get close enough no one would talk to him he kept asking demanding got the same answer over and over refusing to give up knowing he was being an idiot he drove home each day with an inflamed belly and a raging headache the strain of smiling at laura and the kids just short of unbearable a case number was assigned to the daoud murders but no one seemed to be actually investigating he lost interest in his gang cases the ramais could sell dope for another few months big deal and if they shot each other no great loss he wrote memo after memo received no answer finally in laufers office after yet another dismissal he exploded at the commander is this what its come to he was an arab so its not worth the time and effort different values for different lives what are we nazi germany laufer had looked him up and down chainsmoking sleepy eyes full of contempt but he hadnt said a word daniels solving the butcher had gotten him kicked up from deputy commander who knew what other value the yemenite might have for him after that a few suspects were hauled in for questioning but it led nowhere the file was never closed never would be daniel thought from time to time of the savages whod done it dispatched from syria or lebanon or locals still living in bethlehem passing that house now demolished and really believing theyd shown god to be great and what of the seven kids who was raising them what had they been told that the jews had done it daddy and mommy martyrs to palestine the arabs loved martyrs after the intifada ended thered been a martyr shortage young guys with scraped feet or the flu claiming theyd gotten hurt fighting the zionists the virtue of suffering we their jewish cousins arent much different are we he thought though were a little more subtle about it democracy and now these american killings three homicides of children in three separate police districts delaware had a point about that spread out over a vast shapeless thing that calls itself a city retarded kids how could you get any crueler gene said they called them something else nowadays developmentally challenged nowadays everyones challenged danny boy short people are vertically challenged drunks are sobrietychallenged criminal scumbags are socially challenged socially challenged sounds more like someone shy gene thats the point my friend its not supposed to make sense a con game like that book change the names to confuse the good guys socially challenged so what does that make me on this case and sturgis and delaware solutionchallenged no just stuck seventhirty am i was at the doors to the biomed library when they opened barely awake showered but unshaven still tasting gulped coffee i worked for two hours finding only one reference to the group called meta but it was enough wireservice piece three years old carried locally by the daily news genius group editorial causes controversy new york opinions supporting selective breeding to improve genetic stock as well as mercy killing of the retarded published by an organization of selfdescribed geniuses have raised controversy among members of socialadvocacy organizations and put the group under an unaccustomed spotlight meta a littleknown manhattanbased club founded ten years ago to provide information about creativity and giftedness now finds itself accused of fascism the article under fire was written by meta director and attorney farley sanger in the pathfinder the groups quarterly newsletter in it sanger calls for a new utopia based upon objectively measured intellectual ability and questions the value of providing special education and other services including medical care to the developmentally disabled whom he labels meat without mentation sanger also suggests that those lacking the ability to reason and care for themselves are not fully human and thus do not merit constitutional protection under the law an effective socialpolicy analogue he argues would be animalprotection statutes just as sterilization and euthanasia are widely held to be humane policies for cats and dogs so should they be considered for those quasihuman organisms whose genetic makeup causes them to fall well short of the intellectual goalpost the article published several months ago without fanfare until it was brought to the attention of the press has generated a predictably hostile reaction from advocates for the mentally retarded this is fascism pure and simple said barry hannigan chairman of the child welfare society ugly stuff reminiscent of nazi germany margaret esposito director of the special children foundation an advocacy group for the retarded said weve worked so hard to erase the stigma associated with developmental delay only to see something like this come along i can only hope were talking about a fringe group and that reasonable people will see it for what it is similar sentiments were echoed by clergy social scientists and jurists reprehensible said monsignor william binchy of the manhattan archdiocese the church believes only god should play god the editor responsible for publishing the article in the pathfinder wall street securities analyst helga cranepool was unfazed by these comments admitting that sangers essay contained some pushtheenvelope phraseology and adventurous notions cranepool defended them on freespeech grounds and the right of our members to be exposed to a wide spectrum of opinions two characteristics of very bright people are a willingness to take reasonable risks and an unquenchable curiosity were not for everyone nor do we claim to be well continue to do everything in our power to stimulate and challenge ourselves through an unfettered exchange of ideas author sanger reached at his midtown law office refused to comment beyond saying the writing speaks for itself both he and cranepool declined to offer the names of other meta members with cranepool describing the group as small and selective we dont seek publicity the chairman of the manhattan chapter of the betterknown highiq group mensa laurence lanin described meta as one of our wackier imitators there are lots of them but they rarely endure he estimated meta membership at no more than a few dozen as with mensa sources say admittance to the group is based upon scores on a selfdesigned iq test mensa membership is based upon an upper percent score and meta is believed to be more selective when asked if mensa members shared sangers views lanin said i can only speak for myself but i find them repellent i photocopied the article and searched local phone books for meta listings none big surprise how did they recruit members mensa imitator the betterknown group was listed west la number no address a recording listed the time and address for the next meeting and said messages could be left after the beep i said my name is al and im an east coast transplant looking for info on meta are they out here and left my number next i reached milo at his desk just the one article he said thats it so maybe that was ponsicos club too maybe sharavi can find something on his computers youre going to call him he called me seven am gotta give him points for industriousness he said hed been working all night with the foreign police and israeli contacts zippo i think he was telling the truth i know that pissedoff tone of voice now that we have a name maybe he can pull something up ill arrange a meet at his place this afternoon but first ive got a lunch appointment with malcolm ponsicos first girlfriend sally the scientist more than eager to talk about zena the clerk shes working out in sherman oaks now near the burn center and im supposed to meet her at an italian place on ventura and woodman in the mood for pasta the stuff ive been reading lately has killed my appetite i said but the company sounds fine sally branch speared a piece of mussel from a nest of linguini and stared at it clinically she was thirtyone but had a teenagers eager nasal voice valley girl inflections overlaid on long articulate phrases thick wavy chestnut hair a broad plain freckled face brown eyes and a knockout figure enhanced by a black knit dress a white lab coat was draped over her chair she said malcolm was never a very communicative person but he got worse after he met her how long before his death did you have contact with him said milo a few days before we had lunch in the plasmoderm cafeteria she colored i saw him and sat down he seemed preoccupied but not depressed preoccupied by what his work i assume he was having work problems she smiled no on the contrary he was brilliant but every day something new comes up specific experiments milo smiled too youd have to be a scientist to understand well i dont know about that she ate the mussel i said so he never actually talked about something bothering him no but i could tell the breakup said milo was it friendly she swallowed and forced another smile is it ever really friendly he stopped calling i wanted to know why he wouldnt say then i saw him with her but i got over it i guess i kept thinking malcolm would come to his senses listen i know i sound like just another jealous woman but you need to understand that suicide would have been a totally illogical choice for malcolm his life was going great he never lost interest in his work and he liked himself malcolm was someone who truly liked himself good selfesteem said milo nothing obnoxious but he was brilliant and knew it he used to make wisecracks about winning the nobel prize but i knew it wasnt a total joke what was he researching i said cell permeability moving ions and chemical compounds of increasing complexity through cell walls without causing structural damage it was still at a theoretical level mouse cells but the practical potential was enormous getting drugs into cells without damage i said exactly drugs are basically cellularrepair agents malcolm was studying drugs that enhance tissue growth in burn patients he described it as playing with toy trains on a cellular level cellular repair like patching up defective chromosomes yes i suggested that to malcolm but he said hed stick to medications that it was possible inborn defects shouldnt be tinkered with whys that she looked at her plate malcolm was a bit stodgy a determinist he believed some things should be left alone healing burns was okay but genetic problems shouldnt be fixed something like that i dont want to make him sound unsympathetic he wasnt he was kind but extremely brilliant people are sometimes like that like what said milo snobs milo picked up a piece of garlic bread and ate it if he didnt commit suicide what do you think happened dr branch he was murdered detective connor said he had a wound on his forehead from falling but couldnt it also mean someone came from behind and slammed him down on the table then injected him with the potassium chloride any suspects in mind absolutely she said zena the only thing i cant figure out is why is she a large woman said milo no on the contrary shes tiny a real shrimp but coming from behind she could have compensated for that she coiled linguini around her fork she took malcolm from me but thats not why i suspect her shes a nasty little witch very taken with her image bad little girl when she worked at plasmoderm shed walk around with weird reading material magazines on bodypiercing serial killers those violent xrated alternative comics one time i saw her handing something to malcolm in the hall and went up to him later he showed it to me a photo of a man with a wire connecting his tongue to his penis piercing both it nauseated me what was malcolms reaction i said he said isnt that strange sally as in why would anyone do anything so foolish was he repulsed by it i said hed have had to be did he show his repulsion no malcolm rarely showed feelings she put the fork down this conversation is frustrating me hes coming across as an oddball and he wasnt he was just different because his iq was up in the ionosphere even at plasmoderm he stood apart zena lambert was a clerk at plasmoderm i said whod she work for the maintenance office keeping track of the janitors see what i mean not exactly intellectual stuff said milo her shoulders sagged ill never understand it what could malcolm have seen in her the only thing i can come up with is she was a good listener maybe i challenged him too much we used to have little debates about technical things social issues im an unapologetic liberal and as i said malcolm didnt have much patience for problems we debated all the time i thought he enjoyed it you think zena may have been submissive to him i said thats what doesnt make sense submissives the last thing youd call her at plasmoderm she had a reputation for being cheeky relating to the professional staff as if she were one of them she pushed away her plate now i sound like a snob too but the fact is zena was a file clerk who acted as if she had a doctorate insinuating herself into conversations she couldnt have really understood pretentious that sums her up better than anything intellectually pretentious yet malcolm became infatuated with her her eyelids quivered was there anything appealing about her i said i suppose you could think she was attractive in a contrived way she has a decent figure meet her judge for yourself where can we find her malcolm said she was working at a bookstore named spasm an amusing place he called it more bodypiercing said milo probably spasm does that tell you something was she fired from plasmoderm malcolm said she left when two weeks before malcolms death any idea why no her occupational history wasnt of very much interest to me i was glad she was gone she looked down at the table i guess i was hoping with her out of the immediate environment malcolm and i might reconnect was she at his funeral there was no funeral she said still studying the white linen malcolms parents had him shipped back home and they cremated him look i know you think the fact that she took him from me is coloring my opinion but the facts are clear she got her hooks into him and not long after he was dead for no good reason i said detective connor told us she got malcolm into some kind of highiq group meta people who thought mensa was for dummies malcolm went to a meeting with zena and joined up he said it was great even though the food was lousy and the wine was cheap to me it sounded like losers with nothing to do but talk about how smart they were what did malcolm like about it he said it was a pleasure to meet likeminded individuals but how selective could they have been zena was a member she smoothed her hair back and let it fall and the thick waves reverted to their original shape im glad someones finally looking into it maybe if malcolms parents had insisted it would have happened sooner but they didnt want to rake things up thats unusual said milo parents generally deny suicide youd have to know malcolms parents both are professors of physics at princeton dudley and annabelle ponsico hes mechanical shes particle theyre both geniuses malcolms sister is a physical chemist at mit and his brothers a mathematician at michigan were talking major gray matter in the lineage but none of them talk they just calculate you met them once last christmas they all visited and we had dinner at their hotel silent the person i spoke to after malcolms death was the father and he just said let it rest young lady malcolm has always been a moody boy a moody boy i said quaint she said but hes english maybe it was too soon after and they didnt want to hear about foul play i guess i was insensitive id read ponsicos file this morning both parents had been interviewed over the phone by petra connor both had been griefstricken saying only that malcolm had never done anything unexpected before but that he had been subject to mood swings since adolescence and at age fifteen had been treated for a year by a psychiatrist for sleep disturbance and depression things hed never told sally did anyone else from plasmoderm belong to meta said milo no one i know about why you suspect zena were trying to learn more about her well thats all i know would you like to see a picture of malcolm before we could answer she produced a color snapshot from her handbag she and a tall young redhaired man in a rose garden she wore a sundress a big straw hat and sunglasses and stood with her arm around malcolm ponsicos waist he was well over six feet narrowshouldered slightly overweight the red hair was curly and thinning and he wore a ginger abe lincoln beard with no mustache he had on a red polo shirt and brown slacks and had the loosemuscled stance of someone with no use for mirrors she was grinning his expression was noncommittal we took this at the huntington library an exhibit on thomas jeffersons scientific letters milo gave her back the picture those letters on malcolms computer screen dvll mean anything to you probably some devil reference that she put there thats exactly the kind of thing she would have gone for she was into satanism too it wouldnt surprise me the salient point here is she stole him and got him involved in whoknowswhat and soon after he was dead im not a paranoid person gentlemen but the facts speak for themselves ask anyone who knows me my reputation is for being dependable levelheaded rational her fingers twisted around one another perhaps thats the problem i was too rational perhaps if id yelled and kicked and put up a fuss when she went for him instead of standing back and assuming malcolm would come to his senses he would have understood how i really felt about him perhaps if id emoted hed still be alive she thanked us for listening put her lab coat on and left the restaurant woman scorned said milo and ponsico had mood problems even his parents didnt doubt the suicide without dvll and that meta article you found i wouldnt spend another second on it some pattern weve got i said retarded kids and a genius with no sympathy for the genetically impaired the only link i can see to our murders is ponsico learned something at meta that made him a threat the killer chitchatting too explicitly about his plans and ponsicos contempt for the unfortunate didnt extend to homicide dr sallys convinced this zena was the killer but zenas tiny and that part about her surprising ponsico from behind is nonsense the wound would have hurt but a big guy like that could have fought her off easily so if he was murdered it was by someone strong just like our kids what about zena and someone else a killing team why not were entertaining all kinds of fantasies but the only strike against this girl is the other girl hates her guts somewhere down the line though she may turn out useful as an entrée to meta he nodded meantime lets see what our israeli friend has to offer in the daylight sharavis house was shabby when he came to the door he was closeshaved and neatly dressed cup of tea in his hand mint sprig floating on top i became aware of my own stubbled face he looked out at the street and let us in the tea gave off steam may i offer you some milo said no thanks hope your computers working we walked to the back room the pc was on a screensaving pink hexagon dancing on the black screen sharavi had arranged two folding chairs in the middle of the carpet the velvet bag for his prayer equipment was gone milo showed him the article about farley sangers meta editorial and told him about malcolm ponsico he pulled up to the workstation and began punching keys using a onehanded huntandpeck that was faster than i would have believed the bad hand rested on his lap an inert hunk of flesh i watched data bank after data bank flash and disappear after a while he said if this group has done something criminal none of the major agencies knows about it ill check academic bases the keyword meta brought up hundreds of irrelevant topics from university data stations metaanalysis in philosophy scores of chemical compounds references to metabolism metallurgy metamorphosis when wed waded through all of it he said lets try the internet its become an international trash can but who knows lets try the phone first said milo new york information for meta sharavi smiled good point he dialed information waited hung up no listing maybe i said the publicity about sangers article drove them out of business could be said sharavi though hates a hot commodity it could also drum up more business shall i try the internet now using a coded password he hooked into an online network id never heard of no cute graphics or chat lines just stark black letters on white screen several seconds passed and he sat there without moving or blinking welcome r van rijn flashed rembrandts surname had the israeli police assigned him the moniker or did he fancy himself an artist a brown hand flew nimbly over the keyboard and within seconds he was webcrawling another flood of unrelated topics an entomologist in paris doing research on a larva called metacercaria a holistic healer in oakland promising to cure aches of the metacarpal bones twenty minutes later he stopped suggestions try mensa said milo metas an imitator meaning theres probably some hostility between the groups maybe some mensa faithful wants to express feelings sharavi swiveled around attacking the keyboard plenty on mensa he said we watched him scroll slowly through page after page times and places for mensa meetings around the world mensarelated topics a similar organization in london calling itself limey scumdogs discussing its favorite things members with nicknames the sharp kidd sugar baby buffalo bob listing bad puns strong coffee and dialectics debates from hell cuddles and housebroken afghan hounds and so on some of the notations were in foreign languages and sharavi seemed to be reading them what was that said milo pointing as sharavi skipped one dublin mensa probably gaelic more scrolling a realestate broker in fond du lac wisconsin advertising his services and listing mensa membership as a job qualification same for a personnel manager in chicago a dental hygienist in orlando florida an engineer in tokyo dozens more unemployment hadnt spared the top of the bell curve next came an iq measurement section several writers all men displaying questions from intelligence scales quickie tests the type featured in knowyouriqpaperbacks most selections were followed by variations of the assertion that this is an extremely rigorous set of questions constructed to show a stratospherically high level of intelligence the punchline roberts iq horaces iq keiths iq charless iq some pages had accompanying artwork einsteins face was a favorite all with click here to see my score boxes sharavis clicks brought up graphs with little stars for robert and horace and keith and charles and all in the plus range such smart people said sharavi so much free time weenieland said milo send em applications to the get a life club sharavi moved through several more pages with no success the information age said milo you spend lots of time doing this less and less said sharavi hand continuing to move when the internet began it was more valuable as an investigative tool professors talking to professors scientific data agencies communicating now theres too much to wade through for the little you get it seems to have become one big chatroom for lonely people he turned and looked at me i suppose that serves a purpose doctor keep going said milo after two more hours of viewing we had nothing i assume youve already looked up dvll i told sharavi that and all the hate groups who run bulletin boards no progress im afraid what about a different keyword i said galton sterilization eugenics euthanasia he typed sterilization brought up more references to foodsafety than castration and most of the discussions of eugenics were glorified personal ads i hereby splay my dna out on the platter of public scrutiny women desiring choice nucleic protein are cordially invited to apply sharavi printed it all out anyway page after page landing in the bin silently from time to time milo got up removed sheets scanned them put them back at fivethirty he said enough they obviously keep a low profile we could act rather than just react said sharavi emailing something about meta into some of the data banks and see what turns up can you be sure your identitys totally protected said milo no i change passwords and addresses regularly but you can never be sure then no not yet i dont want to alert anyone i already did that with my call to mensa i said describing the message id left milo said no big deal but i could tell he was bothered and i felt like an amateur he turned to sharavi any other insights ponsicos suicide despite the lack of evidence it does sound irregular using poison for starters poisoners tend to be women right ponsico was a scientist true said sharavi which leads me to another issue as a scientist hed know what to expect potassium chloride causes a quick death but its far from painless sudden cardiac arrhythmia a severe heart attack when you execute criminals with it you add sodium pentothal for presedation and pancurium bromide to stop breathing couldnt ponsico have chosen an easier death for himself maybe he was punishing himself said milo thought he deserved cruel and unusual guilt i said thinking again of nolan over what maybe hed played a part in something really nasty our killings or something else or maybe he was just a guy with mood swings who ended up profoundly depressed in the lab and just happened to have access to poison and even if he did make things rougher on himself than he had to it was still relatively fast and clean helluva lot better than some of the stuff ive seen people do to themselves right superintendent daniel said sharavi yes thats true selfhatred can be an amazing thing but i guess id like to learn more about this young man ill call his parents said milo the professors in princeton maybe some of his other coworkers at plasmoderm its a biomedical company skin research ponsico was working on improving the success of skin grafts why you see some sort of work connection no said sharavi though i suppose if there was a dissatisfied customer someone whose graft didnt take but no they would have poisoned the surgeon not the researcher no i have no ideas he drank tea and put the cup down i have good sources in new york if meta does exist theyll be able to find out we could also tap zena lamberts line forget it weve got no grounds for any kind of warrant let alone a tap on the off chance shes connected to anything i dont want to screw up the evidentiary chain good point dont even think about it said milo of course said sharavi i mean it i realize that the bookstore zena works in i said spasm an offbeat name so maybe its a meeting place for people with offbeat ideas there could be a bulletin board maybe with a posting by meta no phone listing but they announce meetings at a store said milo an outoftheway store that attracts the target audience want me to drop in and look around he rubbed his face let me think about it i want to get the most out of anything we do sharavi got up and stretched raising both arms above his head the bad hand dangling im getting more tea are you sure you wouldnt like some the mints fresh i found a big patch growing out in back sure i said thanks when he was gone milo scowled at the computer garbage in garbage out so whats with the arafat look alex scratch that in view of present company the porcupine look i rushed over to the library didnt take the time to shave thats half a days worth i nodded taking those testosterone pills again i flexed a bicep and grunted and he gave a tired smile sharavi came back with the tea scalding slightly sweet the mint flavor gliding above the heat as i sipped i used one of the phones to call my service hi doctor theres just one a loren bukovsky from looks like mensa though it says here he asked for al the girl a new one tried to tell him different but he insisted you were al you do get some strange ones dr delaware but thats your business right right what did mr bukovsky have to say lets see sorry this new one has terrible penmanship it looks like he was no he has nothing to do with mela or meta something like that anyway he wants nothing to do with mela or whatever um but if you have the sorry doctor this isnt very polite what does it say joyce if you have the poor taste to want to looks like fraternatize with idiots go to a place called looks like spastic but he doesnt leave an address very strange even for you dr delaware thats all of it he also said dont call back hes not interested in you how rude huh very i said but maybe hes got his reasons strong opinions said milo writing down bukovskys name and now its out that were looking into meta sorry but at least we know the bookstores worth looking into he turned to sharavi how about using some of that illegal dmv access on mr bukovsky and ms lambert sharavi put his mug down and faced the computer moments later loren a bukovsky an address on corinth avenue los angeles west los angeles said milo minutes from the station might as well pay him a visit when should i visit spasm i said let me check out bukovsky first sharavi said if bukovsky has something interesting to say perhaps dr delaware can do more than just drop in at spasm such as if meta still holds meetings he could try to attend who better than a phd he could pose as someone interested in forget it said milo sharavi blinked but didnt move otherwise all right and dont think about going yourself superintendent sharavi smiled me i lack the qualifications the same goes for any of your people my people put it out of your mind no undercover operations that i dont know about all right all right just like that huh just like that saying it in a nearwhisper but for the first time the israeli was showing emotion the faintest tightening around the golden eyes a twitch along the jawline im doing my best to cooperate he said softly im a skeptic and a pessimist said milo when things go too smoothly it worries me sharavis jaw relaxed and he brought up a smile mechanically as if evoking data from the computer shall i make your life difficult then milo why break a trend sharavi shook his head im going to eat he left the room again and milo thumbed absently through the printout in the bin ill try to interview bukovsky today and call ponsicos parents i just hope this whole ponsico thing hasnt gotten us too far afield he got up and paced the house was small and i could hear sharavi working in the kitchen if i visit the bookstore i said i could sound out the lambert woman see if i can get her to talk about meta alex in an unobtrusive way even if the killers a meta member that doesnt make the whole group a homicidal cabal and if i did get into a meeting and was able to look them all over delete the thought alex why why do you think because sharavi suggested it he whipped around glaring ten points off for a very bad guess hey i said im brutally frank cause i care he started to retort dropped his shoulders laughed look at this im trying to protect you and youre dissing me you think its a smart idea hobnobbing with a group of genetic snobs one of whom could be a goddamn serial killer i dont think attending one meeting is going to put me in danger he didnt answer also i said i think sharavis involvement still bothers you to the point where you run the risk of throwing the baby out he rubbed his face hard and fast this is great him on one side and you on the other for all i know hes got this goddamn room bugged okay ill shut up sorry he grimaced laughed again circled the room what the hell am i doing here yeah yeah youre right having to deal with him does piss me off i dont like too many layers he shoved his arms in front of him breaststroking air like suffocating under a dozen blankets sure i said but unless some progress is made on the killings you run the risk of a dozen more blankets as in task force what is this tough love its for your own good sonny boy dr castor oil you really want to play secret agent dont you couple of days with mr mossad and youre itching for code names and fountainpen cameras thats me i said agent doubleoshrink license to interpret sharavi returned with a sandwich on a cheap plastic plate tuna and lettuce on egg bread very little tuna he put the plate down next to the phones his face said he had no appetite i have two police scanners the one in the kitchen was on a call just went out on one of your tactical bands central division homicide detectives calling in a dead body in an alley a cutting its probably unrelated but next to the body was a white cane i thought you should know picking up the sandwich he took a small decisive bite daniel watched the two of them drive away through a slit in the livingroom drapes hed kept up a bland front during the meeting taken things in given very little out could delaware see through it the psychologist seemed more agreeable but with psychologists you never knew another meeting how many had he attended over the years leaving with those same feelings of frustration like sturgis he preferred working alone like sturgis he was seldom able to coating himself with the veneer of reason when he itched to be as negative as sturgis dead children he seldom showed his feelings to anyone even laura sobbing about daoud and his fat wife twice both times alone in the cool dark privacy of a tiny cavelike yemenite synagogue near the mahane yehudah market an empty synagogue because hed chosen the dead time between the morning shaharit service and the afternoon minhah reciting a few psalms returning home that evening presentable for laura and the children why expose them to even a hint of the pain the bethlehem hatchet wielders would never be punished not in this world anyway now this irit the other kids maybe a blind man what could be more hideous would this meta thing lead anywhere probably not one walked the desert sands sank shafts hoped for oil so he and sturgis were probably feeling similar emotions hey lets have a discussion group like the ones the department organized when a sapper got blown up or one of the undercover guys took a knife in a back alley of the old city daniel could just see it sturgis and him sitting in a circle each daring the other to be human delaware in the middle the what was the word the facilitator sturgis grumbling an illmannered bear that one but smart zev carmeli was feeling better about the guy like most diplomats zev didnt forgive forced to put on a polite front all day he was judgmental essentially a misanthrope daniel remembered the call guess who theyve given me now sharavi a homosexual daniel had sat in a rear room of the new york embassy listening as carmeli complained carmeli reiterating his opinions of the moronic la police a homosexual he repeated who he screws is his own damn business but it makes him an outcast so how can he possibly be effective i ask for the one with the highest solve rate and this is who they give me you think theyre playing with you what do you think this is some city sharavi every group hates the other like beirut or jerusalem thought daniel maybe he is the best zev why dismiss him before you know silence you said carmeli a guy with a yarmulke and you approve of that kind of thing if hes the one with the highest solve rate and the right kind of experience then youre doing well im surprised sharavi about what such tolerance the orthodox arent known for their tolerance daniel didnt respond well said carmeli thats why im calling you you come out here and check things out whatever it takes if you say keep him on i will but ultimately its your responsibility then hed hung up poor zev years ago theyd both been students at hebrew u daniel a twentyfiveyearold senior with three years of army experience zev younger one of the few whizzes exempted out because of high test scores and family connections even then zev had been serious for his age and openly ambitious but you could talk to him have a discussion not anymore the man had lost a daughter daniel knew about fathers and daughters zev could be forgiven just about anything alone in the house he finished his sandwich though it might as well have been dust on plywood then phoned an attorney in new york who received half of his income from the embassy and asked him to quietly investigate meta and fellow lawyer farley sanger the one whod written that retarded people werent human two more hours at the computer earned him nothing but a sore hand carpal tunnel the police doctor at french hill had announced if you dont watch out youll have no hands ice it and dont use it so much expert advice daniel had suppressed laughter and left the examining room wondering what it would be like to have no hands at pm he drove to a kosher market on pico and stocked up on groceries putting on his yarmulke in order to blend in the woman at the register said shalom and he felt more at home than he had since arriving at ten he called laura in jerusalem she said darling i couldnt wait to hear from you the children want to speak to you too his heart soared bodys zipped almost ready to go said the central homicide detective your basic frenzied cutting his name was bob pierce and he was in his fifties thick in the middle with wavy gray hair a big jaw and a chicago accent on the way over milo told me hed once been a top solver was two months from retirement now thinking only about idaho this evening he seemed resigned and stoic but his fingers gathered and released the bottom hem of his suit jacket pinching letting go pinching he stood with us on fourth street at the mouth of the alley between main and wall as the crimescene crew worked under portable floodlights the lights were selective and the filthy strip lined with dumpsters sported strange blotchy shadows a rottenproduce smell poured out to the street working alone today bob said milo bruce has the flu so whats your interest in our alleged felony cold case of mine a retarded kid so im looking into any s with handicapped vics well this one was handicapped coroner said his eyes were clearly nonfunctional atrophied sclera or something like that probably born blind yours black no this one is any id said milo lots pierce pulled out his notepad medical card a few other things next to the body along with his wallet all the money gone he put on halfglasses and flipped pages melvin myers black male twentyfive home address on stocker avenue he closed the pad and turned to watch the techs stockers the crenshaw district said milo dont know what he was doing here but one of the uniforms said theres a school for the disabled not far from here off la street near the garment outlets ill find out tomorrow if myers was a student what happened to him walking through the alley got stabbed from behind about ten times with a big knife then ten more times in the front overkill said milo ill say pierces hands worked faster at his hem can you imagine unable to see it just feeling it this is some socalled alleged civilization were allegedly living in he directed the last words at me staring as hed done off and on since being introduced was it my unshaven face or the fact that milo had introduced me as a consultant milo said any estimates when it happened bob sometime late in the afternoon me said the body was pretty fresh who discovered him one of our patrol cars hows that for something new they were rolling up the alley saw a leg sticking out from behind one of the dumpsters at first they figured him for a crackhead who fell asleep and got out to roust him late afternoon said milo working hours pretty risky not if youre a nobrain sociopath and he got away with it didnt he pierce gave a sour look the thing is even though its working hours this particular alleys been pretty quiet lots of the buildings on wall are vacant and for the most part the people who work either on main or wall stay out of it because it used to be a crack market the only citizens who do go in there are the janitors who take the garbage to the dumpsters milo peered down the alley the dumpsters give good cover you bet one after the other like rows of shacks reminds me of those little green houses in monopoly so its not a crack market anymore not this week policy order from headquarters mayor says get a handle on qualityoflife offenses lets make our downtown a real downtown so we can pretend were living in a real city hq says knock the dope rate down pronto but without any additional personnel or patrol cars which is about as likely as oj feeling remorse the way it plays out is we up patrol for one alley the crackheads move to another like parcheesi bumping and moving everyone goes in circles how often are the patrols a few times a day pierce pulled out a pack of mints obviously not at the right time for poor mr myers helluva place for a blind guy to get lost in lost said milo what else unless he was a crackhead himself looking for something recreational didnt know the actions three alleys over but im choosing innocent til proven guilty unless i learn different at this point he got lost i thought blind guys had a good sense of direction said milo and if he went to school around here youd think hed know about the neighborhood be extra careful what can i tell you said pierce another glance back well there it goes coroners attendants lifted a black body bag onto a gurney as the wheels moved over the ravaged asphalt the car rattled milo said one second bob strode over said something to the attendants and waited as they unzipped the bag so youre consulting pierce said to me ive got a daughter at cal state wants to be a psychologist maybe work with kids milos voice made us both turn hed walked past the coroners station wagon was standing near the east wall of the alley halfconcealed by a dumpster the visible slice of his bulk whitened by a floodlight pierce said what now he and i went over the chalk outline of melvin myerss body had been drawn unevenly on the pitted tar rightangled folded i could see where his foot had stuck out the oily rust of bloodstains all around a pothole in the center of the outline created a symbolic wound milo pointed at the wall his eyes were bright cold satisfied but enraged the red brick was blackened by decades of smog and grease and garbage distillate a mad jumble of obscene graffiti i saw nothing but defacement same with pierce he said what milo walked to the wall stooped put his finger near something just inches from where the brick met the floor of the alley behind the spot where melvin myerss head would have rested in death pierce and i got closer the garbage stench was overpowering milos fingertip pointed at four white letters maybe half a handbreadth tall white chalk just like the body outline but fainter block letters printed neatly dvll that mean something said pierce it means ive complicated your life bob pierce put on his reading glasses and pushed his big jaw up to the letters not exactly permanent usually the idiots use spray paint it didnt need to be permanent i said the main thing was to deliver the message milo gave pierce more details as we returned to fourth street different mos different divisions for each one said the central detective some piece of crap playing games thats what it looks like whore the other ds hooks and mclaren in southwest manny alvarado in newton and we just picked one up that doesnt fit except for a dvll link thats hollywoods di named petra connor works with stu bishop dont know her said pierce one day bishops gonna be chief why isnt he in on it on vacation so whatre we talking about some coordinated effort nothing to coordinate so far said milo weve just been trading info and not much of it gorobich and ramos did the whole crimescene thing with the fbi and didnt get much either leaving out one particular detective pierce clicked his upper teeth against his lowers perfect teeth dentures what do you want me to do here hey bob far be it from me to tell you what to do why not my wife does and her mother and my daughters and everyone else with a mouth okay what im gonna do tonight is write this up as a committed during a robbery then ill try to see if mr myers has a family and a drug record if theres a family i make that call if not i visit the trade school tomorrow see if he was a student take it from there pierce smiled if im feeling really nasty i call bruce at midnight and tell him hey guess what youll probably still be working on when im fishing at hayden lake trying to figure out which of my neighbors is an aryan nations nutcase and which one just hates people on general principle would it traumatize you said milo if i try to find out about myers tonight run him through the files maybe check out the school the schools closed maybe theyve got an offhours number someone who can confirm he was a student tell us something about him pierces eyes seemed to twinkle but the rest of his face expressed nothing insomniac ive been living with this one for a while bob yeah go ahead why not you can call the family too and while youre at it take my dog to the vet to get his anal glands squeezed forget it dont mean to muscle in hey im kidding go ahead do what you want ive got fortyeight days left before i trade smog for nazis and no way am i gonna finish this one by then just keep me cued in from time to time i need straight paper he faced me this is police work in action enjoying the consulting so far driving away i said theres no way anyone else would have noticed those letters a message but a private one he twisted the wheel drove to sixth street hung a sharp left and headed west racing through the dark downtown streets the only people visible were living out of shopping carts mug a blind guy fake a robbery he said telling us look how goddamn clever i am press here for my score he rolled up onto the freeway learn anything from the body i said not really the poor guy was hashed so much for neat and clean i said so much for mercy killing hes picked up the pace and increased the violence level and the risk level broad daylight he may think hes got a serious philosophy but hes just another psychopath whats really picked up is his confidence level alex he has no idea we even know whats going on and with carmelis gag order we cant flush him out though what kind of warning could we issue anyone with a dark skin and a disability is a potential victim just what this city needs anyone with dark skin and a disability plus malcolm ponsico who joined a group that just might believe handicapped people arent human myerss death says we need to get closer to meta milo and why not use the fact that the killer doesnt know were on to him as an advantage ill go to the bookstore see if theyve got a bulletin board check out zena lambert maybe i can get invited to the next meta party we were going eightyfive on the now he passed under the bridge at the crenshaw exit if lambert turns out to be a literal femme fatale chatting her up could be more than just a social thing femme fatale i said so now you like the idea of a boygirl killer team at this point im not dismissing anything a collaboration could explain some of the diversity in mo two selfrated geniuses getting together to play human chess she serves as a lure he steps in and does the heavy lifting so when do i go to spasm thought you hated parties sometimes im more social than others we stopped for coffee at a fastfood stand on la cienega where i called robin and told her thered been another murder and id be late my god another retarded child a blind man oh alex im sorry it might be a while yes of course how did it happen fake mugging i said downtown i heard her inhale sharply do what you have to do but wake me when you get in if im asleep it was after eleven by the time we returned to sharavis house he took a while to answer the door had clearly been sleeping but he did his best to hide it the gold eyes were redrimmed he wore a plain white tshirt and green cotton athletic shorts as he ushered us in he revealed his good hand and the blackmatte pistol dangling from it plastic said milo glock no a smaller manufacturer sharavi slipped the weapon into a pocket of the shorts so the blind man was part of it milo told him what wed learned and we returned to the computer room moments later we learned that melvin a myers had no criminal record and had received various forms of public assistance for most of his life no family lets try the school said milo central city skills center unsurprisingly no one answered and sharavi played with data banks for a while finally locating a twoyearold article on the school in the los angeles times the director at that time had been a woman named darlene grosperrin at least its not smith said milo look her up he was sitting on the edge of his folding chair moving in rhythm with sharavis onehanded stabs at the keyboard unaware of the harmony sharavi complied yes here it is dmv darlene grosperrin amherst street brentwood milos long arm shot forward as he grabbed the phone and dialed he barked listened wrote down the number grosperrin d no first name no address but how many of those can there be heres what you get for your trusting nature ms g a midnight call he punched numbers again darlene grosperrin this is detective milo sturgis of the los angeles police department sorry to call this late pardon maam no no not your daughter sorry to scare you maam its about one of the students at the skills center a gentleman named melvin a myers no maam unfortunately hes not okay he put the phone down ten minutes later top student she says and not retarded smart one of their best trainees could type over one hundred fifty words a minute on the computer he was due to graduate in a few months she was sure hed get a job he rubbed his face she was pretty broken up couldnt tell me what hed been doing in the alley sometimes he ate dinner downtown before heading back to crenshaw but thered be no reason for him to wander in there and he was pretty good with that cane knew the street layout so he was lured i said what about family none lucky for bob pierce myers has been living alone for the last five years since his mother died apparently she sheltered him and after she was gone he decided to pull himself together first he took some training at the braille center then he enrolled at the school theyve got an eighteenmonth computer program and he was acing it the address on stocker is a statefinanced group home sharavi removed the blackmatte pistol and placed it next to the computer a blind man my contact back east called me while you were gone hes found nothing on meta in new york but the lawyer who wrote that article in the pathfinderfarley sanger is still practicing at the same wall street firm the editor that woman stock analyst helga cranepool is still working at her job too neither of them comes up in lexis so sanger doesnt go to court on important cases my source says the firm does estate planning for rich people what kind of car does he drive said milo what kind of shampoo does he use mercedes station wagon one year old ill try to find out about the shampoo and if he uses cream rinse milo laughed sharavi said the mercedes is registered in connecticut sangers got a home in darien and an apartment on east sixtyninth street hes fortyone years old married has two children a boy and a girl no record of criminal activity so sangers being watched for a while i also looked up zena lambert the bookstore clerk no criminal record for her either shes twentyeight years old lives on rondo vista street in silverlake the bookstores nearby she has a mastercard but rarely uses it last year she earned eighteen thousand dollars he smiled ill check into her haircare as well you surveilling her too said milo not without your agreement how long are you planning to surveil sanger long as necessary in view of his belief that retarded people are what was the phrase dr delaware meat without mentation i said meat without mentation it seems a good idea maybe hell do something that tells us more about the group on both coasts speaking of coasts any chance of accessing his travel records said milo corporate lawyers fly back and forth all the time nice cover good idea said sharavi ill do it tomorrow when offices open in new york in view of myerss murder i did call all the major hotels here in la just to check if sangers registered and hes not but he could be traveling under a different name thanks for all the work sharavi shrugged what next ive got an appointment to meet with mrs grosperrin tomorrow morning see if i can learn more about myers why he was lured as opposed to some other student for one he was black i said every single victim except ponsico was nonanglo a racist eugenicist said sharavi the two have generally gone together a look at the books spasm sells might give us some information something tells me the place doesnt specialize in childrens literature when do i go sharavis eyebrows rose milo told him he wants to play superspy i blame you are you thinking of going as yourself doctor i wasnt planning to show id then maybe you should take alternative id sharavi turned to milo its the kind of thing i could be helpful with undercover hoohah said milo for his protection if hes up for a bit of roleplaying talking about me in the third person sharavi gave me an appraising look youve already made progress on a beard at that point something in the room changed milo and sharavi found several points of agreement undercover work was serious business temporary dissociation sharavi called it were talking a visit to a bookstore i said a visit that could lead to something doctor you need to be extremely careful from the start meaning go as someone else get comfortable being someone else fine and said milo you need robins okay on this dont you think this is a little no alex i dont what will probably happen is youll go there look at some weird books come home even if you do hook up with meta it could deadend maybe theyre just weenies but daniel and i both know police works ninetynine percent boredom one percent panic at the unexpected we are dealing with a person who stabbed a blind man in the back he asked sharavi how long would it take you to get him false papers half a day said the israeli for drivers license credit cards social security i can also get him clothes if thats necessary and a car the address on the id said milo bogus or real real is better i know of a place in the valley thats available right now but i may also be able to find one in the city just cover or actual use in the event of a prolonged roleplay he could use it milo turned to me what if you need to move for a while alex are you ready for that hard voice i knew what he was thinking the last time id relocated the move had been coerced running from the psychopath whod burned my house down i assume were not talking longterm probably days not weeks said milo but what about patients no active ones i said since helena dahl had dropped out i thought of her brother another highiq suicide what about old patients in crisis i can always check in with my service most of what ive got is paperwork reports due good said sharavi so far your lifestyle seems to fit this nicely milo frowned they both gave me more rules in order to avoid accidental slipups i needed to use a false name similar to my real one and a personal history that grew out of my own a psychologist but not one in active practice said milo nothing traceable how about someone who attended psychology graduate school but dropped out before finishing i said abd all but dissertation dropped out for what reason personality conflicts i said he was too smart for them so they messed him up during his dissertation my instinct is thats a metacompatible profile why because people who spend lots of time talking and thinking about how smart they are generally dont accomplish much milo considered that and nodded so far so good he asked sharavi yes but you should start thinking in terms of you doctor not he okay i said they messed me up because i threatened them my research threatened them the genetics of iq politically incorrect no said milo too close too cute i agree said sharavi these people may not be as smart as they think they are but they arent stupid you cant come in there agreeing with them too strongly exactly said milo way i see it you need to show casual curiosity but not jump on their bandwagon if it goes that far okay i said feeling vaguely foolish im essentially an antisocial guy dont trust groups so im not itching to join any new ones my research was on how about sexrole stereotypes and childrearing patterns i did some work on that in grad school then i switched to hospital work and never published so theres no connection in writing sharavi wrote something down fine said milo go on i ran out of money the department wouldnt support me because i refused to play the game and what game said sharavi interdepartmental politics thats also something i can talk about with authority when did all this happen said milo ten years ago what school how about an unaccredited program one thats gone out of business during the eighties there were plenty of them i like that said sharavi he glanced at milo who grunted assent ill find one and create some paper for you seeing as your print shops that good said milo how about some twentydollar bills sharavi waved at the dismal little room how do you think i finance such luxury milo chuckled turned serious speaking of financing howve you supported yourself since dropping out mr all but dissertation family money i said a small inheritance just enough to get by but no luxuries yet another reason for my frustration im brilliant too good for my station in life do you work nope still searching for something fulfilling your basic la slacker they both nodded so whats my name i said how close should i get close enough to make it easy to remember said milo but not so close that you use the real one by mistake allan i said allan del something delvecchio i could pass for italian no said milo lets keep ethnicity out of this they may not like ethnics of any kind and i dont want you to have to fake some conversation about mamas gnocchi recipe how about delbert delham or just plain dell allan dell he said sounds phony and too close arthur dell albert andrew i said andy what about desmond said milo like the old biddy in sunset boulevard andy desmond can you live with it i repeated it to myself several times sure but now i expect a big house daniel sorry said sharavi there are limits andrew desmond said milo wouldbe psychologist mr would be so can we get papers tomorrow we could but i suggest we hold off for a few days why to give alex a chance to get comfortable with the role and to let that beard grow do you wear contact lenses no good i can supply glasses with clear lenses its surprising how effective they can be and you might consider a haircut a short one those curls are a little conspicuous a buzz robins gonna love that said milo if its a problem its no problem i said silence fine then said sharavi lets hear more about you andrew tell me about your childhood a glance at milo i always wanted to say that to a psychologist the next morning i told robin she said nothing then and it has to be you if you really dont no she said if i stopped you it would be if something else happened that could have been prevented id never forget that youre sure they can keep you safe its just a visit to a bookstore just a visit browsing the shelves huh robin she gripped my arm be careful i guess im saying it more for myself than for you her fingers loosened she kissed me and went to the studio i called my service told them id be out of town for a week on vacation would call in regularly somewhere nice i hope dr delaware said the operator somewhere very private that evening daniel sharavi called and asked if he could bring over some of my new id at ten does milo know i just spoke to him hes briefing the other detectives on melvin myers hell come by while im there fine when he showed up carrying a black vinyl satchel robin and i were in the living room playing hearts and she got up to get the door we rarely played cards her idea i made the introductions robin knew about the breakin and the bugging but she smiled evenly and shook sharavis hand i heard the dog door slam shut then spikes minigallop across the kitchen floor he raced into the living room snorting and panting stopping several feet from sharavi he tightened his neck muscles and growled robin stooped and tried to calm him spike barked and wouldnt stop whats the matter handsome he doesnt like me said sharavi i dont blame him when i was here i had to put him in the bathroom for a few minutes robins smile withered im sorry ms castagna i used to have a dog of my own cmon handsome well let them do business spike followed her back into the kitchen youre still willing to do this he said any reason i shouldnt be sometimes people get enthusiastic then they reconsider and ms castagna shes fine with it we sat down and he placed the satchel on the table ive learned more about the new york lawyer farley sanger his last trip to los angeles was two weeks before irits murder he stayed at the beverly hills hotel and as far as we can tell conducted business for his firm so far weve got no records of his being back since but those kinds of things can be hidden he removed papers still no trace of meta after the publicity from sangers article the group either dissolved or went underground when it was active the meetings were held in a building on fifth avenue a very exclusive building and this particular suite houses the loomis foundation a charitable group started by a wealthy louisiana farming family over one hundred years ago a relatively small foundation from what we can tell last year they gave out less than three hundred thousand dollars onethird went to a psychological study of twins in illinois another third to agricultural research and the rest to various scientists conducting genetic studies did the twin research have a genetic bent also the researchers a professor of comparative biology at a small college these are the data he handed me a stapled reprint the journal was proceedings of the loomis foundation the title homogeneity of traits and longitudinal patterns of encoded behavior in monozygotic twins separated at birth loomis sounds familiar what do they farm tobacco alfalfa cotton the loomis family prided itself on its geneology links to european nobility that kind of thing prided i said theyre no longer around the family name died out but a few cousins remain and they run the business and the foundation no new cash has been added to the principal for years is there any record of their funding meta not so far but the fact that meta used their office says something and controversy from sangers article could attract unwanted attention exactly so maybe thats why the group was disbanded or moved to la i said loomis one sec i went into my office and pulled the brain drain from a shelf the author bio on the back flap arthur haldane phd resident scholar the loomis institute new york city i brought it back to sharavi oh he said i bought the book yesterday havent gotten around to reading it so theres an institute in addition to the foundation maybe other money you didnt trace he turned the book over opened it and inspected the table of contents may i use your phone he made a callingcard connection spoke briefly in hebrew hung up returned to the table a bestseller i said if any of the royalties were returned to loomis that kills their taxfree status with their cash depletion they might have been willing to take the risk both sanger and that securities analyst helga cranepool work in financial fields her specialtys farm commodities loomiss product i said assuming they still farm oh they do he said not in america overseas cotton hemp jute alfalfa and other feeds various packing materials they own plantations in asia and africa id assume because of the lower wages oh for them mintjulep days i said does the foundation keep offices out here not under the loomis name im looking into it fifth avenue suite in new york and all we know about them here is a possible link to a bookstore in silverlake bit of a contrast we know theyre snobs he said maybe it extends to their view of california i made coffee while he sat motionless almost entranced when i brought back two mugs he thanked me and gave me a white envelope in it were a socialsecurity card visa mastercard fedco membership blue shield enrollment all made out to andrew desmond health insurance i said whats the deductible he smiled ample in case i get hurt ill do my best to take care of you what about a drivers license well need a photo for that and i want to wait til thursday or friday when your beards thicker ill have some educational credentials for you at that time also weve come up with an labased unaccredited psychology program that closed down ten years ago even if by some strange coincidence you happened to meet another alumnus it was homestudy no contact between the students sounds perfect he squared the stack of papers few civilians would disrupt their life to this extent alex im a masochist and frankly i think were overdoing the espionage bit better that than the opposite should you need a home away from home youve got one i was able to get a place in the city genesee avenue the fairfax district he waved his good hand around the room im afraid its nothing like this but the neighbors dont pry from his pocket came a ring bearing several keys he spread them on the table touched each in turn front and back doors garage your car its a karmann ghia ten years old but customized with a new engine and runs better than it looks its in the garage he slid the keys across the table sounds like youve thought of everything i said if only that were possible milo rang the bell just after tenthirty and petra connor was with him she was dressed in a pantsuit again this one chocolate brown wore less makeup and looked younger milo said superintendent sharavi detective petra connor hollywood division they shook hands connors dark eyes shifted to me then to the false id something to drink i said no thanks she said milo said if youve got coffee left ill have some wheres robin out in back i filled a mug and milo studied my socialsecurity card just finished interdivisional showandtell pierce couldnt make it mclaren and hooks were out on other cases so it was alvarado detective connor and me connor twisted a cameo ring thanks for letting me in on this i recontacted malcolm ponsicos parents in new jersey but once again they were no help and i couldnt tell them it might not be suicide my line was i was just touching base i also looked into zena lamberts background and its spotless she left plasmoderm voluntarily wasnt fired nothing iffy in her personnel file and shes the registered owner of the bookstore so it looks like an attempt at selfemployment she looked at milo he said the only morsel that came up at the meeting was that alvarado dug through recreation department files and found a guy named wilson tenney whod worked at the park where raymond ortiz was abducted and was fired a few weeks later because of personality problems wouldnt take orders showed up when he wanted to sat on a bench and read instead of raking they warned him several times finally gave him the boot tenney contested the firing made noises about a lawsuit reverse discrimination because he was a white male but then he just went away he handed me a sheet printed with a photocopied drivers license tenney was thirtyfive five ten one fifty green eyes shoulderlength hair light brown unless the black and white copy was inaccurate hard eyes tight mouth if you were looking for something nothing else remarkable about the face angry man i said resentment of minorities reading on the job because hes a selfstyled intellectual interesting we ran him through and hes as clean as lambert and didnt go crosstown for a job at the conservancy he did split from his last known address apartment in mar vista and guess what he drives a van seventynine chevy lapsed registration so that raises the hunch quotient a bit if hes living on the street hes not on the dole no welfare applications he might have a history of psychiatric treatment i said could be hospitalized alvarados already starting to check public hospitals at this point private places would be impossible to crack i also dropped by that mensa presidents place bukovsky its his business an autoparts yard and he wasnt in i decided not to leave a card suggestions so far no said sharavi just information he repeated what hed told me about sanger and the loomis foundation fifth avenue said milo and maybe theyre silent partners with the creep who wrote that book maybe partners with zena lambert bankrolling spasm one way for a clerk to go selfemployed overnight venture capital for a new utopia i said and if the store brings in money said sharavi maybe it goes back to the loomis foundation interesting way to launder so youll keep checking sangers travel records said milo sharavi nodded what about the editor cranepool she lives alone in an apartment on east seventyeighth street works long hours at the brokerage house comes home and rarely goes out except to shop and run errands three photos came out of his pocket the first landed upside down and he left it that way the second was a snapshot of a tall beefy man around forty with sloping shoulders that good tailoring couldnt conceal his hair was dark and combed straight back and his features were thick slightly flattened dark eyes droopy lids he wore a gray suit white shirt navy tie and carried a soft leather attaché the camera had caught him walking down a crowded street looking preoccupied the third featured a tightlipped harriedlooking woman ten years older wearing a bulky beige sweater and dark green plaid slacks light brown hair was pulled back from a broad face large gold earrings goldrimmed glasses more flattened features and i asked if she and sanger could be related good question said sharavi ill try to find out i examined the shot of helga cranepool some more she was in motion but a fast lens had captured her without blur stepping out of a door holding two white shopping bags the window behind her displayed apples and oranges the lettering on one of the bags said dagostino he was on his way to a business lunch said sharavi we found her grocery shopping on lexington avenue on saturday both of them are pretty grimlooking said petra connor maybe being brilliants not what its cracked up to be said milo sharavi flipped the first photo over farley sanger in a red polo shirt and canvas hat a pretty blond woman and two blond children sitting in a motorboat still moored to a dock flat green water hints of marsh grass at the periphery sanger still looked unhappy and the woman seemed cowed the children had turned away from the camera showing thin necks and yellow hair not exactly norman rockwell said connor milo asked if he could have the pictures and sharavi said sure they were copies for him i thought about the fact that hed waited til milo arrived to display them waited to let loose with details coptocop i was a very small part of this onward said milo the melvin myers stabbing i met with mrs grosperrin the director at myerss trade school at first she kept describing myers as the perfect student too perfect so i pressed her and she finally admitted he could also be a giant pain quick temper chip on his shoulder always looking for signs of discrimination against the handicapped complaining the school patronized the students instead of treating them like adults the facilities sucked the course offerings sucked grosperrin figured it was because melvins mother had cooped him up for so long now he was feeling his oats she said myers saw himself as a crusader tried to turn the student council into some big deal greater voice for the students more respect from the administration a leader but abrasive i said someone who could have made enemies grosperrin denied hed had any conflict with anyone claimed the faculty understood where he was coming from and admired him for his spunk quote unquote what about the people at myerss group home four residents i talked to three and the landlady over the phone they said basically the same thing melvin was bright but he could piss you off with his smart mouth still said connor none of the other victims was abrasive it sounds like who they were made them victims not what they did did mrs grosperrin have any idea what could have lured myers into that alley said sharavi none said milo but one things for sure he didnt get lost she said he knew the area like the palm of his hand had trained himself to memorize the entire downtown grid so someone offered him motivation to walk through that alley and thats where we stand you schedule a time for visiting the bookstore yet alex daniel suggested thursday or friday to give the beard some time good idea he said andrew the three of them left talking procedure coptocop as i thought about nolan dahl the parallels to ponsico another bright boy destroying himself not very profound iq was no defense against pain sometimes it hurt to perceive too clearly but the next morning it stayed with me dr lehmanns bleak situation the things helena was better off not knowing things that left nolan drowning in guilt id assumed a sexual secret but maybe not helena had talked about nolans embracing extremes how far had he taken it had he transferred out of west la because of something hed done in west la irit had been murdered in west la when id visited the killing site after latvinias murder id thought about a monster in a uniform a cop a big strong smiling handsome young cop disgusting but a west la cop would know the parks backroads be able to lose himself a cop could always offer a reason for being somewhere west la didnt patrol the park the rangers did a cop on lunch break code for doughnuts and homicide but no that made no sense nolan had been dead several weeks by the time of latvinias and melvin myerss murders and there wasnt a shred of evidence that nolan had ever hurt anyone but himself malignant imagination delaware the time line all wrong unless there was more than one killer not just a boygirl thing a killing club that would explain the varying mos a group game dividing the city up one police district per player nolan telling them how to do it because he was an expert on procedure enough i was defaming a dead man because hed been smart no doubt nolan had revealed secrets lehmann thought best left buried still helena had run away why her home phone was disconnected now longterm move with both parents gone no close family who would she turn to in times of stress distant relatives friends i didnt know any of them didnt know much about her at all she had mentioned one former relative the exhusband garys a pulmonologist basically a nice guy but he decided he wanted to be a farmer so he moved to north carolina i called rick at cedars and he came on the line sounding impatient but softening when he learned it was me sure he said gary blank he used to work here too good lung man southerner kind of a country boy at heart why im wondering if helena would have turned to him for support hmm the divorce was friendly as divorces go and garys an easygoing type if she asked him to put her up my guess is sure hed hold the door wide open thanks so youre still trying to reach her you know me rick never developed a taste for unfinished business yup he said used to be that way myself used to be he laughed yesterday north carolina had three area codes and i tried information for all of them before cashing in with gary s blank no degree a rural route near durham dinnertime in north carolina helena answered after two rings she recognized my voice right away and hers got strained howd you find me lucky guess i dont mean to be intrusive but i just wanted to see how youre doing if this makes things worse for you just say so she didnt answer i could hear music in the background something baroque helena its okay you just caught me offguard im sorry no its okay im i guess im touched that you cared im sorry for skipping out without an explanation but this is very hard dr delaware i its just hard you really caught me offguard no need to no its okay its just i got stressed out decided to make a clean sweep was it something you learned about nolan her voice got higher what do you mean you never made another appointment after finding that family photo album in nolans garage i was just wondering if there was something in there that upset you another long silence jesus she finally said shit helena jesus christ i really dont want to talk about this no problem but i dr delaware what im saying is its water under the bridge nothing i can change none of my business really ive got to concentrate on what i can do get past this move on i said nothing youre good she said brilliant uncanny im sorry im not making sense am i yes you are you learned something upsetting and dont want to rake it up exactly exactly i let a few more moments pass one thing though helena if nolan was involved in something thats still continuing and you have the ability to of course its continuing the world stinks its full of that kind of thing but i cant bear the responsibility for every bit of what hold on muffled voices her hand over the phone she came back on my ex heard me shouting and came in to check deep breath listen im sorry nolans death was bad enough but then to learn he was im sorry i just cant deal with this thanks for calling but no im fine ill cope its really beautiful here maybe ill give country life a try sorry for being so edgy dr delaware but please understand three apologies in not many more seconds i said of course you have nothing to be sorry for even if nolan was part of something extreme i wouldnt call it extreme she said suddenly angry sick but not extreme guys do it all the time right do they id say so its the oldest profession right prostitution silence what she said what did you mean i was just wondering if nolan got into some sort of extreme political activity i wish that i was used to she laughed so youre not a mind reader politics if only no dr delaware im just talking about good old whoring around my noble policeofficer brothers apparent obsession i said nothing she laughed again kept laughing louder faster until her voice took on a glassy edge of hysteria i couldnt care less about nolans politics he was always jumping from one crazy thing to another big deal the truth is at this point i couldnt care less about anything he did her voice cracked oh dr delaware im so angry at him so goddamn goddamn angry at him she rescued herself from tears by laughing some more youre right it was the photo album she said filthy polaroids nolans private little stash he kept it right in the middle of one of the books mixed in with pictures of mom and dad our old family stuff first he takes the album from moms effects and never tells me then uses it for his goddamn sicko porno stash porno i said personal porno pictures of him and hookers young girls not little kids thank god it wasnt that sick but most of them looked young enough to be illegal fifteen sixteen skinny little black girls and hispanics obviously hookers from the way they were dressed spiked heels garter belts they all looked stoned with a couple you could actually see the needle tracks on their arms in some of them he left his uniform on so he probably was doing it on the job thats most likely why he transferred to hollywood to be closer to the hookers he probably picked them up when he was supposed to be out fighting crime took them godknowswhere took pictures i heard her snort garbage she said i turned them into confetti and threw them out after i closed the garbagecan lid i thought what are you doing here this city everythings nuts then the next night someone broke in and that was it what an ordeal i said dr delaware i never really knew nolan but nothing could have prepared me for those pictures its just so hard to reconcile someone you grew up with anyway here i do feel safe garys got fortyfive acres with horses all i see when i look out the window is grass and trees i know i cant stay here forever but right now its working no offense but at this point a change of scenery seems a lot more valuable than therapy anyway thanks for calling i havent told anyone actually it wasnt bad being able to unload knowing it wont go any further if theres anything else no she laughed no i think this has been quite enough dr delaware dear little brother first he goes and kills himself on me then he leaves me souvenirs code for hookers a sleaze but not a killer plenty of reason for guilt a bleak situation perhaps nolan had been found out referred to lehmann talked it out got no easy answers lehmann letting him know hed have to leave the force nolan opting for final exit now i could understand lehmanns nervousness confidentiality issues and beyond he made a living as an lapd contractor the last thing he needed was to expose yet another lapd scandal feeling sad but relieved i went into my office and thought about being andrew desmond place of birth st louis suburbia creve coeur selfmade father bourgeois conservative looks down on psychology andrews intellectual pretensions mother donna reed with an edge civic volunteer sharptongued convinced andrew was precocious had his iq tested as a child frustrated at the boys chronic underachievement but explains it away as the schools failure not stimulating poor andrew for simplicitys sake no sibs poor andrew robin came in at six whats the matter nothing why you look different different how i dont know she put her hand on my shoulder touched my stubbled cheek a little down no im fine the hand moved back to my shoulder alex youre so tight how long have you been sitting hunched like that couple of hours spike waddled in usually he licks me hi i said he cocked his head stared left the room on tuesday night at daniel was waiting for retired captain eugene brooker in the parking lot of a bowling alley on venice boulevard in mar vista hed noticed the lot that afternoon when hed driven by wilson tenneys former apartment a dismal earthquakecracked tenunit box bordering an alley wearing a suit and tie hed represented himself as an insurance claims adjustor to the old mexican woman who lived in the managers unit the former park worker hed told her had filed an earthquake claim for damaged personal effects and he wanted to verify tenneys residence at the address during the northridge quake yeah she said and nothing else how long did he live here shrug couple years was he a good tenant quiet paid his rent so nothing we should worry about nope tell the truth i hardly remember him the door shut his look into tenneys background had been more of the same no medical records or state hospitalizations no citations on the chevrolet van not a single entry or crossreference to any crime files tenney hadnt applied for welfare or for a job at any other city county or state park within a hundredmile radius daniel had lied creatively for half a day to find out so either tenney had moved or just disappeared still daniel felt something about the guy an intuition what else could you call it so fuzzy hed never mention it to another detective but hed be foolish to ignore it the first thing was what he knew about tenneys personality a loner who flaunted the rules reading on the job instead of working that remark about being a white male put it all together and it resonated second a van he could not erase the image of raymond ortiz being spirited away in a van a vehicle that hadnt been seen since tenneys firing from the park shortly after raymonds abduction bloody shoes hed said nothing about tenney to zev carmeli the deputy consul had taken to calling him every day between and pm getting irritated when daniel was out even though he knew daniel was working on irit and nothing else tonight zev had caught him just as he sat down to a tuna sandwich the police scanner going in the kitchen are they giving you what you need sharavi theyre being cooperative well thats a switch so nothing yet im sorry no zev silence on the line then the same question sturgis youre sure he knows what hes doing he seems very good you dont sound enthusiastic hes good zev as good as anyone ive ever worked with he takes the job seriously is he taking you seriously about as seriously as could be expected yes no complaints and the psychologist hes doing his best as well but no brilliant new psychological analysis not yet he didnt mention petra connor or alvarado or any of the other detectives why complicate things all right carmeli finally said just keep me fully informed of course after zev hung up daniel bolted down the sandwich said grace after the meal then the maariv prayers and resumed reading the brain drain some of the details flew over his head graphs statistics a very dry book but maybe that was the point dr arthur haldane trying to obscure facts with verbiage and numbers but the message came through smart people were superior in every way and should be encouraged to breed stupid people were during good times a nuisance during bad times an unnecessary obstruction dry but a bestseller some people needed others to lose in order to feel like winners hed looked into haldanes background yet another new yorker the book listed him as a scholar at the loomis institute but sharavis manhattan operative hadnt traced any calls from haldane to loomiss office haldanes apartment was in riverdale in the bronx decent place the operative had said healthy rent but nothing that special family hes got a wife and a fourteenyearold daughter and a dog a mini schnauzer they go out to dinner twice a week usually italian one time they had chinese he stays in a lot doesnt go to church on sunday stays inside said daniel sometimes for days at a time maybe hes working on another book he doesnt own a car either the one phone we know about weve secured but he could be using email and we havent found any password yet thats it so far nothing more on sanger and that sourfaced woman either helga cranepool they both go to work they go home a boring bunch boring and smart so you say so they say the operative laughed she was a twentyeightyearold dutchborn woman whose cover job was photographer for the new york times no connection to the israeli government except for the cash that was deposited for her each month in a cayman islands bank any pictures said daniel what do you think coming right through bye the snapshot that slid through the fax machine was of a slight bearded grayhaired man in his late forties or early fifties curly hair bushy at the sides eyeglasses pinched face he wore a tweed overcoat dark slacks and opennecked shirt and was walking the little schnauzer wholly unremarkable what did he expect monsters hannah arendt had called evil banal and the intellectuals had all jumped on that because it fit in with their disparagethebourgeoisie philosophy but arendt had maintained a longterm pathetic masochistic relationship with the antisemite philosopher martin heidegger so her judgment in daniels opinion was questionable from what hed seen crime was often banal most of it was downright stupid but evil not the evil hed experienced in the butchers dungeon of horrors not this either this was not humanityasusual he refused to believe that gene tapped on the passenger window and daniel unlocked the toyota the older man slipped in in the darkness his ebony face was nearly invisible and his dark sportcoat shirt slacks and shoes contributed to the phantom image only the white hair bounced back some light hey he said shifting around in the small car trying to get comfortable the bowling alley would close soon but there were still enough cars in the lot for cover and daniel had chosen a poorly lit corner and a neighborhood where a black man and a brown man could talk in a car without the police swooping down genes big buick was parked across the asphalt seems youre right danny boy he said sturgis has sleuthed me out asking about me a few days ago at newton but what can he do im out of there he probably wont do anything gene because hes busy and knows how to prioritize but if the case goes completely sour who knows im sorry if this ends up complicating your life it wont whats the felony pulling a file and the shoes gene grinned what shoes hey i was newton captain for seven years always took an interest in unsolved cases everyone knows that anyway in answer to your question manny alvarado is a very good detective no fireworks a plodder but thorough thanks you like this tenney as a suspect dont know yet said daniel hes all weve got so far i like him said gene at least from what youve told me the timing the whole disturbed loner thing anything at the conservancy yet tenney definitely never worked there or applied for a job under any name no other parks either ah too bad still he could have held on to his old city uniforms and used them to lure the kid believe me the citys sloppy when it comes to that kind of thing and a naive kid like irit what would she know about the different uniforms true said daniel well keep looking not mentioning the other depressing fact tenney was nondescript mediumsized fairhaired forgettable literally the gang members from the park where raymond ortiz had been abducted hadnt recognized tenneys snapshot none of the parkgoers had and tenney had worked there for two years just another bland white face in a uniform even reading on the job he hadnt drawn anyones attention so said gene youre okay working with sturgis so far daniel said im fine with it gene i think hes good so they say gene stretched his feet hed put on weight and his belly extended past the lapels of his sportcoat you have doubts said daniel no gene said quickly not in terms of doing the job they all say hes good excellent actually want me to be honest the gay thing im from a different generation it puts me off when i was a rookie we used to bust gay bars which was wrong no question about it but the things i saw i was just wondering about you being religious same thing zev had said belief in god made you an ayatollah what i mean said gene was with this kind of thing you need a cohesive team top of everything else sturgis is a cowboy im fine said daniel hes professional he concentrates on whats important good now for the myers boy i know youre not going to like this but the reason i wanted to meet you was i went by that group home in baldwin hills made like a cop talked to the landlady and the other residents daniel kept his voice even that puts you at risk gene me too my friend i was convincing danny believe me sturgis already did telephonic interviews so why not be more thorough i told the landlady a mrs bradley that i was following up on sturgiss interviews shes black they all are it didnt hurt believe me and guess what i talked to a fellow sturgis hadnt spoken to because he was out that day lived right next door to myers closest thing myers had to a friend closest thing said daniel myers didnt have real friends the picture i got was that myers was hard to like full of attitude didnt hang out with the others mostly stayed in his room reading braille and listening to jazz this particular fellow likes jazz too so he and myers had that in common hes a paraplegic in a wheelchair says myers was always after him to look into different exercises vitamins alternative remedies try to rehab himself the guy had been shot in the spine said what the hell did he expect me to do grow a new backbone but he tolerated myers because even though myers could be a pain he really seemed to care he also said myers had been talking about going to school to become a psychologist anyway the main thing i got out of this guy was that myers didnt like the trade school one bit on the contrary he hated it was planning to write some article about it as soon as he graduated an exposé thats what it sounded like myers never gave him specifics its probably nothing but it does give us a victim with higherthanaverage enemy potential i figure the next step is find out if there was anyone at the school who had an especially hostile relationship with myers which makes sense on another level because whoever got him into that alley probably also knew the neighborhood the director said there was no one myers had problems with maybe she didnt know or maybe shes lying to keep the school out of the spotlight heck for all we know this wilson tenney got a job at the school and ran into myers as a custodian lets say he stole stuff and myers found out heres tenney already killed three people nonwhite people and myers was an abrasive black guy mouths off to him one time too many threatens to blow the whistle daniel said nothing its wild but its plausible said gene you agree it should be looked into ill look into it gene shifted around again ive got time just sitting around i could go over to the school as one of those kindly retired gents looking to volunteer thanks but ill do it gene youre sure im sure ive got the perfect equipment daniel lifted his bad hand genes mouth closed then he said howre you going to pull it off without putting sturgiss nose out of joint ill find a way gene sighed okay just call me if you change your mind believe me i will and gene i know keep my nose out of it i really appreciate everything but keep my nose out of it gene laughed hows the packing going said daniel gene laughed some more changing the subject the packings finished my illustrious life in boxes i finally heard from the leasing agent shes got a couple wholl take the house til the market gets better physical therapists they work fulltime at luther king so they should be able to keep up with the rent im in good shape ready to live the good life in the land of sun and sand great said daniel pleased that gene could think in positive terms without luanne or at least fake it so the new house will be ready soon five more days they claim gene slumped guess i better get used to feeling useless youve been very useful gene not really a file shoes big deal to be truthful its more than that danny its the case itself ugly even for guys like us its ugly and pardon me for saying so but it doesnt sound as if youre getting much movement on wednesday morning milo called to tell me hed caught up with loren bukovsky the local mensa chapter chairman not a bad fellow understandably curious about why i was looking into meta i told him it was a financial thing largescale covert investigation hinted around that it had something to do with stolen computers and asked him to keep it to himself he promised to and my sense is he might keep his word because he doesnt like meta thinks theyre insufferables who look down on mensa because mensa folk arent smart enough for them bukovsky denies that emphatically what if bukovsky doesnt keep it to himself and it gets back to someone in meta then we deal with it it could even work out to our advantage one or more of their members turn out to be bad guys and show their hands and give us moving targets which is better than none that i said sounds like rationalization no alex its the truth you didnt screw things up as it stands were nowhere with this group even bukovsky for all his hostility didnt know much about them just that theyd started back east cropped up in la two or three years ago then took a low profile two years ago i said right around the time of sangers article and publication of the brain drain next item got hold of zena lamberts tax returns for the last three years her sole income was the salary from plasmoderm before that she made no money at all so how she started the store is still an open question maybe a trust fund i said like andrew desmond he looked at me andrews got rich parents comfortable i gave him the profile sounds like a charming fellow he said the only other thing to report is melvin myerss body was clean of drugs and bob pierce says none of the local crackheads knew him so it wasnt dope that got him in that alley youre really up for this secretagent stuff arent you got my shoephone in gear at pm daniel phoned id like to show you the cover apartment on genesee you may never actually have to use it but this way youll be accustomed to it ill meet you there whats the address im near your house he said if you dont mind ill come by and take you he was there ten minutes later and he gave me a brown paper ralphs market bag inside was a change of clothes lightweight black cotton pants black cotton mock turtleneck washed nearly gray baggy gray herringbone sportcoat with the label of dillards department store in st louis on the inside breast pocket rubbersoled black shoes from bullocks la costume rehearsal i said something like that no underwear underwear is underwear true i dont see andrew going for flaming red silk i inspected the jacket the wool emitted a weak scent of insipid cologne the st louis touch is nice i said but andrews lived in la for several years i dont see him as someone who likes to shop he said his mother sent it to him good old mom i put the clothes on the sportcoat was a little baggy but not a bad fit the mirror showed me a nicely shabby getup that would play well in lots of la settings the beard helped too it had grown into the itch stage thick and coarse and straight with more gray hairs than id expected from my cheekbones to my adams apple i was covered the lower half of my face effectively obscured we drove down the glen in the gray toyota just past the beverly hills line he said try these and gave me a pair of eyeglasses tiny round lenses graytinted in bronze frames i slipped them on no prescription i like the effect he said but id remove them from time to time your eyes are good for the part nice and red have you been sleeping well yes i lied well he said you look worldweary anyway method acting andrews an insomniac andrews not a happy man the genesee building was a twostory stucco quadriplex nearly the exact gray of the toyota between beverly and rosewood flat roof barred windows all the charm of a storage depot the front door was locked the small round key he said i turned the latch and we entered a central corridor carpeted in cheap maroon felt boiledonion smell stairs at the back fourslot brass mailbox just inside the door the paper desmond label was on unit brown paper waterstained my neighbors were weinstein and paglia and levine two was the ground floor righthand unit a pair of nailholes pierced the doorpost like the fangholes of a bigjawed snake between them was a threeinch column one shade paler than the surrounding woodwork andrew removed the mezuzah i said hes not jewish still to go to the trouble apparently hes not a man of much faith alex the square key opens both locks two good dead bolts each shiny with the crisp feel of new fixtures the apartment was dim and stuffy more of that same weak cologne overlaid with must and mothballs bare wood floors in need of varnish some of the boards bowing offwhite walls offwhite polyester drapes over the small protected windows each with borders of little turquoise yarnballs thriftshop furniture in hues of ash and earth and not much of it a living room with one wall of plywood shelving crowded with books and a taiwanese stereo system the kitchen looked greasy but felt clean down a skinny dark hall were a crackedtile bathroom mattressonthefloor bedroom and a rear door out to the tiny yard with a sagging clothesline and threecar garage it reminded me of something nolan dahls place lonely bachelor living the places it could lead what do you think said daniel i looked around everything was worn and stained and nicked in all the right places no one would suspect it was a set who lived here the rest of the year perfect i said and he led me back to the back door and out into the yard half dry grass half birdspecked cement an alley runs behind the property he said the garage can be entered from both sides from his pocket he removed a remote control and pushed the button the central garage door opened inside was a karmann ghia painted legalpaper yellow back in the house he gave me the remote and we returned to the living room where he stood back inviting me to inspect i checked out the stereo and the books the music was a mixture of lps tapes and cds small collection maybe fifty selections in all beethoven wagner bruckner mahler bach cat stevens the lovin spoonful hendrix the doors the beatles abbey road nothing recent some of the covers bore resale labels from aarons on melrose the store had moved to highland years ago the books were on psychology sociology anthropology history a smattering of other subjects some with used stickers many bearing the conspicuous irrelevance of assigned texts at the bottom was fiction hemingway faulkner kerouac burroughs camus sartre beckett piles of old psych journals and magazines evergreen review eros harpers the atlantic monthly the nation resting comfortably atop the national review like nolan andrew desmond had covered a wide swath of political territory except for that it could have been my library from college though my apartment on overland had been half the size of this place a stuffy cell neighboring an autorepair shop id struggled each month to make the ninetydollar rent no trust fund i pulled out an abnormalpsych text foxed pages gave off the vomitous odor old books sometimes acquire inside was the inked stamp of the student bookstore at the university of missouri columbus sold and resold twice pages full of yellow underlining a newerlooking tome that i recognized as the major gradschool work on the same topic came from the technical bookstore on westwood boulevard in la purchase date ten years ago meticulous i guess you have the original receipts too i didnt see andrew as someone whod save receipts unsentimental he sat down on a sagging couch and dust puffed lucky im not allergic i said yes i should have asked cant think of everything is there anything youd change alex not so far where are the bugs he crossed his legs and managed to get his bad hand on his knee where it rested like a lumpy gray toad in the phone he said in a bedroom lamp and here he hooked a thumb toward the front windowsill i saw nothing out of the ordinary how many phones i said two here and in the bedroom both tapped neithers been tampered with actually the entire line is monitored what cologne is that i said pardon theres a scent in the apartment on this jacket too his nostrils widened ill find out neither of us spoke and i found myself focusing on sounds someones air conditioner rattling upstairs the occasional car from the street the chitter of passing conversation anything else i said not unless youve got suggestions you seem to have covered everything he stood and so did i but as we headed for the door he stopped reached behind his waistband and took out a pager and looked at it silent he said excuse me i just got a call he walked to the livingroom phone and punched numbers greeted someone with alo and listened eyebrows arching wedging the receiver under his chin he reached in his jacket and extricated a small notepad a miniature pencil was velcroed to the back and he peeled it off okay he said placing the pad on a fakewood end table and leaning over pencil poised american eyzeh mispar he copied said todah lhitraot hung up as he tucked the book back in his windbreaker i saw the black plastic gun nesting in a black mesh nylon holster under his right armpit that he said was a source in new york our lawyer friend farley sanger has booked a flight to los angeles this friday american airlines flight scheduled to arrive at seven pm we almost missed it the arrangements werent made through his firms travel agent one of our people followed him to a meeting with helga cranepool sanger had dinner with her at the carlyle hotel and then the two of them took a cab downtown to lower manhattan to a travel agent we hadnt known about which means there may have been other trips we never found she paid for the ticket but its his hes not traveling under his own name hes calling himself galton francis galton i said close he said frank friday said milo but helga stays in new york helgas back to her routine said daniel she works and goes home the tv can be heard through the door of her apartment cnn situation comedies she goes to bed at ten precisely it was wednesday night and the three of us were back at my house seated around the kitchen table robin was across the room on a stool at the counter reading art and auction with more intensity than usual frank galton said milo so the asshole fancies himself the boss eugenicist helga goes with him to pay for the ticket meaning its meta business or loomis business maybe it is a killing trip and they plan em in new york and do em here this speeds things up if alex is gonna visit the bookstore its got to be tomorrow i agree said daniel and the next day we get on sanger and stay with him who picks up his trail at the airport thats up to you said daniel as far as we know he didnt book a limousine leaving three possibilities a rental car a cab or a friends meeting him if i pose as a cab driver and its a friend or a rental car i lose him so youre saying a twoman thing one at the gate one at the curb it would help using your people if thats not a problem for you whatever i want huh said milo too much more of this and ill start to think ive got free will tell you what ill give you petra connor for the airport shes itching to get involved divide it any way you want my priority is going to be keeping my eye on alex from the time he starts out on this spasmzena thing maybe itll end tomorrow but maybe it wont were talking a nowire deal right too much potential for screwup with a wire i agree is there a tracer on the karmann ghia there will be said daniel soon as possible robin looked up briefly and returned to her magazine daniel put his good hand against one cheek he looked uncomfortable and milo picked up on it what some information came my way regarding melvin myers a cotenant at his group home said myers hated the trade school was going to write an article about it when he graduated came your way said milo a pigeon dropped a note through the window human pigeon said daniel im sorry a large black pigeon from now on hes back in the coop milo once again im sor what kind of article was myers planning to write from the sound of it an exposé it may mean nothing but i thought you should know when exactly did you find this out last night ah i was planning to visit the home myerss school too but now with you watching sanger and me watching alex and trying to track down wilson tenney were spread a little thin if you think its worth following up said daniel i can visit the school before sanger arrives he lifted the arm with the bad hand ill tell them a sad story injury depression disability claim i want to make a new start milo looked at the ravaged limb putting you out there asking questions is more of an active role than we discussed i know said daniel were talking a brief dropin you ask for vocational training check the place out thats all daniel nodded myers was learning computers ill ask for computer training ive already been through it at a rehab center in israel i thought of his onehand lightning peck ill be subtle he said his mouth was taut as he slipped the crippled hand under the table and out of view okay said milo make it a really sad story tug at their heartstrings but watch your back i dont need any goddamn international incident thursday id slept fitfully but was awake at six ahead of robin for a change lying flat on my back i watched her doze and thought about being andrew desmond at sixthirty she awoke and looked at me her eyes were puffy i kissed them she lay there today she said just a bookstore visit i said shouldnt take long hopefully not whens he getting here nine she touched my hair rolled away from me we both got out of bed she put on a robe tugged the sash tight and stood there for a moment i stood behind her and held her shoulders ill be fine i know you will she turned sharply kissed me hard on the cheek almost an assault then she went into the bathroom and locked the door yesterday wed made love twice the second time she said i feel like an adulterer daniel arrived at nine and sat me down in the kitchen covering me with a black barbers sheet he snipped my hair with scissors then used electric clippers to reduce it to a marinerecruit buzz youre a barber too the army he said you learn all kinds of things not that im ready to open a salon he gave me a hand mirror silver glints peppered my scalp gray hair unearthed bumps on my cranium that id never known about i looked ten years older ten pounds thinner the haircut and the beard gave me the appearance of an islamic radical i put on the tinted glasses scowled smile said a voice from the door robin stood there i grinned at her okay its still you she said but she didnt smile back daniel set up a professional polaroid camera on a tripod took three dozen shots left and returned an hour later with andrew desmonds california drivers license to my eyes indistinguishable from the real thing i added it to the rest of the fake id now occupying my wallet hopefully i wont get stopped by a cop if you do its okay he said weve managed to enter the serial number into the system your graduate schools the pacific insight institute have you heard of it no it closed down years ago masters degrees and phds in education and psychology headquarters was a oneroom office in westwood village fiftythree graduates to our knowledge none passed the state licensing exams so they went to work as psychic friends and made twice the money i said could be access to the spirits often pays off so do diploma mills apparently tuition was nineteen thousand dollars per year couldnt buy licensure is that why it closed down he shrugged enrollment dropped each year the former dean sells insurance in oregon his degree was selfgranted for the first year pacific was actually able to obtain partial federal loans but that ended when the government clamped down on diploma mills youve done quite a bit of research more than we intended he said because while finding a place for you i learned that the loomis institute was involved in funding similar schools two in florida and one in the virgin islands another possible profitmaking scheme while claiming taxfree status though all we know so far is loomis awarded grants to these places whered you find this out a book written in response to the brain drain one good thing that did come my way through the internet a collection of essays the one that caught my eye was by a professor at cole university in mississippi whose field of study was diploma mills he found out the school in the virgin islands had links to loomis and may have really been a way to fund eugenics research a book i said twisted science thats the one youve read it i checked it out but never got around to reading it figured why waste time on something i agree with whats this professors name bernard eustace i assume youve contacted him his gold eyes were steady we tried he died fourteen months ago how auto accident he was visiting his parents in mississippi drove off the road late at night jesus i said its recorded as an accident alex maybe it was milo and i agree that digging further right now is too risky because the crash site is rural any questions from outoftown police will be conspicuous the fingers of his good hand had bowed tips pressing into the tabletop mississippi i said was eustace black white a historian not a psychologist we may eventually talk to his wife but right now following farley sanger and your meeting zena lambert seem more useful are you ready yes wheres milo hell be following you but we thought it better that you didnt know where he was that way youd be less likely to look his way accidentally im sure you dont doubt his protectiveness not a shred of doubt i said before i left i stopped in to see robin again the shop was quiet all machines switched off her apron still folded on a workbench as she talked on the phone her back to me spike barked and trotted forward and robin turned ill call you when its done bye she put the phone down you look like a french cinematographer is that good or bad depends if you like french cinema it does have a certain hungry elegance cmere we embraced whats that cologne she said andrews scent do you find it alluring oh yeah baguettes and pessimism she pulled away held me at arms length youre certainly giving them their moneys worth when will you be back depends on how it goes i said probably sometime this afternoon give me a call as soon as you can ill get us something for dinner i held her tighter her hand reached up and touched my bristly head paused stroked fuzzy wuzzy was a bear i said if i run out of sandpaper ill draft you into service she pulled away again studied me definitely different overkill i said its a bookstore visit in hollywood not sneaking into iran but theyre the professionals have you seen hollywood recently i chuckled thought about nolans hollywood she stroked my head some more three kids that blind man some things grow back down in front parked next to daniels toyota was the karmann ghia from the genesee garage creamcolored not yellow in the sunlight with a scarred hood and a dented door he handed me a small color photo headshot of a young woman with a narrow face whiteblond hair cut almost as short as mine her features were good but her skin was beyond pale kabuki white black liner enlarged her blue eyes and emphasized a hypermetabolic glow despite that she looked bored resentful i resisted the urge to interpret standing in line at the dmv could make anyone feel that way drivers license i said he nodded took the picture from me and put it in his pocket the store is at apollo avenue good luck we shook hands and he drove off the karmann ghias seat was adjusted to my height and the car started up easily plenty of power as daniel had promised the interior was trashed torn upholstery and headliner crumpled paper cups and fastfood boxes tossed behind the seat the amfm radio was old enough to be original i turned it on kpfk the guest was a black sociopolitical theoretician and author who believed jewish doctors had created aids in order to kill off innercity babies the host let him preach for paragraphs at a time then threw him grounders that evoked more hatred daniel was a planner and i wondered if hed preset the dial getting me in the mood i switched to jazz and drove spasms address put the store just past the border between hollywood and silverlake i passed sunsets hospital row and the hillhurst intersection where the boulevard veers southeast toward downtown today just a smogshrouded theory then a quick left on fountain which i followed until it became a side street yielding to two lanes of dips and curves apollo the street was planted with huge untrimmed trees old trees this was the kind of onestory mixeduse neighborhood you see only in older parts of la mostly it was autobody shops and printing plants and usedtire yards but interspersed among the dreary lots were liquor stores and other small businesses and small houses some converted to commercial use some still sporting gardens and laundry lines one a pentecostal church a nail parlor a tattoo parlor a botánica advertising crystals and herbs unmarked buildings many with for lease signs looking down on all of it were the steep embankments of silverlake weedy and treeshrouded where they werent toasted golden dry spots primed for the arsonists match the hillside was planted with uneven rows of residences like shrubs sprouting from a careless garden some of the houses flamingoed on stilts others rested at skeptical angles on tremorthrottled foundations i saw cracks snaking down stucco parted seams roofs missing entire sections of shingle porch beams bent like reeds the whole neighborhood looked offkilter a mile away the city was excavating a subway the block appeared and i spotted spasm right away the black window was the tipoff small black plastic letters were placed near the top of a gray door illegible from the street empty curb no problem parking as i got out i made out spasm books on both sides of the store were body shops then an acre of asphalt bearing the badge of an official police tow yard across the street was a momandpop taco joint its doors shut a closed sign hanging on the knob it was impossible to tell if spasm was open for business but when i pushed the gray door it yielded and i stepped into a long skinny tunnellike charcoalcolored room vibrating with loud calypso music skimpy lighting was turned even murkier by the tinted lenses of my glasses but i kept them on and tried to affect an air of mild curiosity to the left a bald wildly tattooed man sat at a checkout booth and smoked energetically leather vest over blueandcrimson flesh he was swaying to the music didnt look up the booth was three panels of plywood pushed up against the wall on the floor were loose piles of throwaway papers the reader the weekly the maoist exile wandererflyers for divas in drag where you can be what you want to be maidenhead in concert tertiara malladonna a onewimin show about tamponsucking and rice confiscation uncle suppuratos bodypiercing studio schedules of night readings in barnhard park of poetry concerned with quantum physics and gum disease leather vest continued to ignore me as i passed him both side walls were lined with slanting shelves of books displayed faceout accent lights brightened the covers toward the back was a cableandplank staircase leading to an upper loft on the back wall another gray door three customers on the ground floor a wanlooking cleancut man in his twenties with bad posture and a fearful frown he wore a madras buttondown shirt khakis and sneakers and glanced over his shoulder nervously as i approached i could imagine him masturbating in his car dreading discovery yet hoping for it the paperback in his hand said cannibal killers the other two browsers were a man and woman in their late forties both with pemmican faces shellacked with a sunandbooze luster long hair missing teeth lots of beads a shopping bag full of scraps had their tiedyes and serapes been clean they could have been traded on melrose as antiques they were sharing a whitecovered paperback and cackling i heard the woman say cool in a grandmothers voice then the man returned the book to the rack and they left looking jolly heilrock marching songs of the waffen ss peace love woodstock had come to this the man with the cannibal book brought it up to leather vest and paid now i was the sole patron the calypso soundtrack shifted to stravinsky the illustrated clerk lit up another cigarette and began tapping his knee to no discernible rhythm time to browse maybe id be lucky and find a dvll reference i decided to start with the second floor out of view of the clerk the staircase took me up to half a loft just one long wall with the same faceout display and spotlighting one copy of each book nothing labeled by subject matter or author no alphabetization though i did find clumps of volumes that seemed related collections on sadomasochism lavishly illustrated some taken to the bloodwoundpus level prison diaries crudely printed a glossy thing called penitentiary magazine with stories on lifer in the top bunk my favorite celly stand up for your rights and dont let the system buttfuck you why writers dont know shit about crime and the best jackoff videos of the year another cluster on human oddities most written with cold leering tones racist comics alternative comix that

closeup views of the destruction visited upon human flesh by shotgun blade blunt instrument strangulation toxicology and lividity charts rates of putrefaction victims sexually posed mutilated the blank helpless face of death the modus operandi section said that while some serial killers traveled the highways most tended to work within circumscribed areas patterns to be broken replacing the book i returned downstairs the clerk had switched to a cigar and was trying to create his own toxic cloud he stared at me for a second leaned forward twisted something and stravinsky blared well above the earbleed range not into userfriendly i used anyway the first floor started off as more of the same brutal eclecticism and i skimmed trying to look casual then i found the eugenics books and slowed down the collected essays of galton desktop publishing by new dominion press why did that sound familiar the publishers address st croix the virgin islands another loomis venture the book was nothing more than what it claimed to be next came dr charles davenports report to the cold springs eugenics society hereditary charts of patients whose degenerative spawn had been curtailed by sterilization annotations at the bottom by dr arthur haldane resident scholar at the loomis institute i checked this one out carefully published five years before the brain drain haldanes prebestseller days in it haldane remarked upon the relative unsophistication of turnofthecentury science but reaffirmed davenports thesis society was doomed unless genetic restructuring utilizing advanced technology became public policy i flipped to the index still no dvll nothing on meta either i found six more books on selective breeding and qualityoflife issues one by the australian ethnicist whod recommended killing retarded babies same old crap nothing new the stench of the clerks cigar had enveloped me and i looked up and realized i was fifteen feet from the register no insights no zena lambert mr tattoo was reading something called wet bandage then just as i was about to give up i found one more nugget a fiftypage pamphlet that same laserprinter look under brown paper covers humanness new perspectives by farley sanger attorneyatlaw an expanded version of the article from the pathfinder supplemented by charts and graphs government statistics on crime race unemployment outofwedlock births dna testing the human genome project and how it could be used to cleanse the dross dry as a legal brief lawsuit against the disadvantaged sanger ended with a call for the brutally efficient elimination of mindset censorship of indisputably valid areas of research simply because certain elements with vested interests are offended or justifiably frightened of what can only be regarded as the logical conclusions of carefully tested hypotheses golden prose pity the poor judges who had to read his workproduct twentytwodollar price tag i tucked the book under my arm returned to the galton book and took that too the door at the back of the store opened and zena lambert came out shed dyed her hair black and grown it to shoulder length with thick bangs that covered her brow and a doris day flip but the face was the same narrow and pale the same black eyeliner in real life less kabuki than bone china clean balanced features the nose small and straight the lips narrow but full glossed pink prettier than in the photo the kind of guileless allamerican face favored by casting directors for detergent commercials sally branch had said she was small but that was an understatement maybe five feet no more than ninety pounds she was a childwoman with small sharp breasts and thin but supplelooking arms exposed by a sleeveless pink polyester top tight black jeans covered trim hips tiny waist proportionately long legs for someone so small she wore black plastic earrings and pink highheeled sandals with clear plastic bows on the instep even with the lift she was tiny twentyeight years old but she could have passed for a college sophomore hipsswiveling walk black pink black pink both of us in costume hers appeared to be fifties retro nostalgia for the good old days when men were men and women were women and defectives knew their place shed assembled herself to attract attention might very well be looking for stares i hid my face behind a book on dwarfs trying to observe inconspicuously she noticed hi she said in a high bright voice is there anything i can help you with i gave her andrews best surly headshake put the book back and returned my attention to the rack happy browsing she swayed up to the register before she got there mr cigar left the booth without comment and exited the store stinky she called after him as the door closed climbing atop the stool she lowered stravinsky to a tolerable level made her own twisting motion and switched to a harpsichord fugue thanks i said welcome she chirped being a reader means never having to herniate your tympanic membranes i turned back to the book id selected randomly a quarterly called earthquake sex and stole glances at her she picked up the copy of wet bandage left on the counter put it aside and took out what looked like an accounting ledger holding it on her lap she began writing i brought sangers pamphlet and the galton book up to the booth columns of figures definitely a ledger she slid it out of sight and smiled cash or charge charge before i got my hand on my wallet she said thirtytwo sixtyfour my surprised look was genuine she laughed white teeth one frontal incisor chipped a speck of lipstick on another dont trust my addition i shrugged im sure youre right but that was rather quick mental arithmetic she said intellectual calisthenics use it or lose it but if youre skeptical laughing again she snatched both books off the counter and punched the register ding thirtytwo sixtyfour she licked her lips with a tiny pink tongue aplus i said i gave her andrews new mastercard she glanced at it and said are you a teacher no why teachers love to grade i seldom grade she put the books in an unmarked paper bag and handed them to me the nonjudgmental type i shrugged well enjoy the books a desmond i started for the door not looking forward to it she said i stopped to what reading what you just bought you look positively sullen its not for pleasure i stopped and gave her my best downbeat smile until i read i wont know that will i her smile freezeframed then widened she tugged a wave of black hair and let it bounce back elastic id seen hair like that as a child blackandwhite tv commercials for tonette doityourself permanents on top of being a skeptic hes an empiricist she said is there an alternative there are alternatives to everything she said then she waved a small delicate hand the nails were long tapered and what else bright pink tata go on your way a desmond didnt mean to intrude but the topic caught my eye oh i looked into the bag youve read them have i made good choices she lowered her eyes from my face to my chest to my belt lingering continuing to my shoes then swooping upward for an eyelock quite good ones galton was the progenitor of it all and yes i have read them it happens to be something im interested in eugenics societal improvements of all kinds i conceded a miserly smile well weve got common ground there do we i think society sorely needs fixing a misanthrope that depends on what day you catch me she leaned on the counter small breasts spreading on the wood a swift or a pope pardon the swiftpope dichotomy on the great yardstick of misanthropy not familiar a i shook my head must have missed that one she examined a pink thumbnail its really quite simple jonathan swift hated humanity as a structural unit but managed to muster affection for individuals alexander pope professed a love for humanity but couldnt countenance interpersonal relationships is that so quite so i put a finger to my mouth then i suppose im both a swift and a pope again depending upon which day you catch me there are also times im an equalopportunity despiser such as when i read the paper too early in the day she laughed a sourpuss so ive been told i slouched forward put my hand out andrew desmond she stared at the hand finally touched my fingertips very lightly how sociable of you to actually grant me a greeting andrew desmond im zena a to z i said she turned off the music how cute we traverse the alphabet in one fell swoop i stepped closer and she moved back sitting higher on the stool she took another look at her nails interesting location youve got i said have you been here long a few months i only noticed it because i was picking my car up from the tow yard and saw the sign our customers know us i looked around the empty room she watched me but didnt react anywhere to get lunch around here i said not really the mexican place across the street is closed because the owners son got shot last week gang morons the usual ethnic entropy waiting for my reaction thats the only place i said there are a few others just like it farther down apollo if you like that kind of thing i like good then no were talking roacharama another pull of her hair lardencrusted pinto beans and shredded pork elevated to palatability only by abject starvation are you starving andrew never i said nothings worth that kind of selfdebasement precisement a corner of the ledger was visible on the shelf beneath the register and she pushed it in id rather dine than eat i said where do you go she bunched her lips creating a mocking rosebud is that a comeon i removed the tinted glasses rubbed my beard if you accept it was an invitation if you dont it was a factual inquiry guarding the old selfesteem eh honor bound to i said im a psychologist are you she looked away as if trying not to show interest clinical or experimental clinical do you practice around here i dont practice anywhere at the moment actually im abd all but degree all but degradation she said a quitter you bet proud of it are you neither proud nor ashamed i said as you said nonjudgmental i served my sentence in grad school learned primarily that psychology is crumbs of science mixed in with dollops of nonsense expositions of the obvious passed off as profundity before i took it further i decided to spend some time figuring out if i can live with that i raised the bag with the books ergo this ergo what unassigned reading not the pc swill they shove at you i want to decide for myself whether or not any of its relevant in terms of the aforementioned improvement putting a brake on the slippery slope toward mediocrity when i came in here i had no idea what you were about when i saw these rattling the bagthey said buy me she leaned forward elbows on the counter the slide toward mediocrity id say were well past that i was trying to be charitable dont be charity leads to delusion then again you are an almostpsychologist making you an almostkeeper of the sacred chalice of selfesteem or selfish steam i said depending upon your point of view she laughed too much more of this and id be ready to puke well a in answer to your question i tend to dine at a french joint in echo park la petite provençal and all that good stuff cassoulet its been known to appear on the menu maybe ill be lucky thanks maybe you will at that she halfclosed her eyes displaying blue lids so i said whats it to be invitation or factual inquiry the latter im afraid im working chained to the rock some boss looking over your shoulder hardly she said suddenly peeved its my store then why not fly i said as you said your customers know you im sure theyll forgive a brief absence her grin was wide but closemouthed almost regretful how do i know youre not some dangerous psychopath you dont i bared my teeth in a wolfish grimace a carnivore all animals werent created equal on the food chain another shake of the bag thats the point of all this isnt it is it she said for me it is z however if your sensibilities are bruised apologies she gave me a long hard look then pulled a key out of her jeans and locked the register ill fetch my purse and lock up meet you out front five minutes later she emerged rubbing her hands together and got in the karmann ghia all but drivability she said wrinkling her nose at the mess in back had i known id have brought the rolls the news was on the radio she said go fiddled with the dial until she found elevator music stretched her legs wiggled her toes in the open pink sandals looked behind no cops andrew make a u and get back to sunset then go east orders she stared out the open passenger window said nothing as i drove a block later she reached over and grabbed my crotch two squeezes and the hand was back at her hair stroking slowly she aimed the rearview mirror at herself and checked her lipstick was milo back there as she fooled with the radio dial again i prepared for anything but she placed her hands in her lap and turned to me looking smug honk honk guess thats why they call it goosing sauce for the gander ha dont go getting ideas a desmond im empowered to shop without buying im sure you shop and return whats that supposed to mean that youre a selective woman i said at least that would be my assumption whys that just a guess she wiggled her toes some more this could get interesting turn here no further conversation she kept staring out the passenger window sticking her head out from time to time to breathe in smoggy wind the rearview mirror remained askew i straightened it and took the opportunity to glance back lots of cars behind me but no way to know if milo was in any of them right here said zena she arched her back and i saw the outline of her nipples sharp and defined against pink polyester i hadnt noticed that in the store had she removed her bra i had a pretty good idea how shed captured malcolm ponsico from sally branch here she said la petite was misnamed a big mock chateau on a generous property more old la the only business in sight without a spanish sign the parking lot was nearly empty but the cars i saw were expensive redvested valets lounged near the porte cochere one of them held zenas door open and eyed the karmann ghia as if it were contagious the restaurants interior was a couple of lumens above pitchdark oak tables and ceiling beams leather booths impressionist copies dessert carts heaped with sculptural pastries on doilies suddenly i remembered the place id eaten there once fifteen years ago a hospital administrator with an expense account explaining why surgery was heroic and psychology wasnt but that i was expected to speak to the volunteer luncheon anyway because genteel women didnt want to know about scalpels and retractors up front was a trio of worriedlooking frenchmen in tuxedos they aimed cold looks of recognition at zena she walked ahead of me and announced two the baldest and oldest of the three stiffened said mademoiselle and snatched up a pair of huge tasseled menus before hurrying after zena as she headed for a remote corner booth her usual trysting place the maitre ds chilly expression congealed as he watched her snap her napkin open when i caught his attention he gave me the same appraisal bon apetit do you have cassoulet today she said no mademoiselle im afrai whats decent his smile was so pained it could have used anesthesia what did you have last time mademoiselle sole véronique but it was mushy mushy mushy soft flabby pulpous in need of another minute in the skillet which i saw to he grabbed his bow tie and entertained homicide very well i will inform the chef she smiled two ice waters with lemon while we decide and bring a bottle of a decent white wine decent he muttered a california wine she added chardonnay whatever year was decent when he was gone she said the french are such pompous fucks pomposity in the face of substance is one thing but theyre so fucking socially and intellectually bankrupt that its reduced to pathetic posturing obsessed with their moribund culture their snotnosed language in pathological denial of the fact that no one speaks it anymore because its linguistically anorexic how do you really feel about it she giggled by anorexic i said you mean not enough words oh therere enough words to order pressed duck she said but insufficient for anything serious as in technology whens the last time computer software originated in french its a beautiful language i said she laughed a mexican busboy brought water the chef she said more like a shortorder cook with no green card probably that ones uncle we were two feet apart in the booth and i could smell her perfume light floral oldfashioned probably french i smiled at her and she began to scoot farther away changed her mind and stayed put licking a finger she traced a vertical path down the frost on her water glass then another two lines she crossed them twice made a tictactoe board erased it as you can see she said i have my swiftpluspope days as well common ground if youre lucky i laughed what she said you dont lack confidence she arched her back again should i before i could answer a tiny hand clamped around my wrist small fingers all bones but soft at the tips hot like those of a child with a fever or too much enthusiasm should i lack confidence andrew id say no i said youre obviously endowed on many levels the hand tightened and i felt her nails digging into my arm am i intellectually and physically i said the hand loosened and her index finger began massaging the space between my thumb and forefinger small circular motions annoying but i didnt resist abruptly she pulled away maybe its psychological she said grinning my confidence that is all through my childhood my parents told me how wonderful i was good childrearing i said i didnt say they were good just free with the praise her voice had hardened i looked into her eyes in the weak light the blue irises were deep gray actually she said they were excellent brilliant educated people who taught me standards what about yours i shook my head wish i could say the same abused child tsktsk no i said but far short of excellent poor snookums she said his mummy didnt nurture him is that why you chose psychology probably probably you dont know im not much for selfanalysis i thought that was the point the point i said is to try to understand as much as you can of this psychotic world so you can do what you feel like i get into other peoples heads but stay away from my own crap if thats inconsistent so be it grumpy grumpy cher a im getting the feeling that you get off on conflict when things get too easy you lose interest correct i didnt answer true she said elbowing my arm hard as i said selfanalysis chafes z i picked up a menu what do you suggest refusing to play her lean face was rigid with anger then she smiled well she said merrily id go for the sole véronique i turned and stared at her not mushy today if it is we throw it in their fucking faces it was firm presented by the maitre d with a hateful flourish he studied me as i tasted then zena i nodded she kept eating he turned on his heel i watched her dissect the fish examining every forkful chewing slowly but steadily never pausing she finished and moved through the side dishes with silent drive and by the time id had enough shed cleaned her plate even the parsley another talent i said are you one of those men who thinks women shouldnt eat heaven forfend good i like to eat she sat back and wiped her lips and not an ounce ends up here patting a flat tummy i just burn calories a surfeit of energy you would have made a good cheerleader a flash of dentition spread across her face i was a great cheerleader snapping her fingers she began moving her head from side to side threw her arms up shaking imaginary pompoms a few more people had come into the restaurant but all had been seated in the adjoining room zena earning her privacy with past displays rah rah rah sisboomboom the other side stinks so clear the room you think youre cool you think youre hot were here to say youre definitely not her arms floated down slowly bracing i said high school where else the great crucible of cruelty pretty lame material but those were the days before you could get away with block that kick block that pass if that doesnt work just fuck em in the ass didnt know things had gotten that loose oh they have they have a complete lack of standards ergo the slippery slope were talking a return of the medieval age andrew the only difference being the new nobilitys that which earns it how intellectually i pretended to think about that she snapped her fingers at a busboy and demanded a mai tai i watched her suck it slowly through a straw one thing will never change the vast majority are relegated to serfdom serfs think they want freedom andrew but theyre incapable of dealing with it serfs need structure predictability someone to show them how to wipe their glutei how vast is the vast majority at least ninetynine percent and they get regulated by the remaining one percent you dont agree i guess that would depend upon which group i ended up in she laughed do you doubt your own abilities more feigned deliberation no i said and i agree with your assessment in principle things have deteriorated beyond belief i just hadnt come up with a number i thought thats what you psychologists were all about abd i said all but dogmatism she touched my hand briefly pulled away played with a black curl one percent is generous probably less than onehalf percent are qualified to make choices the maitre d came over and asked if everything was acceptable she waved him off and said maybe a third and even in that range some individuals wouldnt qualify because they lack conviction ive known people perceived to be geniuses who turned out to have all the backbone of an oyster is that so oh quite the requisite gray matter but no spine a tightening of her lips and i knew she meant malcolm ponsico keeping my voice even i said ideologically weak ideologically mushy she put her hand on my sleeve cher andrew a brain without a spine is only half a central nervous system but no matter were not here to fix societys problems true wed need lunch and dinner for that the faintest smile the mai tai was nearly gone and she sucked foam noisily then leaned over suddenly placed a frigid tongue tip on my cheek and traced a wet trail to my earlobe what are we here for andrew she whispered you tell me another cold tonguedart then a small painful bite of the lobe she snuggled closer nibbled i could hear her breathing rapid and shallow smell the alcohol on her breath she put her hand on my chin swiveled my face bit my lower lip pulled away pinched my thigh touched my knee she was arrogant disturbed pathetic quite possibly evil but dammit all of it had its effect and when she reached under the table and groped me again she found exactly what she wanted and it brought a triumphant grin to the plump pink lips then she pulled away took a gold lipstick tube and matching compact out of her purse made them pinker well youre an eager boy which creates a moral dilemma for me oh she smiled for the mirror the issue at hand is do i fuck the hell out of you today and risk having you think me a slattern or shall i let you simmer until your balls turn turquoise and then just maybe if you behave fuck the hell out of you and leave you begging for more her hand returned to my groin hello mr gander such problems i said call in the ethicists gently i removed her fingers and placed them on the seat take some time to figure it out then call me she stared at me outraged grabbed her glass nearly threw herself halfway down the booth and showed me her back i saw her neck muscles tighten and loosen i was dealing with something fragile easily bruised maybe more dangerous because of it take me back asshole zena fuck off suit yourself i stood hotfaced teeth clenched not having to fake it she started to slide out of the booth but i blocked her exit leaning over the table glaring down at her get the hell out of my ms thirdofapercent i whispergrowled because i dont feel like creaming my slacks right here ive failed you shouldnt the elite be a little more secure my tone made her flinch she was trying to outstare me but little things gave her away nostrils flexing spots of color sprouting on her face pink spots like a mild case of eczema her mouth trembled her nipples were bigger than ever poking at the pink fabric i threw cash on the table its been an experience lets go ill leave when im ready suit yourself i began walking out where the fuck do you think youre going somewhere without pressure z cant handle pressure can but prefer not to i kept going suddenly she was at my side grabbing my bicep with both hands clawing through tweed hold on dammit or ill rip your shirt off right here i stopped she moved around and faced me reached up and cupped my chin in one hand when robin stands on tiptoe she barely brings herself to eye level with me zena missed by several inches and her breasts were up against my abdomen our faces nearly touching someone watching might have thought it affectionate but she was squeezing my face too hard for affection and as i felt her nails graze my jawline i prepared to bleed such a tough boy she said such a tough tough boy whens the last time you were laid i dont keep records she laughed exactly as i thought okay ill attribute your lack of manners to drive level you deserve release my place ill show you how to get there i drove back to apollo with her sitting as close as the gearshift would allow one hand around my neck caressing idly as she hummed along with the bartok shed found on the radio her singing voice was coarse offkey i wanted to tell her to shut up tough boy she said obviously i need to be tender with you i smiled thinking what the hell am i going to do for all milos and daniels cautiousness nothing had prepared me for this i thought of robins goodbye two hours ago how far was i willing to go i tried to put it in perspective by picturing irits body among the trees latvinia hanging in the schoolyard raymonds bloody shoes the pain melvin myers had felt but what if this creature hadnt been part of that nutty but not dangerous lyrics the next corner she said make a left as i turned i allowed myself another lookaround for milo once again moderate traffic but no one followed me up the steep shady road lyric offered barely enough room for one car and i drove slowly trying to sort out my thoughts zena began to drum her fingers on my thigh keep going to the top i checked out the neighborhood houses to the right dry embankment to the left draped with cactus of all things between the homes was an eastern view that would have been stunning but for a saucershaped suspension of airborne filth hovering over the skyline all the way up she repeated sounding impatient right here okay now turn left over there thats rondo vista im a block up pull in right here the karmann ghia came to rest on a cracked cement pad it could have been any la hilltop neighborhood silent hot precarious houses of all sizes and designs unevenly tended facing the pad was a closed double garage next to that a flatroofed white box with blue wood trim in need of touchup leading to the blue door was a short walkway topped with corrugated fiberglass panels and lined with hanging spider plants most of them dead pink geraniums in a window box set on the ground werent doing well either a rusting hibachi sat near the front steps leaking orange onto the cement ma maison she said french is the language of physicality she kissed my cheek waited for me to open the passenger door then jumped out and marched ahead as she had in the restaurant bare arms swinging narrow hips swaying pink heels clacking she got to the door when i was ten feet behind and opened it then she stopped stared inside gave a small wave greeting someone and closed it merde andrew we are stymied whats going on she touched my face gently tsktsk the poor lad is suffused with lust and nowhere to spend guests andrew friends staying over they were supposed to be gone all day theyve changed their plans le grand dragorama but such is our reality i frowned so much for spontaneity so soddy my dear i kept the frown going she put a finger to her lip and looked at her watch i suppose she said glancing at the garage i could take you in there and give you a nice quick suck but such a shame to reduce our first collision to that wheres your place the fairfax district she studied me a taste for bagels a taste for cheap do you live alone of course you do but no it would take too long to get all the way to semitetown and back and i really must return to the shop the shop as if she were selling dainty things i said great she stood higher and pulled me down at the same time kissed my nose oh andrew ive done you wrong obviously it just wasnt meant to be thanks for lunch my pleasure was it another kiss softer on my chin yes i said very much so thats nice andrew youre being so gallant about this look at us standing here being so civil arent we both being wonderfully decent i laughed and she joined in i tell you dear she said placing a hand on my chest if the erotic moment hadnt passed i would have dragged you into the garage laid you across my friends car and sucked you to the root alas i drove her back to the store and this time she opened the door herself and jumped out bye andrew she said through the open window shall we meet again shall we shant we that depends upon whether or not youll settle for less than all of me meaning meaning in the very immediate future all i can offer you is social contact dear meaning the closest youll get to my precious parts might be a surreptitious grab punctuating the chitchat chitchat with your houseguests and others she gave a happykid grin ive scheduled a soiree andrew tomorrow night cocktails at nine oclock casual dress and you are now invited whats the occasion no occasion andrew a carpediem kind of thing good fellowship and social intercourse fun surely you remember fun with the top onethird of a percent are you sure i qualify oh andrew is this all too diffuse for you diffuse sharing me after weve worked ourselves up she squeezed her small torso farther into the car window and put my hand on her left breast pressing down so i squeezed the mound was unfettered small very soft the nipple a weapon piercing my palm i suppose ill have to take what i can get z she took the hand flung it off why doesnt that surprise me nine tomorrow byebye a the old charm works its wonders said milo stretching in the car not the unmarked a brown honda id never seen before pine boughs darkened the cars interior hed pulled up next to me at sunset and san vicente and told me to follow him the place he chose was in beverly hills the alley behind roxbury parks western border lots of toddlers and mothers and nannies the icecream man playing his jingle while dispensing popsicles and drumsticks plenty of parked cars no reason to notice ours if i needed an ego boost this wouldnt be it i said shes beyond aggressive aw dont sell yourself short little miss sex pistol huh both guns blazing ponsico must have been a trout in a bathtub its a good bet it was him she meant when she talked about brains without spine the dvll murders probably originated at a meta meeting maybe not the whole group just a splinter the scenario i like is that ponsico was enthusiastic in theory but when it came to action he got cold feet and disappointed her and her friends some of whom are staying over will probably be at the party tomorrow night add sangers trip tomorrow and it smells like a big night for meta and andrews invited he frowned whats wrong i worry when things go too well dont you think were finally due for some good luck on this one i suppose theres no way shed suspect anything milo the time we spent together was divided between intellectual pretentiousness and sex talk the sex came from her i played morose andrew as hard as i could without turning her off at one point i thought id gone too far i described zenas rage at perceived rejection lots of talk about how wonderful she is but at the core shes fragile fragile he said or just a rotten temper the two often go together the point is for all her posturing about being brilliant and sexy and slender and peppy she lives in a shabby house and runs a bookstore with very few customers the whole femmefatale bit had a pathetic edge to it milo it didnt take much to touch a nerve she also called high school a crucible of cruelty meaning she probably hadnt been miss popular cheerleader she was so upset when i moved her hand away it actually blemished her face that kind of volatility could have spelled bad news for ponsico other people too now youre saying ponsico was killed because he offended her personally i thought it was because he betrayed meta maybe it was both i said someone like zena might not separate the two one things for certain shes a eugenics fan my buying the books is what caught her attention and it didnt take long before she offered her views on the elite and the masses my two purchases were on the dashboard hed thumbed through them mr galton and mr neogalton he said nasty stuff nasty store speaking of which we cant find any business partners sharavi managed to trace her parents lancaster mothers dead and her fathers a groundskeeper at santa anita racetrack has a drinking problem no trust fund she said her folks were educated brilliant more posturing she may be smart but shes not too educated herself lancaster high less than a year of junior college then she worked at kmart before getting the job at plasmoderm and listen to this when she was in jc she signed up as a police scout with the lancaster sheriffs she wanted to join the force but was too small anything weird on her academic record no she spent half a year dropped out underachiever it fits our profile i said so does her being a police wannabe id never have thought of a woman in those terms a woman with pals alex no way would she have been physically able to pull off any of the murders by herself maybe the pals whore staying at her house yeah and maybe pals who fund the store the loomis foundation wouldnt that be nice what if after the flap about sangers article meta shifted its emphasis to la i said sanger could be the groups bagman and hes flying out tomorrow to deliver cash mr mossads working on untangling their accounting well see what he comes up with heard from him on the trade school yet nope he blew smoke rings out the window the icecream man drove away lots of pintsized satisfied customers so cute everybody starts off cute i said i skimmed as many books as i could but found nothing on dvll but some of them had no index and i couldnt cover everything in detail if i stay friendly with zena after the party ill have an excuse to get back to the store he flicked ashes and rubbed his face youve done good work alex but theres a bad smell to this youre sure you want to stick with it if it means getting a closer look at meta i do my main concern is how to avoid zena when she decides she does want to take me into the garage and yank down my pants tell her youve got herpes its a little late for that and besides this woman would check ill figure out something well dont do anything youll regret even lapd has its standards i thought of nolan dahls timeouts with teenage hookers how close were you following me i was at the store before you got there parked two blocks up apollo used some zeiss binocs sharavi gave me and had a clear view of you going in and coming out with her she looks a lot different than the picture sharavi gave me the hair but her size was the tipoff her body language was affectionate so i figured it was going well when you left for the restaurant i was four cars behind you while you ate french food i had a bad burrito in the car such sacrifice yeah workmens comp time when you left the restaurant i followed you but when you turned up lyric i held back because its a quiet road and i didnt want to be conspicuous daniel supply the car he nodded one of the things that smells bad alex is the layout in terms of maintaining a close watch too damn isolated too damn quiet and her house is at the top no way to get above it so you did drive up there i waited a few minutes drove to where rondo vista splits off from lyric and stayed on lyric where i parked about a hundred feet down then i went on foot i had on a uniform gas company and a stickon gascompany sign for the car door i was carrying one of those little meter gizmos no reason for anyone to give me a second look but theres a limit to that kind of thing alex gas guys dont show up often i ambled from house to house managed to catch you getting back in the karmann ghia never spotted you i was two houses down peeking around some plants zenas body language was even better bigtime hots so i figured you werent in any immediate danger but i dont like it its just a party i said the elite and me the biggest threat will be her hormones friday night daniel hated working on sabbath back in israel before joining the police force hed consulted his father a learned man about the issue abba yehesqel had sought the counsel of rav yitzhak a ninetyyearold yemenite hakham and received a quick answer the law was clear saving a life took precedence over shabbat as with military duty when police work involved a lifeordeath situation not only was daniel permitted to work he was obligated over the years hed used the ruling sparingly working extra hours on weekdays in order to free up friday night and saturday not hesitating of course to go fullforce on things like the butcher rapists suicide bombers as he climbed the ranks and was given more administrative duties in lieu of streetwork it became easier the only advantage of becoming a pencil pusher now here he was at the airport sitting at the wheel of a yellow cab at the pickupzone of the american airlines terminal back in jerusalem hed be praying in the tiny ancient yemenite synagogue near the old city even if he hadnt been on the job hed have avoided group worship here needing to maintain the lowest of profiles not wanting to have to reject some wellmeaning shulgoer who learning he was an israeli software technician consulting to some anonymous company out in the valley just had to have him over for shabbat early this morning hed called laura and the kids telling them hed be back as soon as possible but not knowing what that really meant his eldest eighteenyearold shoshana was home for the weekend furloughed from nationalservice assignment up in kiryat shemona assigned to a mentalhealth clinic where she tried to comfort small children terrorized by hezbollah bombs from lebanon ive been thinking abba maybe ill study psychology in university youre wellsuited for it motek the kids are so cute abba im finding out that i like helping people you always had a talent for it they talked a bit more then she told him she loved him and missed him and went to get the boys as he waited he fantasized introducing her to delaware someday getting her some career guidance from the psychologist daddy arranging things for her with his contacts delaware would be happy to help the more he worked with the guy the more he liked him that intense drive and focus abba mikeys twelveandahalfyearold voice still unchanged burst from the receiver six months away from bar mitzvah a big party to be arranged lauras parents wanted the laromme hotel then bennys bar mitzvah a year after that a busy period coming up for the sharavis something to look forward to hey mike hows the studying going its okay suddenly downcast not the student his sister was the boy would have preferred to be playing soccer all day and daniel felt bad for bringing it up but the bar mitzvah meant memorizing a torah portion to be read in synagogue too bad his father wouldnt be there to see it im sure youre doing great mike i dont know abba just my luck to get the longest portion in the entire chumash not the longest heman but definitely long maybe god gave you that birthdate because he knew you could handle it i doubt it ive got a brain made out of marble your brain is fantastic mikey sos your heart and your muscles hows soccer great we won the boys tone lifted and they stayed on sports til it was bennys turn the little one once wild as an old city cat was now studious like shoshi math was his thing a gentle voice talking to his family gentled daniels soul the arrangement with petra connor was clear the female detective dressed in an alaskan airlines flightattendants uniform and equipped with a carryon suitcase with pushme handle was to hang around the terminal read a paperback and keep her eyes out for the new york lawyer in the suitcase among other things was a cellular phone preset to the one in daniels taxi once sangergalton deplaned she was to stick with him once she became aware of his luggage status carryon versus checkedthrough she was to phone daniel if sangergalton picked up a rental car shed notify daniel of the company make model and license number and try to reach her borrowed car a dark green ford escort in time to join in and create a twoperson tail likewise if some friend was there to greet the attorney if sangergalton needed a taxi and daniel ended up being his driver daniel would call petra and report his destination pretending to be contacting the dispatcher if some other driver snagged the fare daniels tail would be hampered and petra would have to take the lead and wait til daniel avoided another fare and made it out of the airport one way or another the wouldbe eugenicist was covered nothing from petra yet she seemed good quiet serious all business so far all the la people hed met were good zevs experience notwithstanding shabbat still he was happy to be doing something especially after the wasted afternoon at melvin myerss trade school nothing strange about the place they truly did seem to be training handicapped people to get jobs he hadnt been able to get to darlene grosperrin settling for a brief interview with a young socialwork assistant named veronica yee each of them thinking the other was the subject smiling courteous ms yee had taken a brief history and told him the school was wellestablished twenty years old funded mostly by government money offering a full range of educational services including job and psychological counseling and yes they would probably have something for him but not until the new term began in two months he was welcome to fill out the application and get back to them handing him a sheaf of papers the application government pamphlets on rights of the handicapped availability of educational grants publicrelations stuff on the school hed looked for some sign that melvin myerss death had caused an impact a funeral notice memorial service anything and had found only an announcement on the bulletin board we regret to announce letters and braille it had given him the opportunity to work myers into the conversation with ms yee shed said yes he was murdered downtown terrible i have to be honest with you it is a tough neighborhood mr cohen honest open nothing to report the taxi in front of him edged up the line and he rolled forward hed waited until the queue stretched beyond the pickup area before taking a position at the back hoping things stayed slow and he wouldnt reach the front before sanger arrived then be forced to zoom past a fare attracting attention the phone rang hes here the plane arrived early said petra no one met him at the gate a briefcase a carryon and a wardrobe so he probably didnt check anything through ill make sure hes getting on the moving sidewalk im thirty feet in back of him hes big about milos size wearing a blue blazer with gold buttons khaki slacks dark blue polo shirt dark hair slicked back tortoiseshell glasses heavy face the carryon and briefcase are olive green and the wardrobes black okay were at the end now hes definitely bypassing the carousel heading for avis looks like hes got paperwork already prepared something else daniels sources hadnt come up with maybe sanger had used one of those airfones set up the car rental while in flight hes filling out an express form said petra im pretending to be using a pay phone across the hall will let you know when he heads for the avis lot sangers car was a brown oldsmobile cutlass and as it headed east on century boulevard daniels taxi was just ahead both vehicles eased into the traffic and daniel switched to the left lane and slowed allowing sanger to get ahead managing to get a look at the lawyer through the drivers window sanger looked big sitting high in the seat serious expression smooth ruddy cheeks well into the jowl stage soft around the jowls a thick rosy nose a cigarette dangled from his lips already halfsmoked he drove quickly inattentively flicking ashes out the window daniel followed him toward the airports outer reaches passing freight depots commercial hangars commuter hotels importexport sheds nudie bars im on century approaching aviation said petra how far ahead are you approaching the freeway daniel told her were making good time hes getting on the freeway headed for looks like north yes north were on the freeway now merging sanger stayed in the slow lane for a couple of minutes then shifted one lane over and maintained a steady speed of sixty from daniels perspective traffic was ideal light enough for movement no jamups with the unpredictability that could bring yet sufficiently dense to give him three carlengths cover whod notice a taxi sanger went past the santa monica freeway interchange and exited shortly after on santa monica boulevard east he took the lightly traveled street past century city into beverly hills turned left on beverly drive and drove north through the wide residential street lined with mansions trailing him here was a little trickier and daniel had to work a bit to keep a jaguar and a mercedes between the taxi and the brown cutlass petra had just called in she was a halfmile back stopped at the beverlysanta monica light sanger crossed sunset and drove straight into the entrance of the beverly hills hotel refurbished recently by some oil sultan reputed to be the richest man in the world years ago during his olympic assignment daniel had done some security work at the hotel guarding a cabinet ministers wife in a bungalow finding the place amazingly pink somewhat decrepit still pink even brighter the israeli consulate threw no parties here because the sultan was antiisrael plenty of bar and bat mitzvahs though pink and shiny sanger had stayed here last time but hed have thought an east coast corporate lawyer would have chosen something quieter maybe when he came here he went hollywood the notie look for sanger supported that theory preparing for zena lamberts casualdress party without telling milo daniel had driven up zenas street this morning early before the trade school opened hoping for a look at this strangesounding woman as she left the small white house with the blue trim maybe with one of her guests maybe the garage door would be open and he could copy down a licenseplate number no such luck but it was good that hed seen the site firsthand verifying what milo had said about a tough surveillance situation hed been driving a pickup truck at the time a lawn mower and other gardening equipment in the bed with his dark skin hed be pegged as a mexican gardener and rendered for all intents invisible not a longterm solution because there wasnt much gardening to do up there mostly concrete pads like zenas instead of lawns and the sloping hillside lots in back were untendable he sped away mentally rationing his time thinking about when and how to return to rondo vista wondering about the boundaries of loyalty parking the cab at the mouth of the sloping hotel driveway he climbed toward the entrance just in time to see a bellman hold the brown cutlasss door open for sanger then open the trunk and take out the two pieces of luggage sanger breezed through the main entrance seemingly unaware as the doorman held the door open for him accustomed to being served the luggage followed moments later daniel retreated down the drive walked to sunset and when the light turned green crossed the boulevard by foot on the south side beverly and crescent and canon met in a confusing intersection the hub was a park where daniel had once taken his children to see the florentine fountain spouting into a pond full of japanese carp fish like delawares now however the fountain was dry and most of the flowers he remembered were gone he waited at the south edge until petra arrived petra entered the hotel her flightattendants uniform minus wings and insignia was just another tailored suit and with her short dark hair finefeatured face and discreet makeup she looked like just another beverly hills working woman the black crocodile valise said a very wellemployed working woman she strode confidently to the front desk the lobby was crowded lots of checkins mostly japanese tourists several harriedlooking clerks male and female prettyfaces were on duty typing dispensing keys petra waited in one of the lines allowed an old japanese man to go past her so she could get a male clerk nicelooking guy blond struggling actor yawn yawn the poor dear was clicking away miserable through his smile she looked at her watch im from deyoung and rubin with the delivery for mr galton has he checked in yet blondie gave her a halfsecond lookover then a real smile as he tapped computer keys frank galton she added a little more impatient he phoned from the plane said hed be in by now yes he is just arrived shall i call him for you chest tightening petra checked her watch again no need hes expecting this said to have you bring it right up blondie looked past her at the undiminished line petra tapped her nails on the granite counter okay ill do it what room three fourteen said the clerk refusing eye contact thanks daniel lit up the offduty sign and moved his taxi to hartford way on the west side of the hotel where he exchanged it for the gray toyota and changed into an olivegreen uniform with the name ahmed embroidered over the pocket petra had a coke in the hotel bar avoiding the stares of men making several trips to the third floor the third time daniel was up there too holding a broom and she returned to the lobby and read a newspaper looking allbusiness at pm daniel saw a roomservice waiter bring farley sanger a club sandwich a heineken and coffee no food at the party going late to the party he phoned petra and told her he was returning to the toyota to let him know if sanger came downstairs circling the hotel property slowly at just as he pulled up to the mouth of the drive for the fifth time petra called still no sign of him maybe hes not going to the party after all maybe indeed thought daniel was this whole evening like so much police work a wrong guess based on fine logic by daniel was ready to believe the lawyer had turned in for sanger still on east coast time it was in the morning give it another hour to be safe five minutes later petra said here we go hes wearing a light gray sportcoat black shirt black slacks daniel thanked her and started his taxi told her to have a nice night sure you dont need me she said im fine thanks stay on call she didnt argue understood that one strange car near the house on rondo vista was enough at the lawyer pulled out onto sunset going east and daniel was ready for him sanger stayed on the boulevard leaving beverly hills and cruising the strip the sunset plaza boutique district continuing into hollywood where marble and granite and sultans fortunes were the last things on anyones mind daniel could see him well enough to know the lawyer was smoking steadily progressing from one cigarette to another flicking stilllit butts out the window where they sparked on the asphalt the scenery was ancillary film businesses photoprocessing places color labs sound studios plus convenience and liquor stores cheap motels with the requisite prostitutes out front cruising for something the wife back in manhattan would never know about a little fun before the party wouldnt that be interesting but no sanger kept looking but never stopped smoking his third cigarette since leaving the hotel and that briefcase said business they stopped at a red light at the fountain intersection and daniel prepared himself for a right turn toward apollo but when the light changed sanger stayed on sunset speeding up continuing east toward a sparkle of lights in the distance downtown daniel stayed with him under the pasadena freeway overpass to figueroa figueroa south to seventh street seventh to the corner of flower where sanger parked in a paylot got out looked around for several seconds and began walking down the street financial buildings now dark and deserted sanger looked a bit nervous checking over his shoulder glancing from side to side holding the green briefcase close to his body that much cash in a tough neighborhood daniel parked across the street in another lot watched sanger stop at a sixstory limestone building the lobby was lit faintly but enough for daniel to see charcoal granite with discreet gold trim the shock of recognition this time a uniformed security guard sat behind the small desk sanger stood at the locked double doors tapped a foot until the security guard saw him opened the doors and escorted him in surprise surprise daniel sat in his car trying to make sense of it friday night party time i left the house at seven spending some time at the genesee apartment wanting to get used to the place in case zena had the impulse to come here to semitetown robin had asked me what zena was like and id said only weird just what youd expect robin and i had made love at six because she wanted to and i wanted to and i had another reason anything that weakened the reflexive response to zena was welcome it made me feel dishonest four murders maybe five helped me live with it i sat on andrews dusty couch listening to andrews music thumbing through andrews books then twisted science the first few pages of the late professor eustaces essay on the loomis foundation eustaces tone went well beyond academic criticism as he accused the group of racist underpinnings exploiting slave labor in asia funding diploma mills in order to churn out eugenic foot soldiers apex university keystone graduate center new dominion university id set my watch for pm and it chimed placing the book under the mattress i went out to the garage and pulled out the karmann ghia childrens voices filled the block and the smells of supper drifted from nearby buildings edging into the alley i drove up fairfax to sunset and traveled east very slowly twentyfive minutes later i was at apollo and lyric well past the cocktail hour late enough i hoped for me to be lost in the activity and able to observe enough activity to occupy the hostess the soupedup karmann ghia chewed its way up the nearly black road treacherous if someone came barreling down from the summit the parked cars began well before the corner of rondo vista and i had to pull over and continue on foot i tried on the tinted glasses the night rendered them hazardous and i returned them to my pocket and continued on inspecting the cars average cars no vans a few lights shone from neighbors windows but most were dark night wind had blown away some of the smog and blades of view between the properties sparkled as i got closer to zenas house i heard music calypso just like in the bookstore bongos and happy vocals just another hillside party who were these people how many of them if any were killers murdering out of some warped notion of genetic cleansing or just for fun or both there was precedent for that kind of thing seventy years ago two young men with stratospheric iq scores had stabbed to death an innocent fourteenyearold boy in chicago motivated they claimed by the challenge of pulling off the perfect motiveless crime leopold and loeb had been sexually twisted psychopaths and i was willing to bet the dvll crimes had roots in something beyond intellectual exercise id reached the whiteandblue house lights poked through drawn drapes but barely turning i sighted down the road at the line of parked cars had milo already arrived copied down license numbers sent them along to daniel for a quick screen calypso shifted to stravinsky the exact same tape from the bookstore frugal probably cheap booze too no matter i wouldnt be drinking the door was locked and i had to ring several times before it opened the man in the doorway was in his middle thirties with a bushy wheatcolored beard and a crew cut he wore a gray sweatshirt and brown pants was holding a glass of something yellow and filmy small alert eyes small unsmiling mouth he held the door open just wide enough to accommodate his wiry frame rough hands dirty nails behind him the room was dotted with a few colored lights but otherwise dark i caught a glimpse of faces moving mouths but the music pounded blotting out conversation yes i saw the word couldnt hear it andrew desmond zena invited me he held up a finger and closed the door i stood there for several minutes before zena came out she wore a fulllength dress royal blue silk crepe printed with tangerinecolored orchids longsleeved low neckline no waistline generously cut i supposed it was a muumuu probably vintage on a large woman it might have looked tentlike but the filmy fabric flowed over her tiny body heightening a sharp pelvis and somehow lengthening her making her appear taller loose and flowing easier access to the precious parts i was starting to wonder about you she said fashionably late i shrugged looked down at her feet again in highheeled sandals pink toenails threeinch heels she was able to kiss me without straining just a peck her lips were supple then she took my chin as she had in the restaurant and her tongue impelled itself between my lips i offered some tooth resistance then let her in her hand dropped cupped my butt and squeezed she moved back taking my hand twisting the doorknob all those who enter abandon all hope of what boredom she took my hand the house was packed the music well past loud and into painful as she led me through the crowd i tried to look the place over without being obvious just past the entry were two doors a bathroom designated le pissoir by a computerprinted sign and an unmarked one that was probably a closet an unrailed staircase led downstairs like many hillside homes bedrooms on the lower floor a grayhaired woman in a black dress with a white peter pan collar waited edgily near the lav not looking up as we passed the jam of bodies was bathed in stravinsky and barely illuminated some people danced others stood and talked managing to communicate despite the din the colored lights were christmas bulbs strung from the lowbeamed ceiling and they did little but blink in opposition to the rite of spring i saw shadows rather than people no other signs or banners nothing identifying it as a meta bash what did i expect zena dragged me forward the other partygoers moved aside with varying degrees of cooperation but no one seemed to notice us the house was smaller than i would have guessed the entire second floor just one main room a waisthigh counter sectioning off a twostep kitchen to the right every inch of counter was filled with plastic soda bottles bags of ice beer cans packages of paper plates plastic utensils what i could see of the walls was hung with prints in metal frames florals nothing telling it didnt seem like zenas style but who knew how often she reinvented herself one thing was certain she wasnt into decorating the few pieces of furniture i saw werent much better than andrews and the books that filled two walls sat in flimsylooking shelves nearly identical to his spooky prescience on daniels part if he ever tired of police work a career as a matchmaker awaited zenas hand burned my fingers as she continued to guide me past a long folding table covered with white paper behind it were yet more people eating and drinking then the only feature elevating the house above lowrent crackerbox glass doors onto a balcony beyond them a symphony of stars manmade constellations twinkling from houses half a mile across a darkened ravine and the real stuff set into a melanin sky dropdead view a realestate agent would claim working mightily to show the place at night as we neared the food i played passive and managed a rough body count sixty seventy people enough to congest the modest room i looked for farley sanger even if hed been there id have been unlikely to spot him in the darkened crush sixty seventy strangers as averagelooking as their cars men seemed to outnumber women the age range thirty to midfifties no one particularly ugly no raving beauties it might have been a casting call for nondescript but an active bunch fastmoving mouths a mass lipsynch lots of gesturing posturing shrugs grins and grimaces fingerstabs of emphasis i spotted the thickly bearded man whod answered the door off in a corner by himself sitting on a folding chair holding a can of pepsi and a paperback book worrying a fold of his sweatshirt he looked up saw me stared returned to reading with the intensity of a finalscrammer nearby two other men one in a baggy tan suit and plaid tie the other wearing an untucked white shirt and khakis sat at a tiny table playing silent chess and smoking as my eyes accommodated i noticed other games going on the edges of the room another chess match a woman and a man moving pieces quickly and fiercely a minuteglass filled with rapidly sifting white sand next to the womans left hand a few feet away yet more table warfare scrabble cards backgammon go something that resembled chess but was played on a cubelike plastic frame by two bespectacled mustached men wearing black who could have been twins threedimensional chess on the near side of the kitchen partition two other men did something intense with polished stones and dice and a mahogany chute how did anyone concentrate with the noise then again these were smart people we made it to the drinks the white paper was a butchers roll cut unevenly soda beer bottled water offbrands of scotch vodka bourbon corn chips and pretzels salsa and guacamole and shrimp dip still in plastic containers zena used a chip to excavate the avocado paste came up with a healthy green blob ate scooped again and aimed the construction at my mouth good she mouthed excellent grinning and fluffing her bangs she blew me a kiss reached out and took hold of my belt buckle and tilted her head at the glass doors her eyes were the brightest thing in the room she led me out to the balcony and closed the doors a dull roar so the neighbors dont shit themselves it was quieter out here but we werent alone about a dozen people shared the balcony but no turning heads or vigilant eyes lots of conversation i tried to make out words heard economy texture bifurcation mode of deconstruction zena maneuvered me into the lefthand corner and i felt the railing press into my back not much of a railing thin iron top and bottom pieces connected by widely spaced diagonal pickets a large man would have had trouble slipping through but anyone else would have found it easy zena pushed up against me and the metal bit deeper the air was warm the view stunning maybe that made it the partys romance zone because right next to us another couple made out feverishly the man was beefy balding middleaged wore a tweed jacket too small around the shoulders it rode up over corduroy slacks his playmate was a few years younger fairhaired bespectacled with a thin face but thick arms that jiggled in a sleeveless white dress as she masturbated her boyfriends lapel he said something her hands flew around his neck and they kissed again next to them three men argued heatedly about modems software morons on the internet how the meaning of cyber had been distorted from norbert wieners original conception zena turned my head and jammed her mouth against mine no one noticed the apathy was comforting but also disappointing because what did it say about my conspiracy ruminations a murder club what i was seeing were some folk who craved sex and chitchat checkmate tripleword scores whatever you aimed for in threedimensional chess sixty seventy people how many killers if any the lovebirds next to us continued to go at it even as the debating trio raised the volume one man nearly shouting zenas tongue continued to explore my palate my hands were on her shoulders when had i placed them there her tongue withdrew regrouping for another attack and i pulled away and massaged the back of her neck such a small delicate neck then her shoulder i could feel the bumps on her collarbone smiling to camouflage the retreat i said nice party thanks for inviting me thank you for coming sir what exactly is the occasion who needs an occasion okay i said whats the organizing criterion she laughed merrily guided my hand downward across crepe wedging it between her legs i felt heat the butter of upper thigh then a crinkly patch that puckered the silk no panties no there was something there a waistband but very sheer very low bikini pants why the hell was i conjecturing she tightened her muscles capturing my fingers her eyes were closed her mouth had parted and i smelled gin one pinknailed hand had gathered the fabric of my sportcoat as the other began moving down not again i played a frantic mental slide show dead faces bloody shoes filthy alleys grieving parents i stayed soft she looked up at me on her smooth white face was that same flash of narcissistic rage i removed her hand took hold of her face kissed her when we stopped for breath her confusion was gratifying all these people i said shaking my head im not into displays i glanced at the passionate couple now edging toward the glass doors her lower lip twitched she nodded i understand a i turned placed my hands on the railing and pretended to study the view lots of black between the house and the twinkles anything could be out there she moved next to me put her head against my arm and i slipped my arm around her and touched her cheek the necking couple had left but the threeman debate was still raging two women came out holding plastic cups laughing and moved to the opposite end of the balcony i repeat my original question z whats the occasion not simply a collection of friends i felt her tense up why do you say that because these people dont act like your friends i rubbed her neck harder slower and she shivered no ones paying you any attention and youre rather hard to ignore so they must have their own agendas her fingers reached under my jacket and kneaded my tailbone oh i dont know about that being hard to ignore oh i do z any bunch that shines you on is either pathologically selfcentered or dead lifting her hair i nuzzled the place where the fine strands met smooth neck flesh theyre acquaintances she said think of them as kindred spirits ah i said the intellectual elite as a matter of fact yes based upon what criterion valid and reliable measurement andrew designed by psychologists oh my why am i not convulsing with awe she laughed i think we could be even more selective but its a start a smart club i said and you provide the house she stared at me tonight i am and thats my sole obligation leaving me free for my own entertainment she grabbed my chin again nasty habit tickled my lower lip with a fingernail well i said i feel privileged to be in such exalted company without even passing the test youve passed mine thank you maam i shall apply for a federal grant based upon that such cynicism she smiled but there was something tentative wounded in her voice still caressing her i turned away and fixed my attention on the houses across the canyon the air was a strange mixture of pollution and pines fun fun fun i said youre not an ascetic are you andrew one of those new age killjoys what does ascetism have to do with cynicism according to milton quite a bit he wrote a poem about thatand fetch their precepts from the cynic tub praising the lean and sallow abstinence lean and sallow i said havent checked my complexion in the mirror recently but believe me i know very well that abstinence does not make the heart grow fonder she laughed i couldnt agree more what im getting at is you seem so oppositional i feel a certain resistance she pressed closer i kept gazing straight ahead then turned looked down at her and took hold of her shoulders the truth is z ive been socially deformed too many years of listening to neurotics whine i can understand that she said can you then understand that parties bring out the worst in me i came tonight because i wanted to see you that makes anyone else twolegged refuse her breathing quickened how say we arrange some quiet time i said are you free tomorrow i tightened my grip on her shoulders she felt breakable so easy to hurt then i thought about malcolm ponsico and had to restrain myself from squeezing tighter i what about finding some quiet time right here andrew i cocked my head toward the packed room on the other side of the glass youve got to be kidding im not she said downstairs my bedroom she closed her eyes come on let me show you my stuffed animals brilliant delaware now what she dragged me across the balcony and back through the room a few heads turned but still no real interest up front the bathroom door was now ajar lights left on and she shut it as we passed taking me down the stairs rickety the steps quivered under our weight at the bottom was another closetbath combo and a single bedroom door she reached for the knob twisted frowned fuck looks like someone beat us to it fuck fuck fuck a tiny fist beat the air theyre not supposed to do that i should pound til they oh fuck it cursing then shaking her head she ran up the stairs and i followed i said i suppose the elite makes its own rules stop ridiculing already im sopping wet and all you want to do is make fun you misanthropic bastard id rather have fun than make fun but its obvious this is not our night so consider my original invitation tomorrow or even tonight after your soiree winds down come over to my place and ill assure you privacy i touched her hair god she said punching my chest very softly and looking at my zipper god that sounds good but i cant dammit whos playing hard to get now its not that ive got to clean up set my houseguests up by the time they get settled its just complicated a poor baby i said drawing her to me all those responsibilities to whats the name of this club anyway whats the difference she said more weary than cagey all those responsibilities to the whats the difference club she smiled all right then z tomorrow it is if you put me off further ill know our karmafatecosmicalgorithmwhatever is accursed she put her arms around my waist even with the heels she fit under my chin breasts poking my stomach so whats the answer yes she said fuck yes i told her id be using the bathroom and then leaving so early she said if i stay i turn venomous what time tomorrow at night ten she said i began reciting the genesee address no you come back here she said my guests depart tomorrow i want you here on my bed you and me and the stuffed animals ill show you stuffed all right ill show you things you never imagined fine i said the stage doesnt matter only the performers you bet she said im a star one long deep kiss and she was off a blue flame burning through the crowd i went into the bathroom cramped and papered in brown foil printed with silver flowers cracked white tile atop the vanity no window the stench of too many recent visits poorly dispelled by a noisy overhead fan closing the commode i sat on the lid and collected my thoughts id been here just over an hour and gotten nothing not even metas name because what she was interested in was bedding me not recruiting i could still taste her tongue and the scent of her perfume stayed with me i sensed it mentally rather than actually smelled it i rinsed my mouth out with tap water and spit if i went home tonight robin would ask how things had gone id say boring the girl was crazy this was probably how female vice cops felt standing on corners waiting for hungry frightened men to drive up and barter but it was wrong to think of her as pathetic rather than dangerous had malcolm ponsico made that mistake kill the pity stop thinking like a therapist time to get back call milo decide how much further this should be taken i rose washed my hands and opened the door saw movement to my left two people coming up the stairs zenas bedroom door open but no lovers emerging from a tryst first came the wheatbearded crewcut guy in the gray sweatshirt still grim he shot me another stare i pretended not to notice had we met there was something familiar then i saw the man behind him and turned my back heart racing trying not to show the fear i felt heading at a normal but steady pace toward the front door a split second had been long enough to register the details older man in a white silk sportcoat short brown hair silver temples tan face gold eyeglasses athletic gait solid build drinks at the marina calamari and a fine cigar sergeant wesley baker nolan dahls training officer and now i knew where id seen the bearded man i was out the door now breath stuck somewhere down in my chest walking down the black street as fast as i could on icecold legs forcing myself to take slow deep lungfuls of the sweet dirty air i drove the hell out of there at sunset and vine i called milos cell phone with the one daniel had given me where are you fifty feet behind you he said you didnt stay long i told him why baker he said and i knew he was remembering bakers love of games the pornstuffed locker sure he didnt see you alex i cant be sure but i dont think so it makes some other things fall into place lets talk somewhere private go home ill meet you which home which do you want andrews place i said this could take time and there are things robin doesnt need to hear at genesee i put the karmann ghia in the garage and was inside the apartment just before midnight past robins bedtime but i called her anyway certain the conversation would be monitored by whoknewhowmany people at the israeli consulate hullo hi hon were you asleep no waiting she said stifling a yawn scuse me where are you alex the apartment i may be here for a while if things stretch too late i may just stay here by the way this is a hightech party line oh she said so when will you know if youre coming home why dont you just assume i wont be ill call you as soon as i can just wanted to say i love you love you too if you can make it home please do alex i will the main thing is youre safe absolutely i said i made instant coffee in the kitchen and sat on the dusty couch baker the bearded man houseguests how many others had farley sanger been at the party vehicle in the garage chevy van because i remembered wilson tenneys driverslicense photo midthirties midsized cleanshaven long light brown hair cut the hair grow a beard someone besides me had been aiming for disguise baker and tenney and zena maybe others a killing club zenas place a refuge their safe house i thought of the atmosphere at the party eat drink make merry no paranoia no suspicion most of the meta people had no idea what the splinter group was doing for fun games tenney had removed himself from the action sitting in a corner alone reading as hed done at the park where raymond was abducted your basic loner going downstairs with wes baker impromptu conference of the club within a club a tight little murderous cell baker and tenney in zenas bedroom behind a locked door zena had been angry but she hadnt protested knowing she was outranked baker the leader because of his charisma and his police experience a teacher a trainer in police technique who better to subvert the police teacher and students baker and nolan code for hookers something worse two cops in a park a young girl strangled and left stretched out on the ground sweeping up easy job for two strong men could it be i thought of nolans suicide so public so selfdebasing executing himself in front of the enemy like every suicide a message this one said soulrotting strangulating guilt the ultimate atonement for unredeemable sin a lawandorder guy a smidgen of conscience had remained and the magnitude of his violation came to haunt him hed passed sentence on himself but something didnt fit if nolan was aiming for expiation why hadnt he gone public exposed the others prevented more bloodshed because baker and the others had some kind of hold on him the photos onduty liaisons with teenage hookers polaroids left in a family album placed there deliberately for helena to find not by nolan by people who didnt want her to probe further breakins at nolans place and helenas house days apart now it seemed ridiculously coincidental why hadnt it bothered me then because burglaries in la were as commonplace as bad air because helena was my patient and i couldnt talk about what went on in therapy unless lives were at stake so id denied it had worked so well shutting my mouth driving helena out of therapy out of town but no it still didnt make sense if nolan had been consumed by guilt over murder dirty pictures wouldnt have stopped him from incriminating the others i was still struggling with it when milo rang the bell he was carrying his vinyl attaché and sat right down next to me theres something i need to tell you i said i know dahl when you told me about baker my mind went on overdrive he unzipped the case removed a sheet of paper and gave it to me heres why it took me an hour to get here photocopy of some kind of chart horizontal grid on the upper threequarters several columns below a tendigit numerical code and the heading daily field activities report at the bottom a series of boxes filled with numbers the top columns were labeled spec survey obs asgd act time of day survey source and code location of all activities type of activity supervisor at scene booking citation bakers name in every supervisor slot baker and nolans work log i said daily report the dfar said milo theyre handed in at the end of each shift stored in the station for a year then moved downtown these are baker and dahls for the day irit was murdered everything in perfect block letters the time notated militarily w la roll call to signoff neat writing i said baker always printed like a draftsman compulsive the type to sweep up he growled i read the report first calls a suppression armed robbery he nodded wilshire near bundy i went on it lasted nearly an hour then a call disturbing the peace right it could mean anything this one was near the country mart but see here where it says no found under type of activity and no booking data in column it didnt pan out he stabbed the paper with his index finger after that they did traffic stops ten of em in a row baker was always one for giving lots of tickets then another noarrest in the palisades then lunch at i said three pm late lunch they list no code s all day if its true they were due for a break my eyes dropped to the final notation before checkout another noaction at i said sunset near barrington are false calls that common common enough and its not only false calls lots of times s end up just being an argument between two citizens the officers calm em down and move on no arrests i scanned the sheet again there are no details on any of the calls beyond the street location is that kosher on a noarrest it is even if it wasnt kosher with baker being a supervisor thered be no one looking over his shoulder unless something iffy happened brutality complaint that kind of thing basically dfars are stashed and forgotten alex wouldnt the calls come in through the dispatcher for the most part but cruisers also get flagged down by citizens or the blues see things on their own and report to the dispatcher so thered be no way to verify most of this nope anything else about it catch your eye i studied the form one more time its not balanced all the activitys in the morning you say baker liked giving tickets but he issued ten before lunch and not a single one afterward no real documentation for their activities for a solid hour prior to signoff more than an hour if you include the country mart call even more if baker bogused the entire afternoon log i looked at him during the time irit was being stalked abducted and strangled baker and nolan had the perfect alibi doing police work no way to disprove it no reason to doubt it two with uniforms a team watching the kids get off the bus selecting irit grabbing her both of them were strong and with two working together it would have been a snap baker probably chose gentle strangulation because he wanted to pretend he wasnt just another psychopath wanting to set it up as a sex crime yet discriminate it from sex crimes god he said in a voice that burst out of him like a wound looking closer to tears than id ever seen him the fucking bastards and they im sure it was bakers idea that calculating fuck did more than set up a oneday alibi they prepared for weeks what do you mean he got up made a move to the fridge stopped sat down i looked through a whole bunch of their dfars the pattern busy mornings quiet afternoons began two weeks before irits murder prior to that they had an even workload calls throughout their shift code s at normal times normal lunch breaks two weeks before irit was murdered they altered it and they continued altering for three weeks after thats how calculating they were jesus three weeks after i said at which point baker headed over to parker center and nolan transferred to hollywood distancing themselves now we know why nolan was willing to give up a plum assignment covering his ass the fuck maybe something else too milo he could have been distancing himself from the murder because the guilt started seeping in im sure thats why he killed himself im also sure baker and the others took steps so helena wouldnt look into it too deeply i told him about the breakins the snapshots in the dahl family album hookers he said darkskinned street girls like latvinia maybe baker introduced him to latvinia maybe baker by himself or with a friend came back and finished latvinia off but what i still dont get is what kept nolan from going public helena he said baker threatened to kill her if dahl squawked yes i said makes perfect sense it would have intensified nolans conflict led him closer to total escape so who are the others zena maybe malcolm ponsico til he changed his mind and received a lethal injection maybe farley sanger though i didnt see him at the party definitely wilson tenney because he was there i described the park workers altered appearance youre sure it was him do you have his dmv shot he produced it from the attaché yes i said handing it back no doubt about it unreal a goddamn psycho club club within a club i said meta offshoot a bunch of eugenics freaks sitting around over their threedimensional chess boards telling themselves how smart they are griping about the decay of society and one of them probably baker says why dont we do something about it the police are idiots believe me i know from experience just use different techniques clean up the physical evidence and distribute the murders one per district detectives from different districts never talk to one another lets have some fun with it or maybe it started off theoretically one of those murdermystery games committing the perfect crime and at some point they took it further fun he said at the core these are thrill crimes milo they cant seriously think theyre creating any societal impact this is leopold and loeb taken a step further pleasurekill under a veneer of ideology pleasure at showing how brilliant they are so just to be extracute they leave a message dvll some coded injoke the police are sure never to notice maybe an insult to the police like raymonds bloody shoes left at the newton station and even if the letters are discovered they know the message will be impossible to figure out baker he said thats exactly his style esoteric leader of the pack sucking everyone into his goddamn games a vein thick and knotted was throbbing at his temple and his eyes burned killers in blue oh shit alex you know the department and i dont have a perfect marriage but this just what lapd needs after mr scumbag rodney king and the riots and mr scumbag oj just what this city needs which leads me to another question i said is dr lehmann doing some buttcovering he told me nolan had problems helena really didnt want to know about i got a clear message to back off if he knew nolan had committed murder hed be under no obligation to report it unless another potential victim was in clear danger i can see him wanting to keep the fact that his patient was homicidal quiet for his sake and the departments he gets lots of business from the department but then why say anything at all why bother to meet with me in the first place and now that i think about it when i was there he tried to turn the tables asking me about helena trying to figure out how much she knew he stared at me checking you out he was in on it too instead of helping dahl he somehow drove the asshole to eat chrome who better than dahls therapist milo and as police consultant working downtown hes someone wes baker may have known someone to whom baker could have referred nolan oh my he said oh my oh my how far does it go he looked at his timex where the hell is sharavi havent heard from him since he and petra tagged sanger to the beverly hills hotel she got sangers room number went home and sharavi did a solo tail pulling out his cell phone he punched the mobile customer is out okay lets lay out this bloodclub scenario again a bunch of meta assholes get together decide to play a different kind of game how many members do you see in the club there couldnt be too many i said too dangerous sharing a secret like that with a crowd without opening his mouth he produced a frightening zoocage sound okay so baker takes charge he assigns tenney to do raymond ortiz maybe not specifically raymond just some kid at the park a kid tenney judged defective or maybe tenney volunteered to go first and suggested raymond because hed seen raymond knew he was retarded we know tenney was bucking authority on the job had been reprimanded what better way to thumb his nose at the job than to use the job to commit murder man with a uniform he said staring at tenneys photo averagelooking man in a uniform i said race discrimination goes both ways and this time it played in tenneys favor to the homeboys at the park tenney was just another faceless anglo he rubbed his face no body because tenney wanted to be careful not to leave physical evidence then after he and baker and the others saw no progress had been made they left the bloody shoes on the steps of the police station blood they brushed in after they wrote dvll i said so theyd planned it maybe tenneys idea probably bakers not as clean a murder as irits because unlike baker and nolan tenney never fancied himself a centurion with ideals just an angry hatefilled guy with a supposedly high iq who couldnt get a better job than sweeping up dog dirt and hated the world because of it also because raymond was a boy tenney might not have seen the killing as a sex crime felt no need to desexualize it he snatched raymond in the bathroom got him to the van and incapacitated him or murdered him right there drove somewhere disposed of the body then he quit his job disappeared living at zenas not all this time i said maybe he lived out of the van maybe he crashed with other members of the club and he wont be at zenas for long she said no more guests by tomorrow night i got the sense some kind of movements afoot another killing could be what districts havent been hit half the city he said and the whole goddamn valley i could talk to carmeli again about releasing that gag order on the other hand all weve got is supposition not a shred of evidence and if we alert baker anything he might have held on to will be destroyed not a chance of ever getting to the truth goddamn it alex its like having a map but no car okay onward irit baker and dahl they just happen to stake out the park because they know kids go there handicapped kids i said after tenney got away with raymond i can see the group going for another retarded kid in a park but theres a big difference between raymonds and irits murders tenney worked in that park was familiar with the layout raymond was a local kid his class was using the park daily while the school was being painted so tenney had plenty of time to study him maybe hed even had a runin with raymond or one of raymonds gangbanger brothers i motioned him to the door led him out of the apartment to the front steps what he said just in case you dont want carmeli to hear this i said the conservancy wasnt part of baker and dahls patrol area and irits school only visited once a year so why was irit selected as victim bakers into control manipulative a planner he took the time to manipulate the daily log for weeks so i cant believe hed choose a victim randomly what made irit right for him could it have been something to do with work after all carmeli weve both felt hes been hostile to the police from the beginning milo made remarks about police incompetence the first time we met him i assumed he meant the lack of progress on irits murder but maybe it was something else an unpleasant experience he had with lapd before irits murder a runin with baker he said something bad enough to cause baker to murder the guys daughter ideologically and psychologically baker was already there i said he wouldnt need a big push just a nudge if carmeli got on his bad side something a mere mortal might have shrugged off that could have been it both of us suspect carmelis mossad or something like it more than just the deputy consul for community liaison but thats the face he presents to the public events organizer the big israeli independence day parade he ran last spring lapd would have had to be involved for crowd management wouldnt it be interesting if baker was part of the police contingent we went back inside the phone was ringing i picked it up its daniel im down the block may i join you definitely i said ive got a key ill let myself in he wore his electricians uniform under a windbreaker and carried a small black backpack his expression was one i hadnt seen before guarded tense how was the party before i could answer milo motioned him to a chair whats with sanger he never went to the party i followed him from the hotel downtown to a building on seventh street near flower where he met with a psychologist roone lehmann i said the guarded look dropped off i told him about nolan and baker my meeting with lehmann my suspicion about lehmann he sat there eyes halfclosed both hands on his knees lehmann is confirmed he finally said i got into his building used a parabolic mike to listen to his conversation with sanger my station was a service closet the mikes a small one reception wasnt great if id had a surveillance post in a neighboring building id have chosen something more powerful but i did manage to get most of it on tape said milo daniel took a microcassette out of the backpack milo held out his hand and daniel gave it to him as i said the qualitys poor sometimes words are hard to understand but the general meanings clear want me to summarize yeah sanger and lehmann are related cousins first they talked about aunts and uncles children a family party last christmas in connecticut lehmanns a bachelor and sanger asked if he was getting laid lehmann said wouldnt you like to know and laughed then sanger laughed too theres a family resemblance i said both are big thick have flat features and baggy eyes both are probably related to the loomis family you said cousins ran the company now the names we got werent lehmann or sanger but you may be right yes there is a resemblance now that you point it out something else i said the loomises pride themselves on links to colonial england when i was in lehmanns office he made a big deal about a piece of silver on his desk that had sat in british parliament noble blood said milo these two jokers do anything besides reminisce daniel said there was nothing about meta or the murders or dvll im afraid though there was plenty of racism lehmann said hows the hotel sanger said not bad considering its owned by a towelhead does that mean no hundredthousanddollar bar mitzvahs that kind of thing then they left the office and went down to a private club on the floor below i couldnt figure out a way to get in there even if i had all the crossconversation would have made the mike useless so instead i entered lehmanns office because sanger had brought a briefcase but didnt take it with him i found it on a chair in lehmanns inner office we were guessing sanger was a bagman for meta so i expected to find it full of money but just the opposite completely empty in lehmanns desk however i did come across a bag of cash two hundred thousand dollars right process wrong route said milo the funds flow from west to east lehmanns the bagman looks that way said daniel they stayed in the club for an hour came back smoking cigars and looking happy they talked some more in the office still no mention of meta by name but lehmann did say he was disappointed in the group it had deteriorated into a social club he hoped new developed into something new said milo not something new no new one word the name of something daniel pointed to the cassette would you like to hear it later new so theres your subgroup maybe its spelled nu i said as in new utopia in his article sanger called for that they looked at each other what else did they talk about milo asked daniel lehmann said heres a little something from the family it should tide you over for a while and they laughed some more i heard a latch being closed the briefcase and a few minutes later sanger came out with it and left the building i dont know what lehmann did because i figured staying with sanger made more sense he drove straight back to the hotel and retired for the evening i tried to call his room and the switchboard said hed left instructions not to be disturbed just to be careful i stuck around for another hour and figured he really had gone to sleep then i called again impersonating his rentalcar agent and verified hed be checking out tomorrow ill be watching him to make sure and then well have our new york people pick up his trail well stay on him tighter now helga cranepool too one big happy family said milo so howd baker get connected probably through lapd i said lehmann consults to the department that also could explain zenas involvement she was a police scout in lancaster maybe she applied to lapd too somehow ran into baker and he gave her a private training course maybe nolan dahl wasnt the only one into young girls milo shot up and circled the room and lit up a cigarillo what bothered me said daniel was that lehmanns name never came up in our investigations we were concentrating on new york and the south because of the loomises origins in louisiana and professor eustaces sudden death in mississippi but i couldnt stop thinking that id heard the name before as it turns out i had he turned to me do you have your copy of twisted science here i nodded retrieved the book from under the bed turning pages he said right in professor eustaces article one of the papers he cites as loomisfunded nonsense was written by lehmann ten years ago in a journal called biogenics and culture never heard of it neither has the library of congress heres eustaces summary i read intelligence crime and weather to me its crazy stuff alex lehmanns main point is people from hot climates are inherently stupider and more dissolute than those from nordic regions because they have less need to build shelters from harsh weather dont develop a sophisticated culture in coldweather regions only smart and creative people are able to cope and propagate survival of the fittest i said lehmann also claims that hot weather creates ill temper that leads to violence thus the expression hot blood he flexed the fingers of his good hand eustace uncovers this said milo and a few months later his car goes off the road something else about lehmann i said his degrees from a place called new dominion university thats one of the loomis diploma mills isnt it yes said daniel and his clinical training was at the pathfinder foundation the same name as the meta newsletter that carried sangers article lehmann told me hed had a career in business before switching to psychology most of the books in his office were on management not clinical psych he even recited a business mottoits not enough that i succeed you have to fail the guys a loomis putup and hes wangled himself a position as a police consultant milo stopped pacing but kept smoking not a banner day for gendarmes he said speaking of which daniel what does carmeli have against the department what do you mean milo came closer and stood over him this is not the time to be coy friend your boss made it clear theres no love lost between him and lapd did he have a runin with someone the parade something else daniel rubbed his eyes removed his windbreaker the black plastic gun sat in the mesh holster it was related to the parade a security briefing at the consulate run by zev for lapd and our people setting up perimeters crowd control security both groups had agreed to share any information about terrorist threats maintain full communication zev had been working overtime hadnt seen his family much so he decided to have liora and the children over to the consulate that day they were waiting out in the hallway for him to take the family to lunch zev ran overtime and as they waited one of the lapd officers came over to liora and irit oded was down the hall playing with a toy car and sat down next to them at first he was friendly trying to talk to irit then he realized she was deaf and he concentrated on liora asking her about israel tel aviv telling her hed traveled all over the world got to be baker said milo im sure youre right said daniel very grim liora told zev the man made her feel uncomfortable too friendly just sitting there when he should have been in the briefing but she said nothing thats lioras style then somehow the officer turned it into something inappropriate sexually he came on to her not explicitly milo but liora said the connotation was clear at that point she got up and walked away later she told zev and he went how do you say ballistic complained to the mayor and was told the officer would be removed from parade detail and disciplined moved downtown but he wasnt demoted i said still maybe thats why for all his alleged brainpower hes still a sergeant baker said milo punching his fist that son of a whore so he knew irit by sight knew she was deaf daniel looked pained but to kill someone a child over that think of it as a tracer bullet said milo after the ortiz boys murder went off perfectly baker and the other new utopia assholes decided someone else was gonna die it didnt really matter who as long as it was someone they judged to be a life not worth living alex told me before that despite all the eugenics bullshit this boils down to killing for fun what greater fun for baker than revenge mrs c rejects him mr c gets him disciplined and their daughter just happens to be handicapped it must have seemed like karma to the bastard when i knew him he was into eastern religions talked a lot about karma daniel slumped stared past us into the kitchen what said milo its disgusting all of its disgusting each murder has a connection to someone in the group i said ponsico and zena raymond and tenney irit and baker nolan dahl helped with irit baker training him in all sorts of things and ill bet latvinia was one of dahls playmates maybe bakers too to them a darkskinned girl with handicaps was something to be used and thrown away baker could have killed her for fun or because she knew about him and nolan or both probably both and melvin myers said daniel he got on the wrong side of someone in the group i said someone downtown baker or lehmann looking into the backpack daniel removed a handful of papers and took out a color brochure i examined it with him the central city skills center for fifteen years a citadel of hope the photos showed blind people walking with guide dogs and operating computers smiling amputees trying on prosthetic limbs the course list sewing crafts mechanical assembly a smallprint list of funding sources was followed by a smallerprint professional advisory board doctors lawyers politicians alphabetized near the middle roone lehmann phd psychological consultant working with the handicapped i said must have given him a laugh but maybe he got a bigger laugh playing financial games with the school taking candy from blind babies milo hurried over and read the roster myers discovers lehmann ripping off the school and threatens to write an exposé maybe he tells lehmann even blackmails him because one thing myers doesnt lack is gall lehmann agrees to pay him off calls a meet in that alley and someone probably baker finishes myers off he took the brochure from daniel the murders said the israeli are their way of mixing business with pleasure the only problem is milo told him all weve got is theory because the only thing close to evidence the polaroids of nolan dahls playdates were destroyed even if we find tenneys van in zenas garage i have nothing that justifies a warrant what would it take i said to move on any of them a full confession would be peachy but ill settle for an incriminating remark anything that lets us focus on one of them a weak link that might be zena she spouts the eugenics line but it seems like roleplaying im not saying shes harmless but so far shes been less interested in politics than in partying i have a date with her tonight at ten maybe i can get her to open up more about nu maybe eventually she can be made to see its in her best interests to give up the others milo frowned dont know about the date alex tenney did make eye contact with you a couple of times and even though you dont think baker recognized you youre not sure tenney doesnt know me i said so hes got no reason to suspect me of anything hes probably just an antisocial guy what would he tell baker zenas got a new boyfriend and if i break the date wouldnt that make zena wonder old andys a heartbreaker he changed his mind then what i said where do you go from there no answer milo the one good thing about these people being so arrogant is they have no idea theyre under suspicion on the contrary theyre probably gloating that everythings gone off smashingly five murders all unsolved theyre getting cocky thats why the pace has picked up think of what you said half the city and all of the valley thousands of handicapped people who cant be protected and your date tonight is gonna change all that he barked at least its a connection to nu maybe zena will tell me something important at the very least you can pull her in and lean on her a little i repeat what else is there longer silence all right he said one more time but thats it after tonight youre out of it and we shift gears go for full surveillance on baker and lehmann keep daniels new york people stuck to sanger and cranepool get a look at zenas garage if tenneys van is in there and he splits like you think hes planning to ill use bakers technique stop the bastard for a traffic violation and take it from there where does baker live said daniel a boat in the marina called satori i described the location of the slip satori he said heavenly tranquility the bastards a pro milo told him did vice work and robbery undercover meaning he understands surveillance so i need to be careful said daniel start with being careful tonight friend i want both of us covering alex nonstop from the time he sets out to romance little ms murder til he gets home a post on her street and another on the hillside behind the house i can do the hillside said daniel youre sure ive done climbing in israel caves in the judean desert recently daniel smiled and flopped the dead hand recently one accommodates contrary to what our nu friends believe life goes on for all kinds of people fine where you sleeping tonight alex might as well go home i said ill follow you he faced daniel after that you and i meet back here on saturday daniel slept from am to awoke put on fresh jeans loafers a black tshirt and his best sportcoat a black serge hugo boss jacket given to him by his motherinlaw last chanukah after buying a morning paper he drove to marina del rey where he walked through the marina shores hotel and out to the harbor shielding his face behind the paper he looked for bakers boat easy enough alexs description had been precise satori was long sleek white on a police sergeants salary or had dr lehmann played sharethewealth in all kinds of ways he could smell the ocean hear the gulls impossible to tell from here if baker was on the boat one way or another hed find out he strolled up and down the breezeway pretending to sightsee twenty minutes later wesley baker came out on deck with a cup of coffee stretching and looking up at the sky solidlooking in a white tshirt and white shorts tan muscular goldrimmed glasses a real california guy absolutely nothing out of the ordinary hannah arendt would have been pleased he gave another stretch unfolded a deck chair and brought it close to the boats pointed bow there he sat mug in hand feet on a lower ledge face full of sun just another golden day for the elite daniel forced himself to watch he got back to the house on livonia before noon and had something of a sabbath studying the weekly torah portion reciting kiddush eating a light meal grape juice today no wine not allowing the murders to reenter his mind for an hour but after that they were all he thought of milo arrived at pm and the two of them discussed equipment the german plastic gun interested the american the most lightweight convertible to automatic with the press of a button two dozen rounds in a cartridge easy to speedload daniel had three offered him one the big man thought about it finally accepted muttering about the next time i want to sneak something onto a plane they talked about long guns and agreed daniel would take a rifle with a nightscope because hed be on the hillside milo had spent the morning reviewing bakers police personnel files as unobtrusively as possible nothing in the records indicated bakers transfer had been disciplinary no record of any punishment or demotion due to zev carmelis complaint no documentation at all of the incident with liora carmeli figures said milo the brass investigates complaints enthusiastically like michelangelo would investigate sculpting david out of dog shit the man had a way with words pencil pushers are the same everywhere said daniel milo made that grumbling noise then he left at the plan was for alex to call zena lambert at to confirm tonights date anything unusual would mean calling the whole thing off milo was protective of his friend that caused daniel to think about things better left ignored and he stopped himself and concentrated on getting onto that hillside at his phone rang and milo said its on daniel set out at dark enough for concealment but enough time to be stationed behind the house well before alex arrived at he wore ultralightweight black pants with paratrooper pockets black shirt black stocking cap concealing the rifle meant the long black coat with the velcrofastened pouch sewn in the lining other pockets for the plastic gun and ammunition his backpack held the parabolic mike a couple of tiny concussion grenades mini teargas canisters a combat knife that dated back to his army days hed yet to find something better than the old blade he felt adrenalized and just a bit ludicrous big tough commando like one of those ninja movies his sons loved to watch hed assured milo he could handle it because they werent talking about freeing multiple hostages here just getting onto that hillside listening recording returning home as he headed for the door the phone rang milo again change in plans yes shavuah tov zev carmeli offered the traditional postsabbath greeting have a good week same to you zev i need to see you daniel when now im afraid thats now carmeli repeated im in the middle of i know what youre in the middle of where youre going is herethe consulate ive sent a driver for you hes parked right behind the toyota which has two flat tires zev and dont think about sneaking out the back door sharavi someones watching youre making a huge the connection broke as he put down the phone two men came in both young one blond one darkhaired dark suits opennecked white shirts he knew them by face and name guards from the consulate dov and yizhar he hadnt heard them enter carmeli had known the phone call would distract him mr ninja indeed erev tov said dov and a good evening to you too schmuck do you have any idea what youre doing the man shrugged yizhar smiled and said following orders who says the only good germans are germans milo was at his desk at the west la station when captain huber called him in huber was doing paperwork at a chaotic desk and didnt look up or speak his bald spot was pink slightly flaky sir your lucky day sturgis meeting downtown with deputy chief wicks whatd you do solve a crime or something when now ahora they even sent a car and a driver big afroamer twostriper waiting just outside my office youre really rating today huber stopped writing but kept his head down maybe its an affirmativeaction thing diversity and all that good stuff dont look so glum never making eye contact so he had no idea about milos expression i now huber looked up sharply thick face mottled with anger wickss call had caught him by surprise out of the loop milo suddenly understood why and his bowels began to churn whats that sturgis im on my way looks like you are indeed making any progress on your cases which ones said milo all of them were doing okay good dont keep them waiting close the door on your way out bodysearched pockets emptied daniel sat sandwiched between the two men in the consulate car breathing in their tobacco smell knowing there was no chance to break free he feigned relaxation they drove him to the consulate placed him in zev carmelis office and remained outside the door he sat wondering if zev would show feeling like an idiot for neglecting the obvious how could he have not seen it how could it have been any other way denial pathological denial had milo been intercepted too how far did this go hopefully it wouldnt matter alex walking into the date unprotected just a date with a crazy girl and back to the genesee apartment more denial alex was expecting full coverage would behave accordingly he remembered the tranquil look on bakers face all those murders and the guy was taking in the sun unbothered by life guy like that nothing would bother him he looked around zevs office saw something that could help pocketed it and knocked on the door dov opened it what bathroom youre sure up to you soldier i can piss on his desk dov smiled took his arm firmly and propelled him to a nearby unmarked door no need for another search the first had been so thorough have fun dov told him once inside daniel urinated flushed turned on the faucet took the cell phone hed lifted from zevs desk out of his pocket and dialed a familiar number time for only one call he hoped the phone was a normal line not one of zevs preassigned coded things ringing good pick up friend pick up pick up hello gene its me i cant talk long i need your help knocking on the door dovs voice hey you drown or what how long does it take to pee wait til you reach my age daniel called out aint that the truth said gene zena was at the store when i made the confirmation call how gallant of you to verify a just wanted to make sure you werent too worn out from the party me never on the contrary bursting with energy i shall prepare comestibles pasta with clams caesar salad fruit of the vine the woman cooks too oh do i she laughed i simmer and sometimes i boil over ill leave a key in the empty flowerpot near the door ill be ready at i put on an andrew uniform gray shirt baggy gray pants the same tweed sportcoat the same cologne starless night a washedslate sky the air reeking of wet paper damp around the edges i took la brea to sunset the boulevard was rife with spandex and leather delusions passing as hope east of western it changed darkened buildings hemmed by shadowstrewn corners everything murky grubby too quiet i drove automatically slowly as if riding a track reached lyric just after ten oclock and climbed the winding road now stripped of cars rondo vista was mortuary silent zenas garage was closed and one car was parked in front of her house fiftyeight tbird pink with a white top faded and scarred had to be hers the same faint light from her window setting the mood i parked and headed for the door the covered pathway was dark the dead spider plants shuddered in the night breeze feeling an inexplicable pang of firstdate anxiety i groped til i found the key in the pot resting atop a mound of bonedry planters mix music from inside electric guitars played slowly beautiful dreamy music sleepwalk by santo and johnny zena setting the mood i remembered the song from my childhood she hadnt been born when it hit the charts i unlocked the door expecting to find her downstairs in the bedroom maybe some kind of cute note directing me to the stuffed animals she was right there in the living room lit by a single pole lamp with a weak blue bulb theatrical nude on the sofa she reclined one arm extended along the top of the couch like goyas naked maja wideeyed with eagerness her tiny white body perfectly formed pearly in the steely light nipples pink and erect oversized for the small white breasts black hair sprayed static her legs were spread just enough to offer a view of bleachedblond pubic patch her other arm rested on her flat smooth belly i smelled clam sauce but the lights were out in the kitchen no preliminaries how to get out of this hi i said she didnt speak or move i came closer was inches away before i saw the ligature around her neck copper wire biting into the slender stem so tight it had been invisible wide wide blue eyes not seductiveness surprise the final surprise i turned to run was caught by the elbows from behind a knee in the small of my back sent a jolt of pain up my spine and made my legs give way then hands around my neck more pain different an entire new definition of pain as the back of my head exploded milos driver was named ernest beaudry and he was coalblack maybe thirty handsome impassive a devout baptist with a bristly mustache that looked lasertrimmed and an eighteeninch neck turned to asphalt by shaving bumps the car was a blue unmarked ford same model as milos but newer and much cleaner parked in the west la station lot beaudry stayed close to milo as they approached it held the door open for him some service officer beaudry didnt answer just shut the door and got into the drivers seat he managed the car skillfully driving was one of his favorite things as a kid hed fantasized about becoming a professional race driver til someone told him there were no black ones the police radio was on reciting that nights epic poem of coded violence but beaudry wasnt listening turning out of the lot he headed for the downtown said milo yup as they got on the ramp milo said so whats this about no answer because beaudry had none and even if he had he was smart enough to keep it zipped the was clogged with nighttime airport traffic and they barely moved for a while milo repeated the question no idea sir a few car lengths later you work for chief wicks yup assigned to the motor pool yup well said milo all these years on the force and i never got driven before so this is my lucky day huh looks like it beaudry let his left hand sink to the driversdoor handrest as he onefingered the wheel traffic started moving okay ill just sit back and enjoy this said milo there you go sturgis stretched his legs and closed his eyes they cruised slowly but steadily nice and easy then beaudry heard shit jesus rustling motion on the passenger side beaudry glanced to the right and saw that sturgis was sitting up oh jeesus i cant the last word was guillotined by a gasp and beaudry saw sturgis slump one hand on his barrel chest the other fighting to loosen his tie whats the problem stomach chest probably just gas the shit i had for dinner oh man heres another jesus it hurts like a mother oh shit this is not sturgis sat up again suddenly as if pierced by something gasping rasping yanking the tie loose but holding on to the limp fabric clutching the left side of his chest beaudry heard a button pop and plink against the dashboard you all right yeah yeah get the hell over to parker maybe theyve got a no i dunno oh shit the long legs stiffened knees knocking against vinyl sturgiss eyes were shut now and his color looked bad grayish his face screwed up tight ever have this before said beaudry fighting to sound calm milos response was a deep bearish moan sir have you ever experie ohh jeez get me oh ah sturgis arched his back bit his lip and beaudry heard fast rough breathing beaudry said im getting you to a hospital no just get me no choice sir wheres the closest one cedars okay robertson exits just a ways up hold on no no im oka ahh left hand back on the wheel beaudry switched to the fast lane and floored the unmarked using his right hand to snatch the handset and call in an emergency no one answered at deputy chief wickss office of course theyd asked him to bring sturgis straight to that conference room on the fifth floor some kind of highlevel detective stuff what was the extension there no idea should he go through the parker switchboard no theyd made it clear this was confidential meaning they were trusting him with more than just chauffeuring probably preparing him for something bigger and better meanwhile his charge was moaning and gasping like a fish out of water sounding like he was gonna die right here in the car look how heavy he was probably didnt exercise ate all kinds of garbage just his luck ernest beaudrys golden luck all that clean living and raising his kids right doing his job without a hitch getting assigned to the motor pool and making delores happy because he wouldnt get shot by some crackhead pushing for motor pool because his uncle had started that way and made sergeant even with all the departmental racism because his uncle and other relatives had told him a smart young guy like him with presence could do even better driving the connections you made maybe hed get to drive for the chief heck driving could make you a chief daryl gates had started off driving for saint william parker then again look where daryl gates had ended up so maybe it was just the opposite and driving was really bad luck a curse a hex this sure wasnt a good sign he wished sturgis would just stop having his heart attack decide it had been gas start breathing normally again silence oh no you all right no answer but sturgis was still breathing beaudry could see the big belly heaving its all right he said soothingly well take good care of you almost there sturgiss face screwed up tighter as he seized again and landed almost prone on the seat sliding down thank god he had his seat belt on bucking and heaving that wheezing robertson mile beaudry checked the rearview and slid across all four lanes raced down the exit ramp which was thankgod clear ran an ambertored at national and jetted north cedars just a couple miles away dont die here man at least wait til we get there pico olympic another iffy amberoo some crosstraffic that honked at him forget you i am allowed i am the police wilshire burton here we go here we go here we go cedars yes swing in on alden into the covered parking lot up to the emergency entrance no one there sturgis quieter but looking worse was he still breathing oh lord please give him just a few more breaths cpr no no no of course not not with all these doctors around were here just hold on man he said slamming the car into park helps right on the way he left the engine running and trackstarred into the er reception area yelled at the sleepylooking clerk that an officer needed help the place was full of sick old people and accident victims various species of lowlife before the clerk could answer beaudry ran past them and grabbed the first person in uniform that he saw a nurse filipina then a female intern in scrubs the three of them hustling to the unmarked where said the intern redhaired looking maybe sixteen but her badge said s goldin md right here beaudry threw open the unmarkeds passenger door no one inside his first thought was that sturgis had been gripped by another attack had somehow opened the door fallen out crawled somewhere to die he ran around the car to check then looked under the vehicle where said the intern now looking skeptical she and the nurse stared at beaudry taking in his badge the uniform the two stripes the sam browne loaded with gear the ninemillimeter figuring he was for real but what the hell was his story beaudry raced around the parking lot looking over under between every damn vehicle greasing up his uniform soaking his taperedtothemuscle shirt with stress sweat when he came back intern s goldin repeated where whats going on officer now beaudry was breathing hard and his own chest hurt stand tall show no stress good question he said so much for family advice driving was definitely a hex newly retired police captain eugene brooker thirty pounds overweight slightly hypertensive and a noninsulindependent diabetic walked uphill old man and the mountain some image when his daughters inquired about his health he always said feel like a kid so live the lie tonight dannys surprise call talking twice as fast as usual from that consulate bathroom had ended with itll probably be nothing do what you can gene but dont put yourself in danger sneaking a phone into the john why were dannys own people doing this to him he trudged up lyric staying in the shadows when he could hed parked his car a long way down on apollo brought the only two weapons handy the old service revolver which hed continued to clean and oil out of habit and the ninemillimeter that he kept in his bedside nightstand no long guns because all three of his were already packed away in the uhaul and they were for quail not people another reason rifles were too conspicuous an overtly armed black man walking the hills at night was beyond a joke up up and away he forced himself to breathe slowly how long had it been since hed done reallife breakasweat police work he didnt even want to think about it pathetically out of shape but with the diabetes you had to be careful about your exercise who was he kidding since college football and walking a beat on central he hadnt done a damn thing athleticwise climb every mountain ford every stream huff huff the old nikes nice and quiet hed memorized the address on rondo vista slow and steady it wouldnt do to have a heart attack up here and end up roadkill or worse no reason to hurry probably a quiet night as danny had said just a precaution for the shrinks sake danny hadnt had time to give many details the main thing was that a cop named baker whom gene didnt know might be part of it so watch out for him he drove a saab convertible a cop behind all that blood it could make the rodney king case look like musical comedy beyond that all gene knew was that a crazy girl was also part of it and the shrink was on an undercover date with her why a shrink for bait how had danny and sturgis put it all together hed find out tomorrow tonight his job was to keep an eye on the house if something looked treacherous for the shrink pull some kind of distraction more if necessary he made it to rondo vista nearly out of breath wanting to clear his throat but the street was too silent for that kind of noise so he lived with the phlegm hed made sure to eat an orange before leaving keep the old blood sugar steady he should probably test more often but sticking himself was such a hassle as he stood there searching for the house he became aware of pounding in his ears like a fast tide the high blood pressure luanne had died of a stroke no stupid to think about that lord it was quiet up here manson family terrain you could dismember someone in the middle of the road no one would notice til sunrise there was the house small place white with dark trim gray or blue he studied the layout examined nearby cars one in front the karmann ghia danny had given the shrink and an old pink tbird in the driveway that had to be the girls nothing else except the few vehicles hed passed on the way up couple of compacts and one honey a white porsche no doubt some hillhouse guys toy porsches and hillhouses went together the old la lifestyle hed never much tasted danny had said look out for three things a chevy van it could be in the garage bakers saab and a mercedes sedan owned by some other shrink named lehmann what the hell was this all about he looked carefully none of those were around maybe in the garage if hed been official hed have run a make on every vehicle within a halfmile radius the compacts the white porsche but now retirement he realized he was breathing fine felt good great no more pounding no clammy skin or other warning signs of impending hypoglycemia revolver in his shoulder holster ninemillimeter tucked in his waistband at the small of his back this was good a sendoff before he died a slow death in arizona ten more minutes of silent watching from behind a tree and he decided to get a closer look at the house a narrow space ran between the crazy girls place and its southern neighbor and gene could see lights more hillhouses way across a canyon from what he could tell the ground sloped down sharply probably not much backyard dannyd said that if sturgis was there thats where hed probably be stationed but he had a feeling sturgis wouldnt make it cold quiet anger in the israelis voice unusual sturgis gene didnt know the guy had only seen him from a distance and he didnt look in any better shape than gene usually you thought of those gay guys being obsessed with their bodies luanne had once remarked that they seemed to be the bestlooking guys probably because they didnt have families plenty of time for the gym the conversation in his head came to an abrupt halt had he heard something a rustling no just silence and nothing around the house had changed he examined the place some more not much in the way of front windows and the way the structure was stuck into the hillside the entire bottom floor was below street level probably lots of windows in back to catch the view how to get back there was there some foothold had to be for someone like sturgis to obtain a position enough idle curiosity the idea was to stay here on the chance the lessthanunlikely minuscule offchance that his old bones would see some action if luanne were alive shed say something like youre doing what cant you work your midlife crisis out some other way sugar that night finding her on the kitchen floor stop dont even think her name dont visualize her face god he missed her he decided to go past the house check out the northern edge of the girls property as he took a step something pressed against his left mastoid and a voice whispered dont move dont even blink hands up very slowly behind the head grab the head a hand took hold of his shoulder and turned him around suppressing oh shit thoughts gene mentally prepared a plan size up the enemy figure out a way to catch him offguard land a sucker punch maybe trip him distract it was sturgis and he looked furious his eyes were green god they were bright even in the darkness the guy stank of exertion and stress they stared at each other sturgiss shirt had a button missing something black and plastic probably one of those german glocks was a foot from genes nose hey whispered gene im a civilian now but shouldnt rank count for something detective sturgis kept staring can i drop the damn hands detective sturgis the glock lowered whatre you doing here captain gene told him about the bathroom call the guy didnt look surprised just angrier the disheveled appearance theyd tried to keep him away too but hed managed to get away gene said you too half a nod the israelis actually grabbed you sturgiss lips pulled back showing teeth something out of a horror movie and gene was glad the guy was a cop then the realization hit him the department said gene sturgis didnt answer damn and you escaped yeah im a fucking houdini and now youre in deep manure sturgis shrugged and lowered the black gun to his side keeps life interesting he guided gene back behind the tree how long you been up here said gene got here right before you how far down did you park sturgis hooked a thumb the porsche hillhouse guy so much for his powers of detection thought gene it was good they were putting him out to pasture you and daniel had a twoman plan he said he was going behind the house you figuring to do it now sturgis didnt answer wasnt this a picture alone in this dark quiet place with a gay guy and it didnt bother him a whit years ago he was supposed to go back there with a microphone and a tape recorder said milo ill go back there but if the drapes are drawn i wont be able to see anything i dont like it but dr delawares in there already see what you mean said gene daniel also said it would probably turn out to be nothing hopefully dr delawares putting himself on the line dedicated huh you have no idea you know he said i worked a case with sharavi serial killer before they were calling them that the guys righteous as they come never met a better detective sturgis kept looking around those wild eyes on full alert as if he heard something that gene wasnt hearing gene said now that im here at least you have backup lets get some signals we were supposed to use cell phones but thats fucked too i had all the stuff at my house before they grabbed me at the station except the gun except that had it in a pants holster the driver never searched me they were trying to make it look like something positive getting called downtown a driver said gene youve got to worry when they escort you sturgis gave a weird halflaugh halfgrunt big lunk youd never know he was gay okay signals he said gene waited a long time for him to come up with something deferring because sturgis was still activeduty knew more details than he did finally the guy said how about this you stay here keep a special lookout for cars saab ragtop chevy van mercedes good two could be in the garage though ive been up here several times today never saw them enter or exit i go in back of the house step out every halfhour over there in that space between the houses and hold up my hand to let you know everythings okay youll be able to see me because of the lights shining from those houses in the distance ill only hold it up for a second so we need to get our times straight if i dont come out wait another five minutes then come checking if you dont see me right away pull some distraction knock on the door said gene pizza man chinesefood delivery instead of answering sturgis looked around some more though gene still couldnt see any reason why yeah fine whatever works said sturgis okay lets play bad spy movie and synchronize our goddamn watches both of them peeled back their cuffs gene was squinting at the dial of his seiko diver when sudden activity threw him offbalance he had time to see a blackgloved hand chop down on sturgiss gun arm sending the glock falling to the ground with a dull clunk as he watched sturgis fall back into darkness he was grabbed from behind arms pinioned yanked behind his back and cuffed sturgis too glove leather over both their mouths blackgarbed figures coming out of the shadows out of nowhere where the hell had they been at least three of them armed for bear and more jesus look at those machine pistols gene had seen them in gang roundups never fired one because unlike lots of other cops hed never been much of a gun freak sturgis was dragged out of his vision and gene felt himself pulled in the opposite direction damned keystone situation and now he was probably gonna die from something else not the damned diabetes fool fool fool never underestimate the enemy a cop like baker would be a serious enemy but still both he and sturgis were pros how could they have hands guided him down the hill shhh a voice said into his ear and he blotted out images of luannes reproving face oh honey yeah i screwed up baby joining you soon my eyelids slammed as tight as metal shutters my mouth tasted metallic breathing was difficult each inhalation a rip in my lungs and the pain in my head was a scarletorangeblack thing drowsy but i hadnt lost consciousness i tried to open my eyes too heavy i could hear smell so much metal feel think feel myself being lifted pressure at wrists and ankles meaning at least two of them bumpy ride steps the stairs down to the bedroom lowered onto something soft perfumed zenas perfume zenas bed new pressure bore down wrists ankles belly weight dry warm crushing weight like a big dog sitting on me the snap of clamps now i couldnt move the back of my head was hot and caustic as if something larval and fanged had hatched inside my skull and was chewing its way out lesser pain in the crook of my right arm cold sting an injection i tried again to open my eyes a sliver of light before they collapsed everything okay because milo and daniel knew daniel was listening then i wondered not a sound had been made since id entered the house and said hi to zena were they assuming zenad made good on her promises the lovemaking beginning spontaneously silently or were they unable to hear an equipment malfunction those things happened space shuttles went down waiting for some kind of signal from me my lips wouldnt function rest up stay calm regain your strength the plan had been for me to open the livingroom curtains did the fact that i hadnt alarm them where were they i needed to say something for the parabolic mike breathing was so hard my throat a pinpoint now i did black out up again no idea how long it had been eyes wide open pupils aching as they expanded to take in the bright light of the bedroom the bedroom ceiling i could see little else white ceiling sparklesprayed the light from a cheap plastic fixture white circular brass finial in the center like the nipple of a big white breast zenas breasts so small i pressed my head to my chest to see what was holding me down leather restraints thick brown hospital restraints as an intern on the psych wards id wondered what they felt like flashes of color off to the left i struggled to get a better look my neck tremoloed with pain that traveled down my spine as if someone had run a filleting knife down my center say something for the damned mike my tongue was a soft useless pillow taking up space in the garbage can claiming to be my mouth i strained some more studying the color to my left eyes white eyes with flat black irises dead eyes plastic stuffed animals what seemed to be a mountain of them stacked against the lefthand wall behind them another curtain behind it no doubt another glass slider teddy bears a gigantic panda with a lolling head disney characters a killer whale that was probably a souvenir from sea world more kapok and felt that i couldnt make out clearly zenas collection that surprised look id taken it for wideeyed arousal the wire around her neck gritted with blood just a twist away from decapitation i moved and the restraints compressed my chest and my forearms and my shins but i was breathing better good i said it came out guh loud enough for the mike to pick up i tried to relax pace myself save the energy for talking as i worked myself up for another syllable a face blocked out the light fingers pinched my left eyelid lifted it let it snap as something tickled my nose bristly the face so close i couldnt focus then it drew back dirtyblond beardhairs raking my chin on the way up smelly beard fermentedfood stink over red skin dandruff flakes a hairframed mouth breathed on me hot and sour a pus pimple nested in the fold between nostril and cheek more distance and i saw wilson tenney dressed again in a sweatshirt this one green and reading illinois arts festival hes up nice recovery said another voice must be in good shape the rewards of a virtuous life said tenney then his face shifted to the right and vanished as if moving offstage and another one freshly shaved ruddy sunburnished took its place wes baker folded his arms across his chest and studied me with mild interest his eyeglass lenses glinted he wore a pink buttondown shirt beautifully laundered sleeves folded up crisply on thick bronze forearms i couldnt see past the third button his right arm held a small hypodermic syringe filled with something clear potassium chloride i said for the mike but it didnt come out right speech will return in a few minutes said baker give yourself a little more time for your central nervous system to bounce back i heard tenneys hoarse laugh from behind me potassium chloride i tried again clearer i thought baker said you just wont relax will you obviously a striver from what ive been able to gather pretty bright too its a shame we never got a chance to discuss issues of substance how about right now i thought i tried to say it the result was a series of mouse squeaks where were daniel and milo taping wanting evidence but theyd never let me down baker said see how peaceful he looks willy weve created another masterpiece tenney joined him he looked angry but baker was smiling i said zena was artistic almost perfectly clear goya someone who appreciates said baker posed like irit and latvinia and tenney said her life was one big pose no gentle strangulation tenney frowned and glanced at baker why kill her i said good the words were out my tongue had shrunk to normal size baker rubbed his chin and bent closer why not kill her she was a believer he held up a silencing finger professorial i remembered what milo had said about how he loved to lecture keep him talking get it all on tape she was he said a receptacle a condom with limbs tenney laughed and i saw him pick something out of the corner of his eye and flick it away zena he said exited this mortal coil with a bang one hand touched his fly bakers expression was that of a weary but tolerant parent that was terrible willy he smiled at me this may batter your selfesteem but she was as sexually discriminating as a fruit fly our little barnyard gimcrack he turned to tenney tell him zenas motto cockadoodledo said the bearded man any cock will do she was a lure i said for ponsico me others a lure said baker have you ever gone flyfishing no its a marvelous pastime fresh air clear water tying the lures unfortunately even the best ones unravel after too many bites malcolm ponsico i said he lost enthu he lacked commitment said tenney a weak trout if you will it soon became clear something smelled fishy willy said baker reprovingly as dr alex here can tell you inveterate and inappropriate punning is a symptom of mood disorder isnt that so yes the word sounded perfect at least to my ears my head was clearer back to normal feeling better said baker somehow sensing it he flourished the hypodermic then i heard a metallic clank as he put it down somewhere the leather restraints were killing the blood flow to my limbs and my body seemed to be disappearing or maybe it was the remnants of the drug pooling in low places what axis tenney asked me depression or mania mania i said and hypomania hmm he stroked his beard i dont like to think of myself as hypoanything sudden smile maybe hypodermic because i do have the capacity to get under peoples skin he laughed baker smiled perhaps thats why ive been feeling crabby or perhaps my moods just shift for the halibut what a wit i said he reddened and i visualized raymond ortiz snatched in the park bathroom bloody shoes i wouldnt irritate him baker said almost maternally he doesnt take well to irritation what did raymond ortiz do to irritate him tenney bared yellow teeth baker turned his back on me want to tell him willy why bother said tenney i have no need to clear my sole petrale dover take your pick to assuage my admittedly shrimpy conscience by confessing what i did to the stupid little squid the scales of justice are in equilibrium no pearls of wisdom i prefer to clam up suddenly his beard loomed above me and his hand was around my neck all right he said spraying spittle since you insist what the obese little degenerate did was destroy the quality of my life how by filthying the bathroom inevitably inexorably every single time he used it he filthied it do you understand he bore down increasing the pressure on my neck and i gagged heard baker say willy my field of vision grew black around the edges and now i knew something was wrong milo would never let it get this far the fingers loosened tenneys eyes were moist bloodshot the stupid gobbet of scrambled dna couldnt figure out how to use toilet paper he said he and all those other limpy loopy defectoids day after day he turned to baker its a perfect metaphor for whats wrong with society isnt it sarge they shit on us we clean up so you killed him in the bathroom i said where else and the bloody shoes think said tenney think what he did to my shoes i gave the closest thing to a shrug the bonds would allow on my own what to do i got tired of stepping in it tenney was shouting now raining saliva they didnt pay me for that his fingers touched my neck again then he reversed himself suddenly and walked away and i heard footsteps a door opening and closing alone with baker my neck hurts i said throwing out another cue but my faith was dying can these restraints be loosened baker shook his head the needle was back in his hand potassium chloride i repeated same as ponsico baker didnt answer raymonds shoes i said nothing random everything had a reason irit carmelis murder simulated a sex crime her mother read you as a sexual aggressor so the payback had to have sexual overtones but you needed to differentiate yourself from just another pervert you and nolan he got off on dominating little girls baker showed me his back again was irit mostly nolan or both of you because i think you shared nolans tastes young girls dark girls girls like latvinia did you do her yourself or with tenneys help or someone else i havent had the pleasure of meeting he didnt budge like ponsico i said nolan lacked the will eventually more important he had some sort of conscience what he did eventually got to him you sent him to lehmann but it didnt help howd you prevent him from bringing you down no answer the sister i said you told him what youd do to her if he destroyed anyone but himself and if his will had failed again and he didnt eat his gun youd have taken care of him his left shoulder twitched think of it as euthanasia he was suffering from a terminal disease which one malignant regrets i heard him laugh now well have to get the sister anyway because you might have educated her i didnt who else knows besides sturgis no one well he said well see about that ive always liked north carolina the horse country spent some time years ago raising thoroughbreds why doesnt that surprise me he turned around and smiled horses are immensely strong horses kick hard more killing more fun youre right about that so ideology eugenics had nothing to do with it he shook his head strip away what passes for motives and motivation alex and the sad truth remains for the most part we simply do things because we can you killed people to prove you were able to get no not to prove it simply because i could same reason you pick your nose when you think no ones watching the silencing finger touched my lips how many ants have you stepped on during your lifetime millions tens of millions how much time have you spent regretting the fact that you committed ant genocide ants and people its all tissue organic material jumbles of carbon so simple until we elevated apes come along and complicate things with superstition remove god from the equation and youre left with a reduction as rich and delicious as the finest sauce its all tissue its all temporary he righted his glasses which is not to say i dont create my own excuses everyone does everyone has a cutoff point for you its ants perhaps youd spare a snake someone else might not others draw the line at vertebrates mammals with fur whichever arbitrary criterion defines lovable or cute or sacred he straightened looked wistful you cant really understand unless you travel and expose yourself to different ways of thinking in bangkok a beautiful putrid very scary city i met a man a master chef artist with a chinese cleaver he was working in a luxury hotel preparing banquets for tourists and politicians but before that he ran his own restaurant in a harbor district where tourists never go his forte was cutting slicing cubing julienning at unbelievable speed we smoked opium together several times and eventually i gained his trust he told me hed trained as a child working his way up to sharper and sharper knives over thirty years hed cut everything sea slugs grasshoppers shrimp frogs snakes beef lamb monkeys baboons chimpanzees smile you know the punch line under the knife it all splits apart then why even bother picking targets i said if its a game why not just strike randomly deconditioning takes time the troops need a rationale the troops he said amused so you gave them one inferior tissue your ants i didnt give anyone anything he said deafness is inferior to hearing retardation is inferior to an adequate intellect not being able to wipe your own anus is inferior to studying philosophy there is intrinsic value in cleaning house new utopia i said fighting to speak clearly calmly was anyone listening survival of the fittest he shook his head again mr scoutmaster showing a dull scout how to tie a complex knot for the fiftieth time spare me the sloppy compassion without the fittest there will be no survival retardates dont discover cures for diseases spastics dont steer jumbo jets too many of the unfit and well all be enduring not living the way willy was forced to endure that bathroom he removed his glasses cleaned them with a tissue the house was silent a nice mix i said pop philosophy and sadistic fun fun is good he said what else do we have to show for our time on this planet he raised the syringe again no help coming but play for time time was all i had melvin myers i said a blind man trying to live a normal life what was his sin learning something about lehmann while fooling with the computers embezzlement shunting grant money to new utopia big smile ah the irony he said money allocated for the inferior finally used productively myers that place pathetic myers was intelligent its all the same damaged tissue spoiled meat can be gussied up and sautéed but it remains unfit for consumption the blind dont lead the blind the blind get led around like barnyard animals he aimed the needle at the ceiling squirting liquid a toilet flushed footsteps again i heard tenneys voice whew no more mexican for me baker tapped the syringe no rescue daniel milo how could you abandon me my body started to shake you cant hope to hope has nothing to do with it said baker what you know amounts to supposition but no evidence the same goes for sturgis the game needs to end heres a true test of your belief system is there an afterlife now youll find out or he smiledyou wont dvll youre the new devils the needle caught ceiling light sparking white his mouth tightened irritated how many foreign languages do you speak some spanish i learned a little latin in school i speak eleven he said all that travel travel enriches what language is dvll german he said nothing like the goths when it comes to matters of principle the crispness none of that useless gallic lassitude zenas comments about french parroting her guru the needle lowered so what does it mean i said no answer hed turned grave almost sad daniel milo the limits of friendship just another delusion potassium chloride i tried for the third time freelance executioner at least the state offers sedation tenney said the state offers a last meal and prayers and a blindfold because the states game is insincerity pretending to be humane he laughed very loudly the state actually takes the time to sterilize the injection site with alcohol protecting against what the state is an ass dont worry said baker your heart will explode it wont take long dust to dust carbon to carbon clever too bad we never got a chance to spend more quality time together executed i said barely able to restrain the scream that kept growing within me whats my crime oh alex he said im so disappointed in you you still dont understand understand what a sad shake of his head there are no crimes only errors then whyd you become a cop the needle lowered a bit because police work offers so much opportunity for power no powers for politicians what law enforcement offers is choice possibilities order and disorder crime and punishment playing the rules like a card hustler when to fold when to draw i said stall stretch every second dont look at the needle robin who to arrest who to let go exactly he said fun who gets to live i said who doesnt how many others have you killed i stopped counting long ago because it doesnt matter thats the point alex everything is matter and nothing matters then why bother to kill me because i want to because you can he came closer not a single one of them was missed no impact nothing changed it made me realize what i should have known years before sensation is all one passes the time in the least onerous way possible i like to clean house a sweeper i said and when he didnt answer the elite takes out the trash there are no elites just those with fewer impediments willy and i will end up wormfood like everyone else smarter worms though said tenney he grinned at me see you for chess in hell you supply the board sensation is all i said to baker baker put down the needle again unbuttoned his shirt and spread the placket his chest was tan hairless a grotesque plane of ravaged flesh scores of scars some threadlike others raised and welted he displayed himself proudly rebuttoned i thought of myself as a blank canvas decided to draw please dont talk to me about mercy at least tell me about dvll oh that he said dismissively just a quotation from herr shickelgruber pure mediocrity that one those sickening watercolors but he did have a way with a phrase mein kampf i said he got very close sweet breath soapandwater skin how did he tolerate tenney die vernichtung lebensunwerten leben he said lives not worth living which applies im afraid to yours tenney moved in and held my right hand down elbow to the mattress oh milo the bastard is right nothing matters in the end nothings fair fingertips drummed the crook of my arm raising a vein baker lifted the syringe happy heart attack he said robin mom go out with style dont scream dont scream i prepared for the jab nervous system crashing alarm bells jingling nothing baker straightened perturbed still the jingling the doorbell shit said tenney go see who it is willy and be careful clang the needle disappeared and in its place baker held a machine pistol black bananashaped handle rectangular body nasty little barrel he looked around the room the bell rang again stopped three knocks more bell i heard tenneys rapid climb up the stairs voices tenneys the other highpitched a woman her voice tenneys hers no i heard tenney say youve got the wrong baker moved toward the door pistol held high the womans voice again irate im telling you said tenney that this then a low muffled stutter that could only be one thing more footsteps racing as baker pointed the machine pistol at the door ready thunder behind him breaking glass a glass roar from behind the curtains then a flute arpeggio of tinkling shards as the curtains parted and men burst in shooting more stutter much louder baker never had a chance to see them his pink shirtback sucked up crimson and the rear of his head dissolved in a redbrown mist the front of his head followed facial features blanketed in red oil and white jelly the substructure disintegrating features losing integrity turning to port wine melting a wax figure melting his chest exploded and soft things flew out plunking wetly against the wall one of the shooters ran to me young sharpfeatured black hair one of the guards id seen at the consulate behind him a big heavy whitehaired black man in navy blue sweats older at least sixty he glanced at bakers body then at me the young hawkfaced man began undoing my restraints only to be yanked away by milo disheveled weteyed sweating breathing hard sir said the young man milos big hand still on his arm get lost do your job and ill do mine the young man hesitated for a second then left milo freed me oh alex such a fuckup such a goddamn idiotic fuckup im so oh man we almost lost you it really went bad never again never fucking again you always were one for drama i said shut up he said just shut up and rest man i am so sorry i will never let you talk me shut up yourself he lifted me he carried me past baker lying in a broth of gore crossed the white room now candystriped bits of brain and bone a freeform collage out to the stairs tenneys corpse was sprawled on top up we go his breathing was too hard too fast i felt strong enough to walk and told him so no way im okay put me down all right but weve got to get the hell out of here be careful not to trip over that piece of shit a woman came into view at the top of the stairs very short heavyset rosy cheeks bulbous nose irina budzhyshyn proprietress of the hermes language school small pistol in her hand nothing fancy in her russian accent she said no one else in the house get him out of here and then we bring in the cleanup crew a man appeared behind her in black late twenties but already bald on top with a brown mustache and goatee he was breathing hard too everyone was ive got transport he said in a thick voice not acknowledging me though wed met the landlord at irinas building what name had he used laurel phil laurel as in hardy everyones a comedian we got into ricks porsche milo said you all right im fine i was coated with icy sweat and fought not to shake he made a toofast uturn and raced down the hill oh man he said what a forget it sure forget it biggest fuckup of my life forget it is exactly what i wont do how the hell could i have been so goddamn stupid what happened i got ambushed is what happened sudden meeting with a deputy chief sharavi was pulled off too by his own people til i found out i thought he set it up did you see an older black guy in there captain

masters teach english somewhere elementary school not in la where tenyearolds shoot you some backwater kids who still say aw shucks and what exactly happened i said what happened shit happened is what happened brooker and i were up there playing i spy when they grabbed us two guys and that little russian girl and they managed to get us cuffed before we knew what hit us finally we convinced them we werent the enemy and they freed us demanded we leave it was their operation brooker and i refused because we didnt trust them to protect you said wed spoil whatever plans they had if they didnt share the wealth bluffing because i knew that if the debate stretched out id have to split because i wanted to make sure someone was watching you didnt want you in there without surveillance he blinked hard wet eyes rubbing them hard he coughed they agreed to let us in on it but they had to call the shots she did irina svetlana whatever she agreed to let us be part of the rear attack if we didnt cause problems the arrangement was brooker and me and one of them the blackhaired guy in back of the house and her and the other guy the fucking landlord at the front door the guy with us had a mike parabolic like sharavis but it wasnt working well and by the time he got it going baker was ready to im sorry alex when i heard you say potassium chloride i nearly i told the guy were going in right now bucko he tells me he needs a signal from her i say fuck you and he uses his beeper to signal her and she says shes already at the front door just hold on one second but im already up running for the glass door anyway and the blackhaired one is holding on to me im fighting with him come this close to shooting him finally svetlana and landlord pull the frontdoor thing do tenney we can hear them shooting him and we do the rear attack on baker im sure all of us perforated him what a mess alex he gripped the wheel and turned to me not that theyre unhappy what went down is exactly what they planned there were never gonna be any arrests other than a false story about wilson tenney none of it ever hit the news wes bakers heartattack obit was printed only in the police protective association newsletter baker had been right about one thing so few things had impact i never saw daniel again carmelis gone too milo told me his fifth visit to my house in one week he was drinking more i kept trying to look my best assure him i was fine the whole family him the wife and son ditto bakers boat i went down to the marina harbormaster said baker had sold the boat to some guy with an accent whod decided to dock at newport all of andrew desmonds identity papers had disappeared from my pockets id given the clothes to goodwill howre you and the department getting along i said they still claim they love me he sat at my kitchen table and ate a corned beef sandwich noisily wonderfully reliably gluttonous some things do matter what do you think happened to daniel i said id like to think they didnt hold it against him but tried to contact brooker hes split for parts unknown daniel was a good soldier alex up until the last moment he did exactly what they wanted defining the target he was their hound just like me spotting pointing they used us both to pinpoint the prey then brought in the attack dogs for the kill revenge i said carmeli heard everything including why baker had chosen irit now he knows it wasnt just random madness wonder how it affected him who knows bet you he never told the wife i smiled whats funny your big performance mr chest pain rogue cop on the lam he slapped his sternum and rolled his eyes debonair i said so tell me about this promotion and why kicked back up to diii but removed from west la theyre giving me an office at one of those little mini community outposts theyre putting up all over town coplite the guys call em but i get my own space separate entrance the title is major case investigator troubleshooter on nasty stuff anywhere in the city the promise is i dont have to deal with red tape get total departmental support and backup sounds good he rubbed his face im not kidding myself alex they want me out of the station any station and i know damn well this can go either way the best thing that ever happened to me or they marginalize me ease me out if its the second fuck em ill deal with it meanwhile theyve upped my pay and promised lieutenant within a year still sounds good i said now tell me why the official reason is that they were intending to do it all along the meeting with the deputy chief was about that because of my solve rate people in high places had put in a good word for me carmeli wanting you out of the way carmeli and the department he said the realreason is they need to shut me up because carmeli told them about baker and nu and what he was going to do about it and they didnt try to stop him common interest i said the last thing lapd needed was a psychokiller cop clean slate alex cant say id rather see baker in court and the story about tenney being picked up for raymond ortiz and latvinia and dying in a shootout with police gives their families some peace of mind too bad raymonds body will never be found they told his parents tenney had burned it completely confessed it before he went for his gun convenient i said frowning he took something out of his pocket and placed it on
