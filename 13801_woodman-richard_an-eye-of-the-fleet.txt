richard woodman an eye of the fleet i am taking all frigates about me i possibly can for if i let the enemy escape for want of the eyes of the fleet i should consider myself as most highly reprehensible nelson authors note the major incidents in this novel are matters of historical fact some of the peripheral characters such as admirals kempenfelt and arbuthnot captain calvert jonathan poulter and wilfred collingwood are also factual and the personalities as depicted tally with the images they have left later generations the exploits of cyclops though fictional are both nautically and politically within the bounds of possibility the continental currency of congress was indeed worthless to the extent of almost ruining the revolution fighting in the carolinas and georgia was characterised by atrocities though the galuda river does not exist no nautical claim has been made which was impossible the details of the moonlight battle for instance can be verified from other sources though the actual capture of santa teresa is cyclopss own part in the action pains have been taken over the accuracy of facts concerning the life on board menofwar during the american war of independence and pedants may like to note that at the time drinkwater went to sea commissioned officers messed in the gunroom midshipmen and masters mates in the cockpit by the beginning of the next century the latter occupied the gunroom with the warrant officer gunner exercising a sort of parental authority and schoolmasters appointed to attempt the education of the young gentlemen by this time the officers had a grander wardroom chapter one the greenhorn october december a baleful sun broke through the overcast to shed a patch of pale light on the frigate the fresh westerly wind and the opposing flood tide combined to throw up a vicious sea as the ship under topsails and staysails drove east down the princes channel clear of the thames upon her quarterdeck the sailing master ordered the helm eased to prevent her driving too close to the pansand the four helmsmen struggling to hold the ship as the wheelspokes flickered through their fingers mr drinkwater the old master his white hair streaming in the wind addressed a lean youth of medium height with fine almost feminine features and an unhealthily pallid complexion the midshipman stepped forward nervously eager sir my compliments to the captain please inform him we are abeam of the pansand beacon yes sir he turned to go mr drinkwater sir please repeat my message and answer correctly the youth flushed deeply his adams apple bobbing with embarrassment y your compliments to the captain and were abeam the pansand beacon aye aye sir very good drinkwater darted away beneath the quarterdeck to where the redcoated marine sentinel indicated the holy presence of the captain of his britannic majestys gun frigate cyclops captain hope was shaving when the midshipman knocked on the door he nodded as the message was delivered drinkwater hovered uncertainly not knowing whether he was dismissed after what seemed an age the captain appeared satisfied with his chin wiped off the lather and began to tie his stock he fixed the young midshipman with a pair of watery blue eyes set in a deeply lined and cadaverous face and you are he left the question unfinished m mister drinkwater sir midshipman ah yes it was the rector of monken hadley requested your place i recollect it well the captain reached for his coat do your duty cully and you have nothing to fear but make damned sure you know what your duty is yes i mean aye aye sir very well tell the master ill be up shortly when ive finished my breakfast captain hope smoothed the coat down and turned to look out through the stern windows as the door closed behind the retreating drinkwater he sighed he judged the boy to be old for a new entrant and yet he could not escape the thought that it might have been himself nearly forty years ago the captain was fiftysix years of age he had only held his post rank for three years devoid of patronage he would have died a halfpay commander had not an unpopular war with the rebellious american colonies forced the admiralty to employ him many competent naval officers had refused to serve against the colonists particularly those with whig sympathies and independent means as the rebels acquired powerful allies the royal navy was stretched to the limit watching the cautiously hostile dutch the partisan neutrals of the baltic and the actively hostile french and spanish in their plight their lordships had scraped the barrel and in the lees at the bottom had discovered the able person of henry hope hope was more than a competent seaman he had served as lieutenant at quiberon bay and distinguished himself several times during the seven years war command of a sloop had come at the end of the war but by then he was forty with little hope of further advancement he had a widowed mother tended by a sister whose husband had fallen before ticonderoga in abercrombies bungled attack but no family of his own he was a man used to care and tribulation a man well suited to command of a ship but as he stared out of the stern windows at the yeasty bubbling wake that cut a smooth through the choppy waters of the outer estuary he remembered a more youthful hope now his name silently taunted him he idly wondered about the young man who had just left the cabin then he dismissed the thought as his servant brought in breakfast cyclops anchored in the downs for three days while she gathered a small convoy of merchantmen about her and waited for a favourable wind to proceed west when she and her covey of charges weighed they thought they would carry a pleasant easterly down channel in the event the wind veered and for a week cyclops beat to windward against the last of the equinoctial gales nathaniel drinkwater was forced to endure a brief hard schooling he lay aloft with the topmen shivering with cold and terror as the recalcitrant topgallants billowed and thundered about his ears there was no redress when an overzealous bosuns mate accidentally sliced his buttocks with a starter cruelty was a fact of life and its evils were only augmented between the stinking decks of an overcrowded british man owar worn out by a weeks incessant labour in conditions of unaccustomed cold forced by necessity to eat indifferent food washed down by small beer of incomparable badness bullied and shouted at drinkwater had broken down one night he wept into his hammock with bitter loneliness his dreams of glory and service to a grateful country melted into the desperate release of tears and in his misery he took refuge in thoughts of home he remembered his careworn mother desperate to see her sons maintain their station in life her delight when the rector had called with a letter from the relative of a friend a captain henry hope accepting nathaniel as midshipman aboard cyclops and how jubilant she had been that her elder son at last had reached the respectability of a kings officer he wept too for his brother the carefree irrepressible ned who was always in trouble and whom the rector himself had flogged for scrumping apples ned with whom he used to practice single stick on barnet common of whom his mother used to say despairingly that only a fathers firmness would make of him a gentleman ned had laughed at that tossed his head and laughed while across the room nathaniel had caught his mothers eyes and been ashamed for his brothers callousness nathaniel had only one recollection of his father a dim shadowy being who had tossed him in the air smelled of wine and tobacco and laughed wildly before dashing his own brains out in a riding accident ned had all his fathers reckless passion and love of horses while nathaniel inherited the mothers quieter fortitude but upon that miserable night when fatigue hunger sickness cold and hopelessness lay siege to his spirit nathaniel was exposed to the vicissitudes of fate and in the surrounding darkness his sobbing was overheard by his neighbour the senior midshipman at dinner the following day as eight or nine of cyclopss dozen midshipmen struggled through their pease pudding the president of the cockpit mr midshipman augustus morris rose solemnly from his place at the head of the filthy table we have a coward amongst us gentlemen he announced a peculiarly malevolent gleam in his hooded eyes the midshipmen whose ages varied between twelve and twentyfour looked from one to another wondering on whom the wrath of mr morris was about to descend drinkwater was already cringing under the onslaught he instinctively felt was destined for him as morriss eyes raked over the upturned faces they fell one by one to dumb regard of the pewter plates and tankards sliding about before them none of them would encourage morris neither would they interfere with whatever malice he had planned mister drinkwater morris sarcastically emphasised the title i shall endeavour to correct your predilection for tears by compelling your arse to weep a little get over that chest drinkwater knew it was pointless to resist at the mention of his name he had risen unsteadily to his feet he looked dumbly round at the indicated sea chest his legs shaking but refusing to move then a cruel fate made cyclops lurch and the tableau dissolved drinkwater was thrown across the chest by the forces of nature with an unnatural eagerness morris flung himself on drinkwater threw aside the blue cloth coattails and inserting his fingers in the waistband of drinkwaters trousers bared his victims buttocks to an accompaniment of tearing calico it was this act more than the six brutal stripes that morris laid on his posterior that burnt itself into drinkwaters memory for his mother had laboured on those trousers her arthritic fingers carefully passing the needle the tears filling her eyes at the prospect of parting with her elder son somehow with the resilience of youth drinkwater survived that passage to spithead despite the pain in his buttocks he had been forced to learn much about the details of handling a ship under sail for the westerly gale compelled the frigate to wear and wear again in a hard ruthless fight to windward and it was the second week in october before she brought to her anchor in st helens roads under the lee of bembridge hardly had cyclops gathered sternway her main topsail aback and the cable gone rumbling through the hawse than the third lieutenant was calling away the captains gig morris acted as the gigs coxswain he ordered drinkwater to the bow where a grinning seaman handed the youth a boathook the gig bobbed alongside the wooden wales of the frigates side the hook lodged in the mainchains above him but unseen drinkwater could hear the thumping of the marines boots as they fell in at the entry port then came the twittering of the pipes he looked up at the entry port fingers to his hat stood captain hope it was only the second time drinkwater had seen him face to face since their brief interview their eyes met the boys full of awe the mans blank with indifference hope turned around grasped the manropes and leaned outboard he descended the side until a foot above the gunwale of the boat he paused waiting for the boat to rise as it did so he jumped aboard landing with little dignity between stroke and second stroke he clambered over the intervening thwart from which the seamen deferentially drew aside and sat himself down toss oars yelled morris bear off forrard drinkwater pushed mightily against his boathook it caught in the iron work of the chains he tried to disengage it as the boats head fell off but it refused to move its shaft drawing through his hand and sticking incongruously outwards from the ships side he leaned further outboard and grabbed the end of the handle the sweat of exertion and humiliation poured off him he lunged again and nearly fell overboard sit down forrard roared morris and drinkwater subsided in the bows his cup of agony overflowing give way together the oars bit the water and groaned in the thole pins in minutes the mens backs were dark with perspiration drinkwater darted a glance aft morris was staring ahead his hand on the tiller the captain was gazing abstractedly at the green shores of the isle of wight away to larboard then a thought struck drinkwater he had left the boathook protruding from the frigates side what in gods name was he going to use when they reached the flagship his mind was overcome by sudden panic as he cast about the bow sheets for another boathook there was none for nearly twenty minutes as the gig danced over the sparkling sea and the westerly breeze dashed spray off the wavecaps drinkwater cast about him in an agony of indecision he knew their destination was the flagship hms sandwich of guns where even the seamen would look haughtily on the frigates unremarkable gig any irregularities in the boathandling would be commented upon to the disservice of cyclops then a second thought struck him any such display of poor seamanship would reflect equally upon mr midshipman morris and he was unlikely to let drinkwater discredit him unscathed the prospect of another beating further terrified the boy drinkwater stared ahead of the boat the low shore of hampshire lay before him the sun shining on the dun blocks of the forts at gosport and southsea guarding the entrance to portsmouth harbour between the gig and the shoreline a long row of ships of the line lay at anchor their hulls massive beneath the masts and crossed yards large ensigns snapped briskly at their sterns and the gaudy flutter of the union flags over their focsles gave the vista a festive air here and there the square flag of a rear or viceadmiral flew at a masthead sunlight glittered on gilded figureheads and quarter galleries as the battleships swung head to wind at the slackwater the sea surrounding them was dotted with small craft coastal vessels crowded on sail to avoid pulling boats of every conceivable size small launches and gigs conveyed officers and commanders larger long boats and cutters under pintsize midshipmen or grizzled masters mates brought stores powder or shot off from the dockyard water hoys and shallops their civilian crews abusive under their protection from the press gangs bucked alongside the battleships a verbal duel between their masters and anxious naval lieutenants who waved requisition orders at them seemed endless the sheer energy and scale of activity was like nothing drinkwater had ever witnessed before they passed a small cutter aboard which half a dozen painted doxies sat pallid with the boats motion two of them waved saucily at the gigs crew amongst whom a ripple of lust passed at the unaccustomed sight of swelling bodices eyes in the boat yelled morris selfimportantly himself glancing at the lushness exhibited by overtight stays the sandwich was nearer now and a cold sweat broke out again on drinkwaters forehead then by accident he solved his problem wriggling round to view the prospect before him his hand encountered something sharp he looked down beneath the grating he caught sight of something hooklike he shifted his weight and lifted the slatted wood in the bilge lay a small grapnel it had an eye at the end of the shank it was this that saved his backside another tanning fishing it out he bent on the end of the gigs painter and coiled the bight in his hand he now possessed a substitute boathook and relaxed once again he looked about him it was a splendid sight beyond the line of battleships several frigates lay at anchor they had already passed one lying as guardship at the warner and had drinkwater been less perturbed by the loss of his boathook he might have been more attentive but now he could feast his eyes on a sight that his provincial breeding had previously denied him beyond fort gilkicker more masts rose from hulls grey blue with distance drinkwaters inexperienced eyes did not recognise the lines of transports it was a powerful fleet a great effort by britain to avert the threat to her west indian possessions and succour the ailing ships on the north american station for two years since the surrender of burgoynes army britain had been trying to bring the wily washington to battle while simultaneously holding off the increasing combination of european enemies from snapping up distant colonies when her attention was occupied elsewhere that this effort had been further strained by the corruption peculation and plain jobbery that infected public life in general and lord sandwichs navy in particular was not a matter to concern drinkwater for grander spectacles were before him as the gig drew close to the massive side of sandwich captain hope drew the attention of morris to something the midshipman turned the boat head to sea oars he ordered and the blades rose dripping to the horizontal drinkwater looked round for some reason for this cessation of activity there was none as far as he could see looking again at sandwich he noted a flurry about her decks glittering officers in blue and white pointed polished telescopes astern in the direction of portsmouth drinkwater could just see the crowns of the marines black hats as they fell in then a drum rolled and the black specks were topped by a line of silver bayonets as the marines shouldered arms a pipe shrilled out and all activity aboard sandwich ceased the great ship seemed to wait expectantly as a small black ball rose to the truck of her mainmast then round her stern and into view from cyclopss gig swept an admirals barge at its bow fluttered the red cross of st george the oarsmen bent to their task with unanimous precision their red and white striped shirts moving in unison their heads crowned by black beavers a small dapper midshipman stood upright in the stern hand on tiller his uniform was immaculate his hat set at a rakish angle drinkwater stared down at his own crumpled coat and badly cobbled trousers he felt distinctly uncomfortable also in the stem of the barge sat an oldlooking man wrapped in a boat cloak the lasting impression made on drinkwater was a thin hard mouth then the barge was alongside sandwich and admiral sir george brydges rodney was ascending the side of his flagship a squeal of pipes a roll of drums and a twinkle of light as the bayonets flashed to the present at the main masthead the black ball broke out and revealed itself as the red cross of st george at this sight the guns of the fleet roared out in salute admiral rodney had arrived to take command of the fleet a few minutes later drinkwater hurled his grapnel at sandwichs mainchains by good fortune it held first time and to indifferent ceremonial captain hope reported to his superior chapter two the danish brig january on new years day rodneys armada was at sea in addition to the scouting frigates and twentyone line of battleships no less than three hundred merchantmen cleared the channel that chill morning in accordance with her instructions cyclops was part of the escort attending the transports and so took no part in the action of th january a spanish squadron of four frigates two corvettes and the gun ship guipuscoano was encountered off cape finisterre with a convoy of fifteen merchantmen the entire force was surrounded and taken prize crews were put on board and the captured vessels escorted back to england by the guipuscoano renamed prince william in honour of the duke of clarence then a midshipman with the fleet the captured vessels which contained victuals were retained to augment the supplies destined for gibraltar as the concourse of ships plodded its slow way down the iberian coast on the afternoon of the th drinkwater sat in the foretop of the cyclops it was his action station and he had come to regard it as something of his own domain guarded as it was by its musket rests and a small swivel gun here he was free of the rank taint between decks the bullying senselessness of morris and here too in the dog watches he was able to learn some of the finer points of the seamans art from an able seaman named tregembo young nathaniel was quick to learn and impressed most of his superiors with his eager enthusiasm to attempt any task but on this afternoon he was enjoying a rest soaking up the unaccustomed luxury of january sunshine it seemed impossible that only a couple of months previously he had known nothing of this life so packed with events and impressions had the period been that it seemed another lifetime in which he had bid his widowed mother and younger brother farewell now he reflected with the beginnings of pride he was part of the complex organisation that made cyclops a man owar drinkwater gazed over the ship which creaked below him he saw captain hope as an old remote figure in stark contrast to his first lieutenant the honourable john devaux was the third son of an earl an aristocrat to his fingertips albeit an impoverished one and a whig to boot he and hope were political opponents and devauxs haughty youth annoyed the captain henry hope had been too long in the service to let it show too frequently since devaux with influence was not to be antagonised in truth the younger mans competence was never in doubt unlike many of his class he had taken an interest in the business of naval war which was motivated by more than an instinct for survival had his politics been different or the government whig he might have been in hopes shoes and hope in his it was a fact both had the intelligence to acknowledge and though friction was never far from the surface it was always veiled as for cyclops herself she had shaken down as well as any ship manned under the system of the press her crew had exercised at the great guns under their divisional officers and her signalling system had been sorely strained trying to maintain order amongst the unruly merchantmen but by and large both captain and first lieutenant agreed she would do hope had no illusions about glory so fanaticism was absent from his character if his officers were able and his crew willing he asked no more of them to nathaniel drinkwater dozing in his top cyclops had become his only real world his doubts had begun to evaporate under the influence of a change in the weather and youthful adaptability he was slowly learning that the midshipmens berth was an environment in which it was just possible to exist although he loathed morris and disliked several of the older members of his mess the majority were pleasant enough boys they got on well together bearing morriss bullying with fortitude and commiserating in their hatred of him drinkwater regarded lieutenant devaux with awe and the old sailing master blackmore whose duties included the instruction of the midshipmen in the rudiments of navigation with the respect he might have felt for his father had the latter been living the nearest he came to friendship was with the topman tregembo who handled the foretop swivel gun in action he proved an endless source of wisdom and information about the frigate and her minutiae a cornishman of uncertain age he had been caught with a dubious cargo in the fishwell of his fathers lugger off the lizard by a revenue cutter his father had offered the officers armed resistance and been hanged for his pains as an act of clemency his son was given a lighter sentence which the justices assured the court would mitigate the grief felt by the wife of the dastardly smuggler impressment tregembo had hardly stepped ashore since drinkwater smiled to himself feeling up here in his little kingdom the selfsatisfaction of youth seeping through him below on deck one bell rang through the ship he was on watch in fifteen minutes he rose and looked up above him the topmast met the topgallant and at the upper hounds sat the lookout a mood of devilment seized him he would ascend to the hounds and from there slide down the backstay to the deck the long descent would be an impressive demonstration of his proficiency as a seaman he began to climb casting his leg over the topgallant yard he joined the man on lookout far below him cyclops rolled gently his view of the deck was broken by the bellying sails and lent perspective by the diminishing rigging each rope leading down to its respective belaying pin or eyebolt the seaman made shift for him and drinkwater looked around the blue circle of the sea was broken by some two hundred odd white specks as the armada sailed south in that direction below the horizon the advanced frigates reconnoitred behind them in three divisions came the dark hulls of the ships of the line a few of them wearing the yellow gunstrakes that would soon become uniform in the centre of the middle column sandwich carried admiral rodney the man responsible for all this puissance behind the battleships a couple of cutters and a schooner tenders to the fleet followed like dogs in the wake of their master then in a great mass came the convoy of troopships storeships cargo vessels with an escort of four frigates and two sloops of war cyclopss station on the inshore bow of the convoy made her the nearest frigate to the rear division of battleships and the most advanced ship of the convoy itself from his elevated position drinkwater looked out to larboard eight or nine leagues distant slightly dun coloured in the westering sun the coast of portugal was clearly visible his eyes raked over the horizon casually and he was about to descend to the deck when his attention was caught by an irregularity a small speck of white almost abeam of them was set against the backdrop of the coast he nudged the seaman and pointed sail sir the man responded matteroffactly yes ill hail then in as manly a voice as he could muster deck there faintly the voice of keene the third lieutenant came back aye aye sail eight points to larboard drinkwater reached for the backstay and began his spectacular hand over hand descent in the excitement of the strange sail nobody noticed him signal from flag sir said lieutenant keene to captain hope as drinkwater came aft well our number chase acknowledge said the captain mr keene put the ship before the wind drinkwater assisted making up the answering signal as the lieutenant turned to bellow orders through his speaking trumpet bosuns mates chivvied the people and the helm was put up cyclops swung to the east the braces rattling through the sheaves as the yards swung round all sail if you please mr keene aye aye sir there was enthusiasm in the lieutenants voice and a ripple of excitement ran through the ship free of the constrictions necessary in keeping station the frigate spread her wings clew and buntlines were cast off the pins as the topmen spread out along the footropes loosening the canvas as the masters mates stationed at the bunt of each sail waved to the deck the order was given to sheet home the topgallants billowed collapsed and billowed again as the waisters tallied on to the halliards and the yards rose from the caps cyclops leaned to the increase of power the hempen rigging drew tight and the vessel began to tremble gently as she gathered speed the frigate surged through the dark atlantic the white vee of her wake creaming out from under her transom on deck the watch changed and the waist cleared as men drawn on deck by the excitement went below again drinkwater found the captain staring at him sir he ventured mr er drinkwater sir ahh mr drinkwater take a glass to the foremasthead and see what you make of her dyou think you can do that aye aye sir drinkwater took from a rack an exceedingly battered telescope which was provided by a generous navy board for the exclusive use of the ships young gentlemen he started for the foremast rigging it was nearly a quarter of an hour before he returned to the deck aware that hope was testing his ability he had waited until he had something positive to report he touched his hat to the captain shes a brig sir not flying colours sir very well mr drinkwater see her from the deck now sir drawled devaux who had come up on deck the captain nodded clear away the bow chasers mr devaux drinkwater too could see the two masted vessel they were bearing down upon he watched for the bright spot of colour that must surely appear soon to denote her nationality a dozen other telescopes were endeavouring to glean the same information a red speck rose to her peak red with a white cross danish a dozen people snapped out simultaneously cyclops tore down on her quarry and on a nod from hope a gun barked from forward its smoke rolling slowly ahead of the onrushing frigate a white spout rose ahead of the danish ship it was a cable short but it had the desired effect as the dane backed his main topsail and hove to mr devaux youll board orders flew where previously every idler in the ship had been intently watching the chase chaos erupted out of this apparent disorder the main and forecourses rose in their buntlines and groups of organised men appeared to lower the lee quarter boat as cyclops turned to back her main topsail devaux shouted more orders and drinkwater heard his own name in the confusion get in that boat cully roared the first lieutenant and nathaniel ran to the waist where a net had been flung over the side the boats crew were aboard but extra seamen armed with cutlasses were swarming down into her drinkwater cocked a foot over the rail caught the leg of his trousers on a belaying pin and heard the fabric rip but this time it did not seem to matter he scrambled down into the boat to his surprise devaux was already there still shouting where in gods name is wheeler he roared at nobody in particular then as the redcoated marine lieutenant and six of his men clumsily descended the netting their tower muskets tangling in the cordage come on you bloody lobsters devaux yelled to the appreciative grins of the seamen lieutenant wheeler resented the insult to his service but he was unable to retaliate due to his preoccupation with getting himself and his hanger into the boat without a total loss of dignity shove off out oars give way together and put your backs into it the big boat drove forward and devaux pushed the tiller into drinkwaters hand take her alongside his lee side and keep her there he turned to wheeler shes a neutral so dont board unless you hear me shout he raised his voice bosuns mate the petty officer with the armed seamen stood up in the bow sir make no attempt to board unless i need help if i shout i want the whole bloody lot of you the seamen grinned and fingered their blades minutes later drinkwaters cracking voice was bellowing oars toss oars hook on lieutenant devaux leapt for the danes chains for a second or two his elegant legs dangled incongruously then he had hoisted himself to the deck of the brig the boat bounced up and down the side of the strange ship occasionally a towheaded face looked curiously overside at them all in the boat were nervous a few cannon balls dropped from the rail would plummet through the boats planking it seemed to drinkwater that the first lieutenant had been gone hours he watched the rail advance and recede as the atlantic shoved the boat up the danes side then dropped her down again he looked anxiously at wheeler the marine officer just smiled dont worry cully when the hon john is in trouble hell squeal at last to his infinite relief drinkwater saw devauxs legs swing over the rail he heard the lieutenants suave voice all trace of coarseness gone yer servant maam and the next instant he had tumbled into the boat he grabbed the tiller from drinkwater without ceremony shove off oars give way together and pull you buggers devaux crouched in the stern his body bent with urgency pull pull pull like youd pull a frenchman off yer mother the men grinned at the obscenity devaux knew his business and the seamen bent their oar looms with effort the blades sprang from the water and flew forward for the next stroke astern of them the dane made sail once devaux looked back and following his gaze drinkwater made out a flash of colour where a woman waved wheeler said devaux weve work to do quite deliberately devaux told wheeler the news he knew the men within hearing would pass it on to the lower deck equally he knew hope would not bother to do so only a garbled version might reach the innermost recesses of cyclops unless devaux disseminated the information himself these men could shortly be called upon to die and the first lieutenant sought to infect them with blood lust he had seen what a fighting madness such enthusiasm could induce in british seamen and he knew cyclops might need just such an infection in the coming hours that dane has just sailed from cadiz the dons are at sea a fleet of em bit of luck he was probritish he paused reflectively married to an english girl damned handsome woman too he grinned the marines grinned too the message was going home it was dark when cyclops rejoined the fleet a full moon enabled hope to take her in amongst the concourse of ships to where the three horizontal lanterns in sandwichs rigging marked the presence of the admiral shortening sail the frigate sent a boat across and devaux had reported to rodney the outcome of this momentous news was that cyclops had been ordered to make sail and warn the advance frigates the fleet had shortened sail at sunset to avoid dispersal and aid station keeping so that cyclops soon drew ahead of the battleships passing down the regular lines of massive sides which dwarfed the swifter frigate as they lumbered along creaking in the moonlight at dawn cyclops was in sight of the frigates astern of her the fleets topsails were just visible with one ship the two decked seventyfourgun bedford crowding on sail to come up with the cruisers hampered by the poor signalling code in use hope had difficulty in conveying the meaning of his message to the more distant frigates by a happy coincidence however he chose clear for action and two hours later bedford came up flying the same signal her two lines of gun muzzles already visible for rodney had thrown out the order to his fleet at dawn at the first beat of the marine drummers sticks drinkwater had sensed the tension in cyclops he raced for his station in the foretop where the swivel was loaded and primed but there was no occasion for haste all morning the british stood at action stations without any sign of the enemy during the forenoon division after division of the fleet had altered course to the south east rounding the pink cliffs of cape saint vincent and heading for the straits of gibraltar at noon half of cyclopss company stood down for a meal of beer flip and biscuit after a hasty meal drinkwater eager not to miss a moment of what popular comment was saying would be a fleet action returned to the foretop he looked around him the frigates had drawn back on the main body and bedford had come up to occupy the inshore station in the foretop his men had loaded their muskets tregembo was musingly caressing the toy swivel gun astern in the main top morriss blue coat could clearly be seen he was bending over a young devon seaman whose good looks had excited some crude jibes from his messmates drinkwater could not quite identify the feeling engendered by the sight of morris thus engaged beyond the fact that it was vaguely disquieting he was still a comparative innocent to the perversions of humanity astern of morris sergeant hagan commanded the mizzen top and its marine sharpshooters their scarlet coats were a splash of vivid colour against the black hemp rigging that almost obscured the view looking down nathaniel had an unimpeded view of the quarterdeck as cleared for action the maincourse and crossjack were clewed up he saw captain hope and lieutenant devaux there with the old sailing master standing by the quartermaster and helmsmen a gaggle of midshipmen and masters mates were also in attendance to run messages and transmit signals but as well as blue there was scarlet aft wheeler resplendent in his brilliant coat crimson sash and the glittering gorget of a military officer had his hanger drawn he carried it negligently in the crook of his arm but the flash of its blade was a wicked reminder of death it was very different from the ash single stick drinkwater had thrust and parried with at home he had not much considered death or the possibility of dying falling from the rigging had at first terrified him but he had overcome that but supposing a mast the foremast perhaps was shot away he looked down again to where nets were stretched above the deck to keep falling spars and rigging off the guns crews toiling below at the moment those gun crews were lazing around their pieces just visible to nathaniel below him on the main deck beneath the gratings the second and third lieutenants conferred with one another on the frigates centreline their demeanour was studiously casual as they waited to command their batteries apart from the creaking of the ships fabric the passage of the wind and the noise of her bow wave cyclops was a silent thing upwards of two hundred and fifty men waited expectantly as did the crews of all the fleet at one oclock in the afternoon bedford fired a gun signalled sandwich and let fly her topsail sheets for those too distant to see the signal the flutter of her topsails was a time honoured indication of the presence of an enemy fleet in sight winds getting up said tregembo to no one in particular but breaking the silence in the foretop chapter three the moonlight battle january the battle that followed was one of the most dramatic ever fought by the royal navy the waters over which the opposing fleets contended were to be immortalised twentyfive years later when nelson was to conquer and die off cape trafalgar but the night action of the thth january was to be known by no geographical name in an age when admirals were absolutely bound upon pain of death to the tactical concept of the unbroken line ranged against that of the enemy rodneys unleasing of his ships was an innovation of the utmost importance and the manner of its doing in that wild moonlight battle was an act of daring unsurpassed by sailing warships in such large numbers tregembo had been right an hour after bedfords sighting of eleven spanish battleships and two frigates the sky had clouded over the wind backed westerly and began to freshen at bedfords signal rodney had thrown out the general chase to his warships each captain now sought to outdo the rest and the vessels fitted with the new copper bottoms forged ahead the twodeckers defence resolution and edgar began taking the lead officers anxiously checked their gear as captains reckless as schoolboys held on to sail still the wind rose telescopes trained with equal anxiety on the spaniards who faced with such overwhelming odds turned away to leeward and the shelter of cadiz seeing the retrograde movement rodney signalled his ships to engage from leeward thereby conveying to his captains the tactical concept of overhauling the enemy and interposing themselves between the spanish and safety it had become a race as the british ships tore forward dead before the wind puffs of smoke appeared from their focsles as gunners tried ranging shots at first the plumes of water difficult to see among breaking wave crests were a long way astern of the spaniards but slowly as the minutes ran into an hour they got nearer aboard cyclops devaux stood poised on the focsle glass to eye as the frigates long ninepounders barked at the enemy as she lifted her bow almost directly above drinkwater watched eagerly his inexperienced eyes missed the fall of shot but the excitement of the scene riveted his attention cyclops trembled with the thrill of the chase and giving expression to the corporate feeling of the ship omalley the mad irish cook sat crosslegged on the capstan top scraping his fiddle the insane jig was mixed with the hiss and splash of the sea around them and the moan of the gale as it strummed the hempen rigging captain hope had taken cyclops across the slower bedfords bows and was heading for the northernmost spaniard a frigate of almost equal size to the south of their quarry the high stern of the spanish line of battleships stretched in a ragged line the second frigate hidden behind them to the east a sudden column of white rose close to the cyclopss plunging bowsprit drinkwater looked up held under the galleries of a spanish twodecker by the following wind a puff of white smoke lingered tregembo swore thats good shooting for dagoes he said it was only then that drinkwater realised he was under fire as cyclops crossed the stern of the twodecker in chase of the frigate the battleships had tried a ranging shot suddenly there was a rush of air and the sound of two corks being drawn from bottles looking up drinkwater saw a hole in the foretopsail and another in the main it was uncomfortably close as their sterns rose to the following seas the spaniards were firing at the oncoming british silhouetted against the setting sun drinkwater shivered the brief winter warmth was gone and the fresh breeze had become a gale he looked again at the spanish fleet they were appreciably nearer then he saw two plumes of white rise under the spaniards quarter their own guns were silent he looked interrogatively at tregembo what the then the seaman pointed to starboard hidden from the huddling midshipman by the mast resolution a newly coppered seventyfour was passing the frigate conditions now favoured the heavier ships resolution was overhauling the spaniards rapidly and beyond her edgar and defence were bearing down on the enemy before the sun set behind a bank of cloud its final rays picked out the resolution the almost horizontal light accentuated every detail of the scene the sea piling up from the west its shadowed surfaces a deep indigo constantly moving and flashing golden where it caught the sun seemed to render the warship on it a thing of stillness the resolutions hull was dark with the menace of her larboard batteries as she passed scarcely two cables from cyclops her sails drew out pulling the great vessel along transmitting their power down through the masts and rigging until the giant oak hull with its weight of artillery and men made ten knots through the water drinkwater could see the heads of her upperdeck gunners and a line of red and silver marines on the poop at her stern and peak battle ensigns stood out pointing accusingly at the enemy ahead her bow chasers barked again this time there was no white column devauxs glass swung round shes hit em by god he shouted somebody on the focsle cheered he was joined by another as cyclopss crew roared their approval at the sight of resolution sailing into battle drinkwater found himself cheering wildly with the other men in the top tears poured down tregembos cheeks the bastards the fucking bastards he sobbed drinkwater was not sure who the bastards were nor at the time did it seem to matter it is doubtful if tregembo himself knew what he was expressing was his helplessness the feeling of magnificent anger that overcame these men the impressed the drunkards the gaol birds and the petty thieves all the dregs of eighteenthcentury society forced into a tiny hull and kept in order by a ruthless discipline sailed into a storm of lead and iron death cheering stirring to their souls by emotions they could not understand or control the sight of puissant resolution had torn from their breasts the cheers of desperation it is with such spontaneous inspiration that the makers of war have always gulled their warriors and transformed them into heroes thus did the glamour of action infect these men with the fighting anger that served their political masters supremely well perhaps it was to the latter that the barely articulate tregembo alluded silence silence there hope was roaring from the quarterdeck and the cheering died as men grinned at one another suddenly sheepish after the outburst of emotion faintly across the intervening sea a cheer echoed from resolution and drinkwater realised cyclops must appear similarly magnificent from the seventyfour a shudder of pride and cold rippled his back before darkness isolated the admiral from his ships rodney threw out a final command to his captains engage the enemy more closely he thus encouraged them to press the enemy to the utmost degree both fleets were tearing down upon a lee shore with offlying shoals by five oclock it was nearly dark the wind had risen to a gale and gloomy clouds raced across the sky but the moon was rising a full yellow moon that shone forth from between the racing scud shedding a fitful light upon the baleful scene at sunset resolution edgar and defence had drawn level with the rearmost spanish ships exchanging broadsides as they passed they kept on heading the leeward enemy off from cadiz larboard battery make ready the order rang out drinkwater transferred his attention to port as cyclops was instantly transformed the waiting was over tension was released as gunners leapt to their pieces and the british frigate rode down the spanish the enemy was close on cyclopss larboard bow below drinkwater a chaser rang out and a hole appeared in the spaniards main topsail devaux ran aft along the larboard gangboard he was yelling orders to the lieutenants on the gundeck below he joined hope on the quarterdeck where the two men studied their enemy at last the captain called one of the midshipmen over mcompliments to lieutenant keene when his battery engages he is to cripple the rigging the boy scrambled below hope wanted the spaniard immobilised before both ships distracted by the fury of battle ran down to leeward where the low spanish coast lay offshore the shoal of san lucar waited for the oncoming ships of both nations mr blackmore hope called over the sailing master sir the san lucar shoal how far distant three or four leagues sir answered the old man after a moments consideration very well post a mate forward on the fore tgallant yard i want to know the instant that shoal is sighted a masters mate went forward on his way aloft he passed drinkwater who stopped him with a question old mans worried about the shoals to looard the mate informed him oh said drinkwater looking ahead of the frigate but all he could see was a tumbling waste of black and silver water as clouds crossed the moon the spume smoking off the wave crests as they tumbled down wind a squealing of gun trucks told where the men of the larboard gun battery were handspiking their carriages round to bear on the enemy the spanish frigate was ahead of cyclops but when the british ship drew abeam they would be about two cables distant make ready the order was passed along the dark gundeck in his foretop drinkwater checked the swivel under the foot of the topsail he could see the high spanish poop tregembo swung the swivel gun round and pointed it at where he judged the spanish officers would be the other seamen cocked their muskets and drew beads on the enemys mizen top where they knew spanish soldiers would be aiming at their own officers the spanish frigate was only two points forward of cyclopss beam in the darkness of the gundeck lieutenant keene commanding the larboard battery of twelvepounders looked along the barrel of his aftermost gun when it bore on the enemys stern his entire broadside would be aimed at the frigate a midshipman dodged up to him touching his hat captains compliments sir and you may open fire when your guns bear keene acknowledged and looked along the deck accustomed to the gloom he could see the long line of cannon lit here and there by lanterns the men were crouched round their pieces tensely awaiting the order to open fire the gun captains looked his way expectantly each grasping his linstock every gun was shotted canister on ball a ragged flash of fire flickered along the spaniards side the noise of the broadside was muted by the gale several balls thumped home into the hull tearing off long oak splinters and sending them lancing down the crowded decks a man screamed another was lifted bodily from the deck and his bloodily pulped corpse smashed against a cannon breech aloft holes appeared in the topgallant sails and the masters mate astride the fore topgallant yard had his shoes ripped off by the passage of a ball with a twang several ropes parted the main royal yard its sail furled came down with a rush orders were shouted at the topmen to secure the loose gear meanwhile keene still watched from his after gunport he could see nothing but sea and sky the night filled with the raging of the gale and the responsive hiss of the sea then the stern of the spanish frigate plunged into view dark and menacing another ragged broadside rippled along her side he stepped back and waited for the upward roll fire chapter four the spanish frigate january frigates varied in size and design but basically they comprised a single gundeck running the full length of the ship in battle the temporary bulkheads providing the captain and officers accommodation were removed when the ship cleared for action above the gundeck and running forward almost to the main mast was the quarterdeck from where the ship was conned a few light cannon and antipersonnel weapons were situated here at the bow a similar raised deck or focsle extended aft round the base of the foremast the focsle and quarterdeck were connected along the ships side by wooden gangways which extended over that part of the gundeck otherwise exposed and known as the waist however the open space between the gangways was beamed in and supported chocks for the ships boats so that the ventilation that the opening was supposed to provide the gundeck was at best poor when the larboard battery opened fire the confined space of the gundeck became a cacophonous hell the flashes of the guns alternately plunged the scene from brilliance to blackness despite the season of the year the seamen were soon running in sweat as they sponged rammed and fired their brutish artillery the concussion of the guns and rumbling of the trucks as they recoiled and were hauled forward again was deafening the tight knots of men laboured round each gun the lieutenants and masters mates controlling their aim as they broke from broadsides to firing at will dashing about the sanded deck the little powder monkeys scraps of undernourished urchins scrambled from the gloomier orlop deck below to where the gunner had retired in his felt slippers to preside over the alchemical mysteries of cartridge preparation at the companionways the marine sentries stood bayonets fixed to their loaded muskets they had orders to shoot any but approved messengers or stretcher parties on their way to the orlop panic and cowardice were thus nicely discouraged the only way for a man to pass below was to be carried to mr surgeon appleby and his mates who like the gunner held their own esoteric court in the frigates cockpit here the midshipmens chests became the ships operating theatre and covered with canvas provided appleby with the table upon which he was free to butcher his majestys subjects a few feet above the septic stink of ratinfested bilges in a foetid atmosphere lit by a few guttering oil lamps the men of sandwichs navy came for succour and often breathed their last cyclops fired seven broadsides before the two ships drew abeam the spaniards fired back with increasing irregularity as the dreadful precision of the british cannon smashed into their vessels fabric even so they carried away cyclopss mizen mast above the upper hounds more rigging parted and the main topsail shot through in a dozen places suddenly dissolved into a flapping cracking mess of torn canvas as the gale finished the work the cannon balls had started suddenly the two frigates were abeam the sea rushing black between them the moon appeared from behind the obscurity of a cloud details of the enemy stood out and etched themselves into drinkwaters brain he could see men in the tops officers on her quarterdeck and the activity of gun crews on the upper deck a musket ball smacked into the mast above him then another and another fire he yelled unnecessarily loudly at his topmen astern of him the main top loosed off then tregembo fired the swivel drinkwater saw the scatter of the langridge tearing up the spaniards decks he watched fascinated as a man puppetlike in the bizarre light fell jerking to the deck with a dark stain spreading round him someone lurched against drinkwater and sat down against the mast a black hole existed where the mans right eye had been drinkwater caught his musket and sighted along it he focussed on a shadowy figure reloading in the enemys main top he did it as coolly as shooting at barnet fair squeezing the trigger the flint sparked and the musket jerked against his shoulder the man fell tregembo had reloaded the swivel and the moon disappeared behind a cloud as it roared the concussion wave of a terrific explosion swept the two vessels momentarily stopping the combatants away to the south six hundred men had ceased to exist as the seventygun san domingo blew up fire reaching her magazine and causing her disintegration the interruption of the explosion reminded them all of the other ships engaged to the southward drinkwater reloaded the musket enemy balls no longer whizzed round him he looked up levelling the barrel the spanish frigates mainmast leaned drunkenly forward stays snapped and the great spars collapsed dragging the mizen topmast with it cyclops drew ahead hope and blackmore stared anxiously astern where the crippled spaniard wallowed wreckage hung over her side as she swung to starboard if the spanish captain was quick he could rake cyclops his whole broadside pouring in through the latters wide stern and the shot travelling the length of the crowded decks it was every commanders nightmare to be raked especially from astern where the comparative fragility of the stern windows offered little resistance to the enemy shot the wreckage over her side was drawing the spaniard round one of her larboard guns fired and splinters shot up from cyclopss quarter certainly someone appreciated the opportunity cyclopss helm was put down in an attempt to bring cyclops on a parallel course but the spanker burst as the spaniard fired then the mizen topmast went and cyclops lost the necessary leverage to force her stern round it was a ragged broadside compared with that of the british but its effects were no less lethal although nearly a quarter of a mile distant the damaged enemy had fought back with devastating success as captain hope surveyed the damage with devaux a voice hailed them deck there breakers on the lee bow although the british frigate had started her turn the loss of her after sails deprived her of manoeuvrability there were anxious faces on the quarterdeck the officers looked aloft the lower mizen mast still stood broken off some six feet above the top the wreckage was hanging over the larboard side dragging the frigate back that way while the gale in the forward sails still drove the ship inexorably downwind to where the san lucar shoal awaited them axes were already at work clearing the raffle hope saw a chance and ordered the helm hard over to continue the swing to port devaux looked forward and then at the captain set the crojack bend on a new spanker and get the fore topsl clewed up the captain snapped at him the first lieutenant ran forward screaming for topmen anyone pulling the upperdeck gun crews from their pieces thrusting bosuns mates here and there men raced for the rigging disappeared below hurrying and scurrying under the first lieutenants hysterical direction wheeler get your lobsters to brace the crojack yard aye aye sir wheelers booted men stomped away with the mizen braces as the topmen shook out the sail a masters mate unmade the weather sheet he was joined by another they both hauled as two or three seamen under a bosuns mate loosed the clew and buntlines the great sail exploded white in the moonlight flogging in the gale then it drew taut and cyclops began to swing still in his top drinkwater could see the shoal now a line of grey ahead of them perhaps four or five miles away he became aware of a voice hailing him foretop there aye sir he looked over the edge at the first lieutenant staring up at him aloft and furl that topsl drinkwater started up the fore topsail was already losing its power as the sheets slackened and the clew and buntlines drew it up to the yard it was flogging madly the trembling mast attesting to the fact that many of its stays must have been shot away tregembo was already in the rigging as drinkwater forsook the familiar top he was lightheaded with the insane excitement of the night when they had finished battling with the sail drinkwater lay over the yard exhausted with hunger and cold he looked to starboard the white line on the bank seemed very near now and cyclops was rolling as the swell built up in the shoaling water but she was reaching now sailing across the wind and roughly parallel with the shoal she would still make leeway but she was no longer running directly on to the bank to the south and west dark shapes and flashes told of where the two fleets did battle nearer and to larboard now the spanish frigate wallowed beam on to wind and sea and rolling down on to the shoal drawn from the gundeck a party of powderblackened and exhausted men toiled to get the spare spanker on deck the long sausage of hard canvas snaked out of the tiers and on to the deck thirteen minutes later the new sail rose on the undamaged spars cyclops was once more under control the crossjack was furled and the headsail sheets slackened again her bowsprit turned towards the shoal as hope anxiously wore ship to bring her on to the starboard tack heading where the spanish frigate still wallowed helplessly the british frigate paid off before the wind then her bowsprit swung away from the shoal the wind came over the starboard quarter then the beam the yards were hauled round the headsail sheets hardened in the wind howled over the starboard bow stronger now they were heading into it cyclops plunged into a sea and a shower of stinging spray swept aft half naked gunners scurried away below to tend their cannon hope gave orders to reengage as cyclops bore down on her adversary slowly drawing the crippled spaniard under her lee cyclopss guns rolled again and the spaniard fired back devaux was shouting at blackmore above the crash of the guns why dont he anchor master and have us reach up and down ahead of him raking him scoffed the older man what else can he do besides theres a limit to how long we can hang on here what we want is offing hope heard him released from the tension of immediate danger now his command was again under control the conversation irritated him ill trouble you to fight the ship mr devaux and leave the tactical decisions to me devaux was silent he looked sullenly at the spanish ship and was astonished at hopes next order get a hawser through an after port quickly man quickly at first devaux was uncomprehending then the moon broke forth again and the lieutenant followed hopes pointing arm look man look the red and gold of castile was absent from the stern the spanish frigate had struck cease fire cease fire cyclopss guns fell silent as she plunged past the enemy the exhausted gunners collapsing with their exertions but devaux all thoughts of arguing dispelled by the turn of events was once more amongst them rousing them to further efforts devaux shouted orders bosuns mates swung their starters and the realisation of the spanish surrender swept the ship in a flash fatigue vanished in a trice for she was a war prize if they could save her from going ashore on the san lucar shoal even the aristocratic devaux did not despise his captains avarice the chance of augmenting his paltry patrimony would be eagerly seized upon he found himself hoping cyclops had not done too much damage on the quarterdeck captain hope was enduring the masters objections the only person on board who could legitimately contest the captains decisions from the navigational point of view blackmore vigorously protested the inadvisability of taking cyclops to leeward again to tow off a frigate no more than half a league from a dangerous shoal but the exertions of the night affected men differently as blackmore turned away in defeat hope saw his last opportunity shedding years at the prospect of such a prize his caution fell a prey to temptation after a life spent in a service which had consistently robbed him of a reputation for dash or glamour fate was holding out a fiscal prize of enormous magnitude all he had to do was apply some of the expertise that his years of seagoing had given him wear ship mr blackmore the captain turned and bumped into a slim figure hurrying aft b beg pardon sir drinkwater had descended from the foretop he touched his hat to the captain well shoals a mile to leeward sir for a minute hope studied the young face he showed promise thank you mr er drinkwater sir quite so remain with me my messengers gone the captain indicated the remains of his twelveyearold midshipman messenger the sight of the small broken body made drinkwater feel very light headed he was cold and very hungry he was aware that the frigate was manoeuvring close to the crippled spaniard paying off downwind first lieutenants on the gundeck see how long hell be uncomprehending the midshipman hurried off below the shadowy scene in the gundeck was ordered a hundred gunners lugged a huge rope aft drinkwater discovered the first lieutenant right aft and passed the message devaux grunted and then over his shoulder ordered follow me they both ran back to the quarterdeck nearly ready sir said devaux striding past the captain to the taffrail he lugged out his hanger and cut the log ship from its line and called drinkwater coil that for heaving young shaver he indicated the long log line coiled in its basket for an instant the boy stood uncertainly then recollecting the way tregembo had taught him he began to coil the line devaux was bustling round a party of sailors bringing a coil of fourinch rope aft he hung over the taffrail dangling one end and shouting at someone below eventually the end was caught drawn inboard and secured to the heavy cable devaux stood upright and one of the seamen took the log line and secured it to the fourinch rope devaux seemed satisfied banyard he said to the seaman heave that at the spaniard when i give the word cyclops was closing the crippled frigate she seemed impossibly large as the two ships closed the rise and fall between them fifteen to twenty feet the two ships were very close now the spaniards bowsprit rose and fell raking aft along cyclopss side figures were visible on her focsle as the bowsprit jutted menacingly over the knot of figures at the after end of cyclops if it ripped the spanker cyclops was doomed since she would again become unmanageable falling off before the gale the spar rose again then fell as the frigate wallowed in a trough it hit cyclopss taffrail caught for an instant then tore free with a splintering of wood at a signal from devaux banyards line snaked dextrously out to tangle at the gammoning of the bowsprit dipping towards the british stern come on boy shouted devaux in an instant he had leapt up and caught the spar heaving himself over it legs kicking out behind him without thinking impelled by the force of the first lieutenants determination drinkwater had followed below them cyclops dropped away and was past the wind tore at drinkwaters coat tails as he cautiously followed devaux aft along the spar the dangling raffle of gear afforded plenty of handholds and it was not long before he stood with his superior on the spanish forecastle a resplendently attired officer was footing a bow at devaux and proferring his sword devaux impatient at the inactivity of the spaniards ignored him he made signs at the officer who had first secured the heaving line and a party of seamen were soon heaving in the fourinch rope the moon emerged again and devaux turned to drinkwater he nodded at the insistently bobbing spaniard for gods sake take it then return it we need their help nathaniel drinkwater thus received the surrender of the thirtyeight gun frigate santa teresa he managed a clumsy bow on the plunging deck and as graciously as he knew how aware of his own gawkiness he handed the weapon back the moonlight shone keenly on the straight toledo blade devaux was shouting again men men hombres hombres the fourinch had arrived on board and the weight of the big hawser was already on it gesticulating wildly and miming with his body devaux urged the defeated spaniards to strenuous activity he pointed to leeward muerto muerto they understood to windward hope was tacking cyclops it was vital that devaux secured the tow in seconds the fourinch snaked in then it snagged the big teninch rope coming out of the water had caught on something under santa teresas bow heave screamed devaux beside himself with excitement cyclops would feel the drag of that rope she might fail to pay off on the starboard tack suddenly it came aboard with a rush the floating hemp rose on a wave and swept aboard as santa teresas bow fell into a steep trough drinkwater was astonished where she had been rolling wildly the seas had been breaking harmlessly alongside he sensed something was wrong that sea had broken over them he looked around the sea was white in the moonlight and breaking as on a beach they were in the breakers of the san lucar shoal above the howl of the wind and the screaming of the spanish officers the thunder of the atlantic flinging itself on to the bank was a deep and terrifying rumble devaux sweated over the end of the teninch rope get a gun fired quick drinkwater pointed to a cannon and mimed a ramming motion bang he shouted the sailors understood and a charge was quickly rammed home drinkwater grabbed the linstock and jerked it it fired he looked anxiously at cyclops several spaniards were staring fearfully to leeward dios said one crossing himself others did the same slowly devaux breathed out cyclops had tacked successfully the hemp rose from the water and took the strain it creaked and drinkwater looked to where devaux had passed a turn round santa teresas fore mast and wracked lashings on it more were being passed by the sailors the santa teresa trembled men looked fearfully at each other was it the effect of the tow or had she struck the bottom cyclopss stern rose then plunged downwards the rope was invisible in the darkness which had again engulfed them but it was secured and santa teresa began to turn into the wind very slowly cyclops hauled her late adversary to the southwest clawing a foot to windward for every yard she made to the south devaux turned to the midshipman and clapped him on the back his face broke into a boyish grin weve done it cully by god weve done it drinkwater slid slowly to the deck the complete oblivion of fatigue enveloping him chapter five the evil that men do february april rodneys fleet lay at anchor in gibraltar bay licking its wounds with a sense of satisfaction the evidence of their victory was all about them the spanish warships wearing british colours over their own the battle had annihilated don juan de langaras squadron four battleships had struck by midnight the admiral in fenix surrendered to rodney but sandwich had pressed on at about am on the th she overhauled the smaller monarcha and compelled her to strike her colours with one terrible broadside by this time as cyclops struggled to secure santa teresa in tow both fleets were in shoaling water two seventygun ships the san julian and san eugenio ran helplessly aground with terrible loss of life the remainder spanish and british managed to claw off to windward in the confusion of securing the prizes one spanish battleship escaped as did the other frigate with the exception of the san domingo and the escapees de langaras squadron had fallen into rodneys hands it was a bitter blow to spanish naval pride pride that had already suffered humiliation when late the previous year the treasure flota from the indies had fallen to marauding british cruisers now the great ships lay at anchor fenix was to become gibraltar and others were to be bought into the british service their presence boosted the morale of general elliotts hard pressed garrison and forced the besiegers to stop and think behind the fleet the convoy had arrived safely and the military dined their naval colleagues midshipmen however at least those of cyclops dined aboard on hard tack pease pudding and salt pork during her stay at gibraltar cyclops became a happy ship she had come through a fleet action with distinction and the experience had united her crew into a true ships company her casualties had been light four dead and twentyone wounded mostly by splinters or falling wreckage every morning as the hands turned up there was not a man among them who did not cast his eyes in the direction of the santa teresa the spanish frigate was their own special badge of honour the men worked enthusiastically repairing the damage to cyclops it was a task that fascinated drinkwater the elements of seamanship he already knew were augmented by the higher technicalities of masting and rigging and when lieutenant devaux turned his attention to the santa teresa his knowledge was further increased the first lieutenant had taken a liking to drinkwater after their sojourn together on the captured frigate revived from his faint devaux had found him an eager and intelligent pupil once his stomach had been filled cyclopss crew spared no effort to efface as much of the damage their own cannon had done to the santa teresa so that the frigate presented as good an appearance as possible to the prize court presided over by adam duncan rodneys viceadmiral this august body was holding preliminary hearings into the condition of the fleets prizes before despatching those suitable back to england once this intelligence had been passed to the hands they worked with a ferocious energy the intensive employment of cyclopss crew meant that the midshipmen were often absent and rarely all on board at the same time for the first time drinkwater felt comparatively free of the influence of morris occupied as they all were there was little opportunity for the senior midshipman to bully his hapless juniors the anticipation of vast sums of prize money induced a euphoria in all minds and even the twisted morris felt something of this corporate elevation then for drinkwater all this contentment ended cyclops had lain in gibraltar bay for eleven days the repairs were completed and work was almost finished aboard the santa teresa her spars were all prepared and it was time to send up her new topmasts devaux had taken almost the entire crews of cyclops over to the spaniard to make light of the hauling and heaving topmen and waisters marines gunners focsle men were all set to man the carefully arranged tackles and set up the rigging captain hope was ashore with lieutenant keene and only a handful of men under the master kept the deck the remainder offduty men slept or idled below a drowsy atmosphere had settled over the frigate exemplified by mr blackmore and the surgeon appleby who lounged on the quarterdeck their energies spent by recent exertions drinkwater had been sent with the launch to pass the convoy orders to a dozen transports in the outer bay these ships were bound for port mahon and cyclops would be escorting them as he returned to cyclops he passed santa teresa the sound of omalleys fiddle floated over the calm water signs of activity were visible the creak of tackles lifting heavy weights clearly audible as two spars rose up the newly erected masts drinkwater waved to midshipman beale as the launch swept round the frigates stern the yellow and red of her superimposed ensign almost brushed the oarsmen as it drooped disconsolately under the british colour drinkwater brought the launch alongside the mainchains of cyclops mr blackmore languidly acknowledged his report drinkwater went below he had half expected to find morris on deck not wishing to encounter him in the cockpit so intense was drinkwaters loathing of morris that he would return to the deck rather than remain in his company below there was something something indefinable about him that nathaniel found distasteful without knowing what it was between decks cyclops was dim and almost silent the creaking of her fabric went unnoticed by drinkwater a few men sat at the mess tables slung between the guns lounging and talking some swung in hammocks and several watched drinkwater with idle curiosity then one a foxfaced man named humphries nudged his neighbour a large topman turned round drinkwater scarcely noticed the malice that appeared in threddles eyes he descended to the orlop and turned aft to where screened off with canvas the frigates young gentlemen lived drinkwater was happily oblivious of the menace in the air the foetid atmosphere of the orlop was dark a darkness punctured by swinging lanterns suspended at intervals from the low deckhead which glowed dimly in the poor air drinkwater approached the canvas flap which answered the midshipmen for a door he was stopped in his tracks at first he was completely uncomprehending then the memory of similar halfglimpsed actions and a pang of instinctive recognition in his own loins brought the realisation slamming home to him he felt sick morris was naked from the waist down the handsome young seaman from the main top was bent over a midshipmans chest there was little doubt what was happening for a few seconds drinkwater was rooted to the spot helplessly watching morriss breathless exertions then drinkwater noticed the initials on the chest nd he turned and ran stumbling along the orlop desperate for the cool freshness of the upper deck he ran fulltilt into threddle who hurled him back drinkwater staggered and before he could recover threddle and humphries were lugging him aft drinkwater struggled in pure terror at reentering his dismal quarters threddle threw him forward and he fell on his back for a minute he closed his eyes then a kick in the kidneys forced them open a fully dressed morris stood looking down at him threddle and humphries were behind the midshipman the handsome seaman had shrunk into a corner he was crying what are we goin to do wiv im mr morris asked humphries his eyes glittering with possibilities morris looked at drinkwater his own eyes veiled he licked his lips considering the physical possibilities himself perhaps he read something in drinkwaters expression perhaps his lusts were temporarily slaked or perhaps he feared the consequences of discovery at last he came to his decision and bent over nathaniel if morris laboured the word if you mention a word of this to anyone we will kill you it will be easy an accident do you understand that or perhaps youd like friend threddle here the seaman shuffled forward eagerly a hand passing to his belt to show you what a buggering is drinkwaters mouth was quite dry he swallowed with difficulty i i understand then get on deck where you belong lickspittle drinkwater fled the normality of the scene on deck shocked him profoundly as he arrived in the waist tregembo came up and gave him an odd look but the midshipman was too terrified to notice mr blackmore wants you sir called tregembo as he rushed past drinkwater went aft his heart thumping doing his best to master his shaking limbs a week later gibraltar was once more closely invested by the besieging spanish rodney had sent the transports on to minorca and the units of the channel fleet back to home waters under rear admiral digby the empty transports had gone with them his task fulfilled the admiral sailed for the west indies with reinforcements for that station it is miles from gibraltar to port mahon the brief respite in the weather was over a lleventades blew in their teeth as cyclops and her consort meteor struggled to keep the transports and storeships in order the convoy beat to windward tack upon weary tack at first they kept well south avoiding the unfavourable current along the spanish coast and the flyspeck island of alboran but having made sufficient easting they held to a more northerly course until they raised the high snowcapped peaks of the sierra nevadas and could weather cape da gata with more sea room the convoy spread out and the escorts had even more trouble shepherding their charges the weather worsened cyclops was a misery damp permeated every corner of the ship fungi grew in wet places the companionways were battened down and the closed gunports leaked water so that the bilges required constant pumping the lack of ventilation between decks filled the living spaces with a foul miasma that made men gasp as they came below watch relieved watch four hours on four off the galley fire went out and only the daily grog ration kept the men going that and fear of the lash even so tempers flared fights occurred and mens names were listed in the punishment book things did not improve when meteor signalled that she would keep the convoy company in port mahon while cyclops cruised offshore and waited for the ships to discharge meteors captain though half the age of hope was the senior he was known to have a weakness for good wine darkhaired women and the tables it was meteor therefore that secured to a buoy in the lazaretto reach and cyclops that stood on and off the coast hardreefed and halfhearted in her lookout for spanish cruisers the fourth day after they had seen the convoy safe into mahon humphries went overboard no one saw it happen he just failed to answer the muster and a search of the ship revealed nothing when he heard the news drinkwater was suddenly afraid morris shot him a malignant glance on the seventh day the weather began to moderate but the ocean with typical perversity sent one misery to succeed the last towards evening the wind fell away altogether and left cyclops rolling viciously in a cross sea a swell rolling up from the south east so chaos remained to plague the frigate and filled midshipman drinkwaters cup of misery to overflowing somehow the happiness he had felt in gibraltar seemed unreal a false emotion with no substance he felt his own ingenuous naivety had betrayed him the ugliness of morris and his perverted circle of lower deck cronies seemed to infect the ship like the dampness and the rank stink indeed it so associated itself in his mind with the smell of malodorous bodies in cramped unventilated spaces that he could never afterwards sense the taint in his nostrils without the image of morris swimming into his mind it had a name this thing morris had used it with pride the very recollection made drinkwater sweat he began to see signs of it everywhere though in truth there were about a dozen men in cyclopss crew of over two hundred and sixty who were homosexual but to drinkwater himself in the fever of adolescence they posed a threat that was lent substance by the continuing tyranny of morris and the knowledge that morris possessed henchmen in the form of the physically heavyweight threddle and his cronies drinkwater began to live in a cocoon of fear he wrestled unresolvedly with the possession of knowledge he longed to share free of the disturbances of bad weather at last cyclops cruised a week in pleasant circumstances light to fresh breezes and warmer winds took march into april the frigate smelt sweeter between decks as fresh air blew through the living spaces vinegar wash was applied liberally and devaux had the waisters and landsmen painting and varnishing until the waterways gleamed crimson the quarterdeck panelling glistened and the brasswork sparkled in the spring sunshine on the last sunday in march instead of the anglican service captain hope had read the articles of war drinkwater stood with the other midshipmen as hope intoned the grim catechism of admiralty he felt himself flush ashamed at his own weakness as hope read the th article if any person in the fleet shall commit the unnatural and detestable crime of buggery or sodomy with man or beast he shall be punished with death he bit his lip and with an effort mastered the visceral fear he felt but he still avoided the eyes of those he knew were staring at him after the solemnly oppressive reminder of the captains power the hands had been made to witness punishment in the recent bad weather two men had been persistent offenders hope was not a vicious commander and devaux with a simple aristocratic faith in being obeyed never pressed for strict action infinitely preferring the indolence of inaction he was content that the bosuns mates kept cyclopss people at their duty but these two men had developed a vendetta and neither captain nor first lieutenant could afford to stand for that a drum rolled and the marines stamped to attention as a grating was triced up in the main rigging a man was called out before passing sentence hope had endeavoured to discover the source of the trouble but to no avail the lower deck kept its own counsel and guarded its own secrets the man came forward to where two bosuns mates grabbed him and lashed his wrists to the grating a piece of leather was jammed into his mouth to prevent him from biting through his own tongue it was tregembo the drum rolled and a third bosuns mate wielded the supple cat onine tails and laid on the first dozen he was relieved for the second and his relief for the third after a bucket of water had been thrown over the wretched prisoners body he was cut down with difficulty tregembo staggered back to his place among the sullen hands the second man was led out threddles powerful back testified to previous punishment but he bore his three dozen as bravely as tregembo when he too was cut down he stood unsupported his eyes glittering with tears and fierce hatred he looked directly at drinkwater the midshipman had become inured to the brutality of these public floggings in some curious way the spectacle affected him far less than the sonorous intonation of that th article of war like many of the officers and men he managed to think of something else to concentrate on the way the row of fire buckets each with its elaborately painted royal cipher swung to the motion of the ship he found the device reassuring helping him to master himself after the disquiet of that uncompromising sentence it was thus disarmed that threddle caught his eye drinkwater felt the occult force of loathing hit him with near physical impact the midshipman was certain that he was in some strange way connected with the animosity that existed between these two men that had broken out in persistent and disruptive fighting it was only with difficulty that drinkwater prevented himself from fainting one seaman did it was the handsome young topman who had been morriss pathic later in the day drinkwater passed close to tregembo as the man worked painfully at a splice i am sorry you were flogged tregembo he said quietly the man looked up beads of sweat stood out on his brow evidence of the agony of working with a back lashed to a bloody ruin you don have to worry zur he replied then he added as an afterthought it shouldnt have to come to that drinkwater passed on musing on the mans last incomprehensible remark later that night the wind freshened at am drinkwater was called to go on watch stumbling forward to the companionway he was aware that once more cyclops was pitching and tossing theyll shorten sail soon he muttered to himself struggling into his tarpaulin as he emerged on deck the night was black and chilly a patter of spray came aboard stinging his face he relieved beale who gave him a friendly grin at a quarter after four the order came to double reef the topsails drinkwater went aloft he thought little of it now nimbly working his way out to the place of honour at the yardarm after ten minutes the huge sail was reduced and the men were making their way to the backstays disappearing into the darkness as they returned to the deck as he came in from the yardarm and transferred his weight to a backstay a hand gripped his wrist what the hell he nearly fell then a face appeared out of the windtorn blackness it was the goodlooking topman from the main top and there was a wild appeal in his eyes sir for christs sake help me drinkwater swaying a hundred feet above cyclopss heaving deck yet felt revulsion at the mans touch but even in the gloom he saw the tears in the others eyes he tried to withdraw his hand but his precarious situation prevented it im not one of them sir honest they make me do it they force me into it sir if i dont they kick me sir drinkwater felt the nausea subside kick you what dye mean he could hardly hear the man now as the wind whipped the shouted confidences away to leeward the bollocks sir he sobbed for christs sake help me the grip relaxed drinkwater tore himself away and descended to the deck for the remainder of the watch as dawn lit the east and daylight spread over the sea he pondered the problem he could see no solution if he told an officer about morris would he be believed and it was a serious allegation had he not heard captain hope read the th article of war for the crime of sodomy the punishment was death it was a serious a terrible allegation to make against a man and drinkwater quailed from the possibility of being instrumental in having a man hanged and morris was evil of that he was certain evil beyond his own perversion for morris was allied to the huge physical bulk of ableseaman threddle and what would threddle not stop at drinkwater remained in an agony of fear for himself and helplessness at his inability to aid the topman he felt he was failing his first test as an officer who could he turn to then he remembered tregembos remark what was it he had said he dredged the sentence out of the recesses of his memory it shouldnt have to come to that to what what had tregembo said before his final remark you dont have to worry that was it meaning that he drinkwater did not have to worry but another doubt seized him he had only expressed regret that the seaman had been flogged for fighting then he realised the truth tregembo had been flogged for fighting threddle and had said the midshipman did not have to worry tregembo must therefore know something of what had gone on it should not have to come to drinkwater himself worrying would the lower deck carry out its own rough justice had it already passed sentence on and executed humphries then drinkwater realised that he had known all along threddles eyes had blamed his flogging on nathaniel and subconsciously drinkwater had acknowledged his responsibility for tregembos pain he resolved that he would consult tregembo it was the second dog watch before he got tregembo to one side on the pretext of overhauling the log for mr blackmore tregembo he began cautiously why did you fight threddle tregembo was silent for a while then he sighed and said now why would youm be axing that zur drinkwater took a deep breath because if it was over what i believe it to have been then it touches the midshipmen as well as the lower deck he watched tregembos puzzled frown smooth out in comprehension i know zur he said quietly and looking directly at drinkwater added i saw what theym did to you in gib zur it was tregembos turn to be embarrassed i kind of took to ee zur he flushed then resumed with a candid simplicity thats why i did fur umphries drinkwater was shocked you murdered humphries e slipped and i elped im a bit tregembo shrugged offn the jibboom zur e ent the fust he said to alleviate drinkwaters obvious horror the midshipman absorbed the knowledge slowly the burden he had borne was doubled not halved as he had hoped the respect for the law engendered by his upbringing was suffering a further assault tregembos lawless smuggling devilmaycare attitude was a phenomenon new to him his face betrayed his concern doan ye worry yerself mr drinkwater were used to buggers and their ways most ships ave em but we doan like it when they doan keep it to emselves he indicated the handsome seaman coiling a rope amidships he looked up at them there was appeal and desperation in his eyes as though he knew the substance of a conversation taking place sixty feet away yon sharples is a good topmn but es scared of em see i doan wonder if yed seen what they done to im tregembo reached into a pocket and slipped a quid of tobacco into his mouth e wont ave owerlong to wait he concluded ruminatively drinkwater stared sharply at tregembo the lower deckll look after its own zur but mr morris as a cockpit problem cockpits usually ave their own justice zur tregembo paused sensing drinkwaters sense of physical inadequacy youd easy outnumber im zur wouldnt e the log line was neatly coiled in its basket and tregembo rose he walked forward knuckling his forehead to the first lieutenant as he passed drinkwater remained aft at the taffrail staring astern unseeing he felt no shame at the suggestion that he was alone unable to thrash morris yet it saddened him to think that morris could terrorise not just him and his fellow midshipmen but the less fortunate sharples there was so much in the world that he did not comprehend that was at variance with what the picture books and learning had given to his minds eye perhaps but no it was not possible he turned to walk forward the whole of cyclops lay before him devaux and blackmore were at the foot of the mizen mast the boom and spanker overhead she was a thing of great beauty this ship this product of mans ingenuity and resolve to conquer for mankind went onwards following an undirected destiny at no matter what cost to himself and in the echo of that resolve exemplified by the frigate he cast about for the will to do what he thought was right chapter six prize money may his britannic majestys frigates meteor and cyclops saw their charges into spithead in the last week of may news had just come in from the west indies that admiral rodney had fought a fleet action with de guichen off martinique on th april but the battle had not been decisive and there were disturbing rumours that rodney was courtmartialling his captains for disobedience the news though vital to the progress of the war was of secondary importance to the ships company of cyclops all the weary voyage from the mediterranean the ship had buzzed as every mess speculated on the likely value of the prize there was not a man in the entire crew who did not imagine himself in some state of luxury or gross debauch as a result of the purchase of santa teresa into the royal navy for henry hope it meant security in old age for devaux the means of reentering society and hopefully contracting an advantageous marriage to men like morris tregembo and omalley fantasies of splendid proportions rose in their imaginations as they prepared to make obeisance at the temples of bacchus and aphrodite but as the two frigates and their empty convoy sailed northward the initial excitement passed arguments broke out as to how much hard money was involved and more important how much each man would receive rumour speculation and conjecture rippled through the ship like wind through standing corn a chance remark made by an officer overheard by a quartermaster and passed along the lower deck sparked off fresh waves of debate based on no single thread of fact but by mountains of wishful thinking only the previous year frigates like cyclops had taken the annual treasure fleet from the spanish indies it had made their captains fabulously wealthy even ableseamen had received the sum of but it was not always visions of untold wealth that occupied the imaginations of her people as the frigate drew north other rumours gained currency perhaps santa teresa had been retaken by the spaniards who were once again besieging gibraltar or sunk by shellfire or burned by fireships if the spanish could not take her would they not have made an attempt to redress their honour by destroying at least some of the prizes in gibraltar bay gloom spread throughout cyclops and as the days passed the talk of prize money occurred less and less frequently by the time cyclops sighted the lizard all discussions on the subject had become taboo a strange superstition had seized the hands including the officers a feeling that if the subject were mentioned their greed would raise the ire of the fate that ruled their lives with such arbitrary harshness no seaman irrespective of his class or station could admit the philosophical contention that atropos lachesis or clotho and their elemental agents acted with impartiality his own experience continually proved the contrary gales battles leaks dismastings disease and death acts of god acts of my lords commissioners of the admiralty and all the other factors which combined to cause maritime discomfort seemed to direct the whole weight of their malice at jack tar hardship was a necessary function of existence and the brief appearance of a golden ladder to a haven of wealth and ease became regarded with the deepest suspicion when cyclopss cable rumbled through the hawse and she brought up to her bower at spithead no man dared mention santa teresa but when the first lieutenant called away the captains gig there was not a soul on board whose heartbeat did not quicken hope was absent from the ship for three hours even when he returned to the boat lying at kings stairs the gigs crew were unable to read anything from his facial expression drinkwater was coxswain of the gig and set himself the task of conning her through the maze of small craft that thronged portsmouth harbour in fact drinkwater had thought less than most about the prize money money was something he had no experience of there had been enough barely enough in his home and his interest in his new profession had both prevented him from dwelling on the subject of poverty or from realising how little he had as yet the disturbance of lust had been a confused experience in which the romantic concepts imparted by a rudimentary education were at sharp variance with the world he found around him he had not yet realised the power of money to purchase pleasure and his adolescent view of the opposite sex was one of total ambivalence besides whilst there were no other distractions he found the business of a seaofficer vastly more interesting and he had changed significantly since his first boat trip on the waters of spithead although he had added little to his girth and height his body had hardened his muscles were lean and strong his formerly delicate hands sinewy with hard labour his features remained fine drawn but there was now a touch of firmness of authority about the mouth that had banished the feminine cast to his face a dark shadow was forcing him to shave occasionally and his former pallor was replaced by a weathered complexion there remained however the bright eagerness that had attracted devauxs notice so that he used drinkwater when he wanted a difficult task undertaken by one of the young gentlemen the first lieutenant had placed drinkwater in a post of honour as coxswain of the captains gig if he could afford no fancy ribbons about his boats crew at least hope could have a keen young middy to swagger dirk at his side in the stern sheets blackmore too considered the youth the aptest of his pupils and had it not been for the spectre of nemesis in the form of morris the approbation of his seniors would have brought the keenest pleasure to nathaniel the gig danced over the water next to drinkwater hope sat in stony silence digesting the facts that the admirals secretary had told him santa teresa had been purchased as a prize the court had been assembled under the authority of rearadmiral kempenfelt whose purpose it was to examine the findings of duncans preliminary hearing at gibraltar kempenfelt and his prize court had decided that she was a very fine frigate indeed and had purchased her into the service for the sum of captain hopes share would amount to shillings after years of grinding service with little glory and no material rewards beyond a meagre and delayed salary fate had smiled upon him he could hardly believe his luck and regarded it with a seamans cynicism which accounted for his stony visage drinkwater brought the gig alongside hope reached the deck and the pipes twittered in salute every man upon the upper deck ceased work to look at the captain for some sign of news of the santa teresa all they perceived was a stony face so they concluded their worst fears were realised hope walked directly aft and disappeared the eyes of the ships company followed the captains retreating back one hundred and seventysix men just then occupied upon the upper deck of cyclops were united in a moment of immobile silent bitter disappointment some halfhour later drinkwater was dispatched again in the gig instead of the captain the midshipman had orders to convey mr copping the purser ashore mr copping imparted the intelligence that he was entrusted to buy some special provisions for the captains table that evening and that the captain was holding a dinner for his officers he also handed drinkwater a letter written in the old captains crabbed hand the superscription was to his excellency richard kempenfelt rearadmiral drinkwater was to deliver it while the purser attended to his purchases hope had invited all his officers the master gunner and the midshipmen appleby the surgeon was also present they gathered noisily aft at three bells in the second dog watch with only the first lieutenant and wheeler absent forming an honour guard to greet the admiral when hope had impulsively dashed off his invitation to kempenfelt he was in boyish high spirits he had suppressed his mirth as he snapped orders at copping so that that individual had left his commander with the positive belief that the worst fears of the ships company were realised and had lost no time in sending word forward that further optimism was futile hope saw the admiral as the true author of his good fortune and in some way wished to acknowledge his gratitude for kempenfelt was a popular sea officer whose brilliance shone in an age when brains were not the qualification for flag rank his innovations were admired throughout the fleet where thinking men discussed the handling of fleets under sail more than jobbery or place seeking kempenfelt was perhaps more than that to hope to the captain whose post rank he owed to the political faction he despised the rearadmiral was a respected figure and in an age when lip service of the greatest extravagance disguised base motives hope wished to demonstrate honest simple admiration but as his officers collected on the deck above the captain had his private doubts midshipman drinkwater had brought back the admirals acceptance and he was beset by second thoughts the prank he was playing on his own ships company was childish but captains could indulge themselves to some extent with their own people admirals were rather different he was not sure now what kempenfelt would think above his head the buzz of speculative conversation came down the skylight the officers might have got wind of the prize courts decision it was unlikely that they had not heard by now and were doubtless writing him off as an old fool hope flushed but recollected himself when he heard the note of resignation in the babble above he listened more attentively he heard the second lieutenant mr price his lilting welsh voice vaguely angry say i told you so eh blackmore hope could imagine the old sailing master called in as an ally in disappointment a man so like himself that the captain could imagine the years of experience formulating a reply to price thats right mr price youll never see jolly jack make a brass farthing out of his business the remark was made dully authoritatively an oftuttered and oftheard contention hope suddenly grinned to hell with admirals he had a surprise for blackmore a good surprise too and of all his ships company he would be most pleased to see the whitehaired master receive his share a knock came at the door enter devaux stepped inside all ready sir and the admirals barge is in sight the first lieutenant hesitated wanting to say more sir hope enjoyed devauxs discomfort so often the easymannered savoir faire of the man had irritated him assuredly this was henry hopes day yes mr devaux the prize sir hope looked up sharply perhaps his little drama made him overreact but it had its effect on devaux the first lieutenant jumped for the captains threshold like a chastened midshipman the prize mr devaux the prize hope managed a tone of outraged propriety dont talk to me of prizes when theres an admiral to meet rearadmiral richard kempenfelt greeted captain hope with a smile he doffed his tricorne to wheeler and his guard and nodded to devaux his eye rove over cyclops and her company as hope conducted him aft to where the now silent group of officers waited those who noticed such details watched their captain earnestly addressing the admiral they might also have noticed the admirals smile broaden and crack open in a brief laugh at the laugh hope relaxed it was going to be his day after all hope introduced his officers the warrant officers and midshipmen then kempenfelt asked to be conducted round the ship i merely want to see something of cyclops and the brave fellows who took that spaniard someone in the waist raised a formal cheer for the admiral to devauxs ears its very halfheartedness was shameful he did not notice kempenfelts eyes twinkle with amusement after his brief tour of the frigate the admiral turned to hope youve a damned taut ship captain hope we shall find work for you to do in the mean time he lowered his voice hope nodded and turned to devaux call all hands aft mr devaux there was a vast shuffling and scurrying to a twitter of pipes and a bellowing of orders redcoated marines stamped aft and gradually a sort of order fell on the ship kempenfelt stepped forward and addressed them dyou hear now my lads captain hope has asked that i give ye all the news of your prize the frigate santa teresa he paused to watch the shuffle throughout the assembly expectancy kindled in their faces by the presence of the admiral now became a restless eagerness the ragged line wavered youll be pleased to know shes been purchased for he tailed off as a buzz that swiftly became a hum broke out silence there yelled devaux shes been purchased for guineas sterling and youll all receive your due according to usage and custom the admiral stepped back devaux looked at hope he was smiling cherubically then sensing the moment was right he called out three cheers for the admiral it was no longer halfhearted they heard the noise on cerberus a mile away as the cheering died down hope announced to devaux mr devaux you may allow wives and sweethearts tomorrow apparently the admirals office announced us a few days ago captain hope was having his day as he ushered the admiral and his flag lieutenant into the cabin there were more cheers for the captain himself the dinner in captain hopes cabin that evening was as naval dinners went unremarkable but the setting sun laid a path of glittering gold from the horizon to the very stern windows of cyclops and invested the scene with some of its magic the excited babble of talk amongst the juniors present and the natural elation due to the unaccustomed wine and natural headiness of the occasion nevertheless lent to the proceedings a degree of memorability copping had provided a banquet within the limits of his materials if kempenfelt was unimpressed by the cookery he did not show it and to the shortrationed midshipmen any meal of more than one course automatically assumed the dignity of haute cuisine fortunately the santa teresas loot had yielded a sufficiency of both oporto and jerez wines which made up for the indifference of hopes claret some havana cigars were also salved which after the duff and capons had been consumed filled the air with the aromatic luxury of their blue smoke a bare hour after they had sat down drinkwaters body was enjoying the pleasant sensations of a mild drugging his stomach was distended to unusual proportions and his head just beginning to assume that lucid detachment from his limbs that is the pleasantest but also the briefest stage of drunkenness as for his forgotten legs they reclined as he had negligently left them before the increase in his cerebral concentration had drawn all the energy from them he heard without fully comprehending the senior officers discussing kempenfelts new code of signals the admirals explanation of rodneys action off martinique passed through his aural organs and left his brain to seize on and amplify certain graphic phrases that his overwrought imagination dwelt on hope price keene devaux and blackmore listened to the rearadmiral with professional deference but to drinkwater the splendid ligure of kempenfelt poured forth the very stuff of dreams after the loyal toast kempenfelt proposed one to the cyclopss gallantry in the night action off cadiz in turn hope toasted an admiral without whose ratification their fortunes would have remained uncertain the admiral prodded his flag lieutenant and that worthy rose unsteadily and read a prepared statement toasting lieutenant john devaux and midshipman nathaniel drinkwater for their bold action in boarding the prize and earning a special place in hopes report devaux rose and bowed to the flag lieutenant and the admiral recalling that the midshipman had the post of honour in receiving the spaniards surrender he called upon the young gentleman to reply drinkwater was barely aware of what was required of him but he was suddenly aware of morris staring at him from the far side of the table with an evil grin upon his face the face seemed to grow larger terrifying in its size oppressive with malice conversation died as all turned to stare at him he was confused he remembered a succession of his seniors standing in turn and he rose unsteadily to his feet for a moment or two he stood there swaying slightly the bored expression of the flag lieutenant changed to one of sudden interest at the prospect of a neat gaffe with which to entertain his fashionable friends drinkwater stared out through the stern windows to where the last shreds of daylight flared above the horizon morriss face faded and that of his mother swam before him he remembered her preparing his seakit sewing a table cloth for her son to use at sea it lay hidden and unused at the bottom of his chest it bore a motto that motto sprang into his midshipmans mind now and he uttered it in a loud commanding voice confusion to the kings enemies he said it all in one breath and without a slur he sat down abruptly as a roar of assent went round the table the flag lieutenant resumed his bored expression he vaguely heard kempenfelts approbatory comment damme captain a real fire eater chapter seven the duel june july on awakening next morning drinkwater had only the haziest notions of turning in the previous night he was not sure at what hour the admiral had left for after his toast the evening had become a blur the blue and white uniforms the gold braid and pink faces seemed shrouded in more than tobacco smoke wheelers scarlet coat and glittering gorget had glowed like a surrogate sun in the candlelight as they joked and laughed and became serious again the conversation had turned on a variety of topics had been general then particular bawdy then technical as the portions of the table concentrated divided then joined again in a verbal tide the event had been a triumph for henry hope as a crowning to the evening blackmore had suggested a little music and word was passed for omalley the diminutive irish cook entered stealing sidelong glances at the ruins of the meal and the empty bottles he produced some sweet and melancholic airs after the fashion of the time which brought an appreciative silence to the table he concluded to loud applause with a frantic jig from his native land which drawn from the wild turbulence of his people seemed to drinkwater to summarise the exhilaration of that moonlight battle in which these genial fellows had taken such a part little omalley had gone forward two guineas better off with a farewell whose obsequiousness was not that of sobriety but suggested that in the course of roasting the very capons whose ruins he had so enviously regarded he had partaken of pussers dips despite the vague recollections of a successful evening drinkwater woke to the disturbing sensation that all was not well he had a headache due to the quite unaccustomed quantity of wine he had consumed but it was more than that he groped in his mind for some memory that would give him a clue to his disquiet at first he thought he had committed some impropriety his stomach contracted at the thought of an indiscretion in front of the admiral but the approach of a figure traversing the darkened orlop brought the memory back it was morris coming to call him at one bell to stand the morning anchor watch morriss face was lit demoniacally by the lantern the rest of his body was invisible in the blackness of the cockpit this apparition finding drinkwater awake was a very mask of malice which spat out a torrent of invective in a sibilant whisper nathaniel was transfixed with horror a feeling made worse by his prone position jealousy and hate burned within morris contesting with the fear of drinkwaters knowledge of himself the resulting conflict of powerful emotion burned within him in a terrible bullying anger come on admirals lickspittle get out of your hammock and convey your greasy arse on deck damn you for a crawling get drinkwater made no reply vulnerably shrinking within his blanket for a second morriss face hung over him the malevolence in his eyes an almost physical force in a sudden swift movement morris had a knife out the lantern catching the dull glint of its blade it was a micro second of suspense wherein drinkwater suddenly inexplicably found himself drained of all fear he simply tensed and awaited the inevitable morris slashed with the knife the hammock lashing parted and with a jarring crash drinkwater landed on the deck fighting out of his blanket he found himself alone in the creaking darkness on deck a squall of rain skittered across spithead and the wind behind it was cutting drinkwater shivered and drew his cloak closer around him dawn was not yet visible and morriss figure was barely discernible huddled in the paltry shelter of the mizen rigging the figure detached itself and approached drinkwater morriss face dark now came close the older midshipman gripped the arm of the younger spittle flecked offensively on to drinkwaters cheek now listen hissed morris just because you are a crawling little bastard dont get any goddamned ideas about anything threddle hasnt forgotten his flogging and neither of us have forgotten humphries so dont forget what im saying i mean it morriss vehemence was irresistible drinkwater shrunk from the voice from the spittle and the vicious grip upon his arm morriss knee came up into his groin he gasped with pain dye understand goddamn you queried morris an undetected doubt in his voice y yes whispered drinkwater doubling with agony and nausea his head swimming another figure loomed out of the rainswept darkness for a terrifying moment drinkwater thought it was threddle but the voice of tregembo asked everything air right mr drinkwater he felt morris freeze then relax as he straightened up tears flowed down his cheeks but he managed to steady his nerve enough to mutter yes thank you in a clipped tone morris handed over the watch the lieutenants are excused watches tonight call all hands at three bells a quartermaster approached the halfhour glass in his hand the lower half was almost full eight bells mr morris make it so then aye aye sir four oclock in the morning when morris had gone below drinkwater went to the weather side the rain stung and wet his face he felt it with relief the pain in his groin eased and his head felt less thick then a wave of nausea swept over him the pain the wine and the selfdisgust caused him to vomit into the inky hissing waters of spithead after that he felt better he still stared to windward his hands gripping the rail his selfdisgust rankled why had he not hit morris back just once he had to face the fact that he was scared forgetful of the bold resolutions he had formulated and continually put off pending a more propitious opportunity he had one now morris had assaulted him hitherto he had lain low in the hope that by effacing himself morris would leave him alone but morris could not do that the thing that he knew about morris he devoutly wished he did not know it was so disgusting that the very image of it so vivid in his impressionable mind was abominable to him drinkwater was terrified of what he had seen almost more than of those who had been doing it in that terror was submerged the realisation of the power he had over morris in morriss aggression all drinkwater saw was brutality he failed to perceive the brutality masked fear he saw nothing of the source only the sources manifestation he was suddenly aware of someone alongside of him hhm a voice coughed apologetically drinkwater nervously began to move away beg pardon zur yes i saw what appened zur i saw im it ee if youm be wantin a witness zur no tregembo thank you drinkwater paused he remembered that conversation with tregembo in the mediterranean a brief memory of humphries flashed in his brain of sharples and threddle and of the flogging tregembo had received drinkwater looked hard at tregembo the seaman expected drinkwater to thrash morris tregembo would otherwise see drinkwater as a coward drinkwater suddenly recalled the moment when fear had left him not an hour earlier a bold feeling swept over him he could no longer suffer morriss tyranny and determined to challenge his senior it was a desperate throw but in such circumstances resolves are easily made though less easily carried out he forced a grim note into his voice no tregembo this is a cockpit matter as you said ill thank you to hold your tongue the man backed away disappointed he had mistimed his assistance to the young gentleman having conceived a respect for the midshipman tregembo had assumed that he sought a legitimate means to encompass the destruction of morris tregembo remembered the twentyninth article of war if ever one man held the other in the palm of his hand drinkwater held sway over morris tregembo was puzzled he had taken to the youth and could not understand why some attack had not been made on morris as he had seen many of the youngsters carry out from time to time on various ships tregembo was too blunt to be aware of drinkwaters sensibilities just as drinkwater was unaware that morriss bullying concealed a pusillanimous soul a fact that was very plain to tregembo in the first glimmer of dawn drinkwater saw the topmans crestfallen retreat tregembo zur the man hesitated quietly have a word with one of the carpenters mates to get two ash single sticks made up each thirty inches long dyou understand aye zur and thankee drinkwater had not the slightest idea why tregembo had thanked him but suddenly the rain fell sweet upon his upturned face the news of cyclopss prize and the promise of allowing visitors on board made her the happiest vessel in the anchorage before the morning watch was over the hands uncommonly cheerful had swabbed her decks and flaked and coiled all the ropes when devaux appeared the brasswork already gleamed in a watery sunshine that promised a fair day after the dawns wet beginning the men were already staring across the leaden water to fort gilkicker and portsmouth harbour for days past hired punts and galleys had brought out women and children many were full of whores but there had been some with wives of both the churched and common law variety they had made a forlorn sight lying just clear of the ships sides exchanging unhappy waves or little snatches of conversation with the sailors until the bosuns mates or the officers had driven the men back to their work the boats too were driven off either by the abuse of the ships officers and marine sentries or by the efforts of the guardboats provided by the units of fleet themselves this was an especial joy to the seamen who manned them for if you are denied the pursuit of pleasure yourself there is a certain gratification in denying it to others although cyclops had commissioned at chatham some of her company volunteers mainly had wives in the portsmouth area occasionally a young wife would travel at god knows what cost and on the chance that leave would be given to meet her man but it was the other variety of female that most interested cyclopss hands that pale morning today no guardboat could interrupt them as they took their pleasure a fact that was doubly appreciated by the messes as they broke their fast to the news that meteor was rowing guard it was a sweet revenge for their consorts debauch at port mahon in the gunroom lieutenant devaux presided over fresh coffee and toast in evident good humour well appleby he said addressing the chubby surgeon why are you looking so damned glum the reason for my glumness is occasioned by my contemplation of the follies of mankind mr devaux ah yes a cup of coffee would be most welcome i thank you for your courtesy he sat in the chair indicated by the first lieutenant devaux poured the women mr appleby enquired devaux with a smile the women mr devaux replied the surgeon resignedly and of course the men devaux laughed outright poor appleby we win or lose in action but you can never win poor devil but youve plenty of mercury i dont doubt to cope with the inevitable problems interjected lieutenant price with a sense of nicety in which his sensibility fought a losing action with his curiosity appleby drew a deep breath and devaux knew he was about to deliver a lengthy peroration for which he was notorious mr price the provision of mercury by my lords commissioners for the execution of the office of lord high admiral i say the provision of mercury to ships of war is insufficient to combat the outbreak of a chronic dose of syphilis in all but the smallest vessels since their lordships have failed to take cognisance of the fact that vessels of the various rates have an increasing number in their complement in inverse proportion to the number of their rating now by syphilis i mean that corrupting infection of the blood known colloquially as pox which euphemism scarcely moderates its effect upon the human body but only serves to render its acquisition a little easier to the witless sailor who foolishly considers it no worse than the common cold having been misapprehended by the employment of the common vernacular unfortunately he continues in this mind until with unsteady tread and wandering mind disfigured beyond his fellows toleration he is led raving to an asylum to the inevitable shame of his family and the everlasting damnation of his immortal soul devaux had heard it before furthermore appleby continued as devaux groaned furthermore the administration of mercury in my opinion only serves to suppress the symptoms rendering the individuals life more agreeable but enabling him to pass the contagion on to other partners undetected in time however the bacilli attack essential organs and precipitate death by a stroke or other cessations of essential bodily functions dont you consider the expression of lust an essential bodily function asked devaux winking at price the latter was exhibiting a distinct pallor the honourable john devaux asks me a question to which a man of his erudition surely knows the answer the expression of lust is a natural manifestation of procreational urges which holy ordinances proclaim sanctified under the matrimonial coverlet nature did not intend its indiscriminate proliferation but it is bones interrupted price again rallying now the discussion was of a less medical nature aye mr price and so is the proliferation of the disease so lately under discussion surely a punishment from god pah exploded devaux at last exasperated by the doctor not pah sirrah droned on appleby undeterred consider the evidence the appearance of christ on this earth was followed by an expansion of the church under the divine felicity and a thousand years in which the christian religion gained ground against paganism only when the church of rome reached a state of corruption offensive to god did the devil descend to tempt mens hearts with temporal arts and produce what educated people are pleased to call the renaissance off men went in search of knowledge and what did columbus bring back from his fabulous americas syphilis bravo medico laughed devaux sardonically such a simple deduction scarcely becomes a man of science whose profession descends from such selfsame intellectual quest who would be an indigent fellow without it and whose mind has such a high regard for its own opinions i cannot escape my time replied the good surgeon whose tragic tones were not ennobled by his pudgy frame you sound like a goddamned wesleyan appleby maybe i have some sympathy with the man hah then im damned if yell get any more coffee at my table yes drinkwater this last was addressed to the midshipman who had appeared at the gunroom door beg pardon sir but boats approaching the gleam in devauxs eye was an eloquent endorsement of the accuracy of applebys forebodings thank you drinkwater the midshipman turned away oh drinkwater sir sit down cully and listen to some good advice said the first lieutenant indicating a vacant chair drinkwater sat and looked at the two lieutenants with a bewildered expression on his face mr appleby has something to say to you havent you appleby appleby nodded marshalled his facts and began cannonading the midshipman now young man the first lieutenant is alluding to a contagion which is best and successfully avoided by total abstinence for a second devaux watched the look of horror cross drinkwaters face then clapping the tricorne on his head and waving price out behind him the two lieutenants quit the gunroom total abstinence to which end i do earnestly implore you to bend and address your best endeavours the arrival of the women brought all hands on deck men craned over the hammock nettings leaned from gunports and ascended the lower rigging to leer at the wherries bobbing alongside the hands gave no thought to the fact that what was to follow was no substitute for proper shore leave something they could not have for fear they might desert the immediate preoccupation was a debauch women and gin were aboard whilst wheeler and his marines made a token effort to maintain order the usage of the service permitted all classes of women to board and all offences of drunkenness and fornication to be ignored it was inevitable therefore that the greater part of the women were whores and that the messdeck deteriorated instantly into an inferno of desperate debauchery the women were of various ages tired painted and blowsy doxies in worn and soiled dresses whose vernacular was as explicit as jolly jacks and younger molls their youth blown on the winds of experience their eyes dull with the desperate business of survival some few were bona fide wives the older among them used to their sisters in trade the two or three younger astonished and shocked at the dim squalor of the gundeck where perhaps a poor countinghouse clerk had been pressed into the service his wife possessing some slender claim to gentility found her husband living in the vilest conditions such women instantly became a butt for the others to vent their coarse wit upon which was a double tragedy since their husbands had probably just managed to live down their genteel origins legitimate wives were quickly recognised by their demeanour at the entry port for they waved chits and passes at the marine sentries these genuine spouses looked earnestly for their husbands and avoided the leering and grasping propositions of others for several such wives their journey ended in battle royal not expecting their spouses men were engaged in coupling with whores one enormous creature the churched wife of a yeoman of sheets found her man thus occupied between two twelve pounders she belaboured his heaving buttocks with the tattered remnants of a parasol a stream of filthy invective poured from her and she was quickly surrounded by a mass of cheering seamen and harlots who egged the trio on the wife ceased her beating and took a long pull at a gin bottle someone held out to her in the interval her husband finished his business and to a cheer the girl wriggled out from beneath him hastily covering herself she held out her hand for money but changed her mind when she saw the expression in the wifes eyes she dodged under the barrel of the adjacent cannon as the offended lady screeched at her try and take the money thats mine ye painted trollop why ye dont know yre business well enough to axe fur it fust at this remark the yeoman caught his wifes arm and slapped her across the mouth with and how in hells name ud youm be knowin that my polly the crowd melted away for this was now a domestic matter and not the common property of the gundeck all day the ebb and flow of liaisons took place what little money the men had soon found its way into the pockets of the women mr copping the purser in the manner of his race set up a desk at which the eager men could sign a docket relinquishing a portion of their pay or prize money for an advance of cash many thus exceeded the dictates of prudence the favours of a woman being a most urgent requirement thus were pursers a hated breed though rarely a poor one meteor rowed a dismal guard around cyclops occasionally a bottle or a womans drawers would be thrown out of an open gunport to an accompaniment of cheers and shrieks the cutters crew visibly smouldered and at one point she ran in and hailed the quarterdeck the masters mate in charge of the boat was livid sir he yelled at lieutenant keene yer men show no respect there are three of them baring their arses at me from yer gunports appleby joined the chuckling lieutenant who disdained to reply sure you did not bare yours at mahon mister enquired the surgeon there was no reply that found its mark eh lieutenant said appleby as the man looked sulkily away if the ship offends ye sirrah row guard round the rest of the fleet yell get little pickings from this lot the masters mate spat overside and snarled at his boats crew give way you damned lubbers during the forenoon the wife of the man sharples made her appearance at the entry port she was very young and though few knew it had made the journey from chatham purely on the chance of seeing her husband the journey had taken a week and her expectant condition had made of it a nightmare but sharples had seen her board and embraced her at the entry port amid the sentimental cheers of his messmates no one had seen the sour look on the face of mr midshipman morris who happened to be passing at the time no one that is except tregembo who by another coincidence was in search of morris as sharples and his wife clasped together stepped over the prostrate active bodies oblivious of the parodies of love enacted all about them tregembo stepped up to morris and touched his forelock beg pardon mr morris said tregembo with exaggerated politeness lieutenant keenes orders and will ye take the launch over to flag for orders morris snarled at tregembo then a gleam of viciousness showed in his eyes calling a bosuns mate known for starting he strode forward as he went he called mens names they were the least desirable of cyclopss company a few otherwise engaged told him to go to the devil one or two he let off the rest he left to the bosuns mate at the forward end of the gundeck morris ran his quarry to earth sharples and his wife lay on the deck her head was pillowed on his hammock and her face wore a look of unbelieving horror her man father of her unborn child whose image she had cherished lay sobbing in her arms the whole foul story of morris had poured out of him for there was no way he could be a man to her until he had unburdened himself sharples was unaware of the presence of morris until the author of his misfortune had been standing over the pair for a whole minute sharples called morris in a voice which cut through the unhappy mans monologue you are required for duty the girl knew instinctively the identity of the intruder and struggled to her knees no no she protested morris grinned are you questioning my orders the girl faced morris biting her lip i can report you for obstructing an officer in the execution of his duty the punishment is a flogging your husband is already guilty of disobeying orders in having a hammock out of the nettings he spat the words in her face this threat to his wife revived sharples who pulled his wife gently aside wwhat orders mr morris man the launch the topman hesitated he was not in the boats crew aye aye then turning to his wife he whispered ill be back the girl collapsed sobbing on the deck and one of the older women to whom midshipmen were small fry put an arm around her a stream of filth followed morris down the deck the launch was absent three hours after a while the girl disgusted with the scenes on the gundeck sought fresh air and light on deck finding her way to the forward companionway she groped her way to the starboard side where she made a little bright patch against the coils of black hemp belayed and hung upon the pinrail staring out over the bright waters of spithead she touched the life quickening within her her heart was full to bursting with her misery the horrors of her weeklong journey rose again before her at a time when she had thought to be burying them in happiness shame for her man and for herself shame for the unborn child and for the depths of degradation to which one human could subject another welled up within her tears rolled down her cheeks her eyes stared out unseeing at the ships lying to the tide she was a small broken piece of the price britain paid for its naval puissance it was some time before old blackmore noticed the lonely figure forward he had relieved keene of the deck and soon sent drinkwater to turn the woman below again blackmore trained in the merchant service retained his civilian prejudice for refusing women leave to come on board he sighed in the merchant service a master gave his crew shore leave if they wished to visit a brothel that was their affair but they could be relied upon to return to their ship the navys fear of desertion prevented any liberty and resulted in the drunken orgy at present in progress between decks if the old sailing master could do nothing to alter the crazy logic of admiralty he was damned if he would have the upper deck marred by the presence of a whore drinkwater approached the girl in her preoccupation she did not hear him he coughed and she turned only to blench at his uniform she drew back against the coils of hemp imagining morriss threat of a flogging about to be carried out excuse me maam began drinkwater unsure of himself the woman was obviously distressed the masters compliments and would you please to go below she looked at him uncomprehending please maam the midshipman pleaded none of you er ladies are permitted above decks she began to perceive his meaning and his embarrassment her courage rallied here was one she could answer back dyou think im one of them arlots she asked indignantly drinkwater stepped back and the girl gained more spirit from his discomfiture im a proper wife mrs sharples to the likes oyou and i journeyed a week to see my usband tom she hesitated and drinkwater tried to placate her then please maam will ye go to sharples and bide with him she rose in scorn aye willingly mister officer if yed return him to me but hes out there she waved over the side off in a boat an me with child and a week on the road only to find im beat and and here she could not bring herself to say more and her courage failed her she stepped forward and fainted into the arms of a confused drinkwater then in an intuitive flash he realised she knew of her husbands humiliation he called aft for appleby and the surgeon puffed up along the gangway a glance took in the ladys condition and her nervous state appleby chafed her wrists and sent drinkwater off for sal volatile from his chest a few minutes later the girl recovered consciousness blackmore had come up and demanded an explanation having made an enquiry on passing through the gundeck en route to the surgeons chest drinkwater was able to tell the master that sharples had gone off in the launch with morris but the mans not in the launch crew i know mr blackmore replied drinkwater did morris single him out it appears so sir drinkwater shrugged and bit his lip dye have any idea why asked blackmore shrewdly noticing the midshipmans face shadowed by doubtful knowledge drinkwater hesitated it was more eloquent than words come on now young shaver if ye know lets have it out the midshipman swallowed hard he looked at the distressed girl golden curls fell about a comely face and she looked like a damsel in distress drinkwater burnt his boats morris has been buggering her husband he said in a low voice and sharples enquired blackmore he was forced sir blackmore gave drinkwater another hard look he did not have to ask more long experience had taught him what had occurred morris would have bullied drinkwater may even have offered him physical violence or worse the old man was filled with a loathing for this navy that ran on brutality let the lady get some air said blackmore abruptly and turned aft for the quarterdeck when the launch returned sharples was reunited with his wife he had endured three hours of abuse and ridicule from morris and his boats crew having delivered the admirals orders morris made his way to the cockpit drinkwater had also been relieved and going below he met tregembo the cornishman was grinning he held in his hand two ash sticks each three feet long with a guard of rattan work obviously untwisted from one of the blacksmiths withy chisels here zur said tregembo drinkwater took the sticks drinkwater looked at tregembo he had better let the man know what had happened on the upper deck before it became known below the master knows morris has been buggering sharples tregembo youd better watch threddle a cloud crossed the cornishmans face and then he brightened again the midshipman was not such a disappointment after all yell thrash him easy zur good luck drinkwater continued below he had uttered words that could hang a man words that he would never have dared to utter at home and now he felt ice cold apprehensive but determined in the cockpit morris and the other midshipmen were eating mugs of ale at their places the messman produced a plate for drinkwater he waved it aside went to his place and standing cleared his throat hhmm nobody took any notice the blood pounded in his throat and adrenaline poured into his blood stream but still he was cool mr morris he shouted he had their attention now mr morris this morning you threatened me and struck me a masters mate put his head in through the canvas door the tableau was lit by two lanterns even at pm here in the orlop the air crackled with tension two masters mates were now looking on morris rose slowly to his feet drinkwater did not see the apprehension turning to fear in his eyes he was too busy remaining cool you struck me sir he repeated he threw a single stick on the table it knocked over a mug of ale and in the ensuing pause the air was filled with the gurgle of beer running on to the deck perhaps gentlemen you would be kind enough after dinner to give me room to thrash mr morris at single stick now steward my dinner if you please he sat down grateful that his own mug remained full the meal was completed in total silence the two masters mates disappeared it was afterwards agreed that drinkwater had been extremely sporting in allowing notice of the forthcoming match to be circulated it was quite a crowd that eagerly cleared a space for the protagonists while drinkwater removed his coat and stock both combatants were in their shirtsleeves and drinkwater took up his stick and tested it for balance he had chosen the weapon for its familiarity in barnet it had been a favourite with the lads imitating the gentlemans short sword it combined the finesse of that weapon with some of the blunt brutality of the quarterstaff the carpenters mate had done well drinkwater watched beale push the last seachest back against the ships side mr beale will ee stand second to me with pleasure mr drinkwater said the other youngster shooting a sidelong glance at morris the latter looked desperately around him at last one of the masters mates stood second to morris rather than spoil the match as duelling was illegal on board ship drinkwaters choice of weapons was fortuitously apt although he had been guided by his own proficiency with the weapon and chose the single stick in ignorance any action by the lieutenants could be circumvented by an explanation that it was a sporting occasion to this end the seconds conferred and decided to send the messman in search of wheeler who despite his commissioned status could be relied upon for his vanity in presiding over such a match it was a tiny space in which they had to fight about five feet four inches high and some fifteen feet by ten in area the spectators backed up against the ships side further restricted it someone offered odds and the babble of excited voices attracted more attention into this babel calling for order strode the resplendent figure of lieutenant wheeler his arrival was accompanied by a rending of canvas as the forward screen was demolished thus augmenting the spectators by some two score wheeler looked about him damn my eyes what an evil coven have we here for the love of god bring more lanterns a fencing master has to see dye hear the protagonists faced each other and wheeler issued his instructions now gentlemen the rules of foil hits with the point on the trunk only you are unmasked which i do not like but as this is only a sporting match this with a heavy emphasis i should not have to caution you he paused en garde êtes vous prêts aye aye wheeler grimaced at the common response allez drinkwaters legs were bent ready for the lunge and his left hand was on his hip as there was no room for it in equipoise morris had adopted a similar position beads of sweat stood out on his forehead drinkwater beat morriss stick it gave he beat again and lunged the point hit morris on the breastbone but he side swiped and would have hit drinkwaters head but the latter parried on the lunge and recovered halte yelled wheeler then en garde this time drinkwater extended drew morriss stick and disengaged pressing the lunge his point blunt though it was scraped and bruised morriss upper arm ripping his shirt away halte cried wheeler but as drinkwater returned to guard morris with a yell of rage cut at his opponents flank the blow stung drinkwaters sword arm and bruised his ribs so that tears started in his eyes and his arm dropped but it was only for a second he lost his temper and jabbed forward wheeler was yelling for them to stop but drinkwaters stick drove savagely into morriss stomach muscles morris stumbled and bent forward drinkwater recovered and raised his smarting arm he beat the length of his stick down upon morriss back halte halte screamed wheeler jumping up and down with the excitement leave em leave em yelled the cheering onlookers drinkwater hit morris again as he went down his arm was filled now with the pentup venom in his soul he struck morris for himself for sharples and for kate sharples until someone pinioned him from behind morris lay prone someone passed a bucket along a woman shouted it was full of ladys pee and the crowd roared its approval as it was emptied over morriss back lieutenant devaux disturbed from the quiet consumption of a third bottle of looted madeira by the yelling and stamping elbowed his way through the crowd he was bleareyed and dishevelled he regarded the scene with a jaundiced eye our bloody little fire eater eh silence fell punters melted away into the darkness send this rabble forward wheeler what in gods name are you doing here whos in charge wheeler whats the meaning of all this tomfoolery but as wheeler began to explain an astonished lieutenant price came in looking at the tableau in illdisguised regret that he had missed the rout he addressed the first lieutenant captains compliments mr devaux and will you attend him in the cabin immediately for answer devaux swore horribly and left the company a few moments later hair clubbed hatted and coated he made his way aft orders to sail i believe price said quietly to wheeler by way of explanation drinkwater overheard he drew a deep deep breath and turned his back on the shakily standing morris they could sail to hell and back now thought nathaniel for he no longer felt oppressed by his boyhood chapter eight the capture of the algonquin july august cyclops was under easy canvas standing southward at noon the ship was hove to and soundings tried for the labadie bank as the yards swung round there was a sudden cry from the masthead sail ho devaux ordered drinkwater up with a glass when he returned hope was on deck schooner sir the midshipman reported raked masts aye sir yankee snapped hope belay that nonsense mr blackmore mr devaux all sail steer south blackmore looked crestfallen holding the lead and examining the arming but around him the ship burst into activity the topgallant sails were cast loose in their slack buntlines and the yards hoisted within minutes braced round to catch the wind the canvas tautened cyclops drove forward royals sir queried devaux as he and hope gauged the wind strength royals sir assented the captain royal halliards hoist away the light yards were set flying sent aloft at the run to the bare poles above the straining topgallants as the frigate spread her kites hope walked forward and carefully ascended the foremast behind him devaux already querying the wisdom of setting royals in the prevailing breeze expressed his opinion of captains who could not trust their officers to make reports ten minutes later the captain descended approaching the knot of officers on the quarterdeck he said shes yankee all right small light and stuffed full of men luckily for us shes to looard and the winds inclined to freshen should catch him then said devaux looking pointedly aloft aye ruminated blackmore still peeved at the captains disregard for his navigational technicalities but if he once gets to windward hell stand closer than us quite snapped hope and now mr devaux we will clear for action since sailing from spithead on a cruise against enemy privateers and commerce raiders the mood in cyclopss cockpit had changed the affair of morris and drinkwater had been the ships own cause celebre since many particularly on the lower deck knew the background to the quarrel the immediate consequences for the protagonists had been a mastheading each after which morris lost all credibility in the mess and aware of the thinness of the ice upon which he now skated assumed an attitude of almost total selfeffacement the change in his attitude was quite incredible and while he nursed a venomous hatred for drinkwater he was himself now haunted by the noose drinkwater on the other hand had become overnight a popular hero his own stature increased with the hands and his selfconfidence grew daily wheeler had made of him a sort of friend and had undertaken to school him in the smallsword drinkwater rapidly became adept at fencing and was once or twice invited to dine in the gunroom tregembo and sharples attached themselves firmly to the midshipman and formed a sort of bodyguard after the scrap blackmore had taken drinkwater aside and quizzed him further about morris drinkwater had not wanted to press charges and blackmore saw to it that morris knew this the old man was confident that morris would give no more trouble on the present cruise the sighting of the yankee schooner was the first opportunity cyclops had had of intercepting all but merchant ships and the crew were in high spirits as she bore down on her quarry the chase had seen cyclops but failed to recognise the danger until too late approaching endon the americans had taken the frigate for a merchantman and a potential prize the appearance of cyclopss gun muzzles however urged the rebels to flee the schooners helm was put up and she made off before the wind she was a small low vessel a fast softwood craft built in the shipyards of rhode island but cyclops now carrying her studding sails in the freshening breeze was tearing down on her the american held his canvas but his smaller vessel laboured with its huge gaff sails threatening to bury her bow and broach her the british frigate came on with a great white bone in her teeth on her focsle devaux waited for her bow to rise the bow chaser barked short by god the guns crew loaded again smoke belched a second time from the muzzle as the frigate ascended a dozen glasses were pointed at the schooner fine to larboard the knot of officers on the quarterdeck muttered their opinions to each other drinkwater lingered retained as messenger to the captain were closing all right he still hasnt hoisted colours there they are the american ensign rose to the peak and snapped out in the wind the schooner was driving forward under too great a press of canvas white water surged beneath her bow and along her side a brief puff of smoke appeared instantly dissipated by the wind a hole opened in the frigates forecourse good shooting by heaven aye and hon johnny will be bloody cross devauxs long ninepounder barked again a hole was visible in the schooners mainsail quid pro quo said keene whatd you do now asked wheeler of no one in particular id stand to windward as fast as i could once up wind of us hell get away said lieutenant price everyone knew the schooner with her fore and aft rig could haul a bowline faster than a squarerigged frigate but prices opinion was contested by drinkwater who could no longer hold himself silent beg pardon mr price but hes his booms to larboard with the wind aft to stand to windard he has to gybe on to the larboard tack to do so on the starboard he must needs cross our bow hell have to do something said price irritably look said several voices at once the american commander knew his business aware that his desperate gamble of overcarrying canvas had failed he decided to stand to windward on the larboard tack but the risk of a gybe that would carry away gear was unacceptable if he was to escape and he had to think of something to reduce this risk hope had been intently studying the yankee had reasoned along the lines that drinkwater had followed and was anticipating some move by the rebel ship what the officers had seen was the scandalising of the two big gaff sails the wooden gaffs began to hang down on their peak halyards taking the power out of the canvas but hope had already noticed the topping lifts tighten to take the weight of the booms even before the peak halyards were started he began roaring orders hands to braces move damn you foretack maintack the officers and men were galvanised to action hope looked again at the schooner her speed had slackened as devauxs gun barked again the shot went over the schooner began to turn now her stern was towards cyclops through the glass drinkwater read her name algonquin newport he reported it to hope the schooner rolled to starboard as she came round then her booms whipped over as she gybed but the americans were skilful the main and foresheets were overhauled and the wind spilled from the scandalised sails down helm lee braces mainsail haul let go an haul even as algonquins gaffs rose again and her sails were hauled flat cyclops was turning hopes task was to traverse the base of a triangle the hypotenuse of which formed algonquins track the schooner pointed to windward better than the frigate and if she reached the angle of the triangle before cyclops without damage her escape was almost certain on the focsle devaux was transferring his attention to the starboard bow chaser as cyclops steadied on her new course heeling over under her press of canvas a crack came from aloft the main royal had dissolved into tattered strips aloft and secure that raffle the algonquin was pointing well up but still carrying too much canvas nevertheless she was headreaching on the british frigate for a few minutes the two ships raced on the wind in the rigging and the hiss of water along their hulls the only significant sounds accompanying their grim contest then devaux fired the starboard bow chaser the shot passed through algonquins mainsail close to the first hole a seam opened up and the sail flogged in two three pieces cyclops came up with her victim and hoveto just to windward the yankee ensign remained at the gaff hope turned to drinkwater my compliments to mr devaux and he may fire the first division at that fellow drinkwater hurried forward and delivered his message the first lieutenant descended to the gundeck and the six leading twelvepounders in the starboard battery roared their command the american struck mr price take a midshipman two quartermasters two bosuns mates and twenty men plymouth or falmouth mr price mr wheeler a file of your marines aye aye sir the long boat was swayed up from the waist and over the side the yardarms blocks clicking with the efforts of the seamen once in the water men tumbled down into it drinkwater heard his own name called out by price mr drinkwater see the master for our position and a chart aye aye sir the midshipman went in search of blackmore the old master was still grumbling about interruptions to his soundings on the labadie bank but he wrote out the estimated latitude and longitude quickly enough as drinkwater turned away the old man grabbed his arm be careful lad he said full of concern yons not like the don drinkwater swallowed in the excitement he had not realised the implications of boarding the prize he went off to join the longboat in minutes it was pulling across the water between the two ships once clear of the ships lee the force of the wind tore off the wavecaps dashing the spray into the boat sergeant hagan reminded his men to cover their primings and the marines moved as one man to place their hands over the pans halfway between cyclops and algonquin the longboat swooped into the wave troughs so that only the mastheads of the two ships were visible then those of cyclops receded as those of the rebel ship loomed over them drinkwater had a peculiarly empty feeling in the pit of his stomach he was aware of the collective tension of the prize crew as they sat stonyfaced each man wrapped in his own apprehension drinkwater felt vulnerably small sitting alongside price as they took the frail boat over this turbulent circle of the vast ocean astern of them cyclops the mighty home of thirteen score of men dwindled into insignificance hope had deliberately detailed a large body of men for taking the privateer he knew she would have a numerous and aggressive crew capable of manning her own prizes as the longboat neared the privateer drinkwater realised blackmores predictions would be right this was no comparison with the boarding of the santa teresa there wrapped in the powerful protection of a victorious fleet he had felt no qualms the dramatic circumstances of the moonlight battle and the rapid succession of events that had resulted in him accepting a surrendered sword had combined into an experience of almost sublime exhilaration the remnants of chivalric war were absent now the bayonets of the marines glittered cruelly with a dreadful pang of nauseous fear drinkwater imagined what it would be like to be pierced by so ghastly a weapon he shrank from the thought the next moment they were alongside the schooner the twenty seamen followed price up the side hagan and his marines brought up the rear lieutenant price addressed a bluecoated man who appeared to be the commander i must ask you for your vessels papers sir the bluecoated one turned away sergeant hagan swept his men through the ship she had a crew of fortyseven seamen having ascertained the large focsle was secured by one hatch he herded them below under the guns of cyclops three cables distant they went resentfully but without resistance price having possessed himself of the ship had a man run up british colours and set his men to securing and repairing the mainsail the privateers officers were confined in the cabin aft and a marine sentry put on guard next the lieutenant turned two of the quarter guns inboard to sweep the deck and had them loaded with grapeshot the keys of the magazine were secured and the vessels details passed down into the waiting longboat for return to cyclops with a damaged mainsail price was limited to the gaff foresail and a staysail but he set course and trimmed the sheets in twentythree minutes the privateer algonquin of newport rhode island operating under letters of marque from the continental congress was seized by his britannic majestys navy the bluecoated man remained on deck he was staring at the frigate that had taken his ship from him the distance between the two vessels was increasing he banged his fist on the rail then turned to find the british lieutenant at his elbow i am sorry sir to be the agent of your distress but you are operating illegally under the authority of a rebel organisation which does not possess that authority will you give me your parole not to attempt to retake this ship or must i confine you like a felon prices courteously modulated welsh voice could not disguise his mistrust of the silent american at last the man spoke in the colonial drawl you sir are the practitioners of piracy you and all your countrys perfidious acts and tyrannous oppressions be damned i shall give you no parole and i shall take back my ship you are outnumbered and may rest assured that my men will not take kindly to you confining them forward you will get little sleep lootenant so you think on that and be damned to ee blue coat turned away price nodded to hagan who with two marines roughly urged the commander below price looked about him the sail repair was progressing midshipman drinkwater and the two quartermasters had organised the deck the tiller was manned and the course set for the channel lieutenant price looked astern cyclops was already only a speck on the horizon resuming her cruise he felt lonely during his eight years at sea he had been prizemaster on several occasions but the prizes had invariably been docile undermanned merchantmen true their masters and crews had resented capture but they had given little trouble in the face of armed might in the dreary years of the war with the americans the british had learned their opponents possessed an almost unfair capacity for seizing opportunities true their generalissimo washington continually faced mutiny in his own army but when the british might be caught at a disadvantage the damned yankees would appear like magic burgoyne had found that out so had st leger even when the greatest american tactician benedict arnold changed sides the laconic british high command learned too late the value of such talents the fate of lieutenant price was sealed in that same restless energy he was surprised even in death that men of his own race could treat his humanity with such contempt for two days algonquin steered south east to pass south of the scillies before hauling up channel the big mainsail had been repaired and hoisted drinkwater took a keen interest in the sailing of the schooner unfamiliar with the qualities of fore and aft rig he was fascinated by her performance he had no idea a vessel could move so fast with a beam wind and listened with interest when the two quartermasters fell to arguing as to whether it was possible to sail faster than the wind itself indeed the fears planted by blackmore were withering as nathaniel experienced the joys of independence the weather remained sunny and pleasant the wind light but favourable the americans appeared in small groups on deck forward for daily exercise and sergeant hagan and his marines saw to the policing of the schooner the american mates gave little trouble remaining confined in one cabin whilst the privateers commander was locked in the other they were allowed on deck at different times so that one or other of them was usually to be seen standing close to the mainmast shrouds during daylight the principal stern cabin had been seized by price and the midshipmen whilst the seamen and marines used the hold tween decks for accommodation this space had been intended to house the crew of prizes taken by the algonquin by the evening of the second day price had relaxed a little an hour earlier one of the american sailors had asked to see him price had gone forward a man had stepped out and asked if they could provide a cook since the food they were receiving was making them ill if the lootenant would agree to this they would promise to behave price considered the matter and agreed they could supply a cook but that no further relaxation of their regimen could be allowed he estimated his position to be some ten leagues south of the lizard and hoped to stand north the following day and make falmouth but that night the wind fell light and then died away altogether as dawn filtered through it revealed a misty morning the schooner lay rolling in the water as a lazy swell caused her blocks to rattle and her gear to chafe when price was called he was in a passion at the change of weather by noon there was still no sign of wind and he had the big gaff sails lowered to reduce chafe the hands were engaged with this work as the american cook went forward a pot of stew in his hands drinkwater was standing right aft as the big mainsail was lowered he hove in the slack of the sheet and coiled it down there was a sudden scream from forward the marine sentry bending down to open the companionway for the prisoners cook had had the boiling contents of the pot dashed into his face in a trice the american had picked up the marines musket and threatened the four seamen lowering the foresail for a splitsecond every man on algonquins deck was motionless then with a whoop the americans were pouring aft they hurled themselves at the unarmed seamen as the latter let go the halyards they pulled belaying pins from the rail and rolled aft a screaming human tide the foresail came down in a rush adding to the confusion the seamen forward were quickly overpowered but further aft hagan had got several marines to present the muskets cracked and three americans went down lieutenant price lugged out his hanger and leapt for the lanyard of the starboard quarter gun he tugged it a flash and roar emanated through the fog as the grape cut a swathe through friend and foe momentarily the human tide was stemmed then it rolled aft again drinkwater remained rooted to the spot this was all a dream in a moment the fog would clear and algonquin become her ordered self again a pistol ball smacked into the rail beside him he saw price mouth drawn back into a snarl whirling the slender hanger one two rebels received its needle point in their bodies then with a sickening thud a handspike whirled by a giant halfcaste indian split the lieutenants skull drinkwater suddenly felt inexplicably angry nothing could withstand the furious onslaught of the americans he was dimly aware of struggling british seamen and marines being held by three or four of the privateersmen he knew he was about to die and felt furious at the knowledge he choked on his rage tears leaping into his eyes suddenly his dirk was in his hand and he was lunging forward the big halfcaste saw him coming too late the man had picked up prices hanger out of curiosity suddenly aware of the midshipman rushing towards him he bent and held it outwards like a hunting knife drinkwater remembered his fencing as the indian jabbed the sword upwards drinkwaters dirk took the hangers foible in a semicircular parry taking the blade he exerted a prisedefer raised his point and his own momentum forced his toy weapon into the stomach of the indian the man howled with pain and surprise as they collided then he collapsed on top of him for a moment drinkwaters anger evaporated into sudden chilling fear a fear mingled with an overwhelming sense of relief then he received a blow on the head and was plunged into a whirlpool of oblivion when drinkwater recovered consciousness it was several minutes before he realised what had happened he was confused by total darkness and a regular creaking sound that terminated in a number of almost simultaneous dull knocks before starting again wh where the hell am i he asked out loud a groan came from alongside him then a hand grasped his knee mister drinkwater a strained voice enquired pain and anxiety in the tone of it yes grattan sir marine eh oh yes were in the focsle just the wounded sir wounded aye sir you were unconscious my arms broken oh im sorry thank you sir drinkwaters brain was beginning to grasp the situation and an enormous and painful bump on the crown of his head testified to the accuracy of the marines report recollection came back to him he sat up and took stock whats that noise then sweepin sir thats what the others are doin before he could ask more the hatch flew open a few cold drops of moisture dripped into drinkwaters upturned face then the shape of a man lowering himself down blotted out the foggy daylight the man bent over each of the prisoners in turn when he got to drinkwater he grunted youre fit get on deck he grabbed drinkwaters arm and dragged him to his feet a few moments later drinkwater stood unsteadily on the deck of algonquin and looked aft the source of the strange noise revealed itself still shrouded in fog algonquin was making slow but steady headway over the calm grey sea between the gunports oak thole pins had been driven into the caprail at each set of pins a long oar or sweep was shipped two men were stationed at each sweep heaving it back and forth so that the schooner made way to the southward the men at the sweeps were nearly all british one of the american mates walked up and down the deck with a ropes end every now and again he brought it down on the bare back of a seaman or the sweatdarkened red coat of a marine drinkwater was pushed along the deck given a pannikin of green water from the scuttle butt and shoved alongside a marine pulling the aftermost larboard sweep the man was hagan he was running with sweat as the rigging dripped with foggy dew hagan grunted a welcome and drinkwater grasped the loom of the sweep it was slippery with the blood and plasma of the man he had relieved within a quarter of an hour drinkwater knew why the privateer was under sweeps the progress through the fog was an advantage to the american commander but it was also the most efficient way of exhausting the british an exhausted prize crew would not attempt further resistance after an hour drinkwater had reached a state of physical numbness that utterly overpowered him he had ceased to feel the mates starter his head throbbed but his brain had ceased to function it was hagan who roused him from his torpor the marine sergeant hissed between clenched teeth breeze comin drinkwater raised his head and wiped the sweat out of his eyes a catspaw rippled the greasy surface of the sea the sun was brighter now warmer he had no idea of the time nor of how long he had been semiconscious the fog began to disperse imperceptibly at first wind and sunshine broke through the murk an hour later there was a breeze light and fitful it steadied to become a north westerly air from a zephyr it graduated to a breeze and the american commander ordered the sweeps inboard and the sails hoisted before they were herded below into the focsle drinkwater was aware that algonquin was headed southeast for he had heard the helm order as the hatch closed over the british the schooner heeled and the water of the channel hissed past her washboards with increasing speed chapter nine a turning of tables august the british prize crew aboard the algonquin were in a pathetic state it had been evening when the americans had retaken their ship all that night the british had swept the craft south away from the cornish coast it was the following dawn when the midshipman recovering consciousness had been forced on deck by the time the breeze sprang up the day was far advanced in the stinking focsle the british sprawled in all attitudes of exhausted abandon after a while the eyes adjusted to the darkness and drinkwater could see the men asleep he looked for grattan the man tossed restlessly his eyes staring he was the only other man awake another whose name drinkwater did not know was dead his head had been injured and dried blood blackened his face he lay stiff his mouth open emitting a silent cry that would echo forever drinkwater shivered grattan was muttering incoherently for the pain of his arm had brought on a fever at noon the hatch was shoved open a pan of thin soup some biscuit and water were lowered down the hatch was being closed again when drinkwater roused himself and called weve a dead man down here the hatch stopped and the silhouette of a mans head and shoulders was visible against the sky so he drawled will you permit him to be taken on deck there was a pause hes one of yours you brought him you keep him a gobbet of spittle flew down and the hatch slammed shut the exchange had woken the men they made for the food improvising means of eating it dunking the biscuit and sucking it greedily after a while sergeant hagan crawled over to the midshipman beg pardon mr drinkwater but ave you any orders eh whats that drinkwater was uncomprehending mr price is dead youre in charge sir drinkwater looked at the quartermasters and the marines they were all older than him they had all been at sea longer than he had surely they were not expecting him to he looked at hagan hagan with twentyodd years of seasoldiering to his credit hagan with his bragging stories of service under hawke and boscawen hagan with his resource and courage but hagan was looking at him drinkwaters mouth opened to protest his unsuitability he had not the slightest idea what to do he closed it again hagan came to his rescue right lads mr drinkwater wants a rollcall he said so lets see how many of us there are right hagan coughed marines speak up apart from the sergeant there were five marines left quartermasters the two quartermasters were both still alive and unwounded bosuns mates there was silence seamen eleven voices were eventually identified one of whom complained of a sprained ankle hagan turned to drinkwater thats er counting yerself sir thats exactly a score though one is unfit sir hagan seemed to think that this round figure represented some triumph for the british thank you sergeant drinkwater managed unconsciously aping devaux in his diction he wondered what was next expected of him hagan asked where dye think they mean to take us sir drinkwater was about to snap that he had not the faintest idea when he remembered the helm orders as he left the deck southeast he said recalling the chart he repeated their course and added their destination southeast to france aye said one of the quartermasters the bloody rebels have found some fine friends with the frogeating johnny crapos theyll be takin us to morlaix or st malo hagan spoke again his simple words came like a cold douche to drinkwater hagan was the fighter hagan the expediter of plans hagan would not shrink from a physical task once that task had been assigned to him but he looked to the quality to provide the ideas to him drinkwater in his halffledged manhood represented the quality in the general scheme of things it was assumed a person of drinkwaters rank automatically had the answer he was what was known on a kings ship as a young gentleman what do we do sir drinkwaters mouth flapped open again then he collected himself and spoke realising their plight was hourly more desperate we retake the ship a pathetically feeble yet strangely gratifying cheer went round the men drinkwater went on gaining confidence as he strung his thoughts together every mile this ship covers takes her nearer to france and you all know what that means there was a morose grumble that indicated they knew only too well there are nineteen fit men here against what about three dozen americans does anyone know approximately how many were killed on deck a speculative buzz arose indicative of rising morale lots went down when the lieutenant fired the gun sir drinkwater recognised sharpless voice in the bustle of events he had forgotten all about sharples and his being in the prize crew he was oddly comforted by the mans presence and we fixed a few you did for one sir admiration was clear in the mans voice hagan interrupted it was a sergeants business to estimate casualties id say we did for a dozen mr drinkwater say three dozen left grunts of agreement came from the men right three dozen it is drinkwater continued an idea had germinated in his brain theyre armed were not were in the focsle which is sealed from the rest of the ship it was the one place we chose to put them he paused they got out because they made a plan long before we took them as a er contingency i heard the american captain tell lieutenant price he would retake his ship it was almost like a boast ive heard americans have a reputation for boasting a desperate cackle that passed for a laugh emanated from the gloomy darkness hagan interrupted again but i dont see how this helps us sir they got out yes mr hagan they got out by using their plan they were model prisoners until they had made their arrangements they lulled us until the last possible moment then they took back their ship if we hadnt run into fog we might have been under the lee of the lizard by now he paused again collecting his thoughts his heart thumping at the possibility someone told me these yankee ships were mostly made of softwood and liable to rot a murmur of agreement came from one or two of the older hands perhaps we could break through the bulkhead or deck into the hold and work our way aft then we could turn the tables on them there was an immediate buzz of interest hagan however was unconvinced and adopted an avuncular attitude but nat lad if we can do that why didnt the yankees aye aye said several voices but drinkwater was convinced it was their only hope well im not sure he replied but i think they didnt want to raise our suspicions by any noise it is going to be difficult for us anyway if i am right they already had a plan worked out which relied on us behaving in a predictable manner now weve got to better them lets start searching for somewhere to begin in the darkness it took them an hour to find a weak spongy plank in the deck of the focsle hagan produced the answer to their lack of tools by employing his boots the joke this produced raised morale still further for the booted marines the unpopular policemen of a man owar were the butt of many a barefoot sailors wit hagan smashed in enough to get a hand through timing his kicks to coincide with the plunging of the algonquins bow into the short channel seas for the wind veered and the schooner was laid well over going to windward like a thoroughbred regularly and rhythmically she thumped into each wave and as she did so she disguised the noise of demolition the deck lifted easily once an aperture had been made access was swiftly gained to the cable tier below drinkwater descended himself the schooners cable lay on a platform of wooden slats beneath these the swirl and rush of bilge water revealed a passage aft it was totally dark below but doing his best to ignore the stench he pressed on driven by desperation he wriggled over the coils of rope and in one corner unencumbered by cable he found the athwartships bulkhead that divided the forepart of the ship from the hold here he found the slatting broken and illfitting he had to get aft of the bulkhead he struggled down in the corner worming his way beneath the cable tier platform where they failed to meet the ships side properly something ran over his foot he shuddered in cold terror never having mastered a fear of rats fighting back his nausea he lowered himself into the bilge water its cold stink rose up on his legs and lapped at his genitals for a long moment he hung poised the malodorously filthy water clammily disgusting him then a strange detached feeling came over him as if he watched himself in that moment he gained strength to go on continuing his immersion nathaniel drinkwater finally forsook adolescence algonquin was on the larboard tack leaning to starboard by sheer good fortune drinkwaters descent was on the larboard side there was therefore a greater amount of water to starboard and a dry space for him to cling to even so it was slippery with stinking slime he could see nothing and yet his eyes stared apprehensively into darkness all his senses were alert that of smell almost overpowered by the stench of the bilge but although he gagged several times he was possessed now by an access of power that drove him relentlessly on ignoring his bodily weaknesses impelled by his will he moved aft over each of algonquins timbers eventually he found what he hardly dared hope he would discover the schooners builders had not constructed the pine planking of the bulkhead down to the timbers it extended to cross floors which supported the ceiling that formed the bottom of the hold between that and the ships skin a small bilge space ran the length of the vessel drinkwater continued aft having eventually completed his reconnaissance he began to return to his fellow prisoners he was excited so that twice he slipped once going into the foul water up to his chest but at last he wriggled back into the focsle the men were expectantly awaiting his return they offered him a pull at the water pannikin which he accepted gratefully then he looked round the barely discernible circle of faces now my lads he said with newfound authority this is what well do captain josiah king commander of the privateer algonquin sat in the neat stern cabin of his schooner drinking a looted bottle of malmsey he would be in morlaix by morning if the wind did not veer again there he could disencumber himself of these british prisoners he shuddered at the recollection of losing his ship but as quickly consoled himself with his own forethought the contingency plan had worked well the british lieutenant had been a fool the british always were king had been with whipple when the rhode islanders burnt the government schooner gapée back in he remembered her captain lieutenant duddingstone acting the hero waving a sword about a thrust in the groin soon incapacitated him they had cast the unfortunate lieutenant adrift in a small boat king smiled at the memory when the magistrates eventually examined the cause of the burning the entire population of the town protested ignorance king knew every spirited man in newport had answered whipples summons the american smiled again burgoyne had been a fool too with his claptrap about honourable terms of surrender never mind that gates had promised his army a safeconduct to the coast the british had surrendered and then been locked up for their pains that was what war was about winning simply that and nothing else warmed by recollection and wine he did not hear the slight scuffle of feet in the alleyway outside drinkwaters plan worked perfectly they had waited until well after dark by this time such food as the americans allowed them had been consumed each fit man was detailed off to follow in order and keep in contact with the man ahead the midshipman led the way the wind had eased and algonquin heeled less the passage of the bilge was foul rats scrabbled out of their way squealing a protest into the darkness but no one complained the filthy focsle was stinking with the corpses corruption and their own excrement activity even in a malodorous bilge was preferable to the miasma of death prevailing in their cramped quarters when he reached the after end of the hold drinkwater moved out to the side here there were gratings that ran round the schooners lazarette the wooden powder magazine was set in the centre of the ship with the catwalk all around this was decked with the gratings that now barred their passage upon these the gunners mates walked round tending the lanterns that shining through glass safely illuminated the gunner within and enabled him to make up his cartridges sergeant hagan followed drinkwater between them they lifted a grating and got through men followed silently they were still in darkness but a faint current of air told where a small hatch led on deck at the top of a panelled trunking it was locked drinkwater and hagan felt round the space behind the ladder they found a door that led into the after quarters it too was locked hagan swore they knew that once they were through that door they had a fair chance of success in there were the officers quarters on either side of the alleyway beyond there were a couple of cabins and at the end athwart the ship the stern cabin if they failed to capture the deck possession of the after quarters would probably result in the capture of an officer who might be useful as a hostage but the door was secured against them drinkwater dared not rattle the lock in the darkness he could hear his men breathing they all relied on him what could he do now he felt the hot tears of frustrated anger begin to collect and he was for the first time thankful for the darkness beg pardon sir a voice whispered yes locked door sir yes he replied without hope let me have a look sir there was a pushing and a shoving a man came past there was a silence as eighteen men held their breath the creaking of the schooner and hiss of the sea seemed inaudible then a faint click was heard a man shoved back into the queue try it now sir drinkwater found the handle and turned it very slowly the door gave he pulled it to again whats your name best you dont know it sir there was a muffled snigger the man was doubtless one of cyclopss many thieves with the scum of london pressed in her crew it was not surprising nevertheless the mans nefarious skill had saved the situation are you ready drinkwater enquired generally in a loud whisper aye aye the replies were muffled but nothing could disguise their eagerness drinkwater opened the door he made directly for the companionway hagan and the marine behind him made for the arms chest outside the stern cabin alternately a marine and a seaman emerged blinking into the dimly lit alleyway the marines armed themselves with the cutlasses hagan thrust at them then in pairs they burst into the cabins they took josiah king before the rhode islanders feet hit the deck his flimsy cabin door was dashed to matchwood and hagan his face contorted into a furious grimace presented the point of a cutlass to kings chest drinkwater dashed on deck his heart was pounding and fear leant a ferocity to him the companionway emerged on deck abaft a skylight that let on to the passageway fortunately for the british a canvas cover was pulled over this to prevent the light disturbing the helmsman but the helmsman stood immediately aft of the hatch behind the binnacle he leant against the huge tiller straining with the effort of maintaining weather helm the mate on deck was a little further forward but he turned at the helmsmans exclamation drinkwater ran full tilt at the mate knocking him over the two men behind him secured the helmsman he was tossed howling over the stern while the next man grabbed the tiller so that algonquin scarcely faltered on her course the american officer rolled breathless on the deck he attempted to rise and summon the assistance of the watch but drinkwater recovering from his butting charge had whipped a belaying pin from the rail the hardwood cracked on the mans head and laid him unconscious on his own deck drinkwater stood panting with effort the noise of blood and energy roared in his ears it was impossible that the algonquins crew had not been awakened by the din around him the british several armed by hagans marines gathered like black shadows as one man they rolled forward too late the americans on deck realised something was amiss they went down howling and fighting one attempted to wake those below but resistance was useless men threatened with imprisonment in a french hulk or the benches of a galley are desperate five americans perished through drowning hurled over algonquins side several were concussed into insanity eight were killed by their own edged weapons weapons intended to intimidate unarmed merchantmen the remainder were penned into the hold so lately reserved for their victims in ten minutes the ship was retaken half an hour later she was put about the sheets eased and on a broad reach steadied on course for england chapter ten elizabeth august drinkwater leaned over the chart beside him a quartermaster named stewart was pointing out the navigational dangers stewart had served as mate of a merchant ship and drinkwater was thankful for his advice i think falmouth mr drinkwater the man said youll find the distance less and youll not need to fear the eddystone the lighthouse is fine but the light feeble nay id say the twin cressets of the lizard will be a better mark drinkwater heeded stewart the former mate was a tough and experienced mariner which the incongruous paradoxes of human social order placed under his orders very well falmouth it is but i fear them retaking the ship we have at least twenty leagues to run before sighting the lizard i do not think they will attempt it hagans guard wont let them trick us again the boysll spit them with their baynits before asking any questions just you refuse them all requests and favours mr drinkwater rolling the charts up they went on deck algonquin raced along her canvas straining under the force of the wind on either side of her the white water hissed urgently as her keel tramped down the waters of the channel underfoot the breeze was fresh but steady allowing them to keep sail on the schooner and reel off a steady seven knots at eight bells the next morning the sun caught the twin white towers of the lizard and at noon algonquin ran into falmouth harbour under the guns of st mawes and pendennis castles at her peak she flew british over american colours drinkwater brought her to an anchor under the guns of a frigate lying in carrick roads drinkwater was reluctant to leave algonquin and report to the frigate but the warship sent her own boat amidst a crowd of unfamiliar faces he was rowed across to her she proved to be the galatea reporting to the third lieutenant he was informed the captain was in lodgings ashore but that the first lieutenant would receive his report drinkwater was conducted aft to where a tall thin officer was bent almost double under the deck beams he was coughing violently beg pardon sir this is midshipman drinkwater of the cyclops prizemaster of the schooner yonder drinkwater was suddenly a boy again the responsibility of command lifted from him in the presence of this intimidating stranger he felt very tired tired and dirty the tall man looked at him and smiled then in an unmistakably northumbrian accent he said watched you anchor mister well done youll have prisoners no doubt aye sir about twenty the lieutenant frowned about he fell to coughing again i havent allowed them on deck sir im not sure how many were killed last night the officers frown deepened you say youre from cyclops lad aye sir thats correct shes off ireland or thereaboots so how were you fighting last night drinkwater explained how the americans had retaken the ship how lieutenant price had been killed and briefly related the prize crews desperate attempt to retrieve the situation the first lieutenants frown was replaced by a wry grin youll be wantin to be rid of such troublesome fellars then yes sir ill send some men and our longboat over youll have to take them to pendennis after that report to captain edgecumbe at the crown the tall man indicated first the squat tower of pendennis on its headland above the harbour and then the huddle of houses and cottages that constituted the market town of falmouth he broke into another fit of coughing thank you sir my pleasure lad said the tall man moving away beg pardon sir the man turned a bloody handkerchief to his mouth may i ask your name collingwood coughed the tall lieutenant lieutenant wilfred collingwood was as good as his word half an hour later galateas longboat was alongside and a file of marines came aboard hagan had done his best to smarten the crew up but they did not compare with galateas men the americans were herded into the boat drinkwater ordered algonquins boat into the water and was rowed ashore with stewart on the stone pier of falmouths inner harbour the marines were lining the american prisoners up josiah king was paraded scowling at the head of his men and the scarlet coats were lined along either side of the downcast little column drinkwater his trousers still damp and smelling of bilge swaggered at their head while stewart and six seamen followed with cutlasses hagan also stinking of bilge marched beside drinkwater the column moved off it was market day and falmouth was crowded the people cheered the little procession as it tramped through the narrow streets drinkwater was conscious of the eyes of girls and women and found the sensation thus produced arousing but such is the vanity of humanity that sergeant hagan threw out his chest and received the same glances with the same assurance that they were for him whereas in truth they were intended for the handsome sulking american commander who in the romantic hour of his defeat appealed to the perverse preference of the women josiah king burned with a furious rage that seemed to roar in his skull like a fire he burned with shame at losing his ship a second time he burned with impotent anger that fate had wrested the laurels of victory from him josiah king of newport rhode island and conferred them on the skinny young midshipman whose wet and smelly ducks stuck to his legs with every swaggering stride he took he burned too with the knowledge that he had been outwitted at the very moment he had been congratulating himself on his forethought that was perhaps the bitterest most private part of the affair behind him his men trooped disconsolately as the column moved out of the town and began to climb the headland the road passed the end of the hornworks ascending through low undergrowth it was hot and the sun beat down upon them suddenly the ramparts rose on their left and they swung over the fosse under the italianate guardhouse inside which the huge expanse of the castle enclosure revealed itself the guard had called the sergeant and the sergeant called his captain the captain despatched an ensign to attend to the matter and continued his postprandial doze the ensign was insufferably pompous having discovered that the escort was commanded by a none too clean midshipman his condescending manner annoyed the exhausted drinkwater who was compelled to endure the tedium of the unfamiliar and bewildering paperwork without which even the business of war could not be expedited each individual american had to be identified and signed for both by the ensign and the midshipman all the while the sun beat down and drinkwater felt the fatigue of a sleepless night merge with the euphoric relief from responsibility at last the disdainful officer was satisfied the marines had fallen in again and the little party began to descend to the town with stewart drinkwater repaired to the crown inn captain edgecumbe of his britannic majestys frigate galatea was an officer of the old school when a ragamuffin midshipman appeared before him in filthy ducks the captain was rightly wrathful when that same scruffy midshipman attempted to report the arrival of the captured privateer algonquin the captain refused to be sidetracked by incidentals he also disliked interruptions the diatribe to which he subjected drinkwater was as lengthy as it was unnecessary in the end the midshipman stood silent discovering after some minutes had elapsed that he was not even listening outside the hot sun shone and he had an odd longing to be doing nothing but lounging in that sunshine and perhaps have his arm about the waist of one of those pretty girls he had seen earlier the sweet scent of cornwall wafted in through the open window distracting his senses from the path of duty only when the captain ceased his tirade did the sudden silence break into his reverie and drag his conscious mind back to the inn room he looked at the captain sitting in his shirtsleeves edgecumbe looked what he was a dissipated and incompetent officer living out of his ship and indulging his sexual appetites with local ladies drinkwater felt a sudden surge of contempt for him he touched his forehead aye aye sir thank you sir he turned and marched smartly from the room downstairs he found stewart in the taproom he was chaffing with a redcheeked girl drinkwater noticed with a flutter in his stomach the girl had bright eyes and apple breasts stewart slightly abashed bought the midshipman a pot of beer be e yer capn the girl asked stewart giggling incredulously and setting the tankard down in front of drinkwater the quartermaster nodded flushing a little drinkwater was confused by the unaccustomed proximity of the girl but he felt stewarts deference to his apparent importance as a spur to his manhood she leaned over him boldly does yre honour need anything she enquired solicitously the heaving bosom no longer embarrassed him in his newfound confidence he sucked greedily at the tankard staring at the girl over its rim and enjoying her discomfiture as the beer warmed his belly he was after all prizemaster of the algonquin who had strutted through falmouth under the admiring glances of scores of women he finished the beer to tell the truth maam i have not the means to purchase more than a pot or two of beer the girl plumped herself on the bench next to stewart she knew the quartermaster had a guinea or half sovereign about him for she had seen the glint of gold in his hand stewarts experience ensured he never ventured ashore without the price of a little dalliance or a good bottle about his person the girl smiled at drinkwater it was a pity she thought he looked a nice young man handsome in a pale sort of way she felt stewarts arm encircle her ah well a girl had to live yer honourll have matters of great importance to deal with she said pointedly she began to nestle up to stewart who was staring at him drinkwater was aware of the pressure of stewarts arm on a large breast the white flesh swelled up threatening to eject itself from the ineffectively grubby confines of the girls bodice drinkwater smiled lightheartedly rising he tossed a few coppers on to the table be on board by sunset mr stewart on his return to algonquin drinkwater found the schooner being washed down upon the deck lay a bundle it was a dead man the other wounded were up and about grattan had had his arm splinted by the surgeon of galatea in the absence of the midshipman collingwood had been aboard the schooner and arranged for cyclopss injured to attend galatea for medical attention he had also ordered the remainder into cleaning their prize collingwood took an interest in the algonquin for he was shortly to be posted to the west indies where such vessels abounded besides he had liked the look of the young midshipman who had done well by all accounts a little discreet questioning among algonquins prize crew told how well the lieutenant left a message that drinkwater should report to him on his return aboard the quarterdeck of galatea reminded drinkwater of cyclops and he experienced a pang of nostalgia for his own frigate collingwood took him to one side and questioned him did you see captain edgecumbe yes sir the lieutenant broke into a fit of coughing what orders did he give you he asked at last none sir none queried the lieutenant a mock frown creasing his forehead well sir drinkwater faltered what did one say to a first lieutenant whose captain had filled you with contempt he told me to change my uniform sir and to and to to report to the flag officer plymouth i dont doubt aint that so lad drinkwater looked at collingwood and through his fatigue the light slowly dawned on him oh yes yes sir thats correct he paused very well id get under way tomorrow if i were you aye aye sir the midshipman knuckled his forehead and turned away oh and mr drinkwater sir you cannot bury that man in the harbour my carpenter is making a coffin i have taken the liberty of arranging a burial service later this afternoon you will attend the church of st charles the martyr at four oclock do you give thanks to the lord for your deliverance the tall lieutenant turned away in another paroxysm of coughing drinkwater slept briefly and at five bells was called to find his ducks cleaned and pressed hagan had spruced up his marines and the little party that solemnly marched to the parish church with their dismal burden carried with them a kind of rough dignity the organisation of a church burial for one of their number was a touch that drinkwater did not really appreciate at the time called upon to squander their lifes blood in the service of an ungrateful country the british seaman was inured to being treated worse than a beast when gestures such as that made by wilfred collingwood touched their hearts they became an emotional breed while edgecumbe pursued the libertine path of the insensitive autocrat collingwood and others were learning the true trade of leadership noone was to play upon the sailors heartstrings as well as horatio nelson but he was not the only one to learn the church was marvellously cool after the heat of the afternoon the little congregation shuffled awkwardly sensing the incongruity of the occasion afterwards under the yew trees the heat wrapped itself around the party again three men wept as the plain coffin was laid to rest worn out with exertion and overstrung nerves the brief burial over the seamen and marines prepared to march into town the priest a thin shrivelled man who wore his hair to the shoulder in the old fashioned manner came over to the midshipman i would be honoured sir if you would take a dish of tea with me at the vicarage yonder thank you sir drinkwater bowed the two men entered the house which contained something of the cool of the church it reminded drinkwater abruptly and painfully of his own home a table was set for three it seemed that the priest had some knowledge of the prize crews exploits for he addressed drinkwater in enthusiastic tones i am but the interregnum here but i am sure that the incumbent would wish me to welcome the opportunity of entertaining a naval hero in his home he motioned drinkwater to a chair you are most kind sir drinkwater replied but i do not think my actions were those of an hero come come no sir i fear the threat of a french prison revived our spirits he rose as a woman came in bearing a tea kettle ahh my dear the tea the old man bobbed up and down wringing his hands mr drinkwater id like to present my daughter elizabeth elizabeth my dear this is mr drinkwater i fear i do not know the gentlemans christian name though it would be an honour to do so he made little introductory gestures with his hands opening and closing them like an inexpertlymanaged glove puppet nathaniel sir volunteered drinkwater the woman turned and drinkwater looked into the eyes of a striking girl of about his own age he took her hand and managed a clumsy little bow as he flushed with surprise and discomfiture her fingers were cool like the church he mumbled yr servant maam honoured sir her voice was low and clear the trio sat drinkwater felt immediately oppressed by the quality of the crockery the delicacy of the china after months of shipboard life made him feel clumsy the appearance of a plate of bread and cucumber however soon dispelled his misgivings nathaniel eh muttered the old man well well a gift of god he chuckled softly to himself most appropriate really most appropriate drinkwater felt a sudden surge of pure joy the little parlour bright with chintzes and painted porcelain reminded him poignantly of home there was even the air of threadbare gentility of a pride that sometimes served as a substitute for more tangible sustenance as she poured the tea drinkwater looked at the girl he could see now that she was indeed his own age though her old fashioned dress had conveyed an initial impression of greater maturity she bit her lower lip as she concentrated on pouring the tea revealing a row of even and near perfect teeth her dark hair was drawn back behind her head in an unpretentious tress and it combined with her eyes eyes of a deep and understanding brown to give her face the inescapable impression of sadness so struck was he with this melancholy that when she looked up to pass him his cup he held her gaze she smiled and then he was surprised at the sudden vivacity in her face a liveliness free of any reproach that his directness deserved he felt contentment change into happiness absent from his life for many months he felt a keen desire to please this girl not out of mere gratuitous bravado but because she had about her the soothing aura of calm and tranquillity in the turmoil of his recent life he felt a powerful longing for spiritual peace occupied with such thoughts he was unaware that he had consumed the greater part of the sandwiches single handed isaac bower and his daughter showed some surprise pardon me for the liberty sir but you have not eaten for some time i have not eaten like this for near a twelvemonth sir smiled drinkwater unabashed but on board ship you eat like gentlemen and keep a good table drinkwater gave a short laugh he told them of what his diet consisted when the parson showed a shocked surprise he learned himself how ignorant the people of britain were as to the condition of their seamen the old man was genuinely upset and questioned the midshipman closely on the food daily routines and duties of the respective persons aboard a man owar punctuating drinkwaters replies with pon my soul and well well well and copious sighs and shakings of his venerable head as for drinkwater he discoursed with the enthusiastic and encyclopaedic knowledge of the professional proselyte who had done nothing but imbibe the details of his employment his picture of life on a frigate though slightly lurid and excusably selfimportant was once sifted by the old mans shrewdness not far from the truth while the men talked elizabeth refilled their cups and studied her guest ignoring the soiled state of the linen about his neck and wrists she found him presentable enough his mop of dark hair was drawn carelessly back into a queue and framed a face that had weathered to a pale tan a tan that accentuated the premature creases around his eyes these were of a cloudy grey like the sky over the lizard in a sou westerly gale and they were shadowed by the blue bruises of fatigue and worry as he talked his face blazed with infectious enthusiasm and a growing selfconfidence that if it was not apparent to its owner was clear to elizabeth for she was more than the sheltered daughter of a country parson she had experienced near poverty since her father had lost his living some two years previously he had unwisely attacked the profligacy of his patrons heir and suffered the heirs revenge when that worthy succeeded suddenly to the estate the death of his wife shortly afterwards had left bower with the child of their declining years to bring up unaided in the event the girl had matured quickly and assumed the burden of housekeeping without demur although brought up in the shadow of her fathers profession the hardships and rigours of life had not left her untouched in his younger days bower had been an active man committed to his flock within the circumscribed world of a country parish events had served to temper elizabeths growing character much of her adolescence had been spent nursing her consumptive mother and during the last weeks of her life elizabeth had come face to face with the concomitants of sickness and death as she contemplated the ruins of a fruit cake that would have lasted the parson and herself a week she found herself smiling she too felt grateful for the teaparty drinkwater had blown in with some of the freshness of youth absent from her life until that moment it was a refreshing change from the overbearing bombast of the redfaced squireens or the languid indolence of the garrison infantry officers who had been until then almost the only eligible members of the male sex that she had met she detected a sympathy about the young man sitting opposite a sensitivity in him something contained in his expression and given emphasis by the early lines appearing on his face the umbra of nervous strain about his eyes at last the discussion ceased both men were by now firm friends drinkwater apologised for monopolising the conversation and ignoring his hostess it is quite unnecessary to apologise mr drinkwater since my father has too little of such stimulating talk she smiled again indeed i am glad that you have come albeit in such circumstances with a little pang of conscience drinkwater remembered he had that afternoon attended a funeral thank you miss bower but tell me mr drinkwater in all these comings and goings did you not feel afraid drinkwater answered without hesitation aye greatly as i told your father earlier but i think fear may be the mainspring of courage he paused it was suddenly imperative that he convey exactly what he meant he did not wish the young woman opposite to misunderstand to misjudge him not that i wish to boast of courage but i found the more i feared the consequences of inactivity the more i found the the resolve to do my utmost to alter our circumstances in this i was most ably supported by the other members of the prize crew she smiled without coquetry nathaniel basked in the radiance of that smile it seemed to illuminate the whole room the cake consumed the tea drunk and the conversation lapsing into the silences of companionable surfeit drinkwater rose the sun was westering and the room already full of shadows he took his leave of the parson the old man pressed his hand goodbye my boy please feel free to call upon us any time you are in falmouth though i do not yet know how much longer we shall be here his face clouded briefly with uncertainty then brightened again as he took the young mans hand may god bless you nathaniel drinkwater turned away strangely moved he bowed towards elizabeth yr servant miss bower she did not answer but turned to her father i shall see mr drinkwater to the gate father do you sit and rest for you look tired after your long talk the old man nodded and wearily resumed his seat elated at thus receiving a moment or two alone with the girl drinkwater followed elizabeth as she moved ahead of him flinging a shawl about her shoulders as she left the house she opened the gate and stepped down into the lane he stood beside her looking down into her face and fumbling with his hat suddenly miserable with the knowledge that he had enjoyed his simple tea with all its reminders of home and english domesticity but it was more than that it had been the presence of this girl that had made the afternoon and evening so memorable he swallowed hard thank you for your hospitality miss bower the air was heavy with the scent of foliage in the gathering gloom of the cornish lane fern fronds curled like fingers of pale green fire in the crevices of rocks that marked the boundary of the glebe overhead swifts screamed and swooped thank you for your very kind hospitality miss bower she smiled and held out her hand he grasped it eagerly holding her eyes with an exhilarating boldness elizabeth she said defying the bounds of propriety yet leaving her hand intensely passive in his firm grip please call me elizabeth then call me nathaniel they paused uncertainly for a second the spectre of awkwardness hovered between them then they smiled and laughed simultaneously i thought she began yes i thought i hoped you would not disappear completely it would be pleasant to see you again in answer nathaniel raised her hand to his lips he felt again the coolness of her flesh not the coolness of rejection but the balm of serenity i am he said with absolute conviction your very devoted servant elizabeth he held her hand a moment longer and turned away he looked back once before the lane bent away in descent he could see her face pale in the twilight and the flutter of her hand raised in farewell that night algonquin seemed to him a prison chapter eleven interlude august october it was autumn before drinkwater rejoined cyclops news had arrived in england of the defection of benedict arnold to the kings cause and the consequent shameful hanging of major john andre to drinkwater however languishing at plymouth it scarcely seemed possible that a ferocious war was taking place at all arriving in that port with algonquin he had been swiftly dispossessed of the schooner which passed to the port admirals hands he found himself with stewart sharples and the rest kicking his heels on the guardship this vessel an obsolete gun battleship was overcrowded and stinking filled with newlypressed seamen awaiting ships and young officers like himself daily expecting the return of their own vessels or the arrival of new posting the conditions on board necessitated the vessel being run like a prison and the consequent corruption found in those institutions therefore prevailed gambling ratbaiting and cockfighting were clandestinely practised drunken and sexual orgies took place almost nightly and the enforced idleness of twelve hundred and seventy men gave the devils agents excessive scope for improvisation from command of his own ship drinkwater became less than nothing one of many midshipmen and masters mates with sufficient time to reflect on the paradoxes of a sea officers career it was a dismal time for him the thought of elizabeth bower plagued him falmouth was not too far away he panicked at the thought of her fathers interregnum ending and the pair being sent god knew where he had never been in love before and submitted to the selfcentred lassitude of the besotted in an atmosphere utterly conducive to the nurturing of such unsociable emotions week succeeded week and the period was one of utter misery yet in its way the amorous depression that accompanied the congested privation served to keep him away from other more immediate amusements his romantic preoccupations encouraged him to read or at least to daydream over such books as the guardship possessed as time passed the memory of elizabeth faded a little and he read more diligently he spent some of his small stock of gold on books purchased from messmates needing ready cash for betting in this way he acquired a copy of robertsons elements of navigation and one of falconer reflecting that the money some loose spanish coin he had found on algonquin and rightly the property of the crown was being correctly spent on the training of a kings officer and not lining the pockets of an admiralty lackey after ten weeks of ennui drinkwater had a stroke of luck one morning an elaborately decorated cutter anchored in jennycliff bay a boat pulled over to the guardship with a request to the commanding officer for the loan of one masters mate or midshipman it so happened that the second mate of the cutter had been taken ill and her master required a replacement for a few days by chance drinkwater happened to be on deck and the first person the lieutenant dispatched to find a volunteer clapped eyes on within minutes he was in the cutters gig and being rowed across the steely waters of the sound a sprinkling rain began to patter on the water the boat rounded the cutters stern and drinkwater looked up to see the state cabin windows richly ornamented with gilt work and a coat of arms consisting of four ships quartered by st georges cross the ensign at the vessels stern was red and bore a similar device in the fly the officer in charge of the boat who happened to be the mate of the cutter explained that she was the trinity house yacht bound to the scillies to attend st agnes lighthouse drinkwater had heard of the elder brethren of the trinity house who maintained buoys in the thames estuary and some lighthouses around the coast however his main source of information had been blackmore as a sailing master in the royal navy blackmore had had to suffer examination by the brethren who passed the navys navigators before he could obtain his warrant blackmore the former master of a baltic trader had resented the fact and commented somewhat acidly on the practice however drinkwater was immediately impressed by the immaculate appearance of the trinity yacht the crew all volunteers exempt from the pressgang were smart and well fed when compared with the royal navys raggamuffins the master one john poulter seemed a pleasant man and welcomed drinkwater cordially on explaining his lack of clothing since his chest remained on cyclops the master offered him fresh ducks a tarpaulin and a pea jacket a great sensation of relief flooded over drinkwater as he settled into his tiny cabin he luxuriated in the privacy which although he had partaken of it aboard algonquin had not been without the worrying responsibility of command until that moment he had not realised the extent of the guardships oppression upon his spirit later he went on deck it was now raining steadily the cawsand shore was blurred into grey mist but the rain fell with the hiss of freedom pulling the tarpaulin round him he examined the vessel she was sturdily built and mounted a few swivel guns on either side her mainsail was clearly larger than algonquins and she had a solider more permanent feel about her this was due to her oak construction and opulent appointments for she fairly dripped with gilt gingerbreadwork her spars gleamed even in the dreary weather and drinkwater examined the details of her rigging with great interest captain poulter had come on deck and walked over to him well cully had much experience with this kind of vessel his accent was unmistakably that of the capital not a cutter sir but i was lately prizemaster of a schooner good i hope i shall not detain you long from the kings business but i am bound for the scilly islands with captain calvert to examine the lighthouse there perhaps a kings officer may find that interesting drinkwater detected the flicker of insinuation in poulters voice he recognised it as a device used by old blackmore and other merchant masters who resented the navys social superiority to his credit he coloured to tell the truth sir i am greatly obliged to you for removing me from yonder guardship methought i might die of boredom before i saw action again thats well said poulter turning to windward and sniffing the air plague on this damn coast its always raining the trinity yacht left plymouth two days later august had passed into september the rain had given way to windy mistladen days but the weather had no power to depress the young midshipmans spirits after the claustrophobic atmosphere of the guardship service on the trinity yacht was stimulating in the extreme here was a fine little ship run as efficiently as a firstrate without the lash and human degradation prevalent in his majestys service captain poulter and his mate proved generous instructors and drinkwater quickly learned more of the subtleties of handling the fore and aft rig of the big cutter than he had mastered aboard algonquin he found captain anthony calvert willing to discourse with him even interested to hear how drinkwater would undertake certain navigational problems he joined the elder brother and poulter at dinner one evening calvert was treated with as much deference as drinkwater had seen accorded to admiral kempenfelt indeed the captain flew his own flag at the cutters masthead although his privileges and responsibilities were considered to be exterior to the management of the yacht nevertheless he proved to be an interesting and interested man as the cutter bucked her way to the west drinkwater found himself recounting the story of the recapture of the algonquin at midnight drinkwater left poulter and calvert to relieve the mate it was still blowing hard the night black wet and inhospitable the mate had to bellow in drinkwaters ear as he passed over the position and course keep her off on the starboard tack another hour youre well off the wolf rock now but keep a sharp lookout when you stand north we should be well west of it by now but the floods away and will be fierce as the devils eyebrows with this wind behind it yell be well advised to use caution aye aye replied drinkwater shouting back to the black figure whose tarpaulin ran with rain and spray he was left to the night ruminating on the dangers of the unmarked wolf this totally isolated pinnacle of rock was with the eddystone the most feared danger to mariners on the south coast of england continually swept by swells on even the calmest days it was to be before an abortive attempt was made to erect a beacon on it this structure collapsed at the first gale and it was to be a generation before a permanent seamark was finally grouted into that formidable outcrop it was claimed by some that in certain sea conditions a subterraneous cavern produced a howling noise and this had given the rock its name but howling noise or not nothing could have been heard that night above the roar of the gale and the creak and crash of the trinity yacht as she drove to the southsouthwest poulter had put four reefs into the enormous mainsail before dark he was in no hurry since he wished to heave to off the scillies to observe the light at st agnes it was for this purpose calvert had journeyed from london at two bells drinkwater prepared to put about on to the port tack before doing so he went forward to inspect the headsails the staysail was reefed down but out on the long bowsprit a small spitfire jib stood against the gale drinkwater had learned that to balance the huge mainsail a jib had to be kept as near the end of the bowsprit as conditions permitted he watched the big spar stab at a wavecrest even as the bow he stood on pitched down off its predecessor beneath him the figurehead of a lion guardant disappeared in a welter of white water that rolled hissing away from the cutters steadily advancing stem he returned aft calling the watch to their stations glanced at the compass then up at calverts flag standing out from the masthead like a board two men leaned against the big tiller he shouted at them down helm they grunted with exertion the yachts heel reduced she came upright her canvas slatting madly cracking like thunder the hull swooped and ducked as she met the seas head on drinkwater bit his lip she took her time passing through the eye of the wind but her crew clearly knew their business his orders were as much for his own satisfaction as the vessels management as she paid slowly off to starboard the little spitfire jib was held aback the wind caught it and suddenly it exerted its tremendous leverage at the extremity of the bowsprit the cutter spun on her heel the mainsail filled then the staysail was hauled over finally the weather jib sheet was started and the canvas cracked like a gun before it was tamed by the lee sheet the yacht sped away to the north west and drinkwater breathed a sigh of relief there was no opportunity to study the chart in the prevailing conditions the deck was continually sluiced by seas coming aboard so that the two boats on chocks amidships appeared to be afloat of their own accord after a further hour of this the sails suddenly slatted at once several men perceived the veering of the wind keep her full and bye roared drinkwater to the helmsmen to which a slightly reproachful voice answered aye aye but thats north sir drinkwater checked himself reflecting that this was no kings ship and the helmsmans reply was not insubordinate but informative north he shook his head to clear away fatigue and too much of calverts port with leeway and a roaring flood tide to set them east he might be setting on to the wolf rock a knot of panic gripped his stomach until he mastered it with the thought that the total area of the rock was less than that of the cutters deck surely the odds were impossibly against them striking that isolated spot a figure loomed up beside him it was poulter heard her luff cully youll be concerned about the wolf it was not a question but a statement simply made drinkwater felt the load lifted from his shoulders his brain cleared and he was able to think dye wish me to put about again captain poulter with the shift of wind shell hold a more westerly course sir poulter was glancing at the dimly lit compass drinkwater thought he caught a glimpse of a smile in the wet darkness that will do very well mr drinkwater see to it if ye please aye aye sir the trinity yacht arrived off hugh town later that day and remained there for several days calvert and poulter had themselves pulled across to st agnes and the crew discharged several cauldrons of coal into their boats to feed the lights chaufferfires ten days after leaving plymouth calvert pronounced himself satisfied with the lighthouse and on coming aboard from a final visit drinkwater overheard him talking to poulter well jonathan well make passage tomorrow at first light observing the cresset again tonight ill post to london from falmouth and you may then proceed to the eastard calverts words fell dully on drinkwaters ears until he mentioned falmouth falmouth meant elizabeth on arrival at falmouth it was discovered that the yachts second mate had recovered sufficiently to rejoin the ship drinkwater was therefore discharged by poulter with a letter explaining his absence and a certificate as to his proficiency greatly delighted with his luck he was even more astonished when calvert sent for him and presented him with four guineas for his services and another certificate testifying that as an elder brother of the trinity house he had examined mr drinkwater and found him to be competent in navigation and seamanship the document he presented to drinkwater certified that he had passed the examination for masters mate there mr drinkwater under the latest regulations you are now permitted to board prizes as prizemaster in your own right good luck to ye stammering his delighted surprise drinkwater shook hands with calvert and was pulled ashore with the elder brother having seen calvert off in the post chaise drinkwater turned his steps to the vicarage autumn was in the air but he strode along without a care in the world his heart thumping at the prospect of seeing elizabeth again he swung back the gate at the door he hesitated his hand actually in the act of drawing back the knocker changing his mind he moved to a side window it was the parsons study peering in he saw the bald dome of the old mans head the white locks from the sides and nape of his head falling sideways in the relaxation of sleep drinkwater crept round to the rear of the house he found elizabeth in the garden she was unaware of his presence and for a moment he stood watching her she was picking fruit from a tree whose gnarled boughs were bent under a load of russet apples as she stretched out to pluck the fruit her face was in profile the lower lip was caught in her teeth in an expression he recognised as one of concentration there was something sweetly pastoral in the scene to one whose eyes had become accustomed to the monotony of the sea he coughed and she started losing hold of her apron a cascade of apples ran out on to the grass oh nathaniel he laughed running over to help pick them up im sorry to have startled you she smiled at him kneeling their faces were very close he felt her breath on his cheek and was about to throw caution to the winds when she stood brushing a wisp of hair behind her neck i am glad that you have come how long can you stay drinkwater had not given the matter much thought he shrugged how long would you have me stay he smilingly asked it was her turn to shrug she laughed refusing to be drawn but he could tell she was pleased i ought to return to plymouth tomorrow well i ought to return today but he shrugged again well let us say i am recuperating the new york packet is due and therell be a post leaving soon stay till then well er i er father will be delighted please stay she uttered the last words pleadingly so that nathaniel had little choice and less inclination to choose he looked into her brown eyes they waited for his reply anxiously would you wish it that i stayed she smiled she had given away too much already she gathered the last of the apples and moved towards the house do you like apple pie nathaniel she called over her shoulder the day passed delightfully cyclops morris and the anxieties and fears of the past months might have been the experience of another person a callow frightened youth compared with the vibrantly energetic young man drinkwater had become as his daughter had said the old parson was delighted to entertain the midshipman he took great pride in showing drinkwater his library and it was clear that the collection of books constituted practically the whole of bowers possessions since the artefacts of the house were the property of the absent clergyman closer acquaintance with isaac bower revealed him to be a man of considerable learning who had not only brought his daughter up but educated her himself she was he told nathaniel with an air of confidentiality the equal to most men and the superior of many in her knowledge of mathematics astronomy greek and latin while her literary tastes encompassed those french authors who did not abjure the existence of god had there been any doubts about elizabeths talents in other directions these were swiftly dispelled at dinner when a roasted chicken was followed by an apple pie of generous proportions after dinner drinkwater found himself alone in a darkening room with a bottle of port that bower had unearthed in his hosts cellar he had drunk two glasses when the old man came into the room he threw some logs on to the fire and poured himself a glass i er had a little news the other day after you had left my lord bishop of winchester had appointed me to a parish near portsmouth it is a poor parish i believe but the old man shrugged resignedly that is of no matter at least he continued on a brighter note it will bring us nearer you brave naval fellows and i trust he looked pointedly at nathaniel i trust you will continue to visit us there warmed by the wine nathaniel replied enthusiastically i shall be delighted sir absolutely delighted after my last visit i found the prospect of reacquainting myself with you and eliz miss bower most comforting bower asked him something of his own circumstances and he told the parson of his widowed mother elizabeth joined them for a while before she announced she was retiring and the conversation was relaxed and informal after she had left nathaniel said i am sir very grateful for your kindness to me it has meant a great deal to me the two men drained the bottle nathaniels remark unsprung the older mans greatest fear my boy i do not expect to remain much longer in this world i have no fortune to leave after me but my daughter and on her account i am oppressed in spirit he coughed a little selfconsciously i would have her left with one friend for i fear she has had no opportunity to establish herself anywhere whilst following me upon my travels he paused diffidently then with a note of firmness in his voice he said dye take my meaning i am sure sir said nathaniel that i shall do all in my power to assist your daughter should she need my protection the old man smiled into the darkness he had known it the instant the boy told them his name nathaniel in the hebrew tongue it meant a gift from god he sighed with contentment the unusual sound of birdsong woke drinkwater next morning realisation that he lay under the same roof as elizabeth woke him to full consciousness he was quite unable to sleep so rose and dressed quietly descending the stairs he moved through the kitchen and unlatched the door the invigorating chill of early morning made him shiver as he strode out on the dewwet grass without thinking he began pacing up and down the lawn head down hands behind his back plunged in thoughts of last nights conversation with the old parson he felt a surge of excitement and relief at bowers approval and smiled inwardly with selfcongratulation he stopped midway between the apple trees and the house youre a lucky dog nathaniel he muttered to himself the creak of an opening window and the ring of laughter brought him back to reality from the kitchen window elizabeth her hair about her shoulders was smiling at him are you pacing your quarterdeck sir she mocked nathaniel was suddenly struck by the ridiculousness of his actions with the whole of cornwall at his feet he had paced over an area roughly equal to a frigates quarterdeck why he raised his hands in a shrug i never gave it a thought elizabeth was laughing at him the sound of her laughter coming out of the window borne on the scent of frying eggs the haunting paradoxes of cyclops and the malice of morris seemed no longer important all that mattered now was the laughter and the smiling face and the sizzling freshness of fried eggs yre a lucky dog nathaniel he muttered again as he crossed the grass to the kitchen door the london mail left falmouth later that day with nathaniel perched on its exterior bound for plymouth by the time it reached truro nathaniel riding on the crest of growing confidence had ascertained he possessed sufficient funds for the fare to london and back the weather remained fair and the experience of hurtling through towns and villages so agreeable and in harmony with his spirits that he decided the plymouth guardship could do without him for a further three or four days the idea had come to him while pacing the lawn that morning discussion of his family had filled him with a longing to return home no matter how briefly there had been no news of cyclops when he had left plymouth in the trinity yacht and poulter he knew would not put into plymouth to inform the authorities that he had landed him at falmouth it was therefore probable that a few days of additional absence would go unnoticed he came to an arrangement for a half price fare riding on the conveniency and settled down to enjoy the unprecedented pleasure of a journey through the green of southern england on an uncommonly fine day it was late in the afternoon following when stiff from the long journey and tired from the trudge up the great north road drinkwater reached barnet he pressed on to monken hadley reaching the small house at last his desire to see his mother and brother had increased with the growing love he felt for elizabeth the strong attraction of her home had reminded him of his own and bowers infirmity had emphasised the effect of passing time upon his remaining parent his stay in falmouth was limited by propriety yet he did not wish to kick his heels aboard that festering guardship nathaniel despite his fatigue was pleased with himself the freedom and independence he had experienced on algonquin and the trinity yacht had served to mature him the responsibility of the prize had stamped its imprint upon his character his growing relationship with elizabeth certain in at least its foundation lent him both hope and stability banishing many of the uncertainties of the past his altered outlook had found expression and practical reward he had looted kings small hoard of gold from the algonquin somewhat shamefacedly aware that his morality was questionable despite the usages of war when this had been supplemented by calverts respectably acquired guineas and most important of all his certificate of examination as masters mate he had a degree of autonomy for the first time in his life it lent a jauntiness to the final steps to his mothers front door he knocked and lifted the latch afterwards when there was time to think he realised he was right to come his mothers pleasure in his visit was only clouded by its brevity to him however her failing health and increasingly obvious penury were distressing and oppressive he had not stayed long he had talked and read to his mother and when she dozed slipped out to ask the rector to engage someone from barnet to attend to some of her needs calverts guineas had gone there and from the rector he had learned that ned was rarely seen in monken hadley nathaniels brother had found employment as a groom at west lodge with his beloved horses had taken a commonlaw wife from among the maids there and come near to breaking his poor mothers heart the rector had shaken his head and muttered like father like son but he promised to do what he could for mrs drinkwater closing his hand over the gold nathaniel sat in the quiet of the room watching motes of dust in the oblique shaft of sunlight that streamed in through the little window he would return to plymouth on the morrow he felt the inactivity the strange silence discomposing his mother dozed and recalling the reason for his visit he quietly resumed his letter to ned it was badly phrased awkward in admonition but it spoke with the newfound authority of the young man what are you doing the old ladys voice startled him oh mother you are awake just a note to ned to tell him to take more care of you he saw her smile dear nathaniel she said simply you cannot stay longer mother i must return to duty already i of course my dear you are a kings officer now i understand she held out her hand and nathaniel knelt by her chair he felt her frail arthritic hand brush his hair he could think of no words adequate to the moment and had lost the means to say them do not be too hard on edward she said quietly he has his own life to lead and is very like his father nathaniel rose and bent over his mother kissing her forehead turning away to hide the tears in his eyes when he left next morning it was still dark he did not know it but his mother heard him leave it was only then she wept chapter twelve a change of orders november january drinkwater joined cyclops again on the last day of october she had been in plymouth sound some days recruiting her prize crews and taking in fresh water and the tale of the retaking of algonquin had preceeded him borne on board by hagan and the others drinkwater therefore found himself something of a hero to the lower deck with whom he was already popular after his beating of morris the latter however had reestablished something of his former ascendancy in the cockpit drinkwaters absence had helped but a few new appointees to the frigate in the form of very young midshipmen had given augustus morris more victims there was though one new member of the mess whom drinkwater was quick to realise was a potential ally midshipman cranston a silent man of about thirty had little liking for morriss bombast or bullying a former seaman cranston had fought his way up from the lower deck by sheer ability he was clever and tough and utterly unscrupulous drinkwater liked him instantly he also liked another though much younger addition to the mess mr white was a pale diminutive boy of thirteen white was the obvious choice for victimisation by morris in the course of the succeeding weeks the now overpopulated cockpit whose members varied in age and pursuits was to become a bedlam of noise and quarrels towards the end of november captain hope expressed himself ready once more to cruise against the enemy and the frigate left plymouth beating west and south to resume her station the weather was now uniformly foul depression succeeded depression and a cycle was established of misery below decks and unremitted labour above the outbreaks of petty thieving fighting insubordination and drunkenness that were the natural consequences of the environment broke out again when a man was flogged for petty theft drinkwater wondered if it was the same man who had been instrumental in the retaking of the algonquin at all events he no longer baulked at such a spectacle inured now to it though he knew other methods existed to keep men at unpleasant labour but they had no part here in the overcrowded decks of cyclops and he felt no anger with captain hope for maintaining discipline with the iron hand that enabled the royal navy to sustain its ceaseless vigilance to the ships company of cyclops it was the dull monotonous routine of normality a fight with the enemy would have come as a blessed relief to both officers and men captain hope appeared on deck as little as possible nursing a grievance that he had not yet received his share of the prize money for the capture of the santa teresa lieutenant devaux showed signs of strain from similar motives his usual bantering tones giving way to an uncharacteristic harassment of his subordinate lieutenants especially mr skelton a young and inexperienced substitute for the late lieutenant price old blackmore the sailing master observed all and said little he found these peevish kings officers deprived of their twopence prize money and behaving like old maids distasteful shipmates bred in a hard school he expected to be uncomfortable at sea and was rarely disappointed mr surgeon appleby ever the philosopher shook his head sadly over his blackstrap he ruminated on the condition of the ship to anyone who cared to listen you see gentlemen about you the natural fruits of mans own particular genius corruption he enunciated the word with a professional relish as if sniffing an amputated stump seeking gangrene corruption is a process arrived at after a period of growing and maturation medically speaking it occurs after death whether in the case of an apple which had fallen from the bough and no longer receives sustenance from the tree or in the case of the human body which corrupts irrevocably after the heart has ceased to function in both cases the span of time may be seen as a complete cycle but in the case of spiritual corruption i assure you the process is faster and independent of the heart observe our noble ships company a pride of lions in battle appleby paused to fortify his monologue with blackstrap they are corrupted by the foetid atmosphere of a frigate sit down mr drinkwater sit down and remember this when you are an admiral as a consequence all manner of evils appear drunkenness quarrelling insubordination sodomy theft and worst of all for it is a crime against god and not merely man discontent and what nurtures that discontent why prize money what damned prize money bones interrupted lieutenant keene exactly my friend what prize money you won it you were awarded it but where the deuce is it why lining the pockets of milor sandwich and his tory toadies someone is growing fat on merely the interest gods blood they too are as corrupted as this stinking ship i tell you gentlemen this will rebound upon them one day one day it will not only be the damned yankees that defy their lordships but tom bowline and jack rattlin aye and harry appleby shouted a voice a bored laugh drifted round the gloom of the gunroom cyclops plunged into a sea and expletives exploded in short exasperated grunts from several voices whod be a goddamned sailor to drinkwater these weeks were less painful than to most it is true he dreamed of elizabeth but his love did not oppress him rather it sustained him blackmore was delighted that he had acquired his certificate from calvert and tutored him in some of the more abstruse mysteries of celestial navigation he also struck up a firm friendship with lieutenant wheeler of the marines whenever the weather moderated sufficiently to allow it wheeler and drinkwater engaged in fencing practice the frequent sight of his enemy thus engaged was a painful reminder of his humiliation to morris and the longer drinkwater seemed immune from morris the more the latter wished to revenge himself upon the younger man morris began to form his earlier alliances with likeminded men amongst the least desirable elements of cyclopss company only this time there was more purpose to the cabal morris was degenerating into a psychopathic creature to whom reality was blurred and in whom hatred burned with a flame as potent as love christmas and new year came and went almost unnoticed as they can only at sea it was a dull day in the middle of january before any event occurred to break the monotony of life aboard the frigate sail ho where away lee beam sir lieutenant skelton sprung into the mizen rigging and levelled his glass jumping down he turned to drinkwater mr drinkwater mcompliments to the captain and theres a sail to starboard might be a frigate drinkwater went below hope was asleep dozing in his cot when the midshipmans knock woke him he hurried on deck call all hands mr skelton and bear away to investigate a topsail was clearly visible now white as a gulls wing against a squall for a grey overcast obscured what sun there was occasionally a fleeting glimpse of a pale lemon orb appeared which blackmore patiently strove to capture in the horizon glass of his quadrant the two ships closed rapidly and after an hour came up with one another recognition signals revealed the other to be friendly and she turned out to be galatea the newcomer hove to under cyclopss lee and a string of bright bunting appeared at her foremasthead signal sir said drinkwater flicking the pages of the codebook repair on board hope bridled who does edgecumbe think he is damn him devaux suppressed a smile as wheeler muttered sotto voce a tory member of parliament perhaps after a little delay just long enough for it to be impertinent hope snapped very well acknowledge your gig sir asked the solicitous devaux dont smirk sir rasped hope irritably beg pardon sir replied devaux still smiling huh hope turned away furious edgecumbe was a damned worthless timeserver half hopes age hope had as much time as lieutenant to his credit as edgecumbe had time at sea gigs ready sir drinkwater laid the gig alongside galatea he watched his captains spindly legs disappear to a twittering of pipes a face looked down at him moornin lad it was lieutenant collingwood morning sir i see you have clean ducks on today the officer smiled before bursting into a violent and debilitating fit of coughing when he had caught his breath he held out a bundle wrapped in oiled paper i have some mail for cyclops he called i believe theres an epistle from a miss bower elizabeth thank you sir answered the delighted and surprised drinkwater as the bundle was tossed into the boat collingwood began coughing again it was the tuberculosis that a posting to the west indies would shortly aggravate and which eventually killed wilfred collingwood it was his brother cuthbert who became nelsons famous secondincommand elizabeth strange how the mention of her name out here on the heaving grey atlantic had the power to cause his heart to thump in his breast the man at stroke oar was grinning at him he smiled back selfconsciously then he realised the man was threddle in galateas stern cabin hope was sipping a glass of excellent claret but he was not enjoying it sir james edgecumbe his prematurely florid face and popeyes a contrast to hopes thin leathery countenance was trying to be pleasantly superior and only succeeded in being offensive i shall overlook the slackness in acknowledging my signal as due to the quality of your midshipmen captain i had the experience of meeting one of em a snotty boy with filthy garments clearly no gentleman eh captain he snorted a contemptuous laugh that was intended to imply that as captains they had problems only appreciated by other commanders hope bridled at the insult to cyclops wondering who the offending middy had been he said nothing beyond a grunt which edgecumbe took for agreement yes well mdear fella the problem of rank dont you know hope said nothing he was beginning to suspect sir james of having an ulterior motive in summoning him well as i say captain problems of rank and exigencies of the service im not helped by mparliamentary duties either bgod makes mlife in the public service a most arduous task i do assure ye this leads me to a question mdear fella how much food and water have ye about two months provisions i suppose but if youre relieving me i dont see edgecumbe held up his hand ah theres the rub mdear fella im not you see edgecumbe interrupted more wine at least he said slowly in a harder voice an edge of malice in it at least i dont intend to hope swallowed are you trying to tell me something unpalatable sir james edgecumbe relaxed and smiled again yes mdear captain i would deem it a great favour if you would relieve me of a rather odious and fruitless task in fact mdear fella he lowered his voice confidentially i have to be in parliament shortly to support the naval vote and one or two other measures in these times every patriot should do his utmost dont you agree captain and im best serving my country and you brave fellas by strengthening the navy he dropped the sham and the note of menace was again detectable it wouldnt do either of us any good if i missed it now would it hope did not like the inflections in edgecumbes speech he had the feeling he was being boxed into a corner i trust sir james that you will do your utmost to ensure that ships like foudroyant emerald and royal george are properly drydocked edgecumbe waved his hands inconsequentially those are mere details captain hope there are competent authorities in the dockyards to deal with such matters hope bit off an acidic reply as from nowhere the servant of sir james appeared with a new bottle of claret edgecumbe avoided hopes eyes and sorted through some papers he looked up with a smile and held out a sealed envelope lifes full of coincidences eh captain this he tapped the envelope is a draft i believe on tavistocks banking house had a bit of luck with prizes i hear well well my wifes a daughter of old tavistock hes a mean old devil but i expect hell honour an admiralty draft for hope swallowed the contents of his glass he swore mentally righteous indignation was no weapon to use against this sort of thing he wondered how many people had connived to get this little scene to run its prescribed course so that he henry hope should do something unpleasant on behalf of sir james in order that the latter should occupy his seat in parliament or worse perhaps sir james had other reasons for not carrying out his orders hope felt sick and swallowed another glass of claret i presume you have my change of orders in writing sir james hope asked suspiciously although he already knew he would be compelled to accept the inevitable of course did you suspect that i was acting unofficially mdear sir edgecumbes eyebrows were raised in outrage not at all sir james replied hope with perfect honesty only there are occasions when one doubts the wisdom of their lordships edgecumbe looked up sharply hope found the suspicion of treason vastly amusing edgecumbe held out another envelope your orders captain hope he said with asperity and the odious and fruitless task sir james ah breathed edgecumbe reaching for a strong box that had all the while been lurking by his chair in the cockpit the single lantern swayed with cyclopss violent motion its guttering flame cast fitful and fantastic shadows that made reading difficult drinkwater had waited until it was morriss watch on deck he had a vague feeling that if he attempted to read elizabeths letter in his presence it would somehow sully his image of her for although morris had made no attempt to reassert himself as drinkwaters superior nathaniel knew instinctively that morris was playing a waiting game covertly watching his fellow midshipman probing for an opening that he could exploit reading elizabeths letter in his presence would almost certainly afford him some such opportunity drinkwater opened the little package inside was a second packet and a letter the letter was dated a few days after his departure from falmouth my dear nathaniel lieutenant collingwood had just come to say that he believes his frigate will be meeting cyclops early in the new year he came to settle the account for your sic funeral and when father said that it should be borne by your own ship he said he would reimburse himself when he met your captain drinkwater bit his lip annoyed that he had not thought of that himself he read on all of which is a poor way of wishing you well i hope you like the enclosure father tells me you sea officers are inordinately vain of your first commands it was done the morning after your first visit but i did not think it good enough to give you before we have news that we shall move to portsmouth in april and i pray that you will visit us there please god that you are unscathed by battle or disease for i fear your service uses men barbarously as poor lieutenant collingwoods cough testifies the weather had turned now and we expect a miserable winter father says prayers regularly now for the navy now i must conclude in haste for l collingwood is just leaving god bless you ever yours elizabeth drinkwater read the letter four times before opening the packet inside set in a small frame was a tiny water colour it showed a sheet of water set round by green shores and the grey bastion of a castle in the foreground was a ship a little dark schooner with british over yankee colours algonquin he muttered aloud holding the picture to the lantern algonquin off st mawes he tucked the picture safely in the bottom of his seachest scrambled into his hammock and reread elizabeths letter elizabeth wished him safe and well perhaps elizabeth loved him he lay basking in the inner warmth the news gave him a kind of bursting laughter exploded somewhere inside his chest a feeling of superhuman triumph and tenderness welled up within him so that he chuckled softly to himself as cyclops creaked to windward in the gale the month of january was one of almost continuous bad weather in the north atlantic the families of depressions that tracked obliquely across that great expanse of water dashed a french fleet to pieces on the rockgirt coasts of the channel islands two thousand french soldiers had embarked to capture the islands but hundreds perished as their troopships were smashed to bits eight hundred who got ashore at st helier almost succeeded in taking the town until twentysix year old major pearson led a desperate bayonet charge in which the french were routed but the young man lost his life but it was not only the french fleet that had suffered earlier in october of rodneys west indies fleet had been virtually destroyed in a hurricane most of hothams squadron had been dismasted and six ships lost although sir samuel hood was even then proceeding to rodneys aid things were going ill for british arms the situation in north america handled in a dilatory fashion by lord north and lord george germaine had become critical none of the principals were to know it at the time but the combination of the francoamerican armies around an obscure peninsula on the james river in virginia was to prove decisive as lord cornwallis fought his way through the swamps and barrens of carolina with a pathetically small army nathaniel greene opposing him fought and ran fought and ran again slowly exhausting the british who staggered from one pyrrhic victory after another in ever diminishing numbers in gibraltar augustus elliot and his little garrison held out whilst cyclops suffered the battering of the elements herself like a halftide rock topgallant masts were struck and twice the frigate drove off before the wind heading back towards the europe that hope strove to leave astern bound as he was for the coast of carolina life between decks had resumed its dismal round so familiar to the ships company damp permeated every corner until fungi grew freely and men sickened with lassitude and discomfort once again the lash was employed with nauseating regularity the men became surly and the atmosphere thick with discontent in this climate it was not only the spores of floral parasites that flourished such conditions seemed to release the latent energies of midshipman morris perhaps because the ship was less efficiently policed perhaps because in the prevailing environment men were less interested in reminding him of previous humiliation morriss position as the senior midshipman was a puissant one and young white was the chief recipient of morriss unpleasantness no sarcasm was too trifling but the opportunity must be taken to hurt the hapless child for his voice had not yet broken and as yet no hair grew upon his upper lip he was made to fag for morris although the latter was careful not to make this too obvious in either drinkwaters or cranstons presence this treatment served chiefly to terrorise the weak into a cringing obsequiousness that may possibly have served them well if they entered public life but was no training for the officers of a man owar one night black and blue from a beating by morris the unfortunate white had lain unable to sleep tears had come to him and he lay quietly sobbing in the subterranean blackness of the cockpit on deck it had come on to rain drinkwater slipped below for his tarpaulin and found the boy weeping for a moment he stood listening in the darkness then remembering morris discovering him in identical circumstances he went over to the boy whats the matter chalky be enquired softly are you sick nno sir dont sir me chalky its me nat whats the matter nnn nothing nnn nat its nothing it was not very difficult for nathaniel to guess the person responsible for the boys misery but it was a measure of his worldliness that he assumed the crime fouler than mere bullying is it morris chalky the silence from the hammock had an eloquence of its own it is isnt it a barely perceptible yes came out of the gloom drinkwater patted a thin and shaking shoulder dont worry chalky ill fix him thanks n nat the boy choked and as drinkwater crept away he heard a barely audible whisper oh mmm mother returning to duty nathaniel drinkwater received a rebuke from lieutenant skelton for leaving the deck the following day was sunday and after divine service the watch below were piped to dinner drinkwater found himself at mess with morris several other midshipmen were in the cockpit struggling with their salt pork one of them was cranston drinkwater swallowed the remains of his blackstrap and then addressed morris in tones of deliberate formality mr morris as you are senior midshipman in this mess i have a request to make morris looked up a warning sounded in his brain as he recalled the last time drinkwater had uttered such formal words to him although he had scarcely exchanged any word with his enemy beyond the minimum necessary to the conduct of the vessel he regarded drinkwater with suspicion well what is it simply that you cease your abominable tyranny over young white morris stared at drinkwater he flushed then began casting angrily about why the damned little telltale wait till i get hold of him he rose but drinkwater objected he told me nothing morris but im warning you leave him alone ah so you fancy him do you like that fancy tart youve got at falmouth drinkwater hadnt expected that then he remembered threddle in the boat and the letter lying in his seachest for a second he was silent it was too long he had lost the initiative and what will you do mister bloody drinkwater morris was threatening him now thrash you as i did before maintained drinkwater stoutly thrash me be damned you had a cudgel we both had single st drinkwater never finished the sentence morriss fist cracked into his jaw and he fell backwards his head hit the deck morris leapt on him but he was already unconscious morris stood up revenge was sweet indeed but he had not yet finished with drinkwater no a more private and infinitely more malevolent fate would be visited on him but for the present morris was content he had at least reestablished his superiority over the bastard morris dusted himself off and turned to the other midshipmen now you other bastards remember yell get the same treatment if you cross me cranston had not moved but remained seated his grog in his hand he brought the patient wisdom of the lower deck to confound morris are you threatening me mr morris he asked in level tones because if you are i shall report you to the first lieutenant your attack on mr drinkwater was unprovoked and constituted an offence for which you would flog a common seaman i sincerely hope you have not fatally injured our young friend for if you have i shall ensure you pay the utmost penalty the articles of war permit morris grew as pallid as cyclopss topsail such a long speech from a normally silent man delivered with such sonorous gravity gripped him with visceral fear he looked anxiously at the prostrate drinkwater cranston turned to one of the other occupants of the mess mr bennett be so good as to cut along for the surgeon yes yes of course the boy dashed out morris stepped towards drinkwater but cranston forestalled him get out he snapped with unfeigned anger appleby entered the midshipmens berth with a worried bennett behind him cranston was already chafing the unconscious midshipmans wrists appleby felt the pulse what occurred he enquired cranston outlined the circumstances appleby lifted the eyelid mmmmmm lend a hand between them they got drinkwater propped up and the latter held some smelling salts under the patients nose drinkwater groaned and appleby felt around the base of the skull hell have a headache but hell mend another groan escaped drinkwaters lips and his eyelids fluttered open closed and opened again oh god what the easy lad easy youve received a crack on the skull and another on the jaw but youll live you midshipmen get him into his hammock for a little while youll bear witness to this the last remark was addressed to cranston aye if its necessary answered cranston i shall have to inform the first lieutenant it will remain to be seen whether the matter goes further appleby picked up his bag and left devaux regarded the matter seriously he was already aware of some doubt as to the exact nature of midshipman morriss sexual proclivities and though he was ignorant as to the extent morris exerted an influence over certain elements of the ships company he realised the man was a danger with the prevalent sullen atmosphere on board it only needed some stupid incident like this to provoke more trouble with the rapidity of a bush fire one such outbreak led to another and it was impossible to hush such things up the unpunished breach of discipline in the midshipmans mess might lead to god knew what horrors he sought an interview with captain hope he found hope more concerned with their landfall on the coast of the carolinas than with the future of mr midshipman augustus morris do as you think fit mr devaux he said without looking up from the chart now i pray your attention on this chart for a few moments the two men studied the soundings and coastline what exactly is our purpose in making a landfall here sir asked devaux at last hope looked up at him i suppose you had better be aware of the details of this mission since any mishap to myself necessitates the duty devolving upon yourself we are to make a landing here hope pointed to the chart we will rendezvous with a detachment of troops at fort frederic probably the british legion a provincial corps under colonel tarleton an accredited officer will accept the package in my strong box in the package are several millions of continental dollars devaux whistled the continental congress hope continued has already debased the credit of its own currency to such a state that the flooding of the markets of rebel areas will ruin all credibility in its own ability to govern and bring large numbers of the yankees over to the loyalist cause i believe large raids are planned on the virginny tobacco lands to further ruin the rebel economy i see sir mused devaux the two men considered the matter then the younger said it does seem a deucedly odd way of suppressing rebellion sir it does indeed mr devaux decidedly odd but my lord george germaine his majestys secretary for the colonies seems to be of the opinion that it is infallible ha germaine snorted the indignant devaux lets hope he exercises better judgement than at minden hope said nothing at his age youthful contempt was an expenditure of energy that was entirely fruitless he took refuge in silent cynicism germaine north sandwich arbuthnot and clinton the naval and military commanders in north america they were all gods appointed thank you mr devaux thank you sir replied devaux picking up his hat and leaving the cabin morris was below when the first lieutenant summoned him ironically it was white who brought the message sensing no threat from the boy morris swaggered out sir ah mr morris began devaux considerately i understand there has been some difference of opinion between you and your messmates is this so sir well er yes as a matter of fact that is so sir but the matter is settled sir to your satisfaction i presume asked the first lieutenant scarcely able to disguise the sarcasm in his voice yes sir but not to mine devaux looked hard at morris did you strike first well sir i er did you sir did you yes sir whispered morris scarcely audible were you provoked morris sensed a trap he could not claim to have been provoked since cranston would testify against him and that would further militate in his disfavour he contented himself with a sullen shrug mr morris you are a source of trouble on this ship and i ought to break you never mind stretching your neck under the twentyninth article of war morriss face paled and his breath drew in sharply but i shall arrange to transfer you to another ship when we rejoin the fleet do not attempt to obtain a berth aboard any ship of which i am first lieutenant or by god ill have you thrown overboard in the meantime you will exert no influence in the cockpit dye understand morris nodded very well and for now you will ascend the foretopgallant and remain there until i consider your presence on deck is again required chapter thirteen the action with la creole february his britannic majestys gun frigate cyclops was cleared for action leaning to a stiff south westerly breeze close hauled on the port tack to windward the chase was desperately trying to escape as yet no colours had broken out at her peak but the opinion current aboard cyclops was that she was american she had the appearance of an indiaman but cynics reminded their fellows that captain pearson had been compelled to surrender to paul jones in the bonhomme richard she had been an indiaman on his quarterdeck hope silently prayed she would be a merchant ship if so she would prove an easy prey if she operated under letters of marque she might prove a tougher nut to crack what was more important was that hope wished his arrival on the coast to be secret whatever the chase turned out to be hope wanted to secure her devaux urged him to hoist french colours but hope demurred he had little liking for such deceptions and ordered british colours hoisted after a while the chase brailed up his courses and broke out the american flag ah there hes going to accept battle to your posts gentlemen this will be warm work do you likewise with the courses mr blackmore and take the topgallants off her shortened down for the ponderous manoeuvres of formal battle cyclops closed with her enemy in the foretop drinkwater peered under the leech of the foretopsail there was something odd about the ship they were approaching tregembo clap your eyes on yon ship do you notice anything peculiar the cornishman left his swivel and peered to where the enemy vessel lay to seemingly awaiting the british frigate no zur but wait theres siller at her rail no its gone now he straightened up scratching his head did you see flashes of silver aye zur leastways i thought i did drinkwater looked aft cranston in the maintop waved at him and he waved back suddenly making his mind up he swung himself over into the futtock shrouds on the quarterdeck he bumped into morris who was now signal midshipman what the hell are you doing aft hissed morris get forrard to your station pig drinkwater dodged round him and hovered at hopes coat tails sir sir what the devil hope and devaux turned at the intrusion of their vigilant watch on the closing american sir i believe i saw the sun on bayonets from the foretop bayonets by god wheeler too whirled at the military word then he turned again and clapped his glass to his eye briefly visible the sun caught the flash of steel again aye bayonets by god sir hes a company or two there sir damned if he hasnt exclaimed the marine officer youll be damned if he has sir retorted hope so he wants to grapple and board with infantry mr devaux lay her off a little and aim for his top hamper aye aye sir devaux went off roaring orders thank you mr drinkwater you may return to your station aye aye sir lickspittle hissed morris as he passed hopes assessment had been correct the enemy ship had indeed been a french indiaman but was then operating under a commission signed by george washington himself despite her american authority she was commanded by a frenchman of great daring who had been cruising under the rebel flag since the americans first appealed for help from the adventurous youth of europe this officer had on board a part battalion of american militia who though recently driven out of georgia by their loyalist countrymen had recovered their bravado after receiving a stirring harangue from their ally and were now eager to fire their muskets again although hope had correctly assessed his opponents tactics he was too late to avoid them as the two vessels opened fire on one another the enemy freed off a little and bore down towards the british ship as they closed her name was visible across her transom la creole la creoles main yard fouled cyclopss crojack yard and the two vessels came together with a jarring crash the pounding match already started continued unabated despite the fact that the gun muzzles almost touched already the adjacent bulwarks of the two ships were reduced to a shambles and the deadly splinters were lancing through the smoke laden air cyclopss shot had destroyed the enemys two boats on the gratings and the stray balls and resultant splinters were unnerving the militia the french commander knowing delay was fatal leapt on to the rail and waved the americans on his own polyglot crew followed him the tide of boarders swirled downwards over the upper deck gunners and wheeler brought his after guard of marines forward in a line forward present fire they let off a volley and reloaded with the ease of practice spitting the balls into their muzzles and banging the musket stocks on the deck to avoid the time consuming ritual of the ramrod back in the foretop drinkwater discharged the swivel into the throng as it poured aboard he reloaded then turned to find tregembo wrestling with a sallow desperado who had appeared from nowhere looking up drinkwater saw more men running like monkeys along the enemys yards and into cyclopss rigging in the main top cranston was coolly picking off any who attempted to lash the yards of the two ships but men were coming aboard via the topsail yards and sliding down the forestays in a kind of hellish circus act on the maindeck the gun crews continued to serve their pieces occasionally the rammer working at the exposed muzzle would receive a jab from an enemy boarding pike until devaux ordered the ports closed when reloading it slowed the rate of fire but made the men attentive and reduced the risk of premature explosions through skimpy sponging small arms fire crackled above their heads and a small face appeared at lieutenant keenes elbow it was little white sir sir please allow the starboard gun crews on deck sir we are hard pressed keene turned starbowlines he roared boarding pikes and cutlasses the order was picked up by the bosuns mates and the men assisting their mates at the larboard guns ran for the small arms racks around the masts skelton do you take command here keene adjusted the martingale of his hanger on his wrist turning to white he managed a lopsided smile come on young shaver white pulled out his toy dirk starbowlines forrard companionway follow me a ragged cheer broke out barely audible amid the thunder of the adjacent guns but it broke into a furious yell as the men emerged onto the sunlit deck where the melee was now desperate although the attempts of the rebels to enter cyclops through the main deck ports had been repulsed on the upper deck it was a different story the initial shock of the boarding party had carried them well on to the british frigates quarterdeck at the extreme after end wheeler and his marines were drawn into a line loading and firing behind a precise hedge of bayonets after a few sallies the boarders drew back and turned their attention to the forward end where the resistance led by lieutenant devaux was fierce but piecemeal the seamen and officers defending themselves as best they might although the american militia were unsteady troops they fought well enough against the seamen and gradually began to overwhelm the defenders once the americans reached the waist in force they could drop down into the gundeck and their possession of the british frigate was only a matter of time the fighting was fierce a confusion of musketry pistol flashes and slashing blades men screamed with rage or pain officers shouted orders their voices hoarse with exhaustion or shrill with fear and all the while the two ships discharged their main batteries at each other at point blank range in a continuous cacophony of rumbling concussions the smoke of which rolled over the frightful business above poor bennett forced over a gun died of a bayonet wound stewart the masters mate weakened by the consequences of his amorous adventure at falmouth parried the french commanders sword but failed to riposte the frenchman was quicker and stewart too fell in his own gore on the bloody deck from the foretop drinkwater was uncertain of the progress of the fight below since it was obscured by powder smoke between the fore and maintops the threat of aerial invasion via the rigging seemed to have been stemmed when drinkwater heard the yells of keenes counter attack he saw them on the american ship where more men were assembling to attack they sent a case of langridge into the rebel waist men fell dispersed and reassembled drinkwaters gun fired again two rounds left zur tregembo shouted in his ear blast it he shouted back what the hell do we do then dunno zur the man looked below join in down there zur drinkwater looked down the gunfire seemed to have eased and the wind cleared some of the smoke he saw white his dirk flashing shoved aside by an american who lunged at a british warrant officer the masters mate took the thrust on the thigh and the american grimaced as the spurned white stabbed him in the side devaux with his hanger whirling in one hand and a clubbed pistol in the other was laying about himself like a maniac urging on keenes men and the remnants of the upper deck gun crews aft of him drinkwater saw cranston out on the main yardarm cutting away any gear that bound the two ships together of course they must prise cyclops away from the rebel ship we must separate the two ships tregembo aye zur but shem to windard it was true the winds pressure was holding la creoles hull alongside cyclops as efficiently as if they were lashed together drinkwater looked below again and his eyes rested on the anchors earlier in the day devaux had had the hands bending a cable to the sheet anchor as they closed the american coast all they had to do was to let it go the sheet anchor tregembo he shouted excitedly pointing downwards tregembo instantly grasped the idea they both leapt for the forestay the anchor was secured to the starboard fore channels by chain the chains terminated in pear links through which many turns of hemp lashing were passed securing the anchor to the ship snatching out his knife tregembo attacked the stock lashing whilst drinkwater went for that at the crown the shouting screaming mass of struggling men were only feet away from them yet because la creole had come aboard on cyclopss port quarter the focsle was a comparative haven then someone in the privateers tops opened fire with a musket the ball struck the anchor fluke and whined away in ricochet sweat rolled off the two men and drinkwater began to curse his fine idea thinking the seizing would never part his head throbbed with the din of battle and the bruise that morris had given him another ball smacked into the deck between his feet his back felt immensely huge a target the marksman could not fail to hit at the next shot tregembo grunted his seizing parted and the sudden jerk snapped the remaining strands of drinkwaters the anchor dropped with a splash i hope to god the cable runs it did enough at least to permit the anchor to reach the bottom where it bit broke loose and bit again snubbing the two ships round head to the current that runs inexorably north east up the coast of florida and carolina the current pulled each hull but cyclops held her anchor bringing her up against the force of it drinkwater moved aft he was the first to detect a grinding between the ships that told where la creole slowly disengaged herself from her foe shes off lads weve got em one head turned then another then all at once the british rallied seeing over their heads the movement in the enemys ship they took up the cry and with renewed vigour carried on the work of stabbing and cutting their adversaries looking over their shoulders the francoamericans began to realise what was going on the militia were the first to break running and scrambling over friend and foe alike la creole scraped slowly aft catching frequently and only tearing herself finally clear of cyclops after a minute or two sufficient time elapsed for most of her men to return to her for the exhausted british let them go the final scenes of the action would have been comic if they had not occurred in such grim circumstances with the dead and dying of three nations scattered about the bloody deck several men leapt overboard and swam to where their comrades were lowering ropes over the side one of these was the french commander who gesticulated fiercely from the dramatic eminence of the frigates rail before plunging overboard and swimming strongly for his own ship on cyclopss gangway a negro was on his knees rolling his eyes his hands clasped in an unmistakable gesture of submission seeing drinkwater almost alone in the forepart of the ship the negro flung himself down at his feet behind him devaux seemed bent on running him through a devaux with blood lust in his eyes no no massa ah do surrenda sah jus like that genral burgoyne sah ah do surrenda it was wheeler who eventually overcame the first lieutenant and brought him to his senses by telling him the captain wanted him aft the negro thankfully ignored attached himself to drinkwater the two ships were now two cables apart neither of them was in a fit condition to reengage immediately that said captain hope to mr blackmore as they emerged from the defensive hedge made for them by wheeler and his marines that was a damned close thing the sailing master nodded with unspoken relief hope barked a short nervous laugh the devilll have to wait a little longer for us eh blackmore la creole drifted astern cut that cable mister ordered hope when devaux eventually reached him and find out who let the anchor go might i suggest we weigh it sir cut it dammit i want to reengage before he spreads the news of our arrival on the coast devaux shrugged and turned forward hope turned to the sailing master were in soundings then aye sir said the old man recollecting himself make sail well finish that rebel first but la creole was already shaking out her canvas she was to leeward and soon under way fifteen minutes later cyclops was before the wind two and threequarter miles astern of the privateer that was still the position when darkness set in below in the cockpit drinkwater sat having his shoes polished by the negro he was unable to rid himself of the encumbrance and in the aftermath of action no one seemed to bother about the addition to cyclopss complement whats your name he asked fascinated by the ebony features of the man mah name sah is achlles and ah am your serbant my servant said drinkwater astonished yes sah you sabe ma life achlles your best frend chapter fourteen the best laid plans of mice and men march daylight revealed cyclops alone within the circle of her visible horizon la creole had given her the slip and captain hope was furious that her arrival on the coast would now be broadcast he now had no alternative but to execute his orders as speedily as possible he waited impatiently for noon and blackmores meridian altitude when the master had made his calculations he brought the answer to hope our latitude is thirtyfour degrees twelve minutes north sir that is he glanced at his slate that is fortythree miles to the north of our landfall although we shall have to weather frying pan shoals hope nodded very well make the necessary arrangements and be kind enough to attend me with the first lieutenant and er mr blackmore have young drinkwater bring your charts down here when the master reappeared with devaux hope cordially invited them to sit drinkwater spread the charts out on the table between them ah hhmmm mr drinkwater began hope the first lieutenant has informed me that it was you that let go the sheet anchor during the late action with la creole er yes sir i was assisted by tregembo foretopman but i take full responsibility for the loss of the anchor quite so quite so if youll permit me to observe sir broke in devaux it may well have saved the ship hope looked up sharply there was the smallest hint of reproach in devauxs voice but hope had not the energy for anger his glance caught blackmores barely perceptibly the old master shrugged his shoulders hope smiled to himself old men saw things differently quite so mr devaux mr drinkwater i wish to congratulate you on your initiative it is a quality which you appear to possess in abundance i shall do what i can for you and if i fail i am sure mr devaux will prompt me in the meantime i would be delighted if you and mr cranston together with lieutenant wheeler mr devaux and yourself master would join me at dinner who will have the watch mr devaux lieutenant skelton sir very well we had better have keene and of course no dinner aboard cyclops would be complete without an afterdinner speaker in the shape of the surgeon please see to it now mr drinkwater the charts the men bent over the table their bodies moving automatically to the motion of the frigate our destination began the captain is the mouth of the galuda river here in long bay as you observe there is a bar but within the river mouth there is a small fort fort frederic our task is to enter the river pass to the garrison such stores and munitions as they require and to hand a certain package to some sort of agent the details of this are known to mr devaux and need not concern us here hope paused and wiped his forehead he resumed when we close the coast we will send boats in ahead to sound the channel into the anchorage devaux and blackmore nodded to be on the safe side we will clear for action as we enter the river and put a spring on the cable when we anchor i do not intend being here a moment longer than is absolutely necessary for i fear our late adversary will come looking for us with reinforcements hope tapped the chart with the dividers any questions gentlemen devaux cleared his throat if i am not mistaken sir you are as apprehensive of this operation as i am hope said nothing merely stared at the lieutenant i mislike the whole thing sir it has a smell about it i mr devaux bristled hope it is not part of your duties to question orders i imagine their lordships know their business hope spoke with a conviction he was far from feeling his own misgivings lending his voice an asperity that was oversevere but devaux knew nothing of the circumstances of hopes reception of his orders to him hope was no longer the man who had towed the santa teresa off the san lucar shoal the tedious weeks of patrol had wearied him the worry over prizemoney had worn him and he had learned from wheeler how hope and blackmore had taken an abject refuge behind a steel hedge of bayonets in the recent fight devauxs reaction was jaundiced for he too had been subject to the same strains for similar reasons but he saw hope now as a timid old man blindly obeying the orders dished up by a hated tory cabal he mastered his impatience with difficulty events had conspired against him with respect sir why send us to this remote spot to cripple the rebel economy with counterfeit bills blackmore looked up with sudden interest and drinkwater had the sense to remain absolutely motionless hope opened his mouth to protest but devaux ploughed on why not get them through new york where clintons agents must have a clearing house or virginny where the rebel wealth really comes from even new england is better than the carolinas mr devaux i must remind you that what i told you was in confidence but since you lack the self control i had thought to be an attribute of your class i will explain as much for your benefit as for these other gentlemen here and i must ask you to treat the matter with confidence the carolinas are in lord cornwalliss hands mr devaux i assume the notes are for him he is i believe extending operations under major ferguson into the back country where i presume the money is required that is all gentlemen drinkwater left the captain with a profound sense of disquiet he knew his presence had been an embarrassment to captain hope who might have dealt more sharply with the first lieutenant had the midshipman not been there but there was more than the rift between captain and first lieutenant to set his mind working the negro achilles had been telling odd stories in the cockpit stories that did not tally with hopes pat summary of the military situation in the carolinas after some thought drinkwater sought out wheeler and consulted him it was a breach of the captains confidence in him but under the circumstances that appeared to prevail ashore he felt confident in so doing well young shaver wed better go and have a word with your friend what dye say he is your servant he claims the right says i saved his life get him to come up to the gunroom they found achilles to be an intelligent man who had been a plantation slave when the british military authorities offered freedom to any negroes who took up arms against the rebels achilles had forthwith escaped and promptly obtained his release from bondage soon obtaining a post as officers servant to a lieutenant in the rd foot he had been separated from his master at the battle of camden and by an evil fate captured by the son of his former owner who was then a captain in the militia battalion that later embarked in la creole his unique position ready wit and intelligent powers of observation had made him a favourite with the officers of the rd and made him privy to many of their conversations this had given him a reasonably accurate idea of the real military state of south carolina wheeler set about extracting as much information as possible he had little trouble since achilles had a great love of the splendid scarlet soldiers and enjoyed their attention and amusement contrasting their indolent disinterest with his former owners ferocity yes sah dis war is no good sah dere is not enuff ob de reglar sojers in de carolinas sah dat major ferguson he dam fine sojer sah but dey tory milisha all dam trash an no more join afta maj ferguson get kill up on dat ole kings mountn wheeler whistled so the brilliant patrick ferguson was dead the best shot in the british army who had invented a breech loading rifle who fenced with his left hand when he lost the use of his right at the brandy wine had been killed the negro rolled his eyes dolorously what about lord comwallis then achilles he dam fine sojer too sah he lick dat yankee rebel gates and whip him proper at camden gates he ride sixty mile after de battle yeees sah but poor achlles sah ah get the wrong side o sum trees an ah run smack inta mah old bosss son who is mighty mad cos hem running from dey redcoats yes yes achilles youve told us all that but what about his lordship he keep marchin replied the negro sitting bolt upright and making little swinging gestures with his arms an he keep fitin but he nebber stop so de officers ob the twenty third they say he nebber win nuffin what do you mean well sah afta genral gates gone back to dam congress wiv his lil old tail hangin tween his legs they send genral greene down an genral greene he wun dam fine sojer too eben sposin he a rebel cos all de officers of de twenty third say so sah achilles was defensive as if in admiring greene he be thought to sympathise with the rebels then a puzzled look came over his face ah don rightly unnerstand but dat genrl greene he jus don know when he beat he fight then he run then he fight an run agen but he jus don get beat achilles shook his head in incomprehension his eyes rolling expressively ma lord cornwallis he send dat lord rawdon here an dere an he send dat conel tarleton here and dere and dem two fine sojers dey charge up an down the swamp lands tryin for to catch de swamp fox an de gamecock the what queried wheeler grinning in spite of himself dey de names of de rebel raiders sah dam clebber men dey say dey look jus like trees all de time dey nearly get caught by tarleton one two time but always dey scape maybe dey nobody achilles hinted darkly maybe dey voodoo again achilles shook his head and rolled his eyes de war no good for us loylists sah de reglar loylists fight like wild cats sah de reglar redcoat sojers dey fight bettern any dam yankees but dere jus aint enuff sah dats all sah achlles tell you truth sah ebbery word i hear all de officers say dis plenty times sah and de twenty third one dam fine corp of fine fuzileer sah despite the seriousness of his news wheeler could not stifle his laughter at the negro at the end of his monologue achilles had risen to his feet and come stiffly to attention to give due importance to the mention of his majestys royal welch fusileers regrettably this zealous action had ended in sharp contact with the overhead deckbeams which were too low to accommodate the negro at full height his swift reduction to a crouching position caused wheeler and drinkwater to burst out laughing very well achilles and what about you you may volunteer for service in the navy don know nuffin bout no navy sah said achilles with feeling rubbing his bruised head achilles dam fine servant sah well in that case i think you had better attend to me achlles dis gennelmans servant sah he indicated drinkwater loyally wheeler looked at drinkwater i dont know what the hon john will say to that cully i should get him appointed a messman wheeler took the news to devaux who snorted with exasperation when he heard it young nat was pretty perceptive to realise the significance of the niggers intelligence not really said the first lieutenant still angry with hope he tossed off a tankard of flip and wiped the back of his hand across his mouth he was in the cabin when the old man re oh dammit when i blew up and revealed all still perhaps its an ill wind at least my suspicions are confirmed whatll we do devaux thought for a bit then poured another tankard of flip listen wheeler ill raise it conversationally at dinner tonight do you back me up it was inconceivable that the mission should not come up during the meal as the prime subject of conversation the poor quality of the food served to remind them all that they had been pitched across the north atlantic with insufficient provisions for a prolonged stay on the coast indeed it was hope who broached the subject in general terms explaining their presence off the carolinas i still dont see why they had to send a frigate to this desolate destination of ours it doesnt make military naval or any other kind of sense to me opined devaux cautiously seeking to channel the drift of talk but appleby sensing an opening for more expansive dialogue beat hope to the breach drinkwater sat open mouthed at the pedagogic delivery of the surgeon if you will permit me gentlemen to offer an opinion on your preoccupation devaux sighed resignedly and hope could scarcely suppress a smile your naivety does you great credit mr devaux devaux protested nay hear me out i beg it seems to me and with all due respect to captain hope that this operation of ours is a political expedient not a military or naval exercise and therefore if i may say so not so readily comprehensible to you gallant gentlemen of the sword well well thought hope either appleby was psychic or omniscient imagine messieurs it was obviously conceived by a politician who else has been passing coercive acts and playing at warfare with parliamentary statutes why politicians milords north and germaine hatched this one up germaine probably told north this was the very thing to do wouldnt cost much print a few million notes ruin the rebel economy bring congress to its knees no need for more troops no credit to general officers or admirals but and heres the beauty of it brilliant stroke by milordships there was a rumble of appreciation from the officers assembled round the table and lounging back in their chairs you perceive the outline gentlemen the idea hatched by a man cashiered for cowardice after minden but with a skin as thick as hide and a changed name to hide under sackville by god exclaimed wheeler ignoring applebys pun i had clean forgot didnt the king himself strike sackville off the army list with an injunction that he was never to serve again in a military capacity exactly so my dear sir the late king certainly did and what is this creature now why none other than the virtual director of military operations in the americas a continent of which he knows nothing barré does but the government ignores the good colonel burke and foe and chatham realised but nobody took any heed of them so here we are appleby expelled his breath contentedly looking round as if expecting applause you are not quite right about germaine mr appleby appleby frowned and looked round to see who dared to contradict him it was cranston i beg your pardon he said archly lord george germaine might well be exactly what you say but he has as his secretary an american loyalist who is reckoned to be an expert in several fields his name is benjamin thompson pah retorted appleby thompson is his catamite drinkwater had not the slightest notion what a catamite was except that it was clearly something suspect for sniggers and grins appeared on several faces i think mr appleby that cranston has a point hope spoke with quiet authority but appleby was not to be gainsaid i disagree sir so do i sir the facts alone speak for themselves surely thompson if he is the genius he claims to be knows far more damage can be done the rebels by us arriving off charleston or new york devaux tried again to manipulate the conversations direction ah theres the rub dont you see plunged in appleby once again germaine turns to thompson damme benjamin he mimicked germaines reputedly haughty tones i dont like clinton irresolute little fella and that damned traitor arnolds in his suite probably playing a double game best not send the cash there germaine turns to map where shall we send it then benjamin to cornwallis damme never liked his walleyes or his second young rawdon or that dammed knowall ferguson fergusons dead wheeler intoned flatly appleby raised his eyebrows imploringly heavenward at the interruption no no that wont do at all benjamin bring that map nearer now which bit is carolina ah yes well how about there eyes closed appleby stabbed the damask table cloth with his finger then opened them and looked down at the imaginary map that will do fine benjamin see to it for it is now five of the clock and i must to the tables for an hour or twos relaxation picks up hat exeunt appleby sat back at last smirked and folded his hands across his stomach several officers clapped languidly they all smiled smugly with the generous contempt sailors reserve for politicians after all the smiles seemed to say what does one expect hope clearly had to dispel such thoughts from the minds of his men it was an attitude that begot carelessness i find your assessment amusing mr appleby but inaccurate that cyclops had been ordered to carry out a part which to us seems incomprehensible is scarcely a new situation in naval war the whole essence of the naval service is an adherence to orders without which nothing can be achieved sir said devaux slowly and deliberately lieutenant wheeler has interrogated the negro who surrendered from la creole the blackamoor informs us that the carolinas are in a state of utter confusion with no man knowing who has the upper hand lord cornwallis has insufficient troops to do more than hold a few posts and chase the rebels it was enough for hope mr devaux he almost shouted what do you expect a damn nigger to say hes a rebel dye think hes going to tell us were winning but devaux was equally flushed for gods sake hear me out sir he altercated in the first place hes loyalist with papers to prove it and thats no mean achievement considering hes been with the rebels in the second hes a slave freed by ourselves so hardly likely to sympathise with the rebels and voluntarily submit to slavery and in the third hes been batman to a lietitenant in the rd foot and i suppose replied hope sarcastically that you consider all that cast iron proof that every word is true he was really deeply angry now angry with devaux and appleby for voicing the doubts in his own heart angry with himself for submitting so tamely to the blandishments of edgecumbe and the prize money which was not one whit the more use to him on this side of the ocean and angry with the whole system that had created this ridiculous situation time will tell sir which of us is right thats as maybe mister but it will not stop us all doing our duty the captain looked meaningfully round the assembled officers their averted gazes and embarrassed complexions further angered him he rose and the officers scrambled to their feet you mr devaux may take such measures as you see fit in the way of precaution good night gentlemen a screech of chairs and buzz of retreat accompanied the departure of the officers devauxs words rang in his ears time will tell sir which of us is right the trouble was hope already knew drinkwater left the dinner with the uncomfortable feeling that he had witnessed something he should not have done he had hitherto considered hopes position as unassailable and was shocked by devauxs outspoken attack in addition he was surprised at the giggling of some of the dinner guests particularly devaux and wheeler who seemed in some curious way pleased with what they had achieved but perhaps it was the face of blackmore that he remembered most the old mans white hair was drawn severely back and his face passed the midshipman like a kind of fixed figurehead the expression it bore as it passed wheeler and devaux was one of utter contempt drinkwater followed cranston below in the shadows of the orlop an arm reached out and grabbed his elbow his exclamation was silenced by a face with a commanding finger held to its barely visible lips it was sharples what do you want whispered drinkwater unable to shake off the foreboding engendered by the recent conversation somehow the appearance of sharples whom he had ignored for months now came as no surprise beg pardon sir you ought to know i believe threddle and mr morris are hatching something up sir thought you ought to know sir drinkwater felt his arm released and sharples melted away in the shadows drinkwater entered the cockpit so you are back from your dinner at the captains table eh morriss voice was loaded with venom at first drinkwater did not reply then aware that cranston was still in the mess he decided to bait his enemy tell me morris why do you hate me because lickspittle you are less than a dogs turd yet you have been a source of trouble for me ever since you came aboard this ship you are an insufferable little bastard drinkwaters fists clenched and he shot a look at cranston the older man was disinterestedly climbing into his hammock ill call on you for satisfaction when we get to new york for that remark ah but not now eh not so bloody bold without a cudgel are you bit more careful of our pretty face since we got that little whore in falmouth arent we or is it because youre keeping company with the officers now wheelers quite a dandyboy now isnt he drinkwater paled at the allusion to elizabeth but he held his rage he saw cranston sitting up in his hammock making negative motions with his hands morris was working himself up into a violent rage a torrent of invective streaming from him in which he worked through every obscenity known to his fertile and warped imagination drinkwater grabbed his boat cloak and went on deck why dont you shut your filthy mouth morris asked cranston from the shadows but morris did not hear cranston hatred blind and unreasoning hatred burned in his heart with the intensity of fever there could be no justification for such bitter emotion any more than there was explanation for love morris only knew that from thwarted purpose drinkwater had come to represent all that had dogged morriss career ability charm affability and a way of inspiring loyalty in others qualities in which he was lacking morris was a victim of himself of his own jealousy of his sexuality and its concomitants perhaps it was the onset of disease that upset his mental balance or perhaps the bitter fruits of a warped and twisted passion a frustrated love that suffered already the convolutions of selftorture by its very perversity chapter fifteen oft times go astray march april if the ships company of hms cyclops expected a dramatic coastline for their landfall they were disappointed the carolinian shore was low and wooded blackmore the navigator had the greatest difficulty in locating the least conspicuous feature with any confidence in the end the estuary of the galuda river was found by the longboat scouting inshore it was afternoon before the onshore breeze enabled hope to take the frigate into the shoaling waters with confidence leadsmen hove their lines from the forechains on either bow and the longboat a loaded fourpounder in her bow proceeded ahead under lieutenant skelton sounding the channel behind her under topsails spanker and staysails the frigate stood cautiously inshore the galuda river ran into the atlantic between two small headlands which terminated in sandspits these twin extensions of the land swung north at their extremity where the river flow was diverted north by the gulf stream here a bar existed over which the frigate had to be carefully worked once into the estuary the river banks were densely wooded seamed by creeks and swamps as the galuda wound inland just within the river mouth itself the land was a little higher reaching an elevation some thirty feet above high water here the trees had been removed and fort frederic erected it was towards the fort that attention aboard cyclops was directed once the dangers of the bar had been negotiated the serrated stockade rampart was just visible over the surrounding trees no union flag was visible from its conspicuously naked flagpole shall i fire a gun sir enquired devaux no replied hope the tension in the situation blotted out the memory of their former disagreement cyclops crept slowly onwards the leadsmens chants droning on the frigate was abeam of the headlands into the main river slowly the fort drew abeam there was not a soul in sight and the very air was pregnant with the desolation of withdrawal abandoned by god we will bring the ship to her bower mr devaux said the captain ignoring devauxs outburst kindly see to it the longboat was brought alongside and a party of seamen and marines detailed into it drinkwater watched the boat pull away from the ship a small wooden jetty obviously for use by the garrison facilitated disembarkation his hanger drawn wheeler advanced his men in open order drinkwater watched as they ran forward in a crouching lope the seamen followed in a ragged phalanx at the boat the fourpounder covered the assault the occupation of fort frederic was carried out without a shot the fort was empty of men ammunition or provisions of any kind there was not the slightest clue as to where or when the garrison had gone but it had a weird sinister atmosphere about it as some deserted places do it made the stoutest hearts shiver devaux who had commanded the landing party turned to wheeler if hes going to stop here wed better occupy the place wheeler agreed we can put swivels here and er over there my marines can manage will you row a guardboat all the time devaux smiled at the scarletcoated figure gorget glinting in the sunshine wheeler was nervous devaux looked around him this is a bloody business wheeler and i like none of it ill report to hope yes of course well row a guard i wouldnt leave a dog in a place like this wheeler shivered despite the suns heat he was not given to premonitions but he was put in mind of another american river wheeler had lost his father on the monongahela he shook off the oppressive feeling he began shouting orders to hagan and the seamen to put fort frederic into a state of defence cyclops was a ferment of activity as a precautionary measure devaux had her topgallant masts struck down so that they might not appear above the surrounding trees three boat guns and a few swivel guns were mounted in fort frederic of which wheeler losing his earlier misgivings was appointed commandant he embraced the post with enthusiasm and it was not long before properlyappointed sentinels were mounted and patrols were sent out into the surrounding woods wheelers only regret was that hope forbade him to hoist british colours over the fort it is conceivable that we may have to abandon the post in haste i have no wish to appear to surrender a british fort hope explained and with that wheeler had to be content as a precaution against attack from seaward the longboat was sent to cruise on the bar commanded by a midshipman or a masters mate the other boats were variously employed ferrying men and stores ashore after twentyfour hours no contact had been made with friend or foe and hope decided to despatch an expedition inland to reconnoitre a spring had been secured to the frigates cable so that her broadsides might bear on either bank up or down stream but it was from seawards that the captain expected trouble and a lookout was kept at the maintopmast cap from here the longboat was assiduously watched that second evening cyclops had been placed in a defensive position and the final preparations were made by rigging boarding nettings these extended from the ships rails to lines set up between the lower yardarms as the sun set and the red ensign fluttered down from cyclopss stern the sick brought on deck for some air were taken below as the bites of the mosquitoes rendered their position on deck untenable but the insects that infested the forested banks of the galuda river boarded unperturbed the restless moans of the sick and hale as they endured the torment of the biting parasites floated away from the frigate over the twilit water punctuating the sinister stillness of the surrounding foliage thus did cyclops pass two nights waiting for some news of british or loyalist forces the following morning wheeler was relieved of his command to take over the entire marine detachment in support of lieutenant devaux and a party of seamen who were to undertake a probe inland it was a desperate attempt by hope to fulfil his orders if the prophet would not go to the mountain then some attempt must be made to bring the mountain to mahomet thus reasoned the captain as he wiped his perspiring forehead he poured himself a glass of rum grog and walked aft the slick waters of the galuda bubbled under cyclopss stern chuckling round the rudder which moved slightly with a faint creak and soft grind of tiller chains in the corner of his vision he could just see the landing party forming up after disembarking he saw wheeler throw out an advanced picket under hagan and lead off with the rest of the marines in a less precise column he saw midshipman morris follow with a squad of seamen midshipman drinkwater brought up the rear followed by a file of marines under their corporal the head of the column had already disappeared in the trees when he saw devaux after addressing a few final words to keene left as fortcommander look back at the ship then take to his heels in chase of his independent command hope tossed off the rum and looked seawards the longboat was down there under cranston skelton was the only other commissioned officer left on board with a surprising pang of affection he thought anxiously of devaux and the gaudy but competent wheeler he thought idly of young drinkwater so very like himself all those years ago he sighed again and watched the galuda run seawards out to the open sea from whence cometh our help he muttered in silent cynicism to himself drinkwater had little taste for the inland expedition once they had lost sight of the frigate it seemed to him that the whole party was instantly endangered the sea was their element and as if to confirm his worries seamen ahead of him men as nimble as monkeys in the rigging were tripping and stumbling over tree roots and cursing at the squelching morasses that they began immediately to encounter he was also overshadowed by the earnest entreaties of achilles who had refused to come with drinkwater but who impressed upon the midshipman the folly of going inland drinkwater therefore plunged into the forest with his nerves already highly strung with every fibre of his being suspicious of the least faltering of the head of the column of the least exclamation no matter how innocent the cause despite the nature of the terrain the landing party made good progress along the track that led inland from fort frederic about five miles from the fort they came across a cleared area with a saw pit and indications of some sort of logging post there was also evidence that its occupants had made a hurried departure a few miles further on they came across a small plantation with a clapboard house and outbuildings the house had been partially burned and the outbuildings were a mass of flies carrion eaters were feeding on the decomposing corpses of cattle the stink of that burnt out farm seemed to linger with the little column as it made its way through the oppressively empty pine barrens they crossed a creek that drained north into the galuda and set up a bivouac for the night the men were now grumbling in a murmur that soon became an uproar as the mosquitoes began biting devaux had no zeal for this kind of service but wheeler able to assume the unofficial leadership through his military training was revelling in his own element watches were posted and the party settled down to eat what they had brought with them about sunset having ascertained his watch duties for the night drinkwater went off into the surrounding forest to answer a call of nature after the sweaty progress of the day the incessant grumbling of the men and the struggle to keep them going towards the end he was feeling very tired squatting over a tree root he became lightheaded convinced that this was not really him nathaniel drinkwater who squatted thus emptying his bowels god knows how many thousand miles from home he looked down was this soggy mossy undergrowth really the fabulous americas it seemed so illogical as to be impossible as so often happened at such private moments he found his thoughts drifting to elizabeth somehow the image of her was more real than this ludicrous actuality so strongly was he able to fantasise that he seemed to see himself telling elizabeth of how once many years ago he had sat across the roots of a pine tree in somewhat indelicate circumstances in far away carolina thinking of her so disembodied were his instincts that he failed to hear the crack of a dead branch behind him even when morris pitched him forward on his face he did not react immediately only when it dawned on him that he had his face pressed in a mossy hummock and his naked backside revealed to the world did he come to well well what a pretty sight and how very appropriate eh threddle at the sound of that voice and the mention of the name he tried to turn putting an arm out to push himself up but he was too late even as he took his weight a foot came down on his elbow and his arm collapsed almost instinctively he drew his knees up twisting his head round threddle stood on his arm a cutlass in his hand there was a cruel glitter in his eyes and the corners of his mouth smirked what shall we do with him eh threddle morris remained behind him out of sight but drinkwater felt horribly exposed like a mare being steadied for the stallion as if reading his own fear morris kicked him the wave of nausea that spread upwards from his genitals was overwhelming he fought for breath as the vomit emptied from him suddenly he felt threddles hand in his hair twisting his face round so that he faced his own excrement what a very good idea threddle and then we will bugger him eh thatll cut him down to his proper size drinkwater had no power to resist all he could do was clamp his mouth and eyes shut but even as the smell of his own ordure grew stronger in his nostrils the pressure of threddles hand ceased and pulled sideways the big man fell with a squelchy thud what the morris half turned to see in the gathering twilight the figure of a man holding a boarding pike its end gleamed wetly as it was pointed at morris sharples sharples said nothing to morris are you all right mr drinkwater the midshipman rose unsteadily to his feet he leaned against the tree and with trembling fingers buttoned his ducks still not trusting his voice he nodded dumbly morris made a move but ceased as sharples jabbed the point at his chest now mister morris take the pistol out of your belt and no tricks drinkwater lifted his head to watch it was getting quite dark but there was still light enough to see the furious gleam in sharpless eyes no tricks now mister morris i want you to place that pistol at threddles head and blow his brains out the voice was vehemently insistent drinkwater looked down at threddle the pike had pierced his abdomen entering below the rib cage and ripping through the digestive organs he was not dead but lay with blood flowing across his belly and gobbets of gore trickling from his mouth occasionally his legs twitched weakly and the only thing about him that seemed not to be already half dead were the eyes that screamed a silent protest and cry for mercy cock it ordered sharples cock it he jabbed the pike into morriss buttocks forcing the midshipman round to face threddle the click of the hammer coming back sounded in drinkwaters ears he roused himself no he whispered for gods sake sharples no his voice gathered strength but before he could say more sharples shouted fire for perhaps a split second morris hesitated then the boarding pike made his muscles involuntarily contract the pistol cracked and threddles face disintegrated no one moved for perhaps thirty seconds oh my god managed drinkwater at last what the hell have you done sharples the man turned a soft childish smile played around his mouth his eyes were deep pools in the nearnight pools of tears his voice when it came caught on breathless sobs it came in the mail mr drinkwater the mail we got from galtea the letter that tol me my kate was dead they said she died in chilbirth but i know bettern that sir i know bettern that drinkwater mastered himself at last im sorry sharples really sorry and thank you for your help but why did you kill threddle because hes shit sir he said simply morris looked up his face was deathly white he began to walk unsteadily back towards the encampment with a final look at threddle sharples followed then sensing drinkwater lagged behind he turned back it aint no good crying over spilt milk mr drinkwater shouldnt we bury him sharples snorted contemptuously no but what am i to tell the first lieutenant sharples was already tugging him away from the darkening clearing there was the sound of branches breaking underfoot ahead of them they saw wheeler and two marines their white crossbelts glowing in the gathering night close round morris sharples let go of the boarding pike they came up with the others whats going on demanded wheeler looking pointedly at morriss hand which still held the pistol morriss face remained an impassive mask he looked through rather than at wheeler drinkwater came up just a stupid mistake mr wheeler i was emptying my bladder when morris thought i was a rebel sharples was doing the same thing about ten yards away he managed a smile thats right isnt it morris morris looked up and drinkwater felt icecold fingers of apprehension round his heart for morris smiled a ghastly complicit smile if you say so drinkwater and it was only then that drinkwater realised that by explaining their actions with lies he had become a party to the crime at dawn the next morning the camp was astir early with discontent unable to comprehend the seemingly pointless purpose of the march employed outside their own environment and stung into a halfcrazy state the men were now openly mutinous devaux did his best to placate them but lacked conviction for he shared their belief with more justification that their mission was an illconceived waste of time well wheeler he said we may be marching along a fine military road but i see few of the fine military upon it barring your good self of course for my money we may as well retrace our steps before being utterly consumed by these damned bugs here he slapped his face missing the offending insect and presenting a ludicrous spectacle to those near him wheeler considered the matter and a compromise was reached they would march until noon then if they still found nothing they would turn back an hour later they set off out on the bar of the galuda river midshipman cranston served biscuit and water to the longboats crew despite their cramped and aching bodies after a night in the boat the seamen were cheerful cruising offshore there was either a land or sea breeze and the insect life was negligible they looked forward to a pleasant day a yachting excursion comparable with that enjoyed by the wealthy members of the duke of cumberlands fleet it all seemed to have little to do with the rigorous duties of a man owar fitted with a lugsail the longboat cruised with little exertion necessary from her crew lulled into such complaisance it was a rude shock to discern the topgallants of a large vessel offshore cranston put the longboat off before the wind and headed for the galuda estuary he was certain the stranger was la creole the sun had almost reached its zenith when they came upon the mill it was another weatherboard edifice and indicated the presence of human habitation since the farther trail was better cleared and recently trod nevertheless it was deserted despite a partiallyfilled sack of flour and a dumped cartload of indian corn thats been left in a deuced hurry said wheeler pointing to the pile very perceptive said devaux annoyed that just as it seemed he would have his way and return they were going to find people dye think they fled at our approach i dont know said devaux flatly shall we feed the men before proceeding further for i dont like this wheelers confidence was shaken for the first time devaux noted this and pulled himself together he was in command of the party first theyd eat and then decide what was to be done dye attend to it wheeler and a couple of men at the top of the mill will set our minds at ease eh aye aye answered the marine officer biting his lip with chagrin that he had overlooked such a very elementary precaution the men settled to another meal of dried biscuit and water they lay in languid poses scratching themselves and grumbling irritably having posted his sentinels wheeler flung himself down in the shade all morning drinkwater had toiled on in the heat trying desperately to forget the events of the night before but his testicles ached and from time to time the gorge rose in his throat he choked it manfully down and avoided all contact with morris sharples swung along with the seamen a benign smile on his face drinkwater was filled with the overwhelming sense of relief when they lay down in the shade of the mill he closed his eyes and drifted into semiconsciousness then the rebel horse were on them the raiders swept into the clearing in a sudden thunder of hooves and dust and the sparkle of sabres most of the british were caught lying prone surprised in the open the seamen were terrified at the appearance of horses the flying hooves and flaring nostrils were unfamiliar and horrifying to these men who gave their lives without protest in the claustrophobic darkness of a gundeck they defended themselves as best they might stark terror adding to their confusion wheeler and devaux came to their feet blaspheming to me sergeant oh christ jesus to me sergeant damn you the marines began to fight their way through to the base of the mill coalescing in little groups to commence a methodical discharge of musketry the general melee lasted ten long minutes in which a third of the seamen had been cut down and there was scarce a man in the entire force who had not received a cut or graze drinkwater leaped up with the rest he had brought a cutlass with him and lugged it out its clumsy unbalanced blade awkward to his hand a man on a bay plunged towards him drinkwater parried the blow but the impetus of the horse threw him over and he rolled to one side to avoid the hooves a pistol ball raised dust by his head as he struggled to his feet again weakness overcame him and he was filled with the overwhelming desire simply to lie down he rolled on to his back half submitting to the impulse a man ran past him with a musket he dropped to one knee and fired at the horseman now turning to make another pass it was sharples he discharged the musket and half dragged drinkwater closer to the mill the horseman swerved and rode off to attack four seamen fighting back to back and already going down before the slashing sabres drinkwater got to his feet he saw devaux and wheeler with a group of men forming a defensive group he pointed and sharples nodded suddenly another man had joined them it was morris he pushed drinkwater who staggered back against the mill sharples turned and thrust the barrel of his musket between them morris fired his pistol and sharples doubled over a great hole in his chest drinkwater was dazed his vision blurred he comprehended nothing another horseman rode up and slashed at them morris turned away running round the corner of the mill the horseman followed drinkwater took one brief look at sharples he was dead he looked up again the little group round the two lieutenants had grown in a blind panic he put down his head and ran dodging among the whirling sabres and stamping horses legs with animal instinct the rebel cavalry had played out their advantage of surprise used as they were to attacking lonely farms or ambushing parties of raw tory militia the horsemen were used to speedy and uncontested victory having fought the intruders for some minutes the surviving seamen steadied devaux was among them his teeth bared in a snarl of rage they began to rally their cutlasses slashing back at the horses or the riders thighs concentrating on the bright red spot which through the swirling dust marked where the marines were forming a disciplined centre of resistance the american officer felt his squadrons will to fight was on the ebb seeking to rally his force he yelled out tarletons quarter my lads give the bastards tarletons quarter this reference to the leader of the british legion a force of loyalist americans under british officers who let not a rebel escape them if they could help it had its effect and they renewed their attack but the resistance of the british was now established and the americans gradually drew off reining in their steaming horses just out of short musket range slowly the dust subsided and the two contending parties glared at each other across a nomansland of broken bodies and hamstrung horses then the enemy wheeled their mounts and vanished into the trees as swiftly and silently as they had come the news of the arrival of la creole off the galuda came as no surprise to hope on receiving cranstons intelligence the captain ordered skelton to the mainmast cap to watch the enemy privateer it was with some relief that the lieutenant reported that la creole had stood offshore towards the late afternoon thus buying valuable time for the british why she had done so hope could only guess possibly the enemy commander wanted time to make preparations perhaps he did not think he had been observed and wished to make his attack the following day perhaps and hope hardly dare believe this perhaps cyclops had not been spotted and la creole was working her patient way southward still searching at all events the captain was too old a campaigner to worry when fate had dealt him a card he did not expect the appearance of la creole enabled him to make up his mind in one direction he would recall devaux and the landing party immediately the indecision that had manifested itself earlier and annoyed devaux was gone now for it had been caused not by senility but lack of faith in his orders hope ordered the garrison of fort frederic to be withdrawn and the frigates defences strengthened against a night boat attack at a conference of officers he called for a volunteer to take the message of recall to devaux the pitifully small group of officers regarded the silent forest visible through the stern windows with misgiving ill go said cranston at last well done mr cranston i shall endeavour to do everything possible for you for such a service will no one else support mr cranston theres no need sir ill take the blackamoor very well you may draw what you require from the purser and small arms from lieutenant keene good luck to you the officers shuffled with relief at cranston filling such a dangerous office when they had gone hope poured himself a glass of rum and wiped his forehead for the thousandth time that day ill be bloody glad when devaux and wheeler get back i pray heaven theyre all right he muttered to himself the landing party reached their bivouac of the previous night dragging with them the remnants of their expedition the men collapsed on the banks of the creek to bathe their wounds or drink the bloody water the badly injured groaned horribly as the mosquitoes renewed their assaults and several became delirious during the night drinkwater slept badly although unwounded beyond a bruised shoulder from the flat of a sabre and the endemic scratches collected on the way the heat fatigue and events of the preceding hours had taken their toll he had marched from the mill in a daze his mind constantly fastening unbidden on images of threddle lying dead in the gloaming and sharples stiff with blackened blood in the heat of noon between these two corpses floated morris morris with a pistol still smoking in his hand morris with the smile of triumph on his face and worst of all the superimposition of morris over his image of elizabeth he fought hard to retain her face in his minds eye but it faded faded beyond recall so that he thought he might go mad in this forested nightmare through which they trudged and when night came there was no rest for the mosquitoes reactivated the exhausted nervous system constantly recalling to wakefulness the mind and the body that only wished to sleep death thought nathaniel at that midnight moment would be a blessed relief wheeler too slept little he constantly patrolled his outposts apprehensive lest the enemy renew their attack on the sleeping men he shook his head sadly as a grey dawn revealed the encampment the men were tattered their limbs scarred and gashed by briars and branches dried blood blackening improvised bandages and flies settling on open wounds several of the wounded were delirious and devaux ordered litters improvised and an hour after dawn the party moved off resuming its painful march at midmorning they found cranston and achilles the negro had been tied to a tree and flayed alive his back was a mass of flies hagan himself badly wounded limped forward and cut the body down achilles was still alive his breath coming in shallow gasps cranston had evidently put up a fight he had been hanged from a tree but it was obvious he had been dead before the rebels strung him up or at least devaux hoped so scarce a man there refrained from vomiting at the sight of the mutilation inflicted on cranstons body devaux found himself wondering if the man had a wife or a mistress and then he turned away wheeler and hagan laid the negro gently on the ground brushing the flies from his face devaux stood beside him and touched his shoulder wheeler stood up bastards he choked achilles opened his eyes above him he saw the scarlet coat and gold gorget his hand moved slightly in salutation before dropping back in death the two officers had the midshipman cut down and crudely buried with the negro then the column pressed on in the evening they emerged from the forest and staggered down to the landing jetty wheeler could raise no protest when he saw no men in the little fort and devaux felt relief flood through him relief from the tension of independent command and relief that very soon he would see the comfortable old face of henry hope all nathaniel drinkwater saw was the frigate dark and strangely welcoming in the twilight and he waited impatiently for the boat to ferry him off are you all right nat it was little white sunburned and bright from new responsibility drinkwater looked at him it did not seem possible that they belonged to the same generation wheres cranston asked white drinkwater raised a tired arm and pointed at the surrounding forest dead in the defence of his majestys dominions he said aware that cynicism was a great relief with his bollocks in his mouth somehow he found whites shocked look amusing chapter sixteen the cutting out april if the remnants of the landing party expected rest after their labours they were to be disappointed after a bare three hours exhausted sleep several found themselves rowing a guardboat cautiously down stream to prevent a surprise attack by la creole or her boats hope was especially concerned since he had seen the enemy stand southwards although he could not know it la creole had missed cyclops in her search but the last of the onshore breeze the next afternoon brought her back an hour before sunset she had anchored on the bar there was no longer any doubt that she had found her quarry the twentyfour hours that had elapsed since the return of the landing party had proved tiring and trying for all without exception the members of the expedition had about them the smell of defeat and their low morale affected the remaining men the immediate failure of the mission was forgotten in the urgent necessity of alleviating the sufferings of the wounded and preparing the frigate for sea the topgallant masts were rehoisted and the upper yards crossed it may well have been this that discovered her to la creole but no one now cared action was infinitely preferable to lying supinely in the stinking junglesurrounded galuda a moment more than was necessary appleby and his mates worked harder than anyone else patching up the walking wounded so that they might man their guns again or easing the sufferings of the badly wounded with laudanum the time passed for drinkwater in a daze outwardly he carried out his duties with his customary efficiency when the roll was called he answered for sharples having been killed at the mill when threddles name was called his mouth clamped shut his eyes swivelled to morris the enigmatic smile still played around the mouth of his adversary but morris said nothing strain and fatigue continued to play havoc with drinkwaters nerves as the day wore on until when the news of the arrival of la creole on the bar spread rapidly through the ship he seemed to emerge from a tunnel he had found his second wind morris was just morris an evil to be endured achilles had been a brief and colourful intrusion into his life and was so no more cranston was dead just that dead and threddle threddle was discharged dead too killed in action at the mill or so the ships books said it was only when he received the summons to attend the captain however that his mind received the final jerk that returned him to sanity as he entered the cabin in company with all the other officers he found himself standing next to morris it came to him then the awful truth the fact that his numbed mind had automatically excluded in its pain sharples had not died in action sharples had been shot down in cold blood under the cover of action and the man next to him had done it well gentlemen hope looked round the ring of tired yet expectant faces they were all here the welcome features of devaux and wheeler the careworn lined face of old blackmore the younger keene and youthful skelton behind the commissioned officers the mature warrant officers the gunner the bosun and the carpenter and the eager yet apprehensive faces of his midshipmen and masters mates well gentlemen it seems our friend has returned i suspect with reinforcements i imagine he will attempt a cutting out so i am not intending to warp the ship round if we see la creole approaching then we shall have to do so and for that eventuality the spring is already rigged but i do not foresee this the wind during the night will be offshore and therefore favour an attack by boats i have a mind to bait a trap and for that purpose have summoned you all here moonset is about two oclock we may therefore expect his boats soon after in order that having taken us here hope looked round and swept what he believed to be a sardonically inspiring grin around the company he may carry the terral to sea a little shuffle among the officers indicated a stirring of interest hope breathed a silent sigh of relief now gentlemen this is what i intend that we should do cyclops settled down to await the expected attack the hands had been fed and the galley fire extinguished the men had been told off to their stations and the most elaborate dispositions made apart from a watch the hands were for the time being ordered to rest on their arms anxious to stimulate the morale of his crew hope had accepted several suggestions for improvisation in the frigates defence of these the best had been suggested by wheeler cyclopss two largest boats were hoisted by the yardarm tackles fitted to the extremities of the fore and main yards by this means the boats were slung outboard of and higher than the frigates sides in each boat a party of the ships best marksmen lay hidden awaiting the order to open fire upon the anticipated boarders as they scrambled up cyclopss sides the lower deck gunports were all secured and the hands issued with small arms an hour after moonset the faint chuckle of water under a boats bow was heard from downstream peering intently from the stern cabin windows devaux touched hopes arm here they come sir he whispered he turned to pass word forward but hope held him back good luck mr devaux hopes voice cracked with age and emotion devaux smiled in the darkness good luck to you sir he replied warmly the first lieutenant slipped through into the gundeck passing a whispered warning to the men stationed there emerging on to the upper deck he ordered the men to lie down in a crouching position he moved up one side and down the other at each post he found the men waiting eagerly drinkwater was one of the party waiting in the forward gundeck commanded by lieutenant skelton their task was to counter attack once the enemy had boarded in the manner that had been so successfully used in the previous action up on the focsle omalley the irish cook scraped a melancholy air on his fiddle and several men sang quietly or chatted in low voices as might be expected from a casually maintained anchor watch the boats came alongside at several points faint grunts and bumps told where they secured devaux waited a hand reached over the rail and grasped the hammock netting another followed one groped upwards and a moment later a knife was sawing through the boarding netting another followed another hand came over the opposite rail it was followed by a head now bellowed devaux expelling his pent up breath in one mighty roar that was taken up by the waiting seamen the tension burst from them in smoke flame and destruction fifty or sixty twelvepound cannon balls were dropped overside to plummet down through the bottoms of la creoles boats from her own boats suspended high above cyclopss marksmen opened a lethal fire on the invaders this desperate refinement quickly cleared the frigates sides from the deck too a withering fire was poured down at the hapless privateersmen now struggling in the river aft the attacks had been driven off with similar success hope looked round he was suddenly aware that his ship was swinging her head falling off from pointing up river someone forward had cut cyclopss cable and instinct prompted hope to stare over the stern searching in the darkness for the spring shouting anxiously for blackmore to get sail on the ship he sprung himself for the wheel in case the spring parted and the ship was in danger of going aground forward the rebels had had more success than the mere severing of the frigates cable having driven a boat in under cyclopss figurehead where access was comparatively easy via the bowsprit rigging and the foretack bumpkins twenty or thirty men had gained access to the deck under an enterprising officer and a fierce hand to hand engagement now took place several of the privateersmen were engaged in turning one of the bow chasers inboard along the length of cyclops the situation became critical and devaux shouted for skeltons reserve hearing the shouts and screams from above lieutenant skelton was already on his way leading the counter attackers out of the stygian gloom of the gundeck behind him drinkwater drew his dirk and followed on the focsle the french privateer officer was achieving a measure of success his men had swung the starboard bow chaser round and were preparing to fire it he was determined to destroy the british frigate if he could not take her if he could force her aground and fire her already she was head downstream it occurred to him that she should be broadside on he turned to shout orders to two men remaining in the boat to bring combustibles on board then he swung round to rally his men for a final attempt to secure the upper deck in the wake of the bow chasers discharge a british lieutenant appeared in front of him leading a fresh body of men that had appeared from nowhere the lieutenant slashed at the frenchman but before skeltons blade even started its downward path the latter executed a swift and fatal lunge hélas he shouted skelton reeled backwards carrying with him two seamen coming up behind the french officers eyes gleamed in triumph and he turned to order his men to discharge the cannon tirez a thin youth confronted him the frenchman grinned maliciously at the dirk his opponent held he extended his sword arm drinkwater waited for the lunge but the other recovered and the two stood for a second eyeing each other the frenchmans experience weighed the midshipman he lunged skeltons blood flowed freely across the deck the french officer slipped as drinkwater half turned to avoid the blade the sword point raised involuntarily by his opponents loss of balance caught his cheek and ripped upwards deflected out of the flesh by the cheekbone drinkwater had gone icy cold in that heartbeat of suspension he already knew he had his man as his fencers instinct told him the other was losing his balance now the sting of the wound unleashed a sudden fury in him he stabbed blindly and savagely giving the thrust impetus by the full weight of his body the dirk passed under the mans biceps and buried itself in his shoulder piercing the right lung the frenchman staggered back recovering his balance too late dropping his sword blood pouring from his wound drinkwater flung away the dirk and grabbed the fallen sword it leapt in his hand balanced exquisitely on the lower phalange of his forefinger he threw himself into the fight screaming encouragement to the seamen struggling for possession of the deck in twenty minutes it was over by then cyclops had brought up to her spring and drinkwater the only officer left standing forward was joined by devaux and they began securing the prisoners instead of travelling slowly downstream beam on the frigates spring had the effect of reanchoring her by the stern since it was led out of an after gunport and secured to the anchor cable below the cut this fortuitous circumstance permitted hope to set the topsails so that the vessel strained at her anchor as the sails bellied out to the terral drinkwater hurried aft touching his forehead all the boarders secured sir what orders hope looked astern he could make out the splashes of men struggling in the water and the taut spring rising dripping with water from the tension on it devaux hurried up get those boats cut down and you drinkwater get the spring cut the two ran off mr blackmore sir take the conn have a man in the chains and a quartermaster back at the wheel pass word to the leadsman that i want the soundings quietly hope emphasised the last word as keene came up work round the deck mr keene not a word from anyone anyone do you understand aye aye sir drinkwater ran up again spring cut sir he reported well done mister hope rubbed his hands gleefully like a schoolboy contemplating a prank im going out after that fella mister drinkwater he confided pointing ahead to somewhere in the darkness where la creole awaited them shell be expecting us under her cutting out party well give em a surprise eh cully hope grinned aye aye sir now run off and find devaux and tell him to man the starboard battery and have topmen aloft oh and men at the braces drinkwater ran off with his message blackmore was letting the wind and current take the frigate downstream trusting that the run of water would serve her best as the ship cleared the wooded headlands he adjusted the course and trimmed the yards drinkwater was ordered forward to keep a lookout for la creole he strained his eyes into the night small circles danced in his vision he elevated his glance a little from the horizon and immediately on the periphery of his retina a darker spot appeared to starboard he clapped the battered glass to this eye it was la creole and at anchor too he raced aft shes two points to starboard sir and at anchor very well mr drinkwater then to blackmore starboard a point blackmores voice answered starboard a point sir by my reckoning you are just clear of the bar very well mr drinkwater get a cable on the second bower cyclops slipped seawards la creole was just visible against the false dawn hope intended to cross la creoles stern rake her and put his helm down as he turned to starboard and ran alongside the enemy ship he would anchor it was his last anchor except for the light kedge and it was a gamble he explained to his principal officers what he intended drinkwater found two bosuns mates and a party of tired seamen hauling an eightinch rope up to the ring on the second bower the two ships were closing fast hurry it up there he hissed between clenched teeth the men looked up at him sullenly after what seemed an interminable delay the cable was secured returning to report the anchor ready drinkwater passed the prisoners in the haste they had been trussed up to the foremast bitts and a sudden thought occurred to him if these men shouted a warning cyclopss advantage would be lost then another idea came to him he ordered the marine sentries to herd them below all of them except the french officer who lay groaning on the deck drinkwater still had the mans sword in his hand he cut the rope securing the man to the bitts up mister he ordered merde growled the man drinkwater pointed the sword at his throat up the man rose reluctantly to his feet swaying with dizziness the midshipman prodded him aft he ordered the last marine to go below to slit the throat of the first man that so much as squealed afterwards his own ruthless barbarity surprised him but at the time it seemed the only logical thing to do under the uncompromising prompting of a desire to survive he arrived on the quarterdeck what the devil queried a startled hope to be reassured by a sight of his own midshipman a drawn sword in his hand behind the frenchman anchors ready sir i thought this fella would help allay any suspicions sir shout to the enemy sir tell em the ships his an excellent idea drinkwater speaks english eh must do with that polyglot rebel crew probably uses french with his commander prick him a little sir said the captain the man jerked hope addressed him in english his voice uncharacteristically sinister and brutal now you dog i have an old score to settle with your race my brother and my sisters husband died in canada and ive an unchristian hankering for revenge you tell your commander that this ship is yours and youll anchor under his lee no tricks now ive the best surgeon in the fleet and hell see to you youve my word on that but here hope looked significantly at drinkwater and paused but one false word and its your last dye understand canaille the man winced again oui he nodded breathing through clenched teeth drinkwater shoved him to the main chains hope turned away pass the word to mr devaux to have the gun crews stand by on the command i want the ports opened and the guns run straight out and fired aye aye sir a messenger ran off cyclops was less than one hundred yards off la creole now crossing her stern from starboard to larboard a hail came from the big privateer very well mr drinkwater prompt our friend the frenchman drew a breath ça va bien je suis blessé mais la frégate est prise a voice replied across the diminishing gap between the two ships bravo mon ami mais votre blessure the french officer shot a glance at drinkwater and took a deep breath affreuse a la gorge there was a moments silence then a puzzled voice la gorge mon dieu a shout of realisation came from la creole hope swore and the frenchman his left hand to his chest where his punctured lung gave him great pain turned triumphantly to drinkwater but the midshipman could not kill him in cold blood indeed he only half comprehended what had transpired but events now moved in rapid succession so that drinkwaters dilemma was short lived the french officer slumped to the deck in a faint as la creoles people ran to their guns a gust of wind filled cyclopss topsails so that she accelerated a little and suddenly the privateers stern was drawing abeam now devaux now by god the ports opened there was a terrible squealing rumble as the starboard battery of twelvepounders were run out then the concussion of the broadside overwhelmed them all rocking the frigate in the darkness of the gundeck keene and devaux were leaping up and down with excitement and a fighting madness they had double shotted the guns and topped off the charges with canister the devastation thus inflicted upon la creole almost destroyed her resistance at a blow as the guns recoiled inboard cyclops swung to starboard her impetus carried her alongside la creole and a further broadside smashed into the exindiamans hull a few bold souls aboard the american fired back and the engagement became general though all the advantage lay with the british drawing a little ahead cyclops lost way her anchor was let go and her sails clewed up veering the cable cyclops settled back and brought up on la creoles larboard quarter for twenty dreadful minutes the british poured shot after shot into her aboard the american ship men died bravely they got eight guns into action and inflicted some damage on their opponent but in the end lying in his own gore his ship and crew a shambles around him the french commander ordered his ensign struck and an american officer complied the pale light of dawn revealed to hope the limp bunting lying across the jagged remnants of what had once been a handsome carved taffrail and he ordered his cannon to cease fire later in the morning drinkwater accompanied his commander aboard the enemys ship captain hope did not consider her worth taking as a prize his depleted crew were barely enough to guard the prisoners and work cyclops the rebel ship had been old when the americans commissioned her and the damage that she suffered at the hands of cyclopss gun crews had been frightful drinkwater gaped at the desolation caused by the frigates broadsides the planking of her decks was ripped up furrowed by ball and canister into jagged lines of splinters reminiscent of a field of petrified grass several beams sagged down into the spaces below and cannon were knocked clean off their carriages trunnions had been sheered and three had had their cascabels cut off as if with a knife scattered about all this destruction were petty items of personal gear a mans stocking hat a shoe a crucifix and rosary beads a clasp knife and a beautifully painted chest split to fragments grimmer remains of what had once been men lay in unseemly attitudes and splashes of vivid colour dried blood was dark beside the ochreous pools of vomit the stark white of exposed bone the blue of bled flesh and the greens and browns of intestines it was a vile sight and the hollow eyes of the surviving members of the crew regarded the british captain with a dull hatred as the author of their fate but hope with the simple faith of the dedicated warrior returned their gaze with scorn for these men were nothing but legalised pirates plundering for profit destroying merchant ships for gain and visiting upon innocent seamen a callous indifference to their fates the captain ordered out of her such stores as might serve the frigate and had combustibles prepared to fire her lieutenant keene boarded la creole at sunset to ignite her as the offshore terral began to blow seawards cyclops weighed her anchor la creole burned furiously a black pall rolling seawards away from the coast of that benighted land cyclops was standing well off shore when la creoles magazine exploded an hour later she altered course for cape hatteras and new york chapter seventeen decision at the virginia capes april october the weather was once more against them off the dreaded cape they met a gale of unbelievable ferocity which tried the gear severely the main topgallant mast went by the board and took with it the fore and mizen topgallants during this blow the wounded were of course confined below the cockpit was a scene of utter degradation the filth in the bilge was augmented by the water made by the straining frigate as she laboured in the seaway and the whole slopped about the bottom of the ship driving the rodent population higher the rats ran almost unchecked over the bodies of the dying who retched and urinated without relief for die they did scarce a man who received anything more trivial than a scratch escaped gangrene or blood poisoning of one kind or another drinkwater was one of the fortunate few his cut a superficial one was disfiguring rather than dangerous appleby sutured it for him an appleby who had lost much rotundity and whose pitifully few medicines were exhausted as he fought disease and sepsis with his own diminishing energies at last utterly worn with fatigue and exasperation he wept angry and frustrated tears in the darkness of his hellish kingdom hope buried the bundles in their hammocks six one day nine another as the wind howled the frigate bucked and the spray drove inboard in hissing sheets the burial service became curtailed into the briefest formality although the weather was poor it allowed cyclops to limp north undetected for she was in no condition to fight in addition to the heavy losses incurred at the galuda river the ships company now had to subsist on rotten stores opening the last casks of salt provisions copping the purser had discovered the usually tainted pork was uneatably putrid and the misery of cyclopss company immeasurably increased at last she made her number to the guardship at sandy hook and in company with the members of the north american squadron let go her anchor in the hudson river for the last months of effective british rule in any part of her thirteen colonies his britannic majestys frigate cyclops lay passive arriving at new york on the last day of april she lay in the mouth of the hudson without positive orders beyond the general directive to effect repairs to her fabric admiral arbuthnot did not appear to take a great interest in her arrival as she was not on the establishment of the north american station indeed he seemed rather offended that she should make her appearance anywhere in his command without his receiving prior notice and visited his displeasure on captain hope whom he greeted with icy politeness secretly angry that he had ended up between two stools hope claimed his mission had been confidential but when challenged as to its success was compelled to report failure his explanation was received with disbelief the admiral firmly maintaining the carolinas were in british hands hope also wished to rid himself of the continental currency but this was too much for admiral arbuthnot who studied the captain through rheumy eyes you arrive on my station sir occupy a british post without authority fail in a mission you claim is secret yet was given you by the captain of a frigate and now you wish me to rid you of an embarrassing sum of rebel currency the admiral rose you may retain the stuff until you report to yr own flag officer admiral admiral kempenfelt sir exactly arbuthnot appeared to consider the matter closed but sir i have to refit my togallants your topgallants sir are your topgallants and not mine i suggest you contact admiral kempenfelt on the matter good day sir hope left eventually arbuthnots secretary received instructions from london to render such assistance as might be necessary to the frigate galatea a note was appended to the effect that due to political circumstances of the greatest importance galatea had been retained in home waters and her mission undertaken by cyclops captain henry hope rn the secretary therefore prepared an order for her to come in and draw such stores as she required and refit her gear arbuthnot signed the order without comment since he was at that time prone to sign almost anything being nearly blind on receipt of these orders cyclops moved to a berth at the manhattan dockyard to commence her repairs on that evening hope and devaux dined together over their port several cases of which had been removed from la creole hope drew devauxs attention to a decision that the weather and the frigates cranky tophamper had deferred assuming that we eventually receive definite orders devaux we have to consider the matter of a replacement for skelton cranston was a loss to us and the service as a whole yes agreed devaux nodding his mind slid back to the dense forest and the sight of cranstons mutilated body he tore his mind away from the grisly memory dye have any opinions asked the captain the first lieutenant recollected himself well sir the next senior is morris his journals are poorly kept though hes served the six years i consider him quite unsuitable and i would appreciate his removal from the ship indeed i threatened him with it i seem to remember i am of the opinion that young drinkwater is a likely candidate for an acting lieutenancy he paused but surely sir theres a junior in the fleet hereabouts devaux indicated the riding lights of several warships visible through the stern windows an admirals favourite dye mean mr devaux asked hope archly just so sir but admiral arbuthnot informed me that the ship is under kempenfelts flag who am i to question his decision he enquired with mock humility and then in a harder tone besides i am not disposed to question him on the matter of my midshipmen he sipped his port furthermore i submitted a list of casualties that clearly indicated the state of our complement of officers if he does not see fit to appoint someone he can go to the devil he paused besides i rather suspect kempenfelt would approve our choice hope smiled benignly and tossed off the glass devaux raised an eyebrow old blackmore will be pleased hes had drinkwater under his wing since we left sheerness the two officers refilled their glasses which said devaux choosing his moment brings me to the matter of morris sir id be obliged if a transfer could be arranged that is a little drastic is it not mr devaux whats behind this request devaux outlined the problem and added the remark that in any case morris would resent serving under drinkwater hope snorted resent why ive resented serving under half the officers ive submitted to but morris is fortunate mr devaux had i known earlier id have broken him another time ill trouble you to tell me as soon as you have any inkling of this kind of thing its the bane of the service and produces officers like that loathsome edgecumbe hope added expansively yes sir devaux changed the subject hastily what are the admirals intentions sir again hope snorted intentions i wish he had some why he and general clinton sit here in new york waving the union flag with enough soldiers to wipe washington off the face of the earth clinton shits himself with indecision at the prospect of losing new york and saves face by sending general philips into virginny however i hear that arbuthnots to be relieved who by sir graves good god not graves hes a pleasant enough man which is more than i found arbuthnot hes an amiable incompetent sir wasnt he courtmartialled for refusing battle with an indiaman yes back in fiftyseven no fiftysix he was acquitted of cowardice but publicly reprimanded for an error of judgement under the th article of war you must admit some indiamen pack a punch both officers smiled ruefully at memories of la creole dye know john its one of the great ironies that on the very day the court at plymouth sentenced tommy graves a court at portsmouth got john byng for a similar offence which was far more strategically justifiable you know what happened to byng they sentenced him under the th article he was shot on his own quarterdeck hopes voice trailed off pour encourager les autres muttered devaux voltaire sir he said in explanation as hope looked up ah that godless french bastard does anyone know whats happened to cornwallis sir hope stirred no i dont believe any of em know anything john now what about my main togallant the next morning devaux sent for drinkwater the lieutenant was staring north up the hudson river to where the new jersey palisades could be seen catching the early sunlight sir devaux turned and regarded the young man the face had matured now the ragged line of the wound rapidly scarring would hardly alter the flesh over the cheekbones though it might contrast the weathered tan the figure beneath the worn and patched uniform was spare but fit devaux snapped his glass shut that hanger you had off la creoles lieutenant dye still have it drinkwater coloured at the end of the action he had found himself still clasping the small sword it was a fine weapon and its owner had not survived long after the capture of his ship drinkwater had regarded the thing as his own part of the spoil after all the gunroom officers wallowed in the captured wine for weeks afterwards and he felt the weight of a dirk too useless for real fighting the sword had found its way to the bottom of his seachest where it lay wrapped in bunting he did not know how devaux knew this but assumed that omniscience was a natural attribute of first lieutenants well sir queried devaux a note of asperity in his voice er yes siri er do have it then yed better clap it on yre larboard hip beg pardon sir the young man frowned uncomprehendingly devaux laughed at drinkwaters puzzled expression the captain is promoting you acting third lieutenant as of now you may move your chest and effects up on to the gundeck he watched the effect of the news on drinkwaters face the lads mouth dropped open then closed he blinked then smiled back at last he stammered his thanks cyclops lay at her anchor with arbuthnots squadron through may and june during this time drinkwaters prime task was to get a new broadcloth coat from a new york tailor the ship had recruited its complement from the guardships but there was little for the men to do then on th july things began to happen admiral graves arrived a kind generous but simple incompetent who was to be instrumental in losing the war then rodneys tender swallow arrived with the intelligence that admiral de grasse had left the west indies with a french fleet bound for the chesapeake graves chose to ignore the warning despite its significance since may lord cornwallis had abandoned the carolinas and was combining his force with general philipss in virginia if cornwallis had de grasse sitting on his communications with new york he would be cut off captains and officers had themselves rowed about the fleet while they grumbled about their admirals failure to grasp the simplest strategic facts cornwallis was retreating to the sea for the navy to support him but the navy was in new york once again the opinion was expressed that in executing byng their lordships had taken more leave of their senses than was usual they had shot the wrong man another message arrived via pegasus that urged graves to sail south and join sir samuel hood to whom rodney had relinquished command through ill health but the fleet remained supinely at anchor at the beginning of august clinton decided to act not against virginia but against rhode island where french troops and men owar were based admiral graves ordered a number of ships down to sandy hook in preparation one of these was cyclops it was at this time that midshipman morris left the frigate when cyclops left the galuda her ships company were hard put to fight the elements guard their prisoners and simply survive the remaining lieutenants were on watch and watch with the mates and midshipmen equally hard pressed drinkwater and morris were in opposite watches and the preoccupations of working and sleeping allowed noone the luxury of contemplating the events of past weeks objectively it would not be true however to say that the events and circumstances that had occurred were forgotten rather they sat at a level just above the subconscious so that they influenced conduct but did not dominate it drinkwater was particularly affected the horrors he had seen and the guilt he felt over his involvement in the death of threddle impinged on his selfesteem and his knowledge of the manner of sharpless death lay like a weight upon his soul although sharples had been the true murderer of threddle drinkwater knew that he had been driven to it morriss coldblooded execution of the seaman at the mill however was another matter to drinkwaters mind it was a matter for the law or and he shuddered at the thought a matter for vengeance when cyclops arrived at new york there was time too much time for the mind to wander over possible causes and effects and the consequences of action in the midshipmens mess some contact with morris was unavoidable and there had been potentially disruptive scenes drinkwater had always avoided them by walking out but this action had given morris the impression of an ascendancy over nathaniel morris had entered the mess some time after but on the day that drinkwater had been told of his promotion and whats our brave nathaniel up to now there was silence then white came in ive taken your boatcloak and tarpaulin to your cabin nat er sir nathaniel smiled at his friend thanks chalky cabin sir what bloody tomfoolery is this morris was colouring with comprehension nathaniel said nothing but continued to pack things in his chest white could not resist the chance of aggravating the bully at whose hands he had suffered particularly when he had a powerful ally in the person of the acting third lieutenant mr drinkwater he said with gravity is promoted to acting third lieutenant morris glared as he assimilated the news he turned to nathaniel in a fury the devil you are why you jumpedup little bastard you dont have time in for lieutenant i suppose youve been arselicking the first lieutenant again ill see about this he ran on for some minutes in similar vein drinkwater felt himself seized again by the cold rage that had made him so brutal with the wounded french lieutenant of la creole it was a permanent legacy of that horrendous march inland and was to stamp his conduct in moments of physical confrontation as the influence of his widowed mother had made him soft clay for morriss viciousness the events of the galuda had tempered the latent iron in his soul have a care sir he said his voice low and menacing have a care in what you say you forget i have passed for masters mate which is more than you have ever managed you also forget i have evidence to have you hanged under two articles of war morris paled and drinkwater thought for a moment he was going to faint at last he spoke and what if i tell of your conduct over threddle drinkwater felt his own heart thump with recollection but he retained his head he turned to little white who was staring wideeyed between one and the other of the older midshipmen chalky if you had to choose between evidence i gave and evidence morris gave whose would you favour the boy smiled pleased at the dividend his revenge was receiving yours nat of course thank you now perhaps you and morris would be kind enough to carry my chest to my cabin drinkwater luxuriated in the privacy of his little cabin situated between two twelvepounders on the gundeck it dismantled when the frigate cleared for action he no longer had to endure the constant comings and goings of the cockpit and was able to read in privacy and quiet perhaps the greatest benefit his acting rank conferred upon him was the right to mess in the gunroom and enjoy the society of wheeler and devaux appleby though not at that time technically a member of the commissioned officers mess was a frequent indeed a usual visitor in new york drinkwater obtained new clothes and cocked hat without braid so that his appearance befitted his new dignity without ostentation though he was rarely on deck without his captured sword swinging as devaux put it upon his larboard hip his acquaintance with the multifarious duties of a naval officer increased daily as there was a constant stream of boats between the ships and town of new york but his social life was limited to an occasional dinner in the gunroom of another vessel unlike wheeler or devaux he eschewed the delights of the frequent entertainments given by new york society for the garrison and naval officers this was partly out of shyness partly out of deference to elizabeth but mostly due to the fact that the other occupants of the gunroom now had a junior in their midst sufficiently subordinate not to protest at their abuses of rank drinkwaters chief delight at this time was reading in the bookshops of new york and from the surgeons small travelling library he had discovered smollett and made the consequential acquaintance of humphry clinker commodore trunnion and roderick random it was the latter that led his thoughts so often to elizabeth the romantic concept of the waiting woman obsessed him so that the uncertainty of elizabeths exact whereabouts worried him that he loved her was now beyond a doubt her image had sustained him in the dreary swamps of carolina and he had come to think of her as a talisman against all evil mostly that of morris there was more to his enmity with morris than a poisonous dislike he was convinced that the man was an evil influence over his life buried deep in the natural fear of the green young midshipman of two years earlier this idea had grown as successive events had seemed to establish a pattern in his imagination that they had served to strengthen him and his resolution seemed inconsequential had he not been made aware of morriss depravity and the fate of sharples could not someone else have come in from the yard arm that night the topman had begged for help could not another midshipman have been sent forward to ask kate sharples to leave the deck that day in spithead but now there was a more vivid reason for attributing something supernatural to morriss malevolence for drinkwater was subject to a recurring dream a nightmare that had its origins in the swamps of carolina and haunted him with an occasional but persistent terror it had come first to him in the exhausted sleep after the taking of la creole and occurred again in the gales off cape hatteras twice while cyclops lay in new york he had suffered from it there was always a white lady who seemed to rear over him pale as death and inexorable in her advance as she came ever nearer yet never passed over him entirely sometimes she bore the face of cranston sometimes of morris but most horribly of elizabeth but an elizabeth of medusalike visage before which he quailed drowning in a vast noise like the clanking of chains rhythmically jerking or of cyclopss pumps it was therefore with relief that drinkwater learned of morriss transfer since his promotion he had not sought to impose his newfound authority upon morris and simply heard that he was joining a ship in rear admiral drakes division with an inner and secret lightening of the heart perhaps after all his fears were the groundless suppositions of an overtaxed nervous system but on the morning of morriss departure drinkwater was again in doubt he was reading in the confined privacy of his tiny cabin when the door was flung unceremoniously open morris stood on the threshold he was drunk and held in his hand a piece of crumpled paper ive come to shay goodbye mishter fucking drinkwater he slurred his hooded lids half closed i want to tell you that you and i have unfinished businesh to attend to he managed a mirthless chuckle spittle bubbling round his mouth ish funny really you and i couldve become friends tears were visible in the corners of his eyes and drinkwater slowly realised the awful odious implication in the mans words morris sniffed drawing his cuff across his nose then he began chuckling again ive a letter from my shishter here she knows a man or two at the admiralty she promishes me to use her fourposhter to make me a posht captain now dont you think thatsh bloody funny mishter drinkwater dont you think thatsh about the funniesht thing youve ever heard he paused to chuckle at the ribald pun then his smile vanished and with it his drunken laxity the threat he had come to utter reinforced by rum was from his heart and if as a consequence i can ever destroy you or your miss bower i will by god i will at the mention of elizabeths name nathaniel felt the terrible icy rage that had despatched the french privateer officer flood his veins morris fell back abruptly and stumbling sprawled on the deck drinkwater had the captured sword half out of its scabbard when the abject spectacle of his adversary quailing before him brought him to his senses he slammed the fragile door of his cabin and snapped the sword down in its sheath outside he heard morriss feet scrape on the deck as he staggered upright drinkwater stood stock still in the centre of the room his breathing slowly returning to normal he began shaking like an aspen leaf in a breeze and found himself looking at the little picture of the algonquin that elizabeth had given him and that his newfound privacy had allowed him to hang he reached out a shaking hand to reassure himself of its reality on august th the ships at sandy hook sighted sails to the southward sir samuel hood arrived in a lather furious to find admiral graves still in new york the rear admiral had himself rowed up the harbour to harangue graves when he found the latter ashore in his comfortable house though junior to graves hood impressed his superior of the size of the french fleet in north american waters in view of gravess apparent pusillanimity he suppressed details of the unseaworthiness of his own squadron one ship of which was actually in a sinking condition graves was suddenly infected with the panic of rapid action and ordered his fleet to sea but it was still the end of the month before the twentyone line of battleships were proceeding south de barras at rhode island with eight of the line had already sailed and the previous day admiral de grasse had anchored his own twentyeight of the line numerous frigates and transports in the chesapeake he had also landed troops to surround an obscure peninsula called yorktown lord cornwallis was cut off for washington and rochambeau were marching south from the hudson highlands across new jersey their flank exposed to the inactive clinton at new york to join up with la fayette and close the iron ring round the hapless earl what happened to cornwallis is history the british fleets sailed south too late graves flung out his frigates and cyclops stood to the eastward thus taking no part in the forthcoming battle the fleet fought an action with de grasse which was indecisive in itself but it was enough for graves de grasse retained possession of the bay of the chesapeake at the time de barras had not arrived but when graves realising the enormity of his blunder tried a second time to draw out de grasse the british admiral found de barras had reinforced the comte and drew off cornwallis was abandoned a gallant effort was made to cross the james river under cover of darkness to where tarleton held a bridgehead at gloucester but after the first boats had got over a violent storm got up and the breakout to new york was abandoned a few weeks later lord cornwallis surrendered and the war with america was effectively if not officially over cyclops scouting eastward missed both the action off the virginia capes and a sight of de barrass squadron she eventually returned to new york to receive belated recognition from the new commander in chief that she belonged to the channel fleet after despatching the fast tender rattlesnake with the news of the loss of cornwalliss army at the end of october admiral graves recollected that although fast she was lightly armed and a vulnerable prey to a french cruiser or a marauding yankee privateer in typical fashion he vacillated fretting about the fate of rattlesnake worrying that his report might fall into enemy hands eventually he decided to send a frigate with a duplicate set of despatches it seemed a good idea his secretary advised to take the opportunity of sending cyclops back to kempenfelt acting lieutenant nathaniel drinkwater stopped pacing to stare up at the main topgallant his body balanced effortlessly as the ship moved beneath him a near southwesterly gale thrumming in the rigging and sending a patter of spray over the starboard quarter rail he studied the sail for a moment there was no mistaking the strain on the weather sheet or the vibration transmitted to the yard below it was time to shorten sail mr white the boy was immediately attentive my compliments to the captain and the winds freshening with his approval i intend furling the tgallants aye aye sir drinkwater stared into the binnacle the two helmsmen grunted and sweated as they fought to hold cyclops on course he watched the gently oscillating compass card advancing daylight already rendered the oil lamp superfluous the heavy grey atlantic lifted the frigates quarter sent her scudding forward until it passed under her and she dragged into the trough stabbing her bowsprit at the sky then her stern lifted again and the cycle repeated itself over and over all the three thousand miles from new york to the chops of the channel drinkwater felt none of the shame being experienced by captain hope shaving in the cabin below for hope already knew the heady wine of victory having fought through the glorious period of the seven years war to end his career in defeat was a bitter blow a condemnation of the years of labour and a justification of his cynicism that was only alleviated by the draft on tavistocks for four thousand sterling to drinkwater the events of the last few weeks had been a culmination in their fruitless search for de barras they had boxed the compass off long island and the new england coast to nathaniel free of the oppressive presence of morris it had been a glorious time a fruitful splendid time in which cautiously at first but with growing confidence he had handled the ship he looked up at the now furled topgallants his judgement was vindicated for cyclops had not slackened her pace he saw captain hope ascend the companionway he vacated the windward side touching his hat as the captain passed morning sir gmorning mr drinkwater hope glanced aloft anything in sight nothing reported sir very well hope looked at the log slate should raise the lizard before dark sir by my reckoning volunteered drinkwater hope grunted and began pacing the weather quarterdeck drinkwater moved over to the lee side where young chalky white was shivering in the downdraught of the main topsail mr drinkwater the captain called sharply sir drinkwater hurried over to where the captain was regarding him with a frown his heart sank sir he repeated you are not wearing your sword sir repeated drinkwater yet again his forehead wrinkling in a frown it is the first morning you have had your present appointment that you have not worn it is it sir drinkwater blushed behind him white giggled you must be paying the correct attention to your duties and less to your personal appearance i am pleased to see it drinkwater swallowed yyes sir thank you sir hope resumed his pacing white was in stitches the subject of mr drinkwaters sword having caused much amusement between decks drinkwater turned on him mr white take a glass to the foremasthead and look for england england nat mr drinkwater sir yes mr white england england he thought england and elizabeth
