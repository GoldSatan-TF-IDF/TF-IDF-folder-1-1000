mystification by edgar allan poe slid if these be your passados and montantes ill have none o them ned knowles the baron ritzner von jung was a noble hungarian family every member of which at least as far back into antiquity as any certain records extend was more or less remarkable for talent of some descriptionthe majority for that species of grotesquerie in conception of which tieck a scion of the house has given a vivid although by no means the most vivid exemplifications my acquaintance with ritzner commenced at the magnificent chateau jung into which a train of droll adventures not to be made public threw a place in his regard and here with somewhat more difficulty a partial insight into his mental conformation in later days this insight grew more clear as the intimacy which had at first permitted it became more close and when after three years of the character of the baron ritzner von jung i remember the buzz of curiosity which his advent excited within the college precincts on the night of the twentyfifth of june i remember still more distinctly that while he was pronounced by all parties at first sight the most remarkable man in the world no person made any attempt at accounting for his opinion that he was unique appeared so undeniable that it was deemed impertinent to inquire wherein the uniquity consisted but letting this matter pass for the present i will merely observe that from the first moment of his setting foot within the limits of the university he began to exercise over the habits manners persons purses and propensities of the whole community which surrounded him an influence the most extensive and despotic yet at the same time the most indefinite and altogether unaccountable thus the brief period of his residence at the university forms an era in its annals and is characterized by all classes of people appertaining to it or its dependencies as that very extraordinary epoch forming the domination of the baron ritzner von jung then of no particular age by which i mean that it was impossible to form a guess respecting his age by any data personally afforded he might have been fifteen or fifty and was twentyone years and seven months he was by no means a handsome manperhaps the reverse the contour of his face was somewhat angular and harsh his forehead was lofty and very fair his nose a snub his eyes large heavy glassy and meaningless about the mouth there was more to be observed the lips were gently protruded and rested the one upon the other after such a fashion that it is impossible to conceive any even the most complex combination of human features conveying so entirely and so singly the idea of unmitigated gravity solemnity and repose it will be perceived no doubt from what i have already said that the baron was one of those human anomalies now and then to be found who make the science of mystification the study and the business of their lives for this science a peculiar turn of mind gave him instinctively the cue while his physical appearance afforded him unusual facilities for carrying his prospects into effect i quaintly termed the domination of the baron ritzner von jung ever rightly entered into the mystery which overshadowed his character i truly think that no person at the university with the exception of myself ever suspected him to be capable of a joke verbal or practicalthe old bulldog at the gardengate would sooner have been accusedthe ghost of heraclitusor the wig of the emeritus professor of theology this too when it was evident that the most egregious and unpardonable of all conceivable tricks whimsicalities and buffooneries were brought about if not directly by him at least plainly through his intermediate agency or connivance the beauty if i may so call it of his art mystifique lay in that consummate ability resulting from an almost intuitive knowledge of human nature and a most wonderful selfpossession by means of which he never failed to make it appear that the drolleries he was occupied in bringing to a point arose partly in spite and partly in consequence of the laudable efforts he was making for their prevention and for the preservation of the good order and dignity of alma mater the deep the poignant the overwhelming mortification which upon each such failure of his praise worthy endeavors would suffuse every lineament of his countenance left not the slightest room for doubt of his sincerity in the bosoms of even his most skeptical companions the adroitness too was no less worthy of observation by which he contrived to shift the sense of the grotesque from the creator to the createdfrom his own person to the absurdities to which he had given rise in no instance before that of which i speak have i known the habitual mystific escape the natural consequence of his manoevresan attachment of the ludicrous to his own character and person continually enveloped in an atmosphere of whim my friend appeared to live only for the severities of society and not even his own household have for a moment associated other ideas than those of the rigid and august with the memory of the baron ritzner von jung the demon of the dolce far niente lay like an incubus upon the university nothing at least was done beyond eating and drinking and making merry the apartments of the students were converted into so many pothouses and there was no pothouse of them all more famous or more frequented than that of the baron our carousals here were many and boisterous and long and never unfruitful of events upon one occasion we had protracted our sitting until nearly daybreak and an unusual quantity of wine had been drunk the company consisted of seven or eight individuals besides the baron and myself most of these were young men of wealth of high connection of great family pride and all alive with an exaggerated sense of honor they abounded in the most ultra german opinions respecting the duello to these quixotic notions some recent parisian publications backed by three or four desperate and fatal conversation during the greater part of the night had run wild upon the allengrossing topic of the times the baron who had been unusually silent and abstracted in the earlier portion of the evening at length seemed to be aroused from his apathy took a leading part in the discourse and dwelt upon the benefits and more especially upon the beauties of the received code of etiquette in passages of arms with an ardor an eloquence an impressiveness and an affectionateness of manner which elicited the warmest enthusiasm from his hearers in general and absolutely staggered even myself who well knew him to be at heart a ridiculer of those very points for which he contended and especially to hold the entire fanfaronade of duelling etiquette in the sovereign contempt which it deserves looking around me during a pause in the barons discourse of which my readers may gather some faint idea when i say that it bore resemblance to the fervid chanting monotonous yet musical sermonic manner of coleridge i perceived symptoms of even more than the general interest in the countenance of one of the party this gentleman whom i shall call hermann was an original in every respectexcept perhaps in the single particular that he was a very great fool he contrived to bear however among a particular set at the university a reputation for deep metaphysical thinking and i believe for some logical talent as a duellist he had acquired who had fallan at his hands but they were many he was a man of courage undoubtedly but it was upon his minute acquaintance with the etiquette of the duello and the nicety of his sense of honor that he most especially prided himself these things were a hobby which he rode to the death to ritzner ever upon the lookout for the grotesque his peculiarities had for a long time past afforded food for mystification of this however i was not aware although in the present instance i saw clearly that something of a whimsical nature was upon the tapis with my friend and that hermann was its especial object as the former proceeded in his discourse or rather monologue i perceived the excitement of the latter momently increasing at length he spoke offering some objection to a point insisted upon by r and giving his reasons in detail to these the baron replied at length still maintaining his exaggerated tone of sentiment and concluding in what i thought very bad taste with a sarcasm and a sneer the hobby of hermann now took the bit in his teeth this i could discern by the studied hairsplitting farrago of his rejoinder his last words i distinctly remember your opinions allow me to say baron von jung although in the main correct are in many nice points discreditable to yourself and to the university of which you are a member in a few respects they are even unworthy of serious refutation i would say more than this sir were it not for the fear of giving you offence here the speaker smiled blandly i would say sir that your opinions are not the opinions to be expected from a gentleman as hermann completed this equivocal sentence all eyes were turned upon the baron he became pale then excessively red then dropping his pockethandkerchief stooped to recover it when i caught a glimpse of his countenance while it could be seen by no one else at the table it was radiant with the quizzical expression which was its natural character but which i had never seen it assume except when we were alone together and when he unbent himself freely in an instant afterward he stood erect confronting hermann and so total an alteration of countenance in so short a period i certainly never saw before for a moment i even fancied that i had misconceived him and that he was in sober earnest he appeared to be stifling with passion and his face was cadaverously white for a short time he remained silent apparently striving to master his emotion having at length seemingly succeeded he reached a decanter which stood near him saying as he held it firmly clenched the language you have thought proper to employ mynheer hermann in addressing yourself to me is objectionable in so many particulars that i have neither temper nor time for specification that my opinions however are not the opinions to be expected from a gentleman is an observation so directly offensive as to allow me but one line of conduct some courtesy nevertheless is due to the presence of this company and to yourself at this moment as my guest you will pardon me therefore if upon this consideration i deviate slightly from the general usage among gentlemen in similar cases of personal affront you will forgive me for the moderate tax i shall make upon your imagination and endeavor to consider for an instant the reflection of your person in yonder mirror as the living mynheer hermann himself this being done there will be no difficulty whatever i shall discharge this decanter of wine at your image in yonder mirror and thus fulfil all the spirit if not the exact letter of resentment for your insult while the necessity of physical violence to your real person will be obviated with these words he hurled the decanter full of wine against the mirror which hung directly opposite hermann striking the reflection of his person with great precision and of course shattering the glass into fragments the whole company at once started to their feet and with the exception of myself and ritzner took their departure as hermann went out the baron whispered me that i should follow him and make an offer of my services to this i agreed not knowing precisely what to make of so ridiculous a piece of business the duellist accepted my aid with his stiff and ultra recherche air and taking my arm led me to his apartment i could hardly forbear laughing in his face while he proceeded to discuss with the profoundest gravity what he termed the refinedly peculiar character of the insult he had received after a tiresome harangue in his ordinary style he took down from his book shelves a number of musty volumes on the subject of the duello and entertained me for a long time with their contents reading aloud and commenting earnestly as he read i can just remember the titles of some of the works there were the ordonnance of philip le bel on single combat the theatre of honor by favyn and a treatise on the permission of duels by andiguier he displayed also with much pomposity brantomes memoirs of duelspublished at cologne in the types of elzevira precious and unique vellumpaper volume with a fine margin and bound by derome but he requested my attention particularly and with an air of mysterious sagacity to a thick octavo written in barbarous latin by one hedelin a frenchman and having the quaint title duelli lex scripta et non aliterque from this he read me one of the drollest chapters in the world concerning injuriae per applicationem per constructionem et per se about half of which he averred was strictly applicable to his own refinedly peculiar case although not one syllable of the whole matter could i understand for the life of me having finished the chapter he closed the book and demanded what i thought necessary to be done i replied that i had entire confidence in his superior delicacy of feeling and would abide by what he proposed with this answer he seemed flattered and sat down to write a note to the baron it ran thus sirmy friend m p will hand you this note i find it incumbent upon me to request at your earliest convenience an explanation of this evenings occurrences at your chambers in the event of your declining this request mr p will be happy to arrange with any friend whom you may appoint the steps preliminary to a meeting with sentiments of perfect respect your most humble servant johann herman to the baron ritzner von jung not knowing what better to do i called upon ritzner with this epistle he bowed as i presented it then with a grave countenance motioned me to a seat having perused the cartel he wrote the following reply which i carried to hermann sirthrough our common friend mr p i have received your note of this evening upon due reflection i frankly admit the propriety of the explanation you suggest this being admitted i still find great difficulty owing to the refinedly peculiar nature of our disagreement and of the personal affront offered on my part in so wording what i have to say by way of apology as to meet all the minute exigencies and all the variable shadows of the case i have great reliance however on that extreme delicacy of discrimination in matters appertaining to the rules of etiquette for which you have been so long and so preeminently distinguished with perfect certainty therefore of being comprehended i beg leave in lieu of offering any sentiments of my own to refer you to the opinions of sieur hedelin as set forth in the ninth paragraph of the chapter of injuriae per applicationem per constructionem et per se in his duelli lex scripta et non aliterque the nicety of your discernment in all the matters here treated will be sufficient i am assured to convince you that the mere circumstance of me referring you to this admirable passage ought to satisfy your request as a man of honor for explanation with sentiments of profound respect your most obedient servant von jung the herr johann hermann hermann commenced the perusal of this epistle with a scowl which however was converted into a smile of the most ludicrous selfcomplacency as he came to the rigmarole about injuriae per applicationem per constructionem et per se having finished reading he begged me with the blandest of all possible smiles to be seated while he made reference to the treatise in question turning to the passage specified he read it with great care to himself then closed the book and desired me in my character of confidential acquaintance to express to the baron von jung his exalted sense of his chivalrous behavior and in that of second to assure him that the explanation offered was of the fullest the most honorable and the most unequivocally satisfactory nature somewhat amazed at all this i made my retreat to the baron he seemed to receive hermanns amicable letter as a matter of course and after a few words of general conversation went to an inner room and brought out the everlasting treatise duelli lex scripta et non aliterque he handed me the volume and asked me to look over some portion of it i did so but to little purpose not being able to gather the least particle of meaning he then took the book himself and read me a chapter aloud to my surprise what he read proved to be a most horribly absurd account of a duel between two baboons he now explained the mystery showing that the volume as it appeared prima facie was written upon the plan of the nonsense verses of du bartas that is to say the language was ingeniously framed so as to present to the ear all the outward signs of intelligibility and even of profundity while in fact not a shadow of meaning existed the key to the whole was found in leaving out every second and third word alternately when there appeared a series of ludicrous quizzes upon a single combat as practised in modern times the baron afterwards informed me that he had purposely thrown the treatise in hermanns way two or three weeks before the adventure and that he was satisfied from the general tenor of his conversation that he had studied it with the deepest attention and firmly believed it to be a work of unusual merit upon this hint he proceeded hermann would have died a thousand deaths rather than acknowledge his inability to understand anything and everything in the universe that had ever been written about the duello
