happened at that time subj i was at home i got a phone call int and what were you doing at the time you got the call first night actually i was sitting on my bed in my apartment in culver city watching the lakers game with the sound turned off while i tried to study vocabulary for my introductory japanese class it was a quiet evening i had gotten my daughter to sleep about eight now i had the cassette player on the bed and the cheerful womans voice was saying things like hello i am a police officer can i be of assistance and please show me the menu after each sentence she paused for me to repeat it back in japanese i stumbled along as best i could then she would say the vegetable store is closed where is the post office things like that sometimes it was hard to concentrate but i was trying mr hayashi has two children i tried to answer hayashisan wa kodomo ga fur futur i swore but by then the woman was talking again this drink is not very good at all i had my textbook open on the bed alongside a mr potato head id put back together for my daughter next to that a photo album and the pictures from her second birthday party it was four months after michelles party but i still hadnt put the pictures in the album you have to try and keep up with that stuff there will be a meeting at two oclock the pictures on my bed didnt reflect reality any more four months later michelle looked completely different she was taller shed outgrown the expensive party dress my exwife had bought for her black velvet with a white lace collar in the photos my exwife plays a prominent role holding the cake as michelle blows out the candles helping her unwrap the presents she looks like a dedicated mom actually my daughter lives with me and my exwife doesnt see much of her she doesnt show up for weekend visitation half the time and she misses childsupport payments but youd never know from the birthday photos where is the toilet i have a car we can go together i continued studying of course officially i was on duty that night i was the special services officer on call for division headquarters downtown but february ninth was a quiet thursday and i didnt expect much action until nine oclock i only had three calls special services includes the diplomatic section of the police department we handle problems with diplomats and celebrities and provide translators and liaison for foreign nationals who come into contact with the police for one reason or another its varied work but not stressful when im on call i can expect a halfdozen requests for help none of them emergencies i hardly ever have to roll out its much less demanding than being a police press liaison which is what i did before special services anyway on the night of february ninth the first call i got concerned fernando conseca the chilean viceconsul a patrol car had pulled him over ferny was too drunk to drive but he was claiming diplomatic immunity i told the patrolmen to drive him home and i made a note to complain to the consulate again in the morning then an hour later i got a call from detectives in gardena theyd arrested a suspect in a restaurant shooting who spoke only samoan and they wanted a translator i said i could get one but that samoans invariably spoke english the country had been an american trust territory for years the detectives said theyd handle it then i got a call that mobile television vans were blocking fire lanes at the aerosmith concert i told the officers to give it to the fire department and it was quiet for the next hour i went back to my textbook and my singsong woman saying things like yesterdays weather was rainy then tom graham called its the fucking japs graham said i cant believe theyre pulling this shit better get over here peteysan eleven hundred figueroa corner of seventh its the new nakamoto building what is the problem i had to ask graham is a good detective but he has a bad temper and he tends to blow things out of proportion the problem graham said is that the fucking japs are demanding to see the fucking special services liaison which is you buddy theyre saying the police cant proceed until the liaison gets here cant proceed why what have you got homicide graham said caucasian female approximately twentyfive years old apparent sixohone lying flat on her back right in their damn boardroom quite a sight you better get down here as soon as you can i said is that music in the background hell yes graham said theres a big party going on tonight is the grand opening of the nakamoto tower and theyre having a reception just get down here will you i said i would i called mrs ascenio next door and asked her if she would watch the baby while i was gone she always needed extra money while i waited for her to arrive i changed my shirt and put on my good suit then fred hoffmann called he was watch commander at dhd downtown a short tough guy with gray hair listen pete i think you might want help on this one i said why is that sounds like we got a homicide involving japanese nationals it may be sticky how long have you been a liaison about six months i said if i was you id get some experienced help pick up connor and take him downtown with you who john connor ever heard of him sure i said everyone in the division had heard of connor he was a legend the most knowledgeable of the special services officers but isnt he retired hes on indefinite leave but he still works cases involving the japanese i think he could be helpful to you tell you what ill call him for you you just go down and pick him up hoffmann gave me his address okay fine thanks and one other thing land lines on this one okay pete okay i said who requested that its just better whatever you say fred land lines meant to stay off the radios so our transmissions wouldnt be picked up by the media monitoring police frequencies it was standard procedure in certain situations whenever elizabeth taylor went to the hospital we went to land lines or if the teenage son of somebody famous died in a car crash wed go to land lines to make sure the parents got the news before the tv crews started banging on their door we used land lines for that kind of thing id never heard it invoked in a homicide before but driving downtown i stayed off the car phone and listened to the radio there was a report of a shooting of a threeyearold boy who was now paralyzed from the waist down the child was a bystander during a eleven robbery a stray bullet hit him in the spine and he was i switched to another station got a talk show ahead i could see the lights of the downtown skyscrapers rising into mist i got off the freeway at san pedro connors exit what i knew about john connor was that he had lived for a time in japan where he acquired his knowledge of japanese language and culture at one point back in the s he was the only officer who spoke fluent japanese even though los angeles then had the largest japanese population outside the home islands now of course the department has more than eighty officers who speak japanese and more like me who are trying to learn connor had retired several years before but the liaison officers who worked with him agreed he was the best he was said to work very fast often solving cases in a few hours he had a reputation as a skilled detective and an extraordinary interviewer able to get information from witnesses like nobody else but most of all the other liaisons praised his evenhanded approach one said to me working with the japanese is like balancing on a tightrope sooner or later everybody falls off on one side or the other some people decide the japanese are fabulous and can do no wrong some people decide theyre vicious pricks but connor always keeps his balance he stays in the middle he always knows exactly what he is doing john connor lived in the industrial area off seventh street in a large brick warehouse alongside a diesel truck depot the freight elevator in the building was broken i walked upstairs to the third floor and knocked on his door its open a voice said i entered a small apartment the living room was empty and furnished in the japanese style tatami mats shoji screens and woodpaneled walls a calligraphy scroll a black lacquer table a vase with a single splash of white orchid i saw two pairs of shoes set out beside the door one was a mans brogues the other was a pair of womens high heels i said captain connor just a minute a shoji screen slid back and connor appeared he was surprisingly tall maybe a hundred and ninety centimeters well over six feet he wore a yukata a light japanese robe of blue cotton i estimated he was fiftyfive years old broadshouldered balding with a trim mustache sharp features piercing eyes deep voice calm good evening lieutenant we shook hands connor looked me up and down and nodded approvingly good very presentable i said i used to work press you never knew when you might have to appear in front of cameras he nodded and now youre the sso on call thats right how long have you been a liaison six months you speak japanese a little im taking lessons give me a few minutes to change he turned and disappeared behind the shoji screen this is a homicide yes who notified you tom graham hes the oic at the crime scene he said the japanese were insisting on a liaison officer being present i see there was a pause i heard running water is that a common request no in fact ive never heard of it happening usually officers call for a liaison because they have a language problem ive never heard of the japanese asking for a liaison neither have i connor said did graham ask you to bring me because tom graham and i dont always admire each other no i said fred hoffmann suggested i bring you in he felt i didnt have enough experience he said he was going to call you for me then you were called at home twice connor said yes i see he reappeared wearing a dark blue suit knotting his tie it seems that time is critical he glanced at his watch when did graham call you about nine then forty minutes have already passed lets go lieutenant wheres your car we hurried downstairs i drove up san pedro and turned left onto second heading toward the nakamoto building there was a light mist at street level connor stared out the window he said how good is your memory pretty good i guess i wonder if you could repeat for me the telephone conversations you had tonight he said give them to me in as much detail as possible word for word if you can ill try i recounted my phone calls connor listened without interruption or comment i didnt know why he was so interested and he didnt tell me when i finished he said hoffmann didnt tell you who called for land lines no well its a good idea in any case i never use a car phone if i can help it these days too many people listen in i turned onto figueroa up ahead i saw searchlights shining in front of the new nakamoto tower the building itself was gray granite rising up into the night i got into the right lane and flipped open the glove box to grab a handful of business cards the cards said detective lieutenant peter j smith special services liaison officer los angeles police department printed in english on one side in japanese on the back connor looked at the cards how do you want to handle this situation lieutenant have you negotiated with the japanese before i said not really no couple of drunk driving arrests connor said politely then perhaps i can suggest a strategy for us to follow thats fine with me i said id be grateful for your help all right since youre the liaison its probably best if you take charge of the scene when we arrive okay dont bother to introduce me or refer to me in any way dont even look in my direction okay i am a nonentity you alone are in charge okay fine itll help to be formal stand straight and keep your suit jacket buttoned at all times if they bow to you dont bow back just give a little head nod a foreigner will never master the etiquette of bowing dont even try okay i said when you start to deal with the japanese remember that they dont like to negotiate they find it too confrontational in their own society they avoid it whenever possible okay control your gestures keep your hands at your sides the japanese find big arm movements threatening speak slowly keep your voice calm and even okay if you can okay it may be difficult to do the japanese can be irritating youll probably find them irritating tonight handle it as best you can but whatever happens dont lose your temper all right thats extremely bad form all right i said connor smiled im sure youll do well he said you probably wont need my help at all but if you get stuck youll hear me say perhaps i can be of assistance that will be the signal that im taking over from that point on let me do the talking id prefer you not speak again even if you are spoken to directly by them okay okay you may want to speak but dont be drawn out i understand furthermore whatever i do show no surprise whateveri do okay once i take over move so that youre standing slightly behind me and to my right never sit never look around never appear distracted remember that although you come from an mtv video culture they do not they are japanese everything you do will have meaning to them every aspect of your appearance and behavior will reflect on you on the police department and on me as your superior and sempai okay captain any questions whats a sempai connor smiled we drove past the searchlights down the ramp into the underground garage in japan he said a sempaiis a senior man who guides a junior man known as a kohai the sempaikohairelationship is quite common its often assumed to exist whenever a younger man and an older man are working together they will probably assume it of us i said sort of a mentor and apprentice not exactly connor said in japan sempaikohaihas a different quality more like a fond parent the sempaiis expected to indulge his kohai and put up with all sorts of youthful excesses and errors from the junior man he smiled but im sure you wont do that to me we came to the bottom of the ramp and saw the flat expanse of the parking garage ahead of us connor stared out the window and frowned where is everybody the garage of the nakamoto tower was full of limousines the drivers leaning against their cars talking and smoking but i saw no police cars ordinarily when theres a homicide the place is lit up like christmas with lights flashing from a halfdozen black and whites the medical examiner paramedics and all the rest but there was nothing tonight it just looked like a garage where somebody was having a party elegant people standing in clusters waiting for their cars interesting i said we came to a stop the parking attendants opened the doors and i stepped out onto plush carpet and heard soft music i walked with connor toward the elevator welldressed people were coming the other way men in tuxedos women in expensive gowns and standing by the elevator wearing a stained corduroy sport coat and furiously smoking a cigarette was tom graham when graham played halfback at usc he never made first string that bit of history stuck like a character trait all his life he seemed to miss the crucial promotion the next step up a detectives career he had transferred from one division to another never finding a precinct that suited him or a partner that worked well with him always too outspoken graham had made enemies in the chiefs office and at thirtynine further advancement was unlikely now he was bitter gruff and putting on weight a big man who had become ponderous and a pain in the ass he just rubbed people the wrong way his idea of personal integrity was to be a failure and he was sarcastic about anybody who didnt share his views nice suit he said to me as i walked up you look fucking beautiful peter he flicked imaginary dust off my lapel i ignored it hows it going tom you guys should be attending this party not working it he turned to connor and shook his hand hello john whose idea was it to get you out of bed im just observing connor said mildly i said fred hoffmann asked me to bring him down hell graham said its okay with me that youre here i can use some help its pretty tense up there we followed him toward the elevator i still saw no other police officers i said where is everybody good question graham said theyve managed to keep all of our people around back at the freight entrance they claim the service elevator gives fastest access and they keep talking about the importance of their grand opening and how nothing must disrupt it by the elevators a uniformed japanese private security guard looked us over carefully these two are with me graham said the security man nodded but squinted at us suspiciously we got on the elevator fucking japanese graham said as the doors closed this is still our country were still the fucking police in our own country the elevator was glass walled and we looked out on downtown los angeles as it went up into the light mist directly across was the arco building all lit up at night you know these elevators are illegal graham said according to code no glass elevators past ninety floors and this building is ninetyseven floors the highest building in la but then this whole building is one big special case and they got it up in six months you know how they brought in prefab units from nagasaki and slapped them together here didnt use american construction workers got a special permit to bypass our unions because of a socalled technical problem that only japanese workers could handle you believe that shit i shrugged they got it past the american unions hell they got it past the city council graham said but of course thats just money and if theres one third we know the japanese have money so they got variances on the zoning restrictions the earthquake ordinances they got everything they wanted i shrugged politics my ass you know they dont even pay tax thats right they got an eightyear break on property taxes from the city shit were givingthis country away we rode for a moment in silence graham stared out the windows the elevators were highspeed hitachis using the latest technology the fastest and smoothest elevators in the world we moved higher into the mist i said to graham you want to tell us about this homicide or do you want it to be a surprise fuck graham said he flipped open his notebook here you go the original call was at eight thirtytwo somebody saying there is a problem of disposition of a body male with a thick asian accent doesnt speak good english the operator couldnt get much out of him except an address the nakamoto tower black and white goes over arrives at eight thirtynine pm finds its a homicide fortysixth floor which is an office floor in this building victim is caucasian female approximately twentyfive years old hell of a goodlooking girl youll see the blue suits stretch the tape and call the division i go over with merino arriving at eight fiftythree crime scene iu and sid show up about the same time for pe prints and pics okay so far yes connor said nodding graham said were just getting started when some jap from the nakamoto corporation comes up in a thousanddollar blue suit and announces that he is entitled to a fucking conversation with the lapd liaison officer before anything is done in their fucking building and hes saying things like we got no probable cause i go what the fuck is this we got an obvious homicide here i think this guy should get back but this jap speaks excellent fucking english and he seems to know a lot of law and everybody at the scene becomes you know concerned i mean theres no point in pushing to start an investigation if its going to invalidate due process right and this jap fucker is insisting the liaison must be present before we do anything since he speaks such fucking good english i dont know what the problem is i thought the whole idea of a liaison was for people who dont speak the language and this fucking guy has stanford law school written all over him but anyway he sighed you called me i said yeah i said who is the man from nakamoto shit graham scowled at his notes ishihara ishiguri something like that you have his card he must have given you his card yeah he did i gave it to merino i said any other japanese there what are you kidding graham laughed the place is swarming with them fucking disneyland up there i mean the crime scene so do i graham said we cant keep em out they say its their building they have a right to be there tonight is the grand opening of the nakamoto tower they have a right to be there on and on i said where is the opening taking place one floor below the murder on the fortyfifth floor theyre having one hell of a bash must be eight hundred people there movie stars senators congressmen you name it i hear madonna is there and tom cruise senator hammond senator kennedy elton john senator morton mayor thomass there district attorney wylands there hey maybe your exwife is there too pete she still works for wyland doesnt she last i heard graham sighed must be great to fuck a lawyer instead of getting fucked by them must make for a nice change i didnt want to talk about my exwife we dont have a lot of contact any more i said a little bell rang then the elevator said yonjusan kai graham glanced at the glowing numbers above the door can you believe that shit yonjuyon kai the elevator said mosugu de gozaimasu whatd it say were almost at the floor fuck graham said if an elevators going to talk it should be english this is still america just barely connor said staring out at the view youjugo kai the elevator said the door opened graham was right it was a hell of a party the whole floor had been made into a replica forties ballroom men in suits women in cocktail dresses the band playing glenn miller swing music standing near the elevator door was a grayhaired suntanned man who looked vaguely familiar he had the broad shoulders of an athlete he stepped onto the elevator and turned to me ground floor please i smelled whiskey a second younger man in a suit instantly appeared by his side this elevator is going up senator whats that the grayhaired man said turning to his aide this elevators going up sir well i wantto go down he was speaking with the careful overarticulated speech of the drunk yes sir i know that sir the aide replied cheerfully lets take the next elevator senator he gripped the grayhaired man firmly by the elbow and led him off the elevator the doors closed the elevator continued up your tax dollars at work graham said recognize him senator stephen rowe nice to find him partying here considering hes on the senate finance committee which sets all japanese import regulations but like his pal senator kennedy rowe is one of the great pussy patrollers oh yeah they say he can drink pretty good too i noticed that thats why hes got that kid with him to keep him out of trouble the elevator stopped at the fortysixth floor there was a soft electronic ping yonjuroku kai goriyo arigato gozaimashita finally graham said now maybe we can get to work the doors opened we faced a solid wall of blue business suits backs turned to us there must have been twenty men jammed in the area just beyond the elevator the air was thick with cigarette smoke coming through coming through graham said pushing his way roughly past the men i followed connor behind me silent and inconspicuous the fortysixth floor had been designed to house the chief executive offices of nakamoto industries and it was impressive standing in the carpeted reception area just beyond the elevators i could see the entire floor it was a gigantic open space it was about sixty by forty meters half the size of a football field everything added to the sense of spaciousness and elegance the ceilings were high paneled in wood the furnishings were all wood and fabric black and gray and the carpet was thick sound was muted and lights were low adding to the soft rich quality it looked more like a bank than a business office the richest bank you ever saw and it made you stop and look i stood by the yellow crimescene tape which blocked access to the floor itself and got my bearings directly ahead was the large atrium a kind of open bullpen for secretaries and lowerlevel people there were desks in clusters and trees to break up the space in the center of the atrium stood a large model of the nakamoto tower and the complex of surrounding buildings still under construction a spotlight shone on the model but the rest of the atrium was relatively dark with night lights private offices for the executives were arranged around the perimeter of the atrium the offices had glass walls facing the atrium and glass walls on the outside walls as well so that from where i was standing you could look straight out to the surrounding skyscrapers of los angeles it made you think the floor was floating in midair there were two glasswalled conference rooms on the left and right the room on the right was smaller and there i saw the body of the girl lying on a long black table she was wearing a black dress one leg dangled down toward the floor i didnt see any blood but i was pretty far away from her maybe sixty meters it was hard to see much detail i heard the crackle of police radios and i heard graham saying heres your liaison gentlemen now maybe we can get started on our investigation peter i turned to the japanese men by the elevator i didnt know which i should talk to there was an awkward moment until one of them stepped forward he was about thirtyfive and wore an expensive suit the man gave a very slight bow from the neck just a hint i bowed back then he spoke konbanwa hajimemashite sumisusan ishiguro desu dozo yoroshiku a formal greeting although perfunctory no wasted time his name was ishiguro he already knew my name i said hajimemashite watashi wa sumisu desu dozo yoroshiku how do you do glad to meet you the usual watashi no meishi desu dozo he gave me his business card he was quick in his movements brusque domo arigato gozaimasu i accepted his card with both hands which wasnt really necessary but taking connors advice i wanted to do the most formal thing next i gave him my card the ritual required us both to look at each others cards and to make some minor comment or to ask a question like is this your office telephone number ishiguro took my card with one hand and said is this your home phone detective i was surprised he spoke the kind of unaccented english you can only learn by living here for a long time starting when youre young he must have gone to school here one of the thousands of japanese who studied in america in the seventies when they were sending students a year to america to learn about our country and we were sending american students a year to japan thats my number at the bottom yes i said ishiguro slipped my card into his shirt pocket i started to make a polite comment about his card but he interrupted me look detective i think we can dispense with the formalities the only reason theres a problem here tonight is that your colleague is unreasonable my colleague ishiguro gave a head jerk the fat one there graham his demands are unreasonable and we strongly object to his intention to carry out an investigation tonight i said why is that mr ishiguro you have no probable cause to conduct one why do you say that ishiguro snorted i would think its obvious even to you i stayed cool five years as a detective and then a year in the press section had taught me to stay cool i said no sir im afraid its not obvious he looked at me disdainfully the fact is lieutenant you have no reason to connect this girls death to the party were holding downstairs it looks like shes wearing a party dress he interrupted me rudely my guess is youll probably discover that she has died of an accidental drug overdose and therefore her death has nothing to do with our party wouldnt you agree i took a deep breath no sir i wouldnt agree not without an investigation i took another breath mr ishiguro i appreciate your concerns but i wonder if you do ishiguro said interrupting me again i insist that you appreciate the position of the nakamoto company tonight this is a very significant evening for us a very publicevening we are naturally distressed by the prospect that our function might be marred by unfounded allegations of a womans death especially this a woman of no importance a woman of no importance ishiguro made a dismissing wave he seemed to be tired of talking to me its obvious just look at her shes no better than a common prostitute i cant imagine how she came to be in this building at all and for this reason i strongly protest the intention of detective graham to interrogate the guests at the reception downstairs thats entirely unreasonable we have many senators congressmen and officials of los angeles among our guests surely you agree that such prominent people will find it awkward i said just a minute detective graham told you he was going to interrogate everybody at the reception that is what he said to me yes now at last i began to understand why id been called graham didnt like the japanese and he had threatened to spoil their evening of course it was never going to happen there was no way graham was going to interrogate united states senators let alone the district attorney or the mayor not if he expected to come to work tomorrow but the japanese annoyed him and graham had decided to annoy them back i said to ishiguro we can set up a registration desk downstairs and your guests can sign out as they leave i am afraid that will be difficult ishiguro began because surely you will admit mr ishiguro thats what were going to do but what you ask is extremely difficult mr ishiguro you see for us this is going to cause mr ishiguro im sorry ive just told you what police procedure is going to be he stiffened there was a pause he wiped some sweat from his upper lip and said i am disappointed lieutenant not to have greater cooperation from you cooperation that was when i started to get pissed off mr ishiguro youve got a dead woman in there and it is our job to investigate what happened to but you must acknowledge our special circumstances then i heard graham say aw christ what is this looking over my shoulder i saw a short bookish japanese man twenty meters beyond the yellow tape he was taking pictures of the crime scene the camera he held was so small it was nearly concealed in the palm of his hand but he wasnt concealing the fact that he had crossed the tape barrier to take his pictures as i watched he moved slowly back toward us raising his hands for a moment to snap a picture then blinking behind his wireframe spectacles as he selected his next shot he was deliberate in his movements graham went up to the tape and said for christs sake get out of there this is a crime scene you cant take pictures in there the man didnt respond he kept moving backward graham turned away who is this guy ishiguro said this is our employee mr tanaka he works for nakamoto security i couldnt believe what i was seeing the japanese had their own employee wandering around inside the yellow tapes contaminating the crime scene it was outrageous get him out of there i said he is taking pictures he cant do that ishiguro said but this is for our corporate use i said i dont care mr ishiguro he cant be inside the yellow tape and he cant take pictures get him out of there and i want his film please very well ishiguro said something quickly in japanese i turned just in time to see tanaka slip under the yellow tape and disappear among the bluesuited men clustered by the elevator behind their heads i saw the elevator doors open and close son of a bitch i was getting angry mr ishiguro you are now obstructing an official police investigation ishiguro said calmly you must try to understand our position detective smith of course we have complete confidence in the los angeles police department but we must be able to undertake our own private inquiry and for that we must have their own private inquirythe son of a bitch i suddenly couldnt speak i clenched my teeth seeing red i was furious i wanted to arrest ishiguro i wanted to spin him around shove him up against the wall and snap the cuffs around his fucking wrists and perhaps i can be of assistance lieutenant a voice behind me said i turned it was john connor smiling cheerfully i stepped aside connor faced ishiguro bowed slightly and presented his card he spoke rapidly totsuzen shitsurei desuga jikoshokai wo shitemo yoroshii desuka watashi wa john connor to moshimasu meishi o dozo dozo yoroshiku john connor ishiguro said thejohn connor omeni kakarete koei desu watashi wa ishiguro desu dozo yoroshiku he was saying he was honored to meet him watashi no meishi desu dozo a graceful thank you but once the formalities were completed the conversation went so quickly i caught only an occasional word i was obliged to appear interested watching and nodding when in fact i had no idea what they were talking about once i heard connor refer to me as wakaimono which i knew meant his protege or apprentice several times he looked at me severely and shook his head like a regretful father it seemed he was apologizing for me i also heard him refer to graham as bushitsuke a disagreeable man but these apologies had their effect ishiguro calmed down dropping his shoulders he began to relax he even smiled finally he said then you will not check identification of our guests absolutely not connor said your honored guests are free to come and go as they wish i started to protest connor shot me a look identification is unnecessary connor continued speaking formally because i am sure that no guest of the nakamoto corporation could ever be involved in such an unfortunate incident fucking a graham said under his breath ishiguro was beaming but i was furious connor had contradicted me he had made me look like a fool and on top of that he wasnt following police procedure we could all be in trouble for that later on angrily i shoved my hands in my pockets and looked away i am grateful for your delicate handling of this situation captain connor ishiguro said i have done nothing at all connor replied making another formal bow but i hope you will now agree it is appropriate to clear the floor so the police may begin their investigation ishiguro blinked clear the floor yes connor said taking out a notebook and please assist me to know the names of the gentlemen standing behind you as you ask them to leave i am sorry the names of the gentlemen behind you please may i ask why connors face darkened and he barked a short phrase in japanese i didnt catch the words but ishiguro turned bright red excuse me captain but i see no reason for you to speak in this and then connor lost his temper spectacularly and explosively he moved close to ishiguro making sharp stabbing motions with his finger while he shouted iikagen ni shiro soko o doke kiiterunoka ishiguro ducked and turned away stunned by this verbal assault connor leaned over him his voice hard and sarcastic doke doke wakaranainoka he turned and pointed furiously toward the japanese men by the elevator confronted with connors naked anger the japanese looked away and puffed anxiously on their cigarettes but they did not leave hey richie connor said calling to the crime unit photographer richie walters get me some ids of these guys will you sure captain richie said he raised his camera and began moving down the line of men firing his strobe in quick succession ishiguro suddenly got excited stepping in front of the camera holding up his hands wait a minute wait a minute what is this but the japanese men were already leaving wheeling away like a school of fish from the strobe flash in a few seconds they were gone we had the floor to ourselves alone ishiguro looked uncomfortable he said something in japanese apparently it was the wrong thing oh connor said youare to blame here he said to ishiguro youare the cause of all these troubles and youwill see that my detectives get any assistance they need i want to speak to the person who discovered the body and the person who called in the original report i want the name of every person who has been on this floor since the body was discovered and i want the film from tanakas camera ore wa honkida i will arrest you if you obstruct this investigation further but i must consult my superiors namerunayo connor leaned close dont fuck with me ishigurosan now leave and let us work of course captain he said with a tight brief bow he left his face pinched and unhappy graham chuckled you told him off pretty good connor spun what were you doing telling him you were going to interrogate everybody at the party aw shit i was just winding him up graham said theres no way im going to interrogate the mayor can i help it if these assholes have no sense of humor they have a sense of humor connor said and the joke is on you because ishiguro had a problem and he solved it with your help myhelp graham was frowning whatre you talking about its clear the japanese wanted to delay the investigation connor said your aggressive tactics gave them the perfect excuse to call for the special services liaison oh come on graham said for all they know the liaison could have been here in five minutes connor shook his head dont kid yourself they knew exactly who was on call tonight they knew exactly how far away smith would be and exactly how long it would take him to get here and they managed to delay the investigation an hour and a half nice work detective graham stared at connor for a long moment then he turned away fuck he said thats a load of bullshit and you know it fellas im going to work richie mount up you got thirty seconds to document before my guys come in and step on your tail lets go everybody i want to get finished before she starts to smell too bad and he lumbered off toward the crime scene with their suitcases and evidence carts the sid team trailed after graham richie walters led the way shooting left and right as he worked his way forward into the atrium then going through the door into the conference room the walls of the conference room were smoked glass which dimmed his flash but i could see him inside circling the body he was shooting a lot he knew this was a big case i stayed behind with connor i said i thought you told me it was bad form to lose your temper with the japanese it is connor said then why did you lose yours unfortunately he said it was the only way to assist ishiguro to assistishiguro yes i did all that for ishiguro because he had to save face in front of his boss ishiguro wasnt the most important man in the room one of the japanese standing by the elevator was the juyaku the real boss i didnt notice i said its common practice to put a lesser man in front while the boss stays in the background where he is free to observe progress just as i did with you kohai ishiguros boss was watching all the time yes and ishiguro clearly had orders not to allow the investigation to begin i needed to start the investigation but i had to do it in such a way that he would not look incompetent so i played the outofcontrol gaijin now he owes me a favor which is good because i may need his help later on he owes you a favor i said having trouble with this idea connor had just screamed at ishiguro thoroughly humiliating him as far as i was concerned connor sighed even if you dont understand what happened believe me ishiguro understands very well he had a problem and i helped him i still didnt really understand and i started to say more but connor held up his hand i think we better take a look at the scene before graham and his men screw things up any more than they already have itd been almost two years since i worked the detective division and it felt good to be around a homicide again it brought back memories the nighttime tension the adrenaline rush of bad coffee in paper cups and all the teams working around you its a kind of crazy energy circling the center where somebody is lying dead every homicide crime scene has that same energy and that finality at the center when you look at the dead person there is a kind of obviousness and at the same time there is an impossible mystery even in the simplest domestic brawl where the woman finally decided to shoot the guy youd look at her all covered in scars and cigarette burns and you had to ask why tonight what was it about tonight its always clear what you are seeing and theres always something that doesnt add up both things at once and at a homicide you have the sense of being right down to the basic truths of existence the smells and the defecation and the bloating usually somebodys crying so youre listening to that and the usual bullshit stops somebody died and its an unavoidable fact like a rock in the road that makes all the traffic go around it and in that grim and real setting this camaraderie springs up because youre working late with people you know and actually know very well because you see them all the time la has four homicides a day theres another one every six hours and every detective at the crime scene already has ten homicides dragging on his backlog which makes this new one an intolerable burden so he and everybody else is hoping to solve it on the spot to get it out of the way there is that kind of finality and tension and energy all mixed together and after you do it for a few years you get so you like it and to my surprise as i entered the conference room i realized that i missed it the conference room was elegant black table black highbacked leather chairs the lights of the nighttime skyscrapers beyond the glass walls inside the room the technicians talked quietly as they moved around the body of the dead girl she had blond hair cut short blue eyes full mouth she looked about twentyfive tall with a longlimbed athletic look her dress was black and sheer graham was well into his examination he was down at the end of the table squinting at the girls black patent high heels a penlight in one hand his notebook in another kelly the coroners assistant was taping the girls hands in paper bags to protect them connor stopped him just a minute connor looked at one hand inspecting the wrist peering closely under the fingernails he sniffed under one nail then he flicked the fingers rapidly one after another dont bother graham said laconically theres no rigor mortis yet and no detritus under the nails no skin or cloth fibers in fact id say there arent many signs of a struggle at all kelly slipped the bag over the hand connor said to him you have a time of death im working on it kelly lifted the girls buttocks to place the rectal probe the axillary thermocouples are already in place well know in a minute connor touched the fabric of the black dress checked the label helen part of the sid team said its a yamamoto i see that connor said whats a yamamoto i said helen said very expensive japanese designer this little black nothing is at least five thousand dollars thats assuming she bought it used new its maybe fifteen thousand is it traceable connor asked her maybe depends on whether she bought it here or in europe or tokyo itll take a couple of days to check connor immediately lost interest never mind thatll be too late he produced a small fiberoptic penlight which he used to inspect the girls scalp and hair then he looked quickly at each ear giving a little murmur of surprise at the right ear i peered over his shoulder and saw a drop of dried blood at the pierced hole for her earring i must have been crowding connor because he glanced up at me excuse me kohai i stepped back sorry next connor sniffed the girls lips opened and closed her jaw rapidly and poked around inside her mouth using his penlight as a probe then he turned her head from side to side on the table making her look left and right he spent some time feeling gently along her neck almost caressing it with his fingers and then quite abruptly he stepped away from the body and said all right im finished and he walked out of the boardroom graham looked up he never was worth a damn at a crime scene i said why do you say that i hear hes a great detective oh hell graham said you can see for yourself he doesnt even know what to do doesnt know procedure connors no detective connor has connections thats how he solved all those cases hes so famous for you remember the arakawa honeymoon shootings no i guess it was before your time peteysan when was that arakawa case kelly seventysix kelly said right seventysix big fucking case that year mr and mrs arakawa a young couple visiting los angeles on their honeymoon are standing on the curb in east la when they get gunned down from a passing car driveby gangstyle shooting worse at autopsy it turns out mrs arakawa was pregnant the press has a field day lapd cant handle gang violence is the way the story goes letters and money come from all over the city everyone is upset about what happened to this fresh young couple and of course the detectives assigned to the case dont discover shit i mean a case involving murdered japanese nationals theyre getting nowhere so after a week connor is called in and he solves it in one day a fucking miracle of detection i mean its a week later the physical evidence is long gone the bodies of the honeymooners are back in osaka the street corner where it happened is piled high in wilted flowers but connor is able to show that the youthful mr arakawa is actually quite a bad boy in osaka he shows that the streetcorner gangland shooting is actually a yakuzakilling contracted in japan to take place in america and he shows that the nasty husband is the innocent bystander they were really gunning for the wife knowing she was pregnant because its herfather they wanted to teach a lesson so connor turns it all around pretty fucking amazing huh and you think he did it all with his japanese connections you tell me graham said all i know is pretty soon after that he goes to japan for a year doing what i heard he worked as a security guy for a grateful japanese company they took care of him is what it amounted to he did a job for them and they paid off anyway thats the way i figure it nobody really knows but the man is not a detective christ just look at him now out in the atrium connor was staring up at the high ceiling in a dreamy reflective way he looked first in one direction and then another he seemed to be trying to make up his mind suddenly he walked briskly toward the elevators as if he were leaving then without warning he turned on his heel and walked back to the center of the room and stopped next he began to inspect the leaves on the potted palm trees scattered around the room graham shook his head what is this gardening im telling you hes a strange guy you know hes gone to japan more than once he always comes back it never works out for him japan is like a woman that he cant live with and cant live without you know myself i dont fucking get it i like america at least whats left of it he turned to the sid team which was moving outward from the body you guys find those panties for me yet not yet tom were looking tom i said what panties graham lifted the girls skirt your friend john couldnt be bothered to finish his examination but id say theres something significant here id say thats seminal fluid oozing out of the vagina shes not wearing panties and theres a red line at the groin where they were ripped off external genitals are red and raw its pretty clear she had forcible intercourse before she was killed so im asking the boys to find the panties one of the sid team said maybe she wasnt wearing any graham said she was wearing them all right i turned back to kelly what about drugs he shrugged well get lab values on all fluids but to the eye she looks clean very clean i noticed that kelly was distinctly uneasy now graham saw it too for christs sake what are you hangdog about kelly we keeping you from a latenight date or what no kelly said but to tell you the truth not only is there no evidence of a struggle or of drugs i dont see any evidence that she was murdered at all graham said no evidence she was murdered are you kidding kelly said the girl has throat injuries that suggest she may have been into one of the sexual bondage syndromes she has signs beneath the makeup that shes been tied up before repeatedly so so technically speaking maybe she wasnt murdered maybe she experienced sudden death from natural causes aw christ come on its quite possible this is a case of what we call death from inhibition instantaneous physiological death meaning what he shrugged the person just dies for no reason at all well not exactly theres usually minor trauma involving the heart or nerves but the trauma isnt sufficient to cause death i had one case where a tenyearold kid got hit in the chest with a baseball not very hard and fell down dead in the school yard nobody within twenty meters of him another case a woman had a minor car accident banged into the steering wheel with her chest not very hard and while she was opening the car door to get out she dropped dead it seems to happen where there is neck or chest injury which may irritate the nerves running to the heart so yeah tom technically sudden death is a distinct possibility and since having sex is not a felony it wouldnt be murder graham squinted so youre saying maybe nobodykilled her kelly shrugged he picked up his clipboard im not putting any of this down im listing the cause of death as asphyxiation secondary to manual strangulation because the odds are she was strangled but you should file it away in the back of your mind that maybe she wasnt maybe she just popped off fine graham said well file it under medical examiners fantasies meanwhile any of you guys got an id on her the sid team still searching the room murmured no kelly said i think i got a time of death he checked his temperature probes and read off a chart i register a core of ninetysix point nine in this ambient room temperature thats consistent with up to three hours postmortem up to three hours thats great listen kelly we already knew she died sometimetonight its the best i can do kelly shook his head unfortunately the cooling curves dont discriminate well for under three hours all i can say is death occurred sometime within three hours but my impression is that this girl has been dead a while frankly i would say its close to three hours graham turned to the sid team anybody find the panties yet not so far lieutenant graham looked around the room and said no purse no panties i said you think somebody cleaned up here i dont know he said but doesnt a girl whos coming to a party in a thirtythousanddollar dress usually carry a purse then graham looked past my shoulder and smiled well what do you know peteysan one of your admirers to see you striding toward me was ellen farley the mayors press secretary farley was thirtyfive dark blond hair cropped close to her head perfectly groomed as always she had been a newscaster when she was younger but had worked for the mayors office for many years ellen farley was smart fast on her feet and she had one of the great bodies which as far as anyone knew she retained for her own exclusive use i liked her enough to have done a couple of favors for her when i was in the lapd press office since the mayor and the chief of police hated each other requests from the mayors office sometimes passed from ellen to me and i handled them mostly small things delaying the release of a report until the weekend so itd run on saturday or announcing that charges in a case hadnt been brought yet even though they had i did it because farley was a straight shooter who always spoke her mind and it looked like she was going to speak her mind now listen pete she said i dont know whats going on here but the mayors been hearing some pretty strong complaints from a mr ishiguro i can imagine and the mayor asked me to remind you that there is no excuse for officials of this city to be rude to foreign nationals graham said loudly especially when they make such large campaign contributions foreign nationals cant contribute to american political campaigns farley said you know that she lowered her voice this is a sensitive case pete i want you to be careful you know the japanese have a special concern about how they are treated in america okay fine she looked through the glass walls of the conference room toward the atrium is that john connor yes i thought he was retired whats he doing here helping me on the case farley frowned you know the japanese have mixed feelings about him they have a term for it for somebody who is a japan lover and goes to the other extreme and turns into a basher connor isnt a basher ishiguro felt roughly treated ishiguro was telling us what to do i said and we have a murdered girl here which everybody seems to be forgetting come on pete she said nobodys trying to tell you how to do your job all im saying is you have to take into account the special she stopped she was looking at the body ellen i said do you know her no she turned away you sure i could see she was rattled graham said you saw her downstairs earlier i dont maybe i think so listen fellas ive got to get back ellen come on i dont know who she is pete you know id tell you if i did just keep it cordial with the japanese thats all the mayor wanted me to say ive got to go now she hurried back toward the elevators i watched her leave feeling uneasy graham came over and stood beside me shes got a great ass he said but she aint leveling buddy even with you i said what do you mean even with me everybody knows you and farley were an item what are you talking about graham punched me on the shoulder come on youre divorced now nobody gives a shit i said its not true tom you can do what you want handsome guy like you im telling you its not true okay fine he held up his hands my mistake i watched farley at the other end of the atrium ducking under the tape she pressed the elevator button and waited for it to come tapping her foot impatiently i said you really think she knows who the girl is damn right she does graham said you know why the mayor likes her she stands by his side and whispers everybodys name to him people she hasnt seen for years husbands wives children everyone farley knows who this girl is then why didnt she tell us fuck graham said must be important to somebody she took off like a shot didnt she i tell you we better figure out who this dead girl is because i fucking hate being the last one in town to know connor was across the room waving to us what does he want now graham said waving like that whats he got in his hand looks like a purse i said cheryl lynn austin connor said reading born midland texas graduate of texas state twentythree years old got an apartment in westwood but hasnt been here long enough to change her texas drivers license the contents of the purse were spread out on a desk we pushed them around with pencils whered you find this purse i asked it was a small dark beaded clutch with a pearl clasp a vintage forties purse expensive it was in the potted palm near the conference room connor unzipped a tiny compartment a tight roll of crisp hundreddollar bills tumbled onto the table very nice miss austin is well taken care of i said no car keys no so she came with somebody and evidently intended to leave with somebody too taxis cant break a hundreddollar bill there was also a gold american express card lipstick and a compact a pack of mild seven menthol cigarettes a japanese brand a card for the daimatsu night club in tokyo four small blue pills that was about it using his pencil connor upended the beaded purse small green flecks spilled out onto the table know what that is no i said graham looked at it with a magnifying glass connor said its wasabicovered peanuts wasabiis green horseradish served in japanese restaurants i had never heard of wasabicovered peanuts i dont know if theyre sold outside japan graham grunted ive seen enough so what do you think now john is ishiguro going to get those witnesses you asked for i wouldnt expect them soon connor said fucking right graham said we wont see those witnesses until day after tomorrow after their lawyers have briefed them on exactly what to say he stepped away from the table you realize why theyre delaying us a japanese killed this girl thats what were dealing with its possible connor said hey buddy more than possible were here this is their building and that girl is just the type they go for the american beauty longstemmed rose you know all those little guys want to fuck a volleyball player connor shrugged possibly come on graham said you know those guys eat shit all day long at home crammed into subways working in big companies cant say what they think then they come over here away from the constraints of home and suddenly theyre rich and free they can do whatever they want and sometimes one of them goes a little crazy tell me im wrong connor looked at graham for a long time finally he said so as you see it tom a japanese killer decided to dispatch this girl on the nakamoto boardroom conference table right as a symbolic act graham shrugged christ who knows were not talking normality here but ill tell you one thing im going to get the fucker who did this if its the last goddamned thing i do the elevator descended rapidly connor leaned against the glass there are many reasons to dislike the japanese he said but graham knows none of them he sighed you know what they say about us what they say americans are too eager to make theories they say we dont spend enough time observing the world and so we dont know how things actually are is that a zen idea no he laughed just an observation ask a computer salesman what he thinks of his american counterparts and hell tell you that everyone in japan who deals with americans thinks it and when you look at graham you realize theyre right graham has no real knowledge no firsthand experience he just has a collection of prejudices and media fantasies he doesnt know anything about the japanese and it never occurs to him to find out i said then you think hes wrong the girl wasnt killed by a japanese i didnt say that kohai connor replied its very possible graham is right but at the moment the doors opened and we saw the party heard the band playing moonlight serenade two partygoing couples stepped into the elevator they looked like real estate people the men silverhaired and distinguished looking the women pretty and slightly tacky one woman said shes smaller than i thought yes tiny and that was that her boyfriend i guess wasnt he the one in the video with her i think that was him one of the men said you think she had her boobs done hasnt everybody the other woman giggled except me of course right christine but im thinking about it did you see emily oh she did hers so big well jane started it blame her now everyone wants them big the men turned and looked out the window hell of a building one said detailing is fantastic must have cost a fortune you doing much with the japanese now ron about twenty percent the other man said thats way down from last year its made me work on my golf game because they always want to play golf twenty percent of your business yeah theyre buying up orange county now of course they already own los angeles one of the women said laughing well just about they have the arco building over there the man said pointing out the window i guess by now they have seventy seventyfive percent of downtown los angeles and more in hawaii hell they ownhawaii ninety percent of honolulu a hundred percent of the kona coast putting up golf courses like mad one woman said will this party be on ettomorrow they had enough cameras here lets remember to watch the elevator said mosugu de gozaimasu we came to the garage floor and the people got off connor watched them go and shook his head in no other country in the world he said would you hear people calmly discussing the fact that their cities and states were sold to foreigners discussing i said theyre the ones doing the selling yes americans are eager to sell it amazes the japanese they think were committing economic suicide and of course theyre right as he spoke connor pressed a button on the elevator panel marked emergency only a soft pinging alarm sounded whatd you do that for connor looked at a video camera mounted in the corner of the ceiling and waved cheerfully a voice on the intercom said good evening officers can i help you yes connor said am i speaking to building security thats right sir is something wrong with your elevator where are you located were on the lobby level southeast corner behind the elevators thank you very much connor said he pushed the button for the lobby the security office of the nakamoto tower was a small room perhaps five meters by seven it was dominated by three large flat video panels each divided into a dozen smaller monitor views at the moment most of these were black rectangles but one row showed images from the lobby and the garage another row showed the party in progress and a third row showed the police teams up on the fortysixth floor jerome phillips was the guard on duty he was a black man in his midforties his gray nakamoto security uniform was soaked around the collar and dark under the armpits he asked us to leave the door open as we entered he appeared noticeably uneasy to have us there i sensed he was hiding something but connor approached him in a friendly way we showed our badges and shook hands connor managed to convey the idea that we were all security professionals having a little chat together must be a busy night for you mr phillips yeah sure the party and everything and crowded in this little room he wiped sweat from his forehead boy you got that right all of them packed in here jesus i said all of who connor looked at me and said after the japanese left the fortysixth floor they came down here and watched us on the monitors isnt that right mr phillips phillips nodded not all of em but quite a few down here smoking their damn cigarettes staring and puffing and passing around faxes faxes oh yeah every few minutes somebodyd bring in another fax you know in japanese writing theyd all pass it around make comments then one of em would leave to send a fax back and the rest would stay to watch you guys up on the floor connor said and listen too phillips shook his head no we dont have audio feeds im surprised connor said this equipment seems so uptodate uptodate hell its the most advanced in the world these people i tell you one thing these people do it right they have the best fire alarm and fire prevention system the best earthquake system and of course the best electronic security system best cameras detectors everything i can see that connor said thats why i was surprised they dont have audio no no audio they do highresolution video only dont ask me why something to do with the cameras and how theyre hooked up is all i know on the flat panels i saw five different views of the fortysixth floor as seen from different cameras apparently the japanese had installed cameras all over the floor i remembered how connor had walked around the atrium staring up at the ceiling he must have spotted the cameras then now i watched graham in the conference room directing the teams he was smoking a cigarette which was completely against regulations at a crime scene i saw helen stretch and yawn meanwhile kelly was getting ready to move the girls body off the table onto a gurney before zipping it into the bag and he was then it hit me they had cameras up there five different cameras covering every part of the floor i said oh my god and i spun around very excited i was about to say something when connor smiled at me in an easy way and placed his hand on my shoulder he squeezed my shoulder hard lieutenant he said the pain was incredible i tried not to wince yes captain i wonder if youd mind if i asked mr phillips one or two questions no captain go right ahead perhaps youd take notes good idea captain he released my shoulder i got out my notepad connor sat on the edge of the table and said have you been with nakamoto security long mr phillips yes sir about six years now i started over in their la habra plant and when i hurt my leg in a car accident and couldnt walk so good they moved me to security in the plant because i wouldnt have to walk around you see then when they opened the torrance plant they moved me over there my wife got a job in the torrance plant too they do toyota subassemblies then when this building opened they brought me here to work nights i see six years altogether yes sir you must like it well i tell you its a secure job thats something in america i know they dont think much of black folks but they always treated me okay and hell before this i worked for gm in van nuys and thats you know thats gone yes connor said sympathetically that place phillips said shaking his head at the memory christ the management assholes they used to send down to the floor you couldnt believe it mb fucking a out of detroit little weenies didnt know shit they didnt know how the line worked they didnt know a tool from a die but theyd still order the foremen around theyre all pulling in two hundred fucking thousand a year and they didnt know shit and nothing ever worked right the cars were all a piece of shit but here he said tapping the counter here i got a problem or something doesnt work i tell somebody and they come right down and they know the system how it works and we go over the problem together and it gets fixed right away problems get fixed here thats the difference i tell you these people pay attention so you like it here they always treated me okay phillips said nodding that didnt exactly strike me as a glowing endorsement i had the feeling this guy wasnt committed to his employers and a few questions could drive the wedge all we had to do was encourage the break loyalty is important connor said nodding sympathetically it is to them he said they expect you to show all this enthusiasm for the company so you know i always come in fifteen or twenty minutes early and stay fifteen or twenty minutes after the shift is over they like you to put in the extra time i did the same at van nuys but nobody ever noticed and when is your shift i work nine to seven and tonight what time did you come on duty quarter to nine like i said i come in fifteen minutes early the original call had been recorded about eightthirty so if this man came at a quarter to nine he would have arrived almost fifteen minutes too late to see the murder who was on duty before you well usually its ted cole but i dont know if he worked tonight why is that the guard wiped his forehead with his sleeve and looked away why is that mr phillips i said with a little more force the guard blinked and frowned saying nothing connor said quietly because ted cole wasnt here when mr phillips arrived tonight was he mr phillips the guard shook his head no he wasnt i started to ask another question but connor raised his hand i imagine mr phillips you must have been pretty surprised when you came in this room at a quarter to nine you damn right i was phillips said what did you do when you saw the situation well right away i said to the guy can i help you very polite but still firm i mean this isthe security room and i dont know who this guy is ive never seen him before and the guy is tense verytense he says to me get out of my way real pushy like he owns the world and he shoves past me taking his briefcase with him i say excuse me sir ill have to see some identification he dont answer me he just keeps going out the lobby and down the stairs you didnt try and stop him no sir i didnt because he was japanese you got that right but i called up to central security its up on the ninth floor to say i found a man in the room and they say dont worry everything is fine but i can hear theyre tense too everybody is tense and then i see on the monitor the dead girl so thats the first i knew what it was about connor said the man you saw can you describe him the guard shrugged thirty thirtyfive medium height dark blue suit like they all wear actually he was more hip than most of them he had this tie with triangles on it oh and a scar on his hand like a burn or something which hand the left hand i noticed it when he was closing the briefcase could you see inside the briefcase no but he was closing it when you came in the room yes was it your impression he took something from this room i really couldnt say sir phillipss evasiveness began to annoy me i said what do you think he took connor shot me a look the guard went bland i really dont know sir connor said of course you dont theres no way you could know what was in somebody elses briefcase by the way do you make recordings from the security cameras here yes we do could you show me how you do that sure thing the guard got up from the desk and opened a door at the far end of the room we followed him into a second small room almost a closet stacked floor to ceiling with small metal boxes each with stenciled notations in japanese kanjiscript and numbers in english each with a glowing red light and an led counter with numbers running forward phillips said these are our recorders they lay down signals from all the cameras in the building theyre eightmillimeter highdefinition video he held up a small cassette like an audio cassette each one of these records eight hours we change over at nine pm so thats the first thing i do when i come on duty i pop out the old ones and switch over to the fresh ones and did you change cassettes tonight at nine oclock yes sir just like always and what do you do with the tapes you remove keep em in the trays down here he said bending to show us several long thin drawers we keep everything off the cameras for seventytwo hours thats three days so we keep nine sets of tapes all together and we just rotate each set through once every three days get me connor hesitated perhaps id better write this down he produced a small pad and a pen now each tape lasts eight hours so you have nine different sets right right connor wrote for a moment then shook his pen irritably this damn pen its out of ink you have a wastebasket phillips pointed to the corner over there thank you connor threw the pen away i gave him mine he resumed his notes you were saying mr phillips that you have nine sets right each set is numbered with letters from a to i now when i come in at nine i eject the tapes and see whatever letter is already in there and put in the next one like tonight i took out set c so i put in set d which is whats recording now i see connor said and then you put tape set c in one of the drawers here right he pulled open a drawer this one here connor said may i he glanced at the neatly labeled row of tapes then he quickly opened the other drawers and looked at the other stacks of tapes except for the different letters all the drawers looked identical i think i understand now connor said what you actually do is use nine sets in rotation exactly so each set gets used once every three days right and how long has the security office been using this system the buildings new but weve been going oh maybe two months now i must say its a very wellorganized system connor said appreciatively thank you for explaining it to us i have only a couple of other questions sure first of all these counters here connor said pointing to the led counters on the video recorders they seem to show the elapsed times since the tapes began recording is that right because its now almost eleven oclock and you put in the tapes at nine and the top recorder says and the next recorder says and so on yes thats right i put the tapes in one right after another it takes a few seconds between tapes i see these all show almost two hours but i notice that one recorder down here shows an elapsed time of only thirty minutes does that mean its broken huh phillips said frowning i guess maybe it is cause i changed the tapes all one after another like i said but these recorders are the latest technology sometimes there are glitches or we had some power problems could be that yes quite possibly connor said can you tell me which camera is hooked to this recorder yes of course phillips read the number off the recorder and went out to the main room with the monitor screens its camera foursix slash six he said this view here he tapped the screen it was an atrium camera and it showed an overall view of the fortysixth floor but you see phillips said the beauty of the system is even if one recorder screws up there are still other cameras on that floor and the video recorders on the others seem to be working okay yes they do connor said by the way can you tell me why there are so many cameras on the fortysixth floor you didnt hear it from me phillips said but you know how they like efficiency the word is they are going to kaizenthe office workers so basically these cameras have been installed to observe workers during the day and help them improve their efficiency thats what i heard well i think thats it connor said oh one more question do you have an address for ted cole phillips shook his head no i dont have you ever been out with him socialized with him i have but not much hes an odd guy ever been to his apartment no hes kind of secretive i think he lives with his mother or something we usually go to this bar the palomino over by the airport he likes it there connor nodded and one last question where is the nearest pay phone out in the lobby and around to your right by the restrooms but youre welcome to use the phone here connor shook the guards hand warmly mr phillips i appreciate your taking the time to talk to us no problem i gave the guard my card if you think of anything later that could help us mr phillips dont hesitate to call me and i left connor stood at the pay phone in the lobby it was one of those new standing booths that has two receivers one on either side allowing two people to talk on the same line at once these booths had been installed in tokyo years ago and now were starting to show up all over los angeles of course pacific bell no longer was the principal provider of american public pay phones japanese manufacturers had penetrated that market too i watched connor write down the phone number in his notebook what are you doing we have two separate questions to answer tonight one is how the girl came to be killed on an office floor but we also need to find out who placed the original call notifying us of the murder and you think the call might have been placed from this phone possibly he closed his notebook and glanced at his watch its late we better get going i think were making a big mistake here why is that connor asked i dont know if we should leave the tapes in that security room what if somebody switches them while were gone theyve already been switched connor said how do you know i gave up a perfectly good pen to find out he said now come on he started walking toward the stairs leading down to the garage i followed him you see connor said when phillips first explained that simple system of rotation it was immediately clear to me that there might have been a switch the question was how to prove it his voice echoed in the concrete stairwell connor continued down taking the steps two at a time i hurried to keep up connor said if somebody switched the tapes how would they go about it they would be working hastily under pressure theyd be terrified of making a mistake they certainly wouldnt want to leave any incriminating tapes behind so probably theyd switch an entire set and replace it but replace it with what they cant just put in the next set since there are only nine sets of tapes all together it would be too easy for someone to notice that one set was missing and the total was now eight there would be an obvious empty drawer no they would have to replace the set they were taking away with an entirely new set twenty brandnew tapes and that meant i ought to check the trash thats why you threw your pen away yes i didnt want phillips to know what i was doing and the trash was full of crumpled plastic wrappers the kind that new videotapes come wrapped in i see once i knew the tapes had been replaced the only remaining question was which set so i played dumb and looked in all the drawers you probably noticed that set c the set phillips removed when he came on duty had slightly whiter labels than the other sets it was subtle because the office has only been active two months but you could tell i see somebody had come into the security room taken out twenty fresh tapes unwrapped them written new labels and popped them into the video machines replacing the original tapes that had recorded the murder i said if you ask me phillips knows more about this than he was telling us maybe connor said but we have more important things to do anyway theres a limit to what he knows the murder was phoned in about eightthirty phillips arrived at quarter to nine so he never saw the murder we can assume the previous guard cole did but by a quarter of nine cole was gone and an unknown japanese man was in the security room closing up a briefcase you think hes the one who switched the tapes connor nodded very possibly in fact i wouldnt be surprised if this man was the killer himself i hope to find that out at miss austins apartment he threw open the door and we went into the garage a line of party guests waited for valets to bring their cars i saw ishiguro chatting up mayor thomas and his wife connor steered me toward them standing alongside the mayor ishiguro was so cordial he was almost obsequious he gave us a big smile ah gentlemen is your investigation proceeding satisfactorily is there anything more i can do to help i didnt get really angry until that moment until i saw the way he toadied up in front of the mayor it made me so mad i began to turn red but connor took it in stride thank you ishigurosan he said with a slight bow the investigation is going well youre receiving all the help you requested ishiguro said oh yes connor said everyone has been very cooperative good good im glad ishiguro glanced at the mayor and smiled at him too he was all smiles it seemed but connor said there is just one thing just name it if there is anything we can do the security tapes seem to have been removed security tapes ishiguro frowned clearly caught off guard yes connor said recordings from the security cameras i dont know anything about that ishiguro said but let me assure you if any tapes exist they are yours to examine thank you connor said unfortunately it seems the crucial tapes have been removed from the nakamoto security office removed gentlemen i believe there must be some mistake the mayor was watching this exchange closely connor said perhaps but i dont think so it would be reassuring mr ishiguro if you were to look into this matter yourself i certainly will ishiguro said but i must say again i cant imagine captain connor that any tapes are missing thank you for checking mr ishiguro connor said not at all captain he said still smiling it is my pleasure to assist you in whatever way i can the son of a bitch i said we were driving west on the santa monica freeway the little prick looked us right in the eye and lied its annoying connor said but you see ishiguro takes a different view now that he is beside the mayor he sees himself in another context with another set of obligations and requirements for his behavior since he is sensitive to context hes able to act differently with no reference to his earlier behavior to us he seems like a different person but ishiguro feels hes just being appropriate what burns me is he acted so confident of course he did connor said and he would be quite surprised to learn that youre angry with him you consider him immoral he considers you naive because for a japanese consistent behavior is not possible a japanese becomes a different person around people of different rank he becomes a different person when he moves through different rooms of his own house yeah i said thats fine but the fact is hes a lying son of a bitch connor looked at me would you talk that way to your mother of course not so you change according to context too connor said the fact is we all do its just that americans believe there is some core of individuality that doesnt change from one moment to the next and the japanese believe context rules everything it sounds to me i said like an excuse for lying he doesnt see it as lying but thats what it is connor shrugged only from your point of view kohai not from his the hell look its your choice you can understand the japanese and deal with them as they are or you can get pissed off but our problem in this country is that we dont deal with the japanese the way they really are the car hit a deep pothole bouncing so hard that the car phone fell off the receiver connor picked it up off the floor and put it back on the hook up ahead i saw the exit for bundy i moved into the right lane one thing im not clear about i said why do you think the man with the briefcase in the security room might be the killer its because of the time sequence you see the murder was reported at eight thirtytwo less than fifteen minutes later at eight fortyfive a japanese man was down there switching the tapes arranging a coverup thats a very fast response much too fast for a japanese company why is that japanese organizations are actually very slow to respond in a crisis their decisionmaking relies on precedents and when a situation is unprecedented people are uncertain how to behave you remember the faxes i am sure faxes have been flying back and forth to nakamotos tokyo headquarters all night undoubtedly the company is still trying to decide what to do a japanese organization simply cannot move fast in a new situation but an individual acting alone can yes exactly i said and thats why you think the man with the briefcase may be the killer connor nodded yes either the killer or someone closely connected with the killer but we should learn more at miss austins apartment i believe i see it up ahead on the right the imperial arms was an apartment building on a treelined street a kilometer from westwood village its fake tudor beams needed a paint job and the whole building had a rundown appearance but that was not unusual in this middleclass section of apartments inhabited by graduate students and young families in fact the chief characteristic of the imperial arms seemed to be its anonymity you could drive by the building every day and never notice it perfect connor said as we walked up the steps to the entrance its just what they like what who likes we came into the lobby which had been renovated in the most bland california style pastel wallpaper with a flower print overstuffed couches cheap ceramic lamps and a chrome coffee table the only thing to distinguish it from a hundred other apartment lobbies was the security desk in the corner where a heavyset japanese doorman looked up from his comic book with a distinctly unfriendly manner help you connor showed his badge he asked where cheryl austins apartment was i announce you the doorman said reaching for the phone dont bother no i announce maybe she have company now im sure she doesnt connor said kore wa keisatsu no shigoto da he was saying we were on official police business the doorman gave a tense bow kyugo shitu he handed connor a key we went through a second glass door and down a carpeted corridor there were small lacquer tables at each end of the corridor and in its simplicity the interior was surprisingly elegant typically japanese connor said with a smile i thought a rundown fake tudor apartment building in westwood typically japanese from a room to the left i heard faint rap music the latest hammer hit its because the outside gives no clue to the inside connor explained thats a fundamental principle of japanese thinking the public facade is unrevealing in architecture the human face everything its always been that way you look at old samurai houses in takayama or kyoto you cant tell anything from the outside this is a japanese building of course why else would a japanese national who hardly speaks english be the doorman and he is a yakuza you probably noticed the tattoo i hadnt the yakuzawere japanese gangsters i didnt know there were yakuzahere in america and said so you must understand connor said there is a shadow world here in los angeles in honolulu in new york most of the time youre never aware of it we live in our regular american world walking on our american streets and we never notice that right alongside our world is a second world very discreet very private perhaps in new york you will see japanese businessmen walking through an unmarked door and catch a glimpse of a club behind perhaps you will hear of a small sushi bar in los angeles that charges twelve hundred dollars a person tokyo prices but they are not listed in the guidebooks they are not a part of our american world they are part of the shadow world available only to the japanese and this place this is a bettaku a love residence where mistresses are kept and here is miss austins apartment connor unlocked the door with the key the doorman had given him we went inside it was a twobedroom unit furnished with expensive oversized rental pieces in pastel pink and green the oil paintings on the walls had been rented too a label on the side of one frame said breuners rents the kitchen counter was bare except for a bowl of fruit the refrigerator contained only yogurt and cans of diet coke the couches in the living room didnt look as if anybody had ever sat on them on the coffee table was a picture book of hollywood star portraits and a vase of dried flowers empty ashtrays scattered around one of the bedrooms had been converted to a den with a couch and a television and an exercise bike in the corner everything was brandnew the television still had a sticker that said digital tuning feature diagonally across one corner the handlebars of the exercise bike were covered in plastic wrap in the master bedroom i finally found some human clutter one mirrored closet door stood open and three expensive party dresses were thrown across the bed evidently she had been trying to decide what to wear on the dresser top were bottles of perfume a diamond necklace a gold rolex framed photographs and an ashtray with stubbedout mild seven menthol cigarettes the top dresser drawer containing panties and undergarments was partially open i saw her passport stuck in the corner and thumbed through it there was one visa for saudi arabia one for indonesia and three entry stamps for japan the stereo in the corner was still turned on an ejected tape in the player i pushed it in and jerry lee lewis sang you shake my nerves and you rattle my brain too much love drives a man insane texas music too old for a young girl like this but maybe she liked golden oldies i turned back to the dresser several framed color enlargements showed cheryl austin smiling in front of asian backgrounds the red gates of a shrine a formal garden a street with gray skyscrapers a train station the pictures seemed to be taken in japan in most of the pictures cheryl was alone but in a few she was accompanied by an older japanese man with glasses and a receding hairline a final shot showed her in what looked like the american west cheryl was standing near a dusty pickup truck smiling beside a frail grandmotherly woman in sunglasses the older woman wasnt smiling and looked uncomfortable tucked in beside the dresser were several large paper rolls standing on end i opened one it was a poster showing cheryl in a bikini smiling and holding up a bottle of asahi beer all the writing on the poster was in japanese i went into the bathroom i saw a pair of jeans kicked in the corner a white sweater tossed on the countertop a wet towel on a hook by the shower stall beads of water inside the stall electric haircurlers unplugged by the counter stuck in the mirror frame photos of cheryl standing with another japanese man on the malibu pier this man was in his midthirties and handsome in one photograph he had draped his arm familiarly over her shoulder i could clearly see the scar on his hand bingo i said connor came into the room find something our man with the scar good connor studied the picture carefully i looked back at the clutter of the bathroom the stuff around the sink you know i said something bothers me about this place whats that i know she hasnt lived here long and i know everything is rented but still i cant get over the feeling that this place has a contrived look i cant quite put my finger on why connor smiled very good lieutenant it does have a contrived look and theres a reason for it he handed me a polaroid photo it showed the bathroom we were standing in the jeans kicked in the corner the towel hanging the curlers on the counter but it was taken with one of those ultrawideangle cameras that distort everything the sid teams sometimes used them for evidence where did you get this from the trash bin in the hall by the elevators so it must have been taken earlier tonight yes notice anything different about the room i examined the polaroid carefully no it looks the same wait a minute those pictures stuck in her mirror they arent in the polaroid those pictures have been added exactly connor walked back into the bedroom he picked up one of the framed pictures on the dresser now look at this one he said miss austin and a japanese friend in shinjuku station in tokyo she was probably drawn to the kabukicho section or perhaps she was just shopping notice the righthand edge of the picture see the narrow strip thats lighter in color yes and i understood what that strip meant there had been another picture on top of this one the edge of this picture had stuck out and was sunfaded the overlying picture has been removed yes connor said the apartment has been searched yes connor said a very thorough job they came in earlier tonight took polaroids searched the rooms and then put things back the way they were but its impossible to do that exactly the japanese say artlessness is the most difficult art and these men cant help themselves theyre obsessive so they leave the picture frames a little too squaredoff on the counter and the perfume bottles a little too carefully cluttered everything is a little forced your eye can see it even if your brain doesnt register it i said but why search the room what pictures did they remove her with the killer thats not clear connor said evidently her association with japan and with japanese men was not objectionable but there was something they had to get right away and it can only be then from the living room a tentative voice said lynn honey you here she was silhouetted in the doorway looking in barefooted wearing shorts and a tank top i couldnt see her face well but she was obviously what my old partner anderson would call a snake charmer connor showed his badge she said her name was julia young she had a southern accent and a slight slur to her speech connor turned on the light and we could see her better she was a beautiful girl she came into the room hesitantly i heard the music is she here is cherylynn okay i know she went to that party tonight i havent heard anything connor said with a quick glance at me do you know cherylynn well sure i live right across the hall in number eight why is everybody in her room everybody well you two and the two japanese guys when were they here i dont know maybe half an hour ago is it something about cherylynn i said did you get a look at the men miss young i was thinking she might have been looking out of the peephole of her door well i guess i said hello to them hows that i know one of them pretty well eddie eddie eddie sakamura we all know eddie fast eddie i said can you describe him she gave me a funny look hes the guy in the pictures the young guy with the scar on his hand i thought everybody knew eddie sakamura hes in the newspaper all the time charities and stuff hes a big party guy i said do you have any idea how i could find him connor said eddie sakamura is part owner of a polynesian restaurant in beverly hills called bora bora he hangs out there thats him julia said that place is like his office i cant stand it myself its too noisy but eddies just running around chasing those big blondes he loves to look up to a girl she leaned against a table and pushed her full brown hair back from her face seductively she looked at me and gave a little pout you two guys partners yes i said he showed me his badge but you didnt show me yours i took out my wallet she looked at it peter she said reading my very first boyfriend was named peter but he wasnt as handsome as you she smiled at me connor cleared his throat and said have you been in cherylynns apartment before well i guess i live right across the way but she hasnt been in town much lately seems like shes always traveling traveling where all over new york washington seattle chicago all over she has this boyfriend who travels a lot she meets him actually i think she just meets him when his wife isnt around this boyfriend is married well theres something in the way you know obstructing do you know who he is no she once said hed never come to her apartment hes some big important guy real rich they send the jet for her and off she goes whoever he is he drives eddie crazy but eddie is the jealous type you know got to be iro otokoto all the girls the sexy lover connor said is cheryls relationship a secret with this boyfriend i dont know i never thought it was its just real intense shes madly in love with the guy shes madly in love you cant imagine ive seen her drop everything to run and meet him one night she comes over gives me two tickets to the springsteen concert but shes all excited because shes going to detroit shes got her little carryon in her hand shes got her little nicegirl dress on because he just called ten minutes ago and said meet me her face all bright she looks about five years old i dont know why she cant figure it out figure what out this guy is just using her why do you say that cherylynn is beautiful and real sophisticatedlooking shes worked all over the world as a model mostly in asia but deep down shes a smalltown girl i mean midland is an oil town theres lots of money but its still a small town and cherylynn wants the ring on the finger and the kids and the dog in the yard and this guy isnt going to do it she hasnt figured it out i said but you dont know who this man is no i dont a sly look crossed her face she shifted her body dropping one shoulder so her breasts thrust forward but youre not really here because of some old boyfriend are you connor nodded not really no julia smiled in a knowing way its eddie isnt it umm connor said i knew it she said i knew hed get in trouble sooner or later we all talked about it all the girls here in the arms she made a vague gesture because hes just going too fast fast eddie you wouldnt think he was japanese hes so flashy connor said hes from osaka his fathers a big industrialist there with daimatsu hes a nice old guy when he comes over to visit sometimes he sees one of the girls on the second floor and eddie eddie was supposed to get educated here for a few years then go home to work for the kaisha the company but he wont go home he loves it here why not hes got everything he buys a new ferrari every time he bangs up the old one hes got more money than god hes lived here long enough hes just like an american handsome sexy and with all the drugs you know real party animal whats in osaka for him i said but you said you always knew that hed get in trouble sure because of that crazy side that edge she shrugged a lot of them have it these guys come over from tokyo and even if they have a shokai an introduction you still have to be careful they think nothing of dropping ten or twenty thousand in a night its like a tip for them leave it on the dresser but then what they want to do at least some of them she drifted into silence her eyes had a vacant unfocused look i didnt say anything i just waited connor was looking at her nodding sympathetically abruptly she began to speak again as if unaware of the pause and to them she said their wishes their desires its just as natural as leaving the tip its completely natural to them i mean i dont mind a little golden shower or whatever handcuffs you know maybe a little spanking if i like the guy but i wont let anybody cut me i dont care how much money none of those things with knives or swords but they can be a lot of them they are so polite so correct but then they get turned on they have this this way she broke off shaking her head theyre strange people connor glanced at his watch miss young youve been very helpful we may need to speak to you again lieutenant smith will take your phone number yes of course i flipped open my pad connor said im going to have a word with the doorman shinichi she said connor left i took down julias number she licked her lips as she watched me write then she said you can tell me did he kill her who eddie did he kill cherylynn she was a pretty girl but i could see the excitement in her eyes she was looking at me with a steady gaze her eyes were shining it was creepy i said why do you ask because he was always threatening to like this afternoon he threatened her i said eddie was here this afternoon sure she shrugged hes here all the time he came to see her this afternoon real worked up they put extra soundproofing to the walls in this building when they took it over but even so you could hear them scream at each other in her apartment him and cherylynn shed have on her jerry lee lewis the one she played day and night until you just about went crazy and theyd be screaming and throwing things hed always say ill kill you ill kill you you bitch so did he i dont know but shes dead her eyes still shining yes it had to happen she said she seemed completely calm we all knew it it was just a matter of time if you want call me if you need more information yes i will i gave her my card and if you think of anything else you can call me at this number she slipped it into the hip pocket of her shorts twisting her body i like talking to you peter yes okay i walked down the corridor when i got to the end i looked back she was standing in her doorway waving goodbye connor was using the phone in the lobby while the doorman stared sullenly at him as if he wanted to stop him but couldnt think of a reason why thats right connor was saying all the outgoing calls from that phone between eight and ten pm thats right he listened for a moment well i dont care if your data isnt organized that way just get it for me how long will it take tomorrow dont be ridiculous what do you think this is i need it within two hours ill call you back yes fuck you too he hung up lets go kohai we walked outside to the car i said checking your contacts contacts he looked puzzled oh graham said something to you about my contacts i dont have any special informants he just thinks i do he mentioned the arakawa case connor sighed that old thing we walked toward the car you want to know that story its simple two japanese nationals get killed the department puts detectives on the case who cant speak japanese finally after a week they give the case to me and what did you do the arakawas were staying at the new otani hotel i got the phone records of the calls they made to japan i called those numbers and spoke to some people in osaka then i called osaka and talked to the police there again in japanese they were surprised to hear we didnt know the whole story i see not quite connor said because the police department here was very embarrassed the press had gone out on a limb criticizing the department all sorts of people had sent flowers there had been a big show of sympathy for what turned out to be gangsters a lot of people were embarrassed so the whole thing became my fault i had done something underhanded to solve the case pissed me off i can tell you thats why you went to japan no thats another story we came to the car i looked back at the imperial arms and saw julia young standing at the window staring down at us shes seductive i said the japanese call women like that shirigaru onna they say she has a light ass he opened the car door and got in but shes on drugs we cant trust anything she told us even so theres starting to be a pattern i dont like he glanced at his watch and shook his head damn were taking too long wed better go to the palomino to see mr cole i started driving south toward the airport connor sat back in his seat and folded his arms across his chest he stared at his feet looking unhappy why do you say theres a pattern you dont like connor said the wrappers in the waste basket the polaroid in the trash those things shouldnt have been left behind you said yourself theyre in a hurry maybe but you know the japanese think american police are incompetent this sloppiness is a sign of their disdain well were not incompetent connor shook his head compared to the japanese we areincompetent in japan every criminal gets caught for major crimes convictions run ninetynine percent so any criminal in japan knows from the outset he is going to get caught but here the conviction rate is more like seventeen percent not even one in five so a criminal in the states knows he probably isntgoing to get caught and if hes caught he wont be convicted thanks to all his legal safeguards and you know every study of police effectiveness shows that american detectives either solve the case in the first six hours or they never solve it at all so what are you saying im saying that a crime occurred here with the expectation that it wont be solved and i want to solve it kohai connor was silent for the next ten minutes he sat very still with his arms folded and his chin sunk on his chest his breathing was deep and regular i might have thought he had fallen asleep except his eyes were open i just drove the car and listened to him breathe finally he said ishiguro what about him if we knew what made ishiguro behave as he did wed understand this case i dont understand its hard for an american to see him clearly connor said because in america you think a certain amount of error is normal you expect the plane to be late you expect the mail to be undelivered you expect the washing machine to break down you expect things to go wrong all the time but japan is different everything worksin japan in a tokyo train station you can stand at a marked spot on the platform and when the train stops the doors will open right in front of you trains are on time bags are not lost connections are not missed deadlines are met things happen as planned the japanese are educated prepared and motivated they get things done theres no screwing around uhhuh and tonight was a very big night for the nakamoto corporation you can be sure they planned everything down to the smallest detail they have the vegetarian hors doeuvres that madonna likes and the photographer she prefers believe me theyre prepared they have planned for every exigency you know how they are they sit around and discuss endless possibilities what if theres a fire what if theres an earthquake a bomb scare power failure endlessly going over the most unlikely events its obsessive but when the final night arrives theyve thought of everything and theyre in complete control its very bad form not to be in control okay okay but there is our friend ishiguro the official representative of nakamoto standing in front of a dead girl and hes clearly not in control hes yoshiki no doing westernstyle confrontation but he isnt comfortable im sure you noticed the sweat on his lip and his hand is damp he keeps wiping it on his trousers he is rikutsuppoi too argumentative hes talking too much in short hes behaving as if he doesnt really know what to do as if he doesnt even know who this girl is which he certainly does since he knows everybody invited to that party and pretending he doesnt know who killed her when he almost certainly knows that too the car bounced in a pothole and jolted back up wait a minute ishiguro knows who killed the girl im sure of it and hes not the only one at least three people must know who killed her at this point didnt you say you used to be in press relations yes last year you keep any contacts in tv news a few i said they might be rusty why i want to look at some tape that was shot tonight just look not subpoena right just look that shouldnt be a problem i said i was thinking i could call jennifer lewis at knbc or bob arthur at kcbs probably bob connor said it has to be somebody you can approach personally otherwise the stations wont help us you noticed there were no tv crews at the crime scene tonight at most crime scenes you have to fight your way past the cameras just to get to the tape but tonight no tv crews no reporters nothing i shrugged we were on land lines the press couldnt monitor radio transmissions they were already there connor said covering the party with tom cruise and madonna and then a girl gets murdered on the floor above so where were the tv crews i said captain i dont buy it one of the things i learned as a press officer is that there arent any conspiracies the press is too diverse and in a sense too disorganized in fact on the rare occasions when we needed an embargo like a kidnapping with ransom negotiations in progress we had a hell of a time getting cooperation the paper closes early the tv crews have to make the eleven oclock news they probably went back to edit their stories i disagree i think the japanese expressed concern about their kigyo image their company image and the press cooperated with no coverage trust me kohai the pressure is being applied i cant believe that take my word for it connor said the pressure is on just then the car phone rang god damn it peter a familiar rough voice said what the fucks going on with that homicide investigation it was the chief it sounded like he had been drinking how do you mean chief connor looked at me and punched the speaker phone button so he could hear the chief said you guys harassing the japanese we going to have another set of racial allegations against the department here no sir i said absolutely not i dont know what youve heard i heard that dumb fuck graham was making insults as usual the chief said well i wouldnt exactly say insults chief look peter dont shit me i already reamed out fred hoffmann for sending graham in the first place i want that racist turd off the case weve all got to get along with the japanese from now on its the way the world is you hearing me peter yes sir now about john connor you got him with you is that right yes sir why did you bring him into this i thought why did ibring him in fred hoffmann must have decided to say that connor was my idea and not his own im sorry i said but i i understand the chief said you probably thought you couldnt handle the case yourself wanted some help but im afraid you bought more trouble than help because the japanese dont like connor and i got to tell you i go way back with john we entered the academy together back in fiftynine hes always been a loner and a troublemaker you know anybody who goes to live in some foreign country its because he cant fit in here at home i dont want him screwing up this investigation now chief this is how i see it peter you got a homicide here wrap it up and get it over with do it quick and do it neat im looking to you and you alone you hearing me yes sir the connection is good yes sir i said wrap it up pete the chief said i dont want anybody else calling me on this yes sir finish it by tomorrow latest thats it and he hung up i put the phone back in the cradle yes connor said id say pressure is being applied i drove south on the freeway toward the airport it was foggier here connor stared out the window in a japanese organization youd never get a call like that the chief just hung you out to dry he takes no responsibility its all your problem and hes blaming you for things that have nothing to do with you like graham and me connor shook his head the japanese dont do that the japanese have a saying fix the problem not the blame in american organizations its all about whofucked up whose head will roll in japanese organizations its about whats fucked up and how to fix it nobody gets blamed their way is better connor was silent staring out the window we were driving past slauson the marina freeway a dark curve arcing above us in the fog i said the chief was in the bag thats all yes and uninformed as usual but even so it sounds like wed better have this case solved before he gets out of bed tomorrow can we do that yes if ishiguro delivers those tapes the phone rang again i answered it it was ishiguro i handed the phone to connor i could hear ishiguro faintly through the receiver he sounded tense speaking rapidly a moshi moshi connorsan desuka keibi no heyani denwa shitan desuga ne daremo denain desuyo connor cupped his hand over the phone and translated he called the security guard but no one was there sorede chuokeibishitsu ni renraku shite hito wo okutte moraimashite issho ni tepu o kakunin shite kimashita then he called the main security office and asked them to come down with him to check the tapes tepu wa subete rekoda no naka ni arimasu nakunattemo torikaeraretemo imasen subete daijobu desu the tapes are all in the recorders no tapes are missing or switched connor frowned and replied iya tepu wa surikaerarete iru hazu nanda tepu o sagase dakara daijobu nandesu connorsan doshiro to iun desuka he insists everything is in order connor said tepu o sagase to me he said i told him i wanted the damn tapes daijobuda to itterudeshou doshite sonnaini tepu ni kodawarun desuka ore niwa wakatte irunda tepu wa nakunatte iru i know more than you think mr ishiguro moichido iu tepu o sagasunda connor banged the phone in the cradle and sat back snorting angrily bastards theyre taking the position that there are no missing tapes what does that mean i said theyve decided to play hardball connor stared out the window at the traffic and tapped his teeth with his finger theyd never do it unless they felt they had a strong position an unassailable position which means connor drifted off into his private thoughts i saw his face intermittently reflected in the glass under passing street lamps finally he said no no no as if he were talking to someone no what it cant be graham he shook his head graham is too risky too many ghosts from the past and its not me either im old news so it must be you peter i said what are you talking about something has happened connor said to make ishiguro think he has leverage and id guess its something to do with you me yeah its almost certainly something personal you have any problems in your past like what any priors arrests internal affairs investigations allegations of questionable conduct like drinking or homosexuality or chasing women any drug rehab program problems with partners problems with superiors anything personal or professional anything i shrugged jeez i dont think so connor just waited looking at me finally he said they think they have something peter im divorced im a single parent i have a daughter michelle shes two years old yes i lead a quiet life i take care of my kid im responsible and your wife my exwife is a lawyer in the das office when did you get divorced two years ago before the child was born just after why did you get divorced christ why does anybody get divorced connor said nothing we were only married a year she was young when we met twentyfour she had these fantasies about things we met in court she thought i was a rough tough detective facing danger every day she liked that i had a gun all that so we had this affair then when she got pregnant she didnt want to have an abortion she wanted to get married instead it was some romantic idea she had she didnt really think it through but the pregnancy was hard and it was too late to abort and pretty soon she decided she didnt like living with me because my apartment was small and i didnt make enough money and i lived in culver city instead of brentwood and by the time the baby was finally born it was like she was completely disillusioned she said she had made a mistake she wanted to pursue her career she didnt want to be married to a cop she didnt want to raise a kid she said she was sorry but it was all a mistake and she left connor was listening with his eyes closed yes i dont see why all this matters she left two years ago and after that i couldnt i didnt want to work detective hours any more because now i had to raise the kid so i took the tests and transferred to special services and i worked the press office no problems there everything went fine then last year this asian liaison job came up and it paid better another couple hundred a month so i applied for that uhhuh i mean i can really use the money i have extra expenses now like michelles day care you know what day care costs for twoyearolds and i have fulltime housekeeping and lauren doesnt make her childsupport payments more than half the time she says she cant manage on her salary but she just bought a new bmw so i dont know i mean what am i going to do take her to court she works for the fucking da connor was silent up ahead i saw the airplanes coming down over the freeway we were approaching the airport anyway i said i was glad when the liaison job came along because it works out better for the hours and for the money and thats how i got to be here in this car with you thats it kohai he said quietly were in this together just tell me what is the problem there isnt any problem kohai there isnt kohai hey john i said let me tell you something when you apply for special services liaison five different committees go over your record to get a liaison job you have to be clean the committees went over my record and they found nothing substantial connor nodded but they found something christ i said i was a detective for five years you cant work that long without a few complaints you know that and what were the complaints against you i shook my head nothing little stuff i arrested a guy my first year he accused me of undue force that charge was dropped after inquiry i arrested a woman for armed robbery she claimed i planted a gram on her charge dropped it was her gram murder suspect claimed i beat and kicked him during questioning but other officers were present at all times a drunken woman on a domestic violence call later claimed i molested her child she dropped the charge teenage gang leader arrested for murder said i made a homosexual pass at him charge withdrawn thats it if youre a cop you know that complaints like these are background noise like traffic on the street theres nothing you can do about them youre in an adversarial environment accusing people of crimes all the time they accuse you back thats just the way it works the department never pays any attention unless theres a pattern or repetition if a guy has three or four complaints of undue force over a couple of years then he gets an inquiry or a string of racial complaints he gets an inquiry but otherwise as the assistant chief jim olson always says being a cop is a job for the thickskinned connor didnt say anything for a long time he frowned thinking it over finally he said what about the divorce problems there nothing unusual you and your ex are on speaking terms yes were okay not great but okay he was still frowning still looking for something and you left the detective division two years ago yes why i already told you you said that you couldnt work the hours that was most of it yeah that and what else i shrugged after the divorce i just didnt want to work homicide any more i felt like i dont know disillusioned i had this little infant and my wife had moved out she was going on with her life dating some hotshot attorney i was left holding the kid i just felt flat i didnt want to be a detective any more you seek counseling at that time therapy no trouble with drugs or alcohol no other women some during the marriage i hesitated farley in the mayors office no that was later but there wassomebody during the marriage yes but she lives in phoenix now her husband got transferred she was in the department i shrugged connor sat back in his seat okay kohai he said if this is all there is youre fine he looked at me thats all but i have to warn you he said ive been through this kind of thing before with the japanese when the japanese play hardball they can make things unpleasant reallyunpleasant you trying to scare me no just telling you the way things are fuck the japanese i said ive got nothing to hide fine now i think you better call your friends at the network and tell them well be over after our next stop a roared low overhead its landing lights flaring in the fog it passed the sputtering neon sign that read girls girls all nude girls it was around eleventhirty when we went inside to call the club palomino a strip joint was to flatter it it was a converted bowling alley with cactus and horses painted on the walls it seemed smaller inside than it appeared from the outside a woman in a silver tassled gstring who looked close to forty danced listlessly in orange light she seemed as bored as the customers hunched over tiny pink tables topless waitresses moved through the smoky air the taperecorded music had a loud hiss a guy just inside the door said twelve bucks two drink minimum connor flipped his badge the guy said okay fine connor looked around and said i didnt know japanese came here i saw three businessmen in blue suits sitting at a corner table hardly ever the bouncer said they like the star strip downtown more glitz more tits you ask me those guys got lost from their tour connor nodded im looking for ted cole at the bar guy with the glasses ted cole was sitting at the bar his windbreaker covered his nakamoto security uniform he stared at us dully when we came up and sat beside him the bartender came over connor said two buds no bud asahi okay okay connor flipped his badge cole shook his head and turned away from us he looked studiously at the stripper i dont know anything connor said about what about anything im just minding my own business im off duty he was a little drunk connor said when did you get off duty i got off early tonight why is that stomach trouble i got an ulcer it acts up sometimes so i got off early what time i got off at eightfifteen at the latest do you punch a time clock no we dont do that no time clock and who took over for you i got relieved by whom my supervisor who is that i dont know him japanese guy never seen him before hes your supervisor and you never saw him before new guy japanese i dont know him what do you want from me anyway just to ask a few questions connor said i got nothing to hide cole said one of the japanese men sitting at the table came up to the bar he stood near us and said to the bartender what kind of cigarettes you got marlboro the bartender said what else maybe kools i have to check but i know we got marlboro you want marlboro ted cole stared at the japanese man the japanese seemed not to notice him as he stood at the bar kent the japanese said you got any kent lights no no kent okay then marlboro the japanese man said marlboro is okay he turned and smiled at us this is marlboro country right thats right connor said cole picked up his beer and sipped it we were all silent the japanese man beat the bar with his hands in time to the music great place he said lot of atmosphere i wondered what he was talking about this place was a dump the japanese slid onto the bar stool next to us cole studied his beer bottle as if hed never seen one before he turned it in his hands making rings on the bar top the bartender brought cigarettes and the japanese man tossed a fivedollar bill on the table keep the change he tore open the pack and took out a cigarette he smiled at us connor took out his lighter to light the mans cigarette as the man leaned over the flame he said doko kaisha ittenno the man blinked sorry wakanne no connor said doko kaisha ittenno the man smiled and slipped off the bar stool soro soro ikanakutewa shitsurei shimasu he gave a little wave and he went back to his friends across the room dewa mata connor said he moved around to sit on the stool where the japanese man had been sitting cole said what was that all about i just asked him what company he worked for connor said but he didnt want to talk i guess he wanted to get back to his friends connor ran his hands under the bar feeling feels clean connor turned back to cole and said now then mr cole you were telling me that a supervisor took over for you at what time was that eightfifteen and you didnt know him no and before that time while you were on duty were you taping from the video cameras sure the security office always tapes from the cameras and did the supervisor remove the tapes remove them i dont think so the tapes are still there as far as i know he looked at us in a puzzled way you fellows are interested in the tapes yes connor said because i never paid much attention to the tapes i was interested in the cameras hows that they were getting the building ready for the big party and there were lots of lastminute details but you still had to wonder why they pulled so many security cameras off other parts of the building and put them up on that floor i said they what those cameras werent on the fortysixth floor yesterday morning cole said they were scattered all around the building somebody moved them during the day theyre easy to move you know because theres no wires attached the cameras have no wires no its all cellular transmission inside the building itself built that way thats why they dont have audio they cant transmit full bandwidth on cellular so they just send an image but they can move those cameras around to suit their purposes see whatever they want to see you didnt know that no i said im surprised nobody told you its one of the features of the building theyre most proud of cole drank his beer only question i have is why somebody would take five cameras and install them on the floor abovethe party cause theres no security reason you can lock off the elevators above a certain floor so for security youd want your cameras on the floors below the party not above but the elevators werent locked off no i thought that was kind of unusual myself he looked at the japanese across the room i got to be going soon he said well connor said youve been very helpful mr cole we may want to question you again ill write down my phone number for you cole said scribbling on a bar napkin and your address yeah right but actually im going out of town for a few days my mothers been feeling sick and she asked me to take her down there to mexico for a few days probably go this weekend long trip week or so i got vacation days coming up it seems like a good time to take it sure connor said i can see how it would thanks again for your help he shook hands with cole and punched him lightly on the shoulder and you take care of yourhealth oh i will stop drinking and have a safe drive home he paused or wherever you may decide to go tonight instead cole nodded i think youre right thats not a bad idea i know im right cole shook my hand connor was heading out the door cole said i dont know why you guys are bothering with the tapes with the japanese what can you do theyre ahead of us every step of the way and they have the big guys in their pocket we cant beat em now you two guysll never beat em theyre just too good outside beneath the crackling neon sign connor said come on time is wasting we got in the car he handed me the bar napkin on it was scrawled in block letters they stole the tapes lets get going connor said i started the car the eleven oclock news was finished for the night and the newsroom was nearly deserted connor and i went down the hall to the sound stage where the action newsset was still lit up on the set the evening broadcast was being replayed with the sound off the anchorman pointed to the monitor im not stupid bobby i watch these things she did the leadin and the wrapup the last three nights he sat back in his chair and crossed his arms im waiting to hear what you have to say bobby my friend bob arthur the heavyset tired producer of the eleven oclock news sipped a tumbler of straight scotch as big as his fist he said jim it just worked out that way worked out that way my ass the anchorman said the anchorwoman was a gorgeous redhead with a killer figure she was taking a long time to shuffle through her notes making sure she stayed to overhear the conversation between bob and her coanchor look the anchorman said its in my contract half the leadins and half the wraps its contractual but jim the producer said the lead tonight was paris fashions and the nakamoto party thats human interest stuff it should have been the serial killer bob sighed his arraignment was postponed anyway the public is tired of serial killers the anchorman looked incredulous the public is tired of serial killers now whered you get that you can read it yourself in the focus groups jim serial killers are overexposed our audience is worried about the economy they dont want any more serial killers our audience is worried about the economy so we lead off with nakamoto and paris fashions thats right jim bob arthur said in hard times you do star parties thats what people want to see fashion and fantasy the anchor looked sullen im a journalist im here to do hard news not fashion right jim the producer said thats why liz did the intros tonight we want to keep your image hard news when teddy roosevelt led this country out of the great depression he didnt do it with fashion and fantasy franklin roosevelt whatever you know what im saying if people are worried lets dothe economy lets dothe balance of payments or whatever it is right jim but this is the eleven oclock news in the local market and people dont want to hear and thats whats wrong with america the anchorman pronounced stabbing the air with his finger people dont want to hear the real news right jim youre absolutely right he put his arm over the anchormans shoulder get some rest okay well talk tomorrow that seemed to be a signal of some kind because the anchorwoman finished with her notes and strode off im a journalist the anchor said i just want to do the job i was trained for right jim more tomorrow have a good night stupid dickhead bob arthur said leading us down a corridor teddy roosevelt jesus theyre not journalists theyre actors and they count their lines like all actors he sighed and took another drink of scotch now tell me again what do you guys want to see tape from the nakamoto opening you mean the air tapes the story we ran tonight no we want to see the original footage from the camera the field tapes jeez i hope we still have them they may have been bulked bulked bulk degaussed erased we shoot forty cassettes a day here most of them get erased right away we used to save field tapes for a week but were cutting costs you know on one side of the newsroom were shelves of stacked betamax cartridges bob ran his finger along the boxes nakamoto nakamoto no i dont see them a woman went past cindy is rick still here no hes gone home you need something the nakamoto field tapes they arent on the shelf check dons room he cut it okay bob led us across the newsroom to the editing bays on the far side he opened a door and we entered a small messy room with two monitors several tape decks and an editing console tapes in boxes were scattered around the floor bob rummaged through them okay you guys are in luck camera originals theres a lot of it ill get jenny to run you through them shes our best spotter she knows everybody he stuck his head out the door jenny jenny okay lets see jenny gonzales said a few minutes later she was a bespectacled heavyset woman in her forties she scanned the editors notes and frowned it doesnt matter how many times i tell them they just will not put things in proper finally here we are four tapes two limo driveups two roving inside at the party what do you want to see connor said start with the driveups he glanced at his watch is there any way to do this fast were in a hurry fast as you want im used to it lets see it at high speed she hit a button at high speed we saw the limousines pulling up the doors jumping open the people getting out jerkily walking away looking for anyone in particular because i see somebody marked footages for celebrities during the edit were not looking for a celebrity i said too bad its probably all we shot we watched the tape jenny said theres senator kennedy hes lost some weight hasnt he oops gone and senator morton looking very fit no surprise that creepy assistant of his he makes my teeth shiver senator rowe without his wife as usual theres tom hanks i dont know this japanese guy connor said hiroshi masukawa vicepresident of mitsui there you go senator chalmers hair transplant looking good congressman levine congressman daniels sober for a change you know im surprised nakamoto got so many of these washington people to attend why do you say that well when you get down to it its just the opening of some new building an ordinary corporate bash its on the west coast and nakamoto is pretty controversial right at the moment barbra streisand i dont know who the guy is with her nakamoto is controversial why because of the microcon sale i said whats microcon microcon is an american company that makes computer equipment a japanese company named akai ceramics is trying to buy it theres opposition to the sale in congress because of worries about america losing technology to japan i said and what does this have to do with nakamoto nakamotos the parent company of akai the first tape finished and popped out nothing there you wanted no lets go on right she slid the second tape in anyway im surprised how many of these senators and congressmen felt it was acceptable to show up here tonight okay here we go more driveups roger hillerman under secretary of state for pacific affairs thats his assistant with him kenichi aikou consul general of japan here in la richard meier architect works for getty dont know her some japanese connor said hisashi koyama vicepresident of honda us oh yeah jenny said hes been here about three years now probably going home soon thats edna morris she heads the us delegation to the gatt talks you know general agreement on tariffs and trade i cant believe she showed up here its an obvious conflict of interest but there she is all smiling and relaxed chuck norris eddie sakamura sort of a local playboy dont know the girl with him tom cruise with his australian wife and madonna of course on the accelerated tape the strobes flashed almost continuously as madonna stepped from her limousine and preened want to slow it down you interested in this connor said not tonight well we probably have a lot on her jenny said she pushed the very highspeed fastforward and the image streaked gray when she punched back madonna was wiggling toward the elevator leaning on the arm of a slender hispanic boy with a mustache the image blurred as the camera swung back toward the street then it stabilized again theres daniel okimoto expert on japanese industrial policy thats arnold with maria and behind them is steve martin with arata isozaki the architect who designed the museum connor said wait she punched the console button the picture froze jenny seemed surprised youre interested in isozaki no back up please the tape ran backward the frames flicking and blurring as the camera panned off steve martin and went back to record the next arrival from the limousines but for a moment in the pan the camera swung past a group of people who had already gotten out of their limousines and were walking up the carpeted sidewalk connor said there the image froze slightly blurred i saw a tall blonde in a black cocktail dress walking forward alongside a handsome man in a dark suit huh jenny said you interested in him or her her let me think jenny said frowning ive seen her at parties with the washington types for about nine months now shes this years kelly emberg the athletic modelly kind but sophisticated sort of a tatiana lookalike her name is austin cindy austin carrie austin cheryl austin thats it i said you know anything else about her jenny shook her head listen i think getting a name is pretty good these girls show up all the time you see a new one everywhere for six months a year and then theyre gone god knows where they go who can keep track of them and the man with her richard levitt plastic surgeon does a lot of big stars whats he doing here she shrugged hes around like a lot of these guys hes a companion to the stars in their time of need if his patients are getting divorced or whatever he escorts the woman when hes not taking out clients he takes out models like her they certainly look good together on the monitor cheryl and her escort walked toward us in intermittent jerks one frame every thirty seconds stepping slow i noticed they never looked at each other she seemed tense expectant jenny gonzales said so plastic surgeon and a model can i ask whats the big deal about these two because at an evening like this theyre just you know party favors connor said she was killed tonight oh shes the one interesting i said youve heard about the murder oh sure was it on the news no didnt make the eleven oclock jenny said and it probably wont be on tomorrow i cant see it myself its not really a story why is that i asked glancing at connor well whats the peg i dont follow you nakamoto would say its only news because it happened at their opening theyd take the position that any reporting of it is a smear on them but in a way theyre right i mean if this girl got killed on the freeway it wouldnt make the news if she got killed in a convenience store robbery it wouldnt make the news we have two or three of those every night so the fact that she gets killed at a party who cares its still not news shes young and pretty but shes not special its not as if she has a series or anything connor glanced at his watch shall we look at the other tapes the footage from the party sure you looking for this particular girl right okay here we go jenny put in the third tape we saw scenes from the party on the fortyfifth floor the swing band people dancing beneath the hanging decorations we strained for a glimpse of the girl in the crowd jenny said in japan we wouldnt have to do this by eye the japanese have pretty sophisticated videorecognition software now they have a program where you identify an image say a face and itll automatically search tape for you and find every instance of that face find it in a crowd or wherever it appears has the ability to see a single view of a threedimensional object and then to recognize the same object in other views its supposed to be pretty nifty but slow im surprised the station hasnt got it oh its not for sale here the most advanced japanese video equipment isnt available in this country they keep us three to five years behind which is their privilege its their technology they can do what they want but itd sure be useful in a case like this the party images were streaming past a frenetic blur suddenly she locked the image there background camera left your austin girls talking to eddie sakamura of course hed know her sakamura knows all the models normal speed here please connor said staring at the screen the camera made a slow pan around the room cheryl austin remained in view for most of the shot laughing with eddie sakamura throwing her head back resting her hand on his arm happy to be with him eddie clowned for her his face mobile he seemed to enjoy making her laugh but from time to time her eyes flicked away glancing around the room as if she was waiting for something to happen or for someone to arrive at one point sakamura became aware he did not have her full attention he grabbed her arm and pulled her roughly toward him she turned her face away from him he leaned close to her and said something angrily then a bald man stepped forward very close to the camera the light flared on his face washing out his features and his head blocked our view of eddie and the girl then the camera panned left and we lost them damn again jenny backed it up and we ran it once more i said eddies obviously not happy with her id say connor frowned its so difficult to know what we are seeing do you have sound for this jenny said sure but its probably walla she punched buttons and ran it again the track was continuous cocktail party din only for brief moments did we hear an isolated phrase at one point cheryl austin looked at eddie sakamura and said cant help if its important to you i get his reply to her was garbled but later he said clearly to her dont understand all about the saturday meeting and in the last few seconds of the pan when he pulled her to him he snarled a phrase like be a fool no cheapie i said did he say no cheapie something like that connor said jenny said want to run it again no connor said theres nothing more to be learned here go forward right jenny said the image accelerated the partygoers becoming frenetic laughing and raising glasses for quick sips and then i said wait back to normal speed a blond woman in an armani silk suit shaking hands with the baldheaded man we had seen a few moments before what is it jenny said looking at me thats his wife connor said the woman leaned forward to kiss the bald man lightly on the mouth then she stepped back and made some comment about the suit he was wearing shes a lawyer in the das office jenny said lauren davis shes assisted on a couple of big cases the sunset strangler the kellerman shooting shes very ambitious smart and well connected they say she has a future if she stays in the office it must be true because wyland doesnt ever let her get air time as you see she makes a good appearance but he keeps her away from the microphones the bald guy shes talking to is john mckenna with regis mckenna in san francisco the company that does the publicity for most hightech firms i said we can go forward jenny pushed the button she really your wife or is your partner kidding no shes really my wife was youre divorced now yeah jenny looked at me and started to say something then she decided not to and looked back at the screen on the monitor the party continued at high speed i found myself thinking of lauren when i knew her she was bright and ambitious but she really didnt understand very much she had grown up privileged she had gone to ivy league schools and had the privileged persons deep belief that whatever she happened to think was probably true certainly good enough to live by nothing needed to be checked against reality she was young that was part of it she was still feeling the world learning how it worked she was enthusiastic and she could be impassioned in expounding her beliefs but of course her beliefs were always changing depending on whom she had talked to last she was very impressionable she tried on ideas the way some women try on hats she was always informed on the latest trend i found it youthful and charming for a while until it began to annoy me because she didnt have any core any real substance she was like a television set she just played the latest show whatever it was she never questioned it in the end laurens great talent was to conform she was expert at watching the tv the newspaper the boss whatever she saw as the source of authority and figuring out what direction the winds were blowing and positioning herself so she was where she ought to be i wasnt surprised she was getting ahead her values like her clothes were always smart and uptodate to you lieutenant but its getting late lieutenant i blinked and came back jenny was talking to me she pointed to the screen where a frozen image showed cheryl austin in her black dress standing with two older men in suits i looked over at connor but he had turned away and was talking on the telephone lieutenant this of interest to you yes sure who are they jenny started the tape it ran at normal speed senator john morton and senator stephen rowe theyre both on the senate finance committee the one thats been having hearings about this microcon sale on the screen cheryl laughed and nodded in motion she was remarkably beautiful an interesting mixture of innocence and sexuality at moments her face appeared knowing and almost hard she appeared to know both men but not well she did not come close to either of them or touch them except to shake hands for their part the senators seemed acutely aware of the camera and maintained a friendly if somewhat formal demeanor our countrys going to hell and on a thursday night united states senators are standing around chatting with models jenny said no wonder were in trouble and these are important guys theyre talking about morton as a presidential candidate in the next election i said what do you know about them personally theyre both married well rowes semiseparated his wife stays home in virginia he gets around tends to drink too much i looked at rowe on the monitor he was the same man who had gotten on the elevator with us earlier in the evening and he had been drunk then almost falling down but he wasnt drunk now and morton supposedly hes mr clean exathlete fitness nut eats health food family man mortons big area is science and technology the environment american competitiveness american values all that but he cant be that clean ive heard he has a young girlfriend is that right she shrugged the story is his staffers are trying to break it off but who knows whats true the tape ejected and jenny pushed in the next one this is the last fellas connor hung up the phone and said forget the tape he stood weve got to go kohai why ive been talking to the phone company about the calls made from the pay phone in the lobby of the nakamoto building between eight and ten and no calls were made during those hours i knew that connor thought that someone had gone out of the security room and called from the pay phone cole or one of the japanese now his hopes of following a promising lead by tracing the call were dashed thats too bad i said too bad connor said surprised its extremely helpful it narrows things down considerably miss gonzales do you have any tapes of people leaving the party leaving no once the guests arrived all the crews went upstairs to shoot the actual party then they brought the tape back here to make the deadline while the party was still going on fine then i believe were finished here thanks for your help your knowledge is remarkable kohai lets go driving again this time to an address in beverly hills by now it was after one in the morning and i was tired i said why does the pay phone in the lobby matter so much because connor said our whole conception of this case revolves around whether someone made a call from that phone or not the real question now is which company in japan has locked horns with nakamoto which company in japan i said yes it is clearly a corporation belonging to a different keiretsu connor said i said keiretsu the japanese structure their businesses in large organizations they call keiretsu there are six major ones in japan and theyre huge for example the mitsubishi keiretsuconsists of seven hundred separate companies that work together or have interrelated financing or interrelated agreements of various sorts big structures like that dont exist in america because they violate our antitrust laws but they are the norm in japan we tend to think of corporations as standing alone to see it the japanese way youd have to imagine say an association of ibm and citibank and ford and exxon all having secret agreements among themselves to cooperate and to share financing or research that means a japanese corporation never stands alone its always acting in partnership with hundreds of other companies and in competition with the companies of other keiretsu so when you think about what nakamoto corporation is doing you have to ask what the nakamoto keiretsuis doing back in japan and what companies in other keiretsuoppose it because this murder is embarrassing to nakamoto it could even be seen as an attack against nakamoto an attack think about it nakamoto plans a great starstudded opening night for their building they want it to go perfectly for some reason a guest at the party gets strangled and the question is who called it in who reported the murder right because after all nakamoto controls that environment completely its their party their building and it would be a simple matter for them to wait until eleven oclock after the party was over and the guests had left to report the murder if i were preoccupied with appearances with the nuances of public face thats the way id do it because anything else is potentially dangerous to the corporate image of nakamoto okay but the report wasnt delayed connor said on the contrary somebody called it in at eight thirtytwo just as the party was getting under way thus putting the whole evening at risk and our question has always been who called it in i said you told ishiguro to find the person who called and he hasnt done it yet correct because he cant he doesnt know who called it in correct you dont think anybody from the nakamoto corporation made the call correct an enemy of nakamoto called almost certainly i said so how do we find out who called the report in connor laughed thats why i checked the lobby phone its crucial to that question why is it crucial suppose you work for a competing corporation and you want to know whats going on inside nakamoto you cant find out because japanese corporations hire their executives for life the executives feel they are part of a family and theyd never betray their own family so nakamoto corporation presents an impenetrable mask to the rest of the world which makes even the smallest details meaningful which executives are in town from japan who is meeting with whom comings and goings and so on and you might be able to learn those details if you strike up a relationship with an american security guard who sits in front of monitors all day particularly if that guard has been subjected to japanese prejudice against blacks go on i said the japanese often try to bribe local security officers from rival firms the japanese are honorable people but their tradition allows such behavior alls fair in love and war and the japanese see business as war bribery is fine if you can manage it okay now in the first few seconds after the murder we can be certain of only two people who knew a girl had been killed one is the killer himself the other is the security guard ted cole who watched it on the monitors wait a minute ted cole watched it on the monitors he knows who the killer is obviously he said he left at eightfifteen he was lying but if you knew that then why didnt we hell never tell us connor said the same way phillips wont tell us thats why i didnt arrest cole bring him down for questioning in the end it would be a waste of time and time is of the essence here we know he wont tell us my question is did he tell anyone else i began to see what he was driving at you mean did he walk out of the security office to the lobby pay phone and call somebody to tell them that a murder had occurred correct because he wouldnt use the phone in his office hed use the pay phone and call somebody an enemy of nakamoto a competing corporation somebody i said but now we know that no calls were made from that phone correct connor said so your whole line of reasoning collapses not at all it is clarified if cole didnt notify anybody then who phoned in the murder clearly the source can only be the murderer himself i felt a chill he called it in to embarrass nakamoto presumably connor said then where did he call from thats not clear yet i assume from somewhere inside the building and there are a few other confusing details that we have not begun to consider such as the car phone rang connor answered it and handed the receiver to me its for you no no mrs ascenio said the baby is fine i checked on her a few minutes ago she is fine lieutenant i wanted you to know mrs davis called that was how she referred to my exwife when i think ten minutes ago did she leave a number no she say she cant be reached tonight but she want you to know something has come up and maybe she go out of town so she say maybe she dont take the baby this weekend i sighed okay she say she call you tomorrow and let you know for sure okay i wasnt surprised it was typical lauren lastminute changes you could never make plans involving lauren because she was always changing her mind probably this latest change meant that she had a new boyfriend and she might go away with him she wouldnt know until tomorrow i used to think all this unpredictability was bad for michelle that it would make her insecure but kids are practical michelle seems to understand thats the way her mother is and she doesnt get upset im the one who gets upset mrs ascenio said you coming back soon lieutenant no it looks like ill be out all night can you stay yes but i have to leave by nine in the morning you want i pull out the couch i had a couch bed in the living room she used it when she stayed over yes sure okay goodbye lieutenant goodbye mrs ascenio connor said anything wrong i was surprised to hear tension in his voice no just my ex pulling her usual shit shes not sure shell take the baby this weekend why connor shrugged just asking i didnt think that was all there was to it i said what did you mean earlier when you said that this case could turn ugly it may not connor said our best solution is to wrap it up in the next few hours and i think we can heres the restaurant up ahead on the left i saw the neon sign bora bora this is the restaurant owned by sakamura yes actually hes just a part owner dont let the valet take the car park it in the red we may need to leave quickly the bora bora was this weeks hot la restaurant the decor was a jumble of polynesian masks and shields lime green wooden outriggers jutted out over the bar like teeth above the open kitchen a prince video played ghostlike on an enormous fivemeter screen the menu was pacific rim the noise deafening the clientele movieindustry hopeful everyone was dressed in black connor smiled it looks like trader vics after a bomb went off doesnt it stop staring dont they let you out enough no they dont i said connor turned to speak to the eurasian hostess i looked at the bar where two women kissed briefly on the lips farther down a japanese man in a leather bomber jacket had his arm around a huge blonde they were both listening to a man with thinning hair and a pugnacious manner whom i recognized as the director of come on connor said to me lets go what eddies not here where is he at a party in the hills lets go the address was on a winding road in the hills above sunset boulevard we would have had a good view of the city up here but the mist had closed in as we approached the street was lined on both sides with luxury cars mostly lexus sedans with a few mercedes convertibles and bentleys the parking attendants looked surprised as we pulled up in our chevy sedan and headed up to the house like other residences on the street the house was surrounded by a threemeter wall the driveway closed off with a remotecontrolled steel gate there was a security camera mounted above the gate and another at the path leading up to the house itself a private security guard stood by the path and checked our badges i said whose house is this ten years ago the only people in los angeles who maintained such elaborate security were either mafioso or stars like stallone whose violent roles attracted violent attention but lately it seemed everybody in wealthy residential areas had security it was expected almost fashionable we walked up steps through a cactus garden toward the house which was modern concrete and fortresslike loud music played this house belongs to the man who owns maxim noir he must have seen my blank look its an expensive clothing store famous for its snotty salespeople jack nicholson and cher shop there jack nicholson and cher i said shaking my head how do you know about it many japanese shop at maxim noir now its like most expensive american stores itd go out of business without visitors from tokyo its dependent on the japanese as we approached the front door a large man in a sport coat appeared he had a clipboard with names im sorry its by invitation only gentlemen connor flashed his badge wed like to speak to one of your guests he said which guest is that sir mr sakamura he didnt look happy wait here please from the entryway we could see into the living room it was crowded with partygoers who at a quick glance seemed to be many of the same people who had been at the nakamoto reception as in the restaurant almost everyone was wearing black but the room itself caught my attention it was stark white entirely unadorned no pictures on the wall no furniture just bare white walls and a bare carpet the guests looked uncomfortable they were holding cocktail napkins and drinks looking around for someplace to put them a couple passed us on their way to the dining room rod always knows what to do she said yes he said so elegantly minimalist the detailin executing that room i dont know how he ever got that paint job its absolutely perfect not a brush stroke not a blemish a perfect surface well it has to be she said its integral to his whole conception its really quite daring the man said daring i said what are they talking about its just an empty room connor smiled i call it faux zen style without substance i scanned the crowd senator mortons here he was standing in the corner holding forth looking very much like a presidential candidate so he is the guard hadnt returned so we stepped a few feet into the room as i approached senator morton i heard him say yes i can tell you exactly why im disturbed about the extent of japanese ownership of american industry if we lose the ability to make our own products we lose control over our destiny its that simple for example back in we learned that toshiba sold the russians critical technology that allowed the soviets to silence their submarine propellers russian nuclear subs now sit right off the coast and we cant track them because they got technology from japan congress was furious and the american people were up in arms and rightly so it was outrageous congress planned economic retaliation against toshiba but the lobbyists for american companies pleaded their case for them because american companies like hewlettpackard and compaq were dependent on toshiba for computer parts they couldnt stand a boycott because they had no other source of supply the fact was we couldnt afford to retaliate they could sell vital technology to our enemy and there wasnt a damned thing we could do about it thats the problem were now dependent on japan and i believe america shouldnt be dependent on any nation somebody asked a question and morton nodded yes its true that our industry is not doing well real wages in this country are now at levels the purchasing power of american workers is back where it was thirtyodd years ago and that matters even to the welltodo folks that i see in this room because it means american consumers dont have the money to see movies or buy cars or clothing or whatever you people have to sell the truth is our nation is sliding badly a woman asked another question i couldnt hear and morton said yes i said levels i know its hard to believe but think back to the fifties when american workers could own a house raise a family and send the kids to college all on a single paycheck now both parents work and most people still cant afford a house the dollar buys less everything is more expensive people struggle just to hold on to what they have they cant get ahead i found myself nodding as i listened about a month before i had gone looking for a house hoping to get a backyard for michelle but housing prices were just impossible in la i was never going to be able to afford one unless i remarried maybe not even then considering i felt a sharp jab in the ribs i turned around and saw the doorman he jerked his head toward the front door back fella i was angry i glanced at connor but he just quietly moved back to the entrance in the entryway the doorman said i checked theres no mr sakamura here mr sakamura connor said is the japanese gentleman standing at the back of the room to your right talking to the redhead the doorman shook his head im sorry fellas unless you have a search warrant ill have to ask you to leave there isnt a problem here connor said mr sakamura is a friend of mine i know hed like to talk to me im sorry do you have a search warrant no connor said then youre trespassing and im asking you to leave connor just stood there the doorman stepped back and planted his feet wide he said i think you should know im a black belt are you really connor said so is jeff the doorman said as a second man appeared jeff connor said are you the one wholl be driving your friend here to the hospital jeff laughed meanly hey you know i like humor its funny okay mr wise guy youre in the wrong place youve had it explained move out now he poked connor in the chest with a stubby finger connor said quietly thats assault jeff said hey fuck you buddy i told you youre in the wrong place connor did something very fast and jeff was suddenly down on the floor moaning in pain jeff rolled away coming to rest against a pair of black trousers looking up i saw that the man wearing the trousers was dressed entirely in black black shirt black tie black satin jacket he had white hair and a dramatic hollywood manner im rod dwyer this is my home what seems to be the problem connor introduced us politely and showed his badge were here on official business we asked to speak to one of your guests mr sakamura who is the man standing over there in the corner and this man dwyer asked pointing to jeff who was gasping and coughing on the floor connor said calmly he assaulted me i didnt fucking assault him jeff said sitting up on his elbow coughing dwyer said did you touchhim jeff was silent glowering dwyer turned back to us im sorry this happened these men are new i dont know what they were thinking of can i get you a drink thanks were on duty connor said let me ask mr sakamura to come over and talk to you your name again connor dwyer walked away the first man helped jeff to his feet as jeff limped away he muttered fucking assholes i said remember when police were respected but connor was shaking his head looking down at the floor i am very ashamed he said why he wouldnt explain further hey john john connor hisashiburi danalong time no see how they hanging guy hey he punched connor in the shoulder up close eddie sakamura wasnt so handsome his complexion was gray with pockmarked skin and he smelled like dayold scotch his movements were edgy hyperactive and he spoke quickly fast eddie was not a man at peace connor said im pretty good eddie how about you how you doing hey cant complain captain one or two things only got a fiveohone drunk driving try to beat that but you

great i had the feeling he was on drugs he was too manic i got a good look at the scar on his left hand it was purplered roughly four centimeters by three it appeared to be an old burn connor lowered his voice and said actually eddie were here about the yakkaigotoat nakamoto tonight ah yes eddie said lowering his voice too no surprise she came to a bad end thats one henntai she was perverted why do you say that eddie said want to step outside like to smoke cigarette and rod doesnt allow smoking in the house okay eddie we went outside and stood by the edge of the cactus garden eddie lit a mild

exciting like russian roulette then i couldnt take it captain seriously i couldnt and you know me i like a wild time i decided that eddie sakamura gave me the creeps i tried to make notes while he talked but his words were tumbling out and i couldnt keep up he lit another cigarette his hands shaking he kept talking fast swinging the glowing tip in the air for emphasis and i mean this girl its a problem eddie said okay pretty girl shes pretty but sometimes she cant go out looks too bad sometimes she needs lot of makeup because neck is sensitive skin man and hers is bruised ring around the collar bad you saw that maybe you see her dead captain yeah i saw her so then he hesitated he seemed to step back reconsider something he flicked ash from the cigarette so was she strangled or what yes eddie she was strangled he inhaled yeah figures did you see her eddie me no what are you talking about how could i see her captain he exhaled blowing smoke into the night eddie look at me eddie turned toward connor look in my eyes now tell me did you see the body no captain come on eddie gave a nervous little laugh and looked away he flicked the cigarette so it tumbled in the air dripping sparks what is this third degree no i didnt see the body eddie i swear to you captain eddie how are you involved in this me shit not me captain i know the girl sure i see her sometimes i fuck her sure

you know what this is about its not about some fucking girl man its about saturday meetings the doyou kai connorsan the secret meetings thats what its about connor snapped sonna bakana no bakana connorsan not bullshit what does a girl from texas know about doyou kai she knows something honto nanda and she likes to cause trouble this girl she likes to make turmoil eddie i think maybe you

daimatsu now in osaka they will read that a girl is killed at nakamoto and i am arrested in connection his son detained detained whatever you know what that will mean taihennakoto ni naru zo my father resign his company must make apologies to nakamoto perhaps reparations give some advantage in business it is powerful osawagi ni naruzo you will do this if you take me into your custody he flicked his cigarette away hey you think i did this murder you arrest me fine but you are just covering your ass you maybe do a lot of damage to me captain you know this connor said nothing for a long time there was a long silence they walked around the garden in circles finally eddie said naconnorsantanomuyo his voice sounded pleading it seemed like he was asking for a break connor sighed you got your passport eddie yeah sure always lets have it yeah sure okay captain here goes connor glanced at it handed it to me i slipped it in my pocket okay eddie but this better not be murina koto or youll be declared persona non grata eddie and i will personally put you on the next plane for osaka wakattaka captain you protect the honor of my family on ni kiru yo and he bowed formally both hands at his sides connor bowed back i just stared i couldnt believe what i was seeing connor was going to let him go i thought he was crazy to allow it i handed eddie my business card and gave my usual speech about how he could call me later if he thought of anything eddie shrugged and slipped the card into his shirt pocket as he lit another cigarette i didnt count he was dealing with connor eddie started back toward the house paused i have this redhead here very interesting he said when i leave the party i go to my house in the hills you need me i will be there good night captain good night lieutenant good night eddie we went back down the steps i hope you know what you are doing i said so do i connor said cause he seems guilty as hell to me maybe if you ask me itd be better to take him in safer maybe want to go back and get him no he shook his head my dai rokkansays no i knew that word it meant sixth sense the japanese were big on intuition i said yeah well i hope youre right we continued down the steps in the darkness anyway connor said i owe him for what there was a time a few years ago when i needed some information you remember the fugupoisoning business no well anyway no one in the community would tell me they stonewalled me and i needed to know it was it was important eddie told me he was scared to do it because he didnt want anyone to know but he did it i probably owe my life to him we came to the bottom of the stairs and did he remind you of that he would never remind me it is my job to remember i said thats fine captain all that obligation stuff is fine and noble and im all for interracial harmony but meanwhile its possible that he killed her stole the tapes and cleaned up the apartment eddie sakamura looks like a blownout speedball to me he acts like a suspect and were just walking away letting him go right we kept walking i thought it over and got more worried i said you know officially this is my investigation officially its grahams investigation yeah okay but were going to look stupid if it turns out he did it connor sighed as if he was losing patience okay lets go over it the way you think it might have happened eddie kills the girl right right he can see her any time but he decides to fuck her on the boardroom table and he kills her then he goes down to the lobby and pretends to be a nakamoto executive even though the last thing eddie sakamura looks like is an executive but lets say he passes himself off he manages to dismiss the guard he takes the tapes he walks out just as phillips comes in then he goes to cheryls apartment to clean that up but somehow he adds a picture of himself stuck in cheryls mirror next he stops by the bora bora and tells everybody hes going to a party in hollywood where we find him in a room without furniture calmly chatting up a redhead is that how the evening lays out to you i said nothing it didnt make much sense when he put it that way on the other hand i just hope he didnt do it so do i we came down to the street level the valet ran to get our car you know i said the blunt way he talks about things like putting the bag over her head its creepy oh that doesnt mean anything connor said remember japan has never accepted freud or christianity theyve never been guilty or embarrassed about sex no problem with homosexuality no problem with kinky sex just matteroffact some people like it a certain way so some people do it that way what the hell the japanese cant understand why we get so worked up about a straightforward bodily function they think were a little screwed up on the subject of sex and they have a point connor glanced at his watch a security car pulled up the uniformed guard leaned out hey is there a problem at the party up there like what couple of guys get in a fight some kind of fight we had a report phoned in i dont know connor said maybe you better go up and check the guard climbed out of his car hefted a big gut and started up the stairs connor looked back at the high walls you know we have more private security than police now everyones building walls and hiring guards but in japan you can walk into a park at midnight and sit on a bench and nothing will happen to you youre completely safe day or night you can go anywhere you wont be robbed or beaten or killed youre not always looking behind you not always worrying you dont need walls or bodyguards your safety is the safety of the whole society youre free its a wonderful feeling here everybody has to lock themselves up lock the door lock the car people who spend their whole lives locked up are in prison its crazy it kills the spirit but its been so long now that americans have forgotten what its like to really feel safe anyway heres our car lets get down to the division we had started driving down the street when the dhd operator called lieutenant smith she said we have a request for special services im pretty busy i said can the backup take it lieutenant smith we have patrol officers requesting special services for a vee dig in area nineteen she was telling me there was a problem with a visiting dignitary i understand i said but ive already rolled out on a case give it to the backup but this is on sunset plaza drive she said arent you located yes i said now i understood why she was insistent the call was only a few blocks away okay i said whats the problem its a vee dig dui reported in as glevel plus one last name is rowe okay i said were going i hung up the phone and turned the car around interesting connor said glevel plus one is american government yes i said its senator rowe sounds like it i said driving under the influence the black lincoln sedan had come to a stop on the lawn of a house along the steep part of sunset plaza drive two black and whites were pulled up at the curb red lights flashing up on the lawn a halfdozen people were standing beside the lincoln a man in his bathrobe arms folded across his chest a couple of girls in short glittery sequin dresses a very handsome blond man about forty in a tuxedo and a younger man in a blue suit whom i recognized as the young man who had gotten on the elevator with senator rowe earlier the patrolmen had the video camera out shining the bright light on senator rowe he was propping himself up against the front fender of the lincoln holding his arm up to cover his face against the light he was swearing loudly as connor and i walked up the man in the bathrobe came toward us and said i want to know whos going to pay for this just a minute sir i kept walking he cant just ruin my lawn like this it has to be paid for just give me a minute sir scared the hell out of my wife too and she has cancer i said sir please give me a minute and then ill talk to you cancer of the ear he said emphatically the ear yes sir all right sir i continued toward the lincoln and the bright light as i passed the aide he fell into step beside me and said i can explain everything detective he was about thirty with the bland good looks of a congressional staffer im sure i can resolve everything just a minute i said let me talk to the senator the senators not feeling well the aide said hes very tired he stepped in front of me i just walked around him he hurried to catch up its jet lag thats the problem the senator has jet lag i have to talk to him i said stepping into the bright light rowe was still holding up his arm i said senator rowe turn that fucking thing off for fucks sake rowe said he was heavily intoxicated his speech so slurred it was difficult to understand him senator rowe i said im afraid ill have to ask you to fuck you and the horse you rode in on senator rowe i said turn that fucking camera off i looked back to the patrolman and signaled to him he reluctantly turned the camera off the light went out jesus christ rowe said finally dropping his arm he looked at me with bleary eyes what the fuck is going on here i introduced myself then why dont you dosomething about this fucking zoo rowe said im just driving to my fucking hotel i understand that senator dont know he waved his hand a sloppy gesture what the fucking problemis around here senator you were driving this car fuck driving he turned away jerry explain it to them christs sake the aide came up immediately im sorry about all this he said smoothly the senator isnt feeling at all well we just came back from tokyo yesterday evening jet lag hes not himself hes tired who was driving the car i said i was the aide said absolutely one of the girls giggled no he wasnt the man in the bathrobe shouted from the other side of the car hewas driving it and he couldnt get out of the car without falling down christ fucking zoo senator rowe said rubbing his head detective the aide said i was driving the car and these two women here will testify that i was he gestured to the girls in party dresses giving them a look thats a goddamn lie the man in the bathrobe said no thats correct the handsome man in the tuxedo said speaking for the first time he had a suntan and a relaxed manner like he was used to having his orders obeyed probably a wall street guy he didnt introduce himself i was driving the car the aide said all gone to shit rowe muttered want to go to my hotel was anyone hurt here i said nobody was hurt the aide said everybody is fine i asked the patrolmen behind me you got a oneten to file that was the report of property damage for vehicular accident we dont need to a patrolman said to me single car and the amount doesnt qualify you only had to fill it out if the damage was more than two hundred dollars all we got is a fiveohone if you want to run with that i didnt one of the things you learned about in special services was sar situational appropriate response sar meant that in the case of elected officials and celebrities you let it go unless somebody was going to press charges in practice that meant that you didnt make an arrest short of a felony i said to the aide you get the property owners name and address so you can deal with the damage to the lawn he already got my name and address the man in the bathrobe said but i want to know whats going to be done i told him wed repair any damage the aide said i assured him we would he seems to be damn it look her planting is ruined and she has cancerof the ear just a minute sir i said to the aide whos going to drive the car now i am the aide said he is senator rowe said nodding jerry drive the car i said to the aide all right i want you to take a breatholyzer sure yes and i want to see your drivers license of course the aide blew into the breatholyzer and handed me his drivers license it was a texas license gerrold d hardin thirtyfour years old address in austin texas i wrote down the details and gave it back all right mr hardin im going to release the senator into your custody tonight thank you lieutenant i appreciate it the man in the bathrobe said youre going to let him go just a minute sir i said to hardin i want you to give this man your business card and stay in contact with him i expect the damage to his yard to be resolved to his satisfaction absolutely of course yes hardin reached into his pocket for a card he brought out something white in his hand like a handkerchief he stuffed it hastily back in his pocket and then walked over to give his card to the man in the bathrobe youre going to have to replace all her begonias fine sir hardin said allof em yes thats fine sir senator rowe pushed off the front fender standing unsteadily in the night fucking begonias he said christ what a fucking night this is you got a wife no i said i do rowe said fucking begonias fuck this way senator hardin said he helped rowe into the passenger seat the girls climbed into the back seat on either side of the handsome wall street guy hardin got behind the wheel and asked rowe for the keys i looked away to watch the black and whites as they pulled away from the curb when i turned back hardin rolled down the window and looked at me thank you for this drive safely mr hardin i said he backed the car off the lawn driving over a flower bed andthe irises the man in the bathrobe shouted as the car pulled away down the road he looked at me im telling you the other man was driving and he was drunk i said heres my card if things dont turn out right call me he looked at the card shaking his head and went back into his house connor and i got back into the car we drove down the hill connor said you got information on the aide yes i said what was in his pocket id say it was a pair of womens panties so would i connor said of course there was nothing we could do personally i would have liked to spin the smug bastard around push him up against the car and search him right there but we both knew our hands were tied we had no probable cause to search hardin or to arrest him he was a young man driving with two young women in the back seat either of whom might be without her panties and a drunken united states senator in the front seat the only sensible thing to do was to let them all go but it seemed like an evening of letting people go the phone rang i pushed the speaker button lieutenant smith hey buddy it was graham im over here at the morgue and guess what i have some japanese bugging me to attend the autopsy wants to sit in and observe if you can believe that shit hes all bent out of shape because we started the autopsy without him but the lab work is starting to come back it is not looking good for nippon central id say we have a japanese perp so you coming here or what i looked at connor he nodded were heading there now i said the fastest way to the morgue was through the emergency room at county general hospital as we went through a black man covered in blood was sitting up on his gurney screaming kill the pope kill the pope fuck him in a drugcrazed frenzy a halfdozen attendants were trying to push him down he had gunshot wounds in his shoulder and hand the floors and walls of the emergency room were spattered with blood an orderly went down the hall cleaning it up with a mop the hallways were lined with black and hispanic people some of them held children in their laps everyone looked away from the bloody mop from somewhere down the corridor we heard more screams we got onto the elevator it was quiet connor said a homicide every twenty minutes a rape every seven minutes a child murdered every four hours no other country tolerates these levels of violence the doors opened compared to the emergency room the basement corridors of the county morgue were positively tranquil there was a strong odor of formaldehyde we went to the desk where the thin angular deaner harry landon was bent over some papers eating a ham sandwich he didnt look up hey guys hey harry what you here for austin prep yeah they started about half an hour ago guess theres a big rush on her huh hows that the chief called dr tim out of bed and told him to do it pronto pissed him off pretty good you know how particular dr tim is the deaner smiled and they called in a lot of lab people too who ever heard of pushing a full workup in the middle of the night i mean you know what this is going to cost in overtime i said and what about graham hes around here someplace he had some japanese guy chasing after him dogging him like a shadow then every half hour the japanese asks me can he use the phone and he makes a call speaks japanese a while then he goes back to bothering graham he says he wants to see the autopsy if you can believe that keeps pushing pushing but anyway the japanese makes his last call about ten minutes ago and suddenly a big change comes over him i was here at the desk i saw it on his face he goes mojo mojolike he cant believe his ears and then he runsout of here i mean it runs and wheres the autopsy room two thanks harry close the door hi tim i said as we came into the autopsy room tim yoshimura known to everyone as dr tim was leaning over the stainlesssteel table even though it was oneforty in the morning he was as usual immaculate everything was in place his hair was neatly combed his tie was perfectly knotted the pens were lined up in the pocket of his starched lab coat did you hearme im closing it tim the door had a pneumatic selfclosing mechanism but apparently that wasnt fast enough for dr tim its only because i dont want that japanese individual looking in hes gone tim oh is he but he may be back hes been unbelievably persistent and irritating the japanese can be a real pain in the ass i said sounds funny coming from you tim oh im not japanese he said seriously im japaneseamerican which means in their eyes im gaijin if i go to japan they treat me like any other foreigner it doesnt matter how i look i was born in torrance and thats the end of it he glanced over his shoulder whos that with you not john connor havent seen you in ages john hi tim connor and i approached the table i could see the dissection was already well advanced that the yshaped incision had been made and the first organs removed and placed neatly on stainless steel trays now maybe somebodycan tell me what is the big deal about this case tim said graham is so pissed off he wont say anything he went next door to the lab to see the first of the results but i still want to know why i got called out of bed to do this one marks on duty but he is apparently not senior enough to do it and of course the me is out of town at a conference in san francisco now that he has that new girlfriend he is always out of town so i get called i cant remember the last time i got called out of bed you cant i said dr tim was precise in all ways including his memory the last time was january three years ago but that was to cover most of the staff was out with the flu and the cases were backing up finally one night we ran out of lockers they had these bodies lying around on the floor in bags stacked up in piles something had to be done the smell was terrible but no i cant remember being called out just because a case was politically tense like this one connor said were not sure why it is tense either maybe you better find out because theres a lot of pressure here the me calls me from san francisco and he keeps saying do it now do it tonight and get it done i say okay bill then he says listen tim do this one right go slow take lots of pictures and lots of notes document your ass off shoot with two cameras because i got a feeling that anybody who has anything to do with this case could get into deep shit so its natural to wonder what the big deal is connor said what time was that call to you about tenthirty eleven the me say who called him no but its usually only one of two people the chief of police or the mayor tim looked at the liver pulling apart the lobes then placed it on a steel tray the assistant was taking flash pictures of each organ and then setting it aside so whatve you found frankly the most interesting findings so far are external dr tim said she had heavy makeup on her neck to cover a pattern of multiple contusions bruises of different ages without a spectroscopic curve for the hemoglobin breakdown products at the bruise sites id still say these bruises are of variable age up to two weeks old perhaps older consistent with a pattern of repeated chronic cervical trauma i dont think theres any question were looking at a case of sexual asphyxia shes a gasper yeah she is kelly thought so for once kelly was right its more common in men but it is certainly reported in women the syndrome is the individual is sexually aroused only by the hypoxia of nearstrangulation these individuals ask their sexual partners to strangle them or put a plastic bag over their head when theyre alone they sometimes tie a cord around their neck and hang themselves while they masturbate since the effect requires that they are strangled almost to the point of passing out its easy to make a mistake and go too far they do all the time and in this case tim shrugged well she has physical findings consistent with a sexual asphyxia syndrome of long standing and she has ejaculate in her vagina and abrasions on her external vaginal labia consistent with a forced sexual episode on the same night of her death connor said youre sure the vaginal abrasions occurred before death oh yes they are definitely antemortem injuries theres no question she had forced sex sometime before she died are you saying she was raped no i wouldnt go that far as you see the abrasions are not severe and there are no associated injuries to other parts of her body in fact there are no signs of physical struggle at all so i would consider the findings consistent with premature vaginal entry with insufficient lubrication of the external labia i said youre saying she wasnt wet tim looked pained well in crude laymans terms how long before death did these abrasions occur it could be as much as an hour or two it wasnt near the actual time of death you can tell that from the extravasation and swelling of the affected areas if death occurs soon after the injury blood flow stops and therefore the swelling is limited or absent in this case as you see swelling is quite pronounced and the sperm samples have gone to the lab along with all her usual fluids he shrugged have to wait and see now are you two going to fill me in because it looks to me like this little girl was going to get in trouble sooner or later i mean shes cute but shes screwed up so what is the big deal why am i out of bed in the middle of the night to do a careful documented post on some little gasper i said beats me come on fair is fair dr tim said i showed you mine now you show me yours why tim connor said you made a joke fuck you tim said you guys owe me come on im afraid peter is telling you the truth connor said all we know is that this murder occurred at the time of a big public japanese reception and they are eager to get it cleared up right away that makes sense tim said the last time the shit hit the fan around here it was because of that thing involving the japanese consulate remember the takashima kidnapping case maybe you dont remember it never made the papers the japanese managed to keep it veryquiet but anyway a guard was killed under odd circumstances and for two days they put a hell of a pressure on our office i was amazed what they could do we had senator rowe calling us in person telling us what to do the governor calling in person everybody calling us youd think it was the presidents kid i mean these people have influence of course they do theyve paid handsomely for it graham said coming into the room close the door tim said but this time all their fucking influence wont help graham said because this time we have them by the short and curlies we have a murder and based on the lab results so far we can say without question that the murderer was japanese the pathology lab next door was a large room lit by even banks of fluorescent lights rows of microscopes neatly laid out but late at night only two technicians were working in the big space and graham was standing beside them gloating look for yourself pubic hair combthrough reveals male pubic hair moderate curl ovoid cross section almost certainly asian in origin the first semen analysis is blood type ab relatively rare among caucasians but much more common among asians the first analysis of protein in the seminal fluid comes up negative for the genetic marker for whats it called ethanol dehydrogenase the technician said right ethanol dehydrogenase its an enzyme missing in japanese and missing in this seminal fluid and theres the diego factor which is a bloodgroup protein so we have more tests coming but it seems clear that this girl had forced sex with a japanese man before she was killed by him its clear youve found evidence of japanese semen in her vagina connor said thats all christ graham said japanese semen japanese pubic hair japanese blood factors we are talking a japanese perp here he had set out some pictures from the crime scene showing cheryl lying on the boardroom table he started to pace back and forth in front of them i know where you guys have been and i know youve been wasting your time graham said you went for videotapes but theyre gone right then you went to her apartment but it was cleaned up before you ever got there which is exactly what youd expect if the perp is japanese it lays right out plain as can be graham pointed to the pictures theres our girl cheryl austin from texas shes cute fresh good figure shes an actress sort of she does a few commercials maybe a nissan commercial whatever she meets some people makes some contacts gets on some lists you with me yes i said to graham connor was staring intently at the pictures one way or another our cheryls doing well enough to be wearing a black yamamoto gown when she gets invited to the grand opening of the nakamoto tower she comes with some guy maybe a friend or a hairdresser a beard maybe she knows other people at the party and maybe not but in the course of the evening somebody big and powerful suggests they slip away for a while she agrees to go upstairs why not this girl likes adventure she likes danger shes cruising for a bruising so she goes upstairs maybe with the other guy maybe separately but anyway they meet upstairs and they look around for a place to do it a place thats exciting and they decide him probably hedecides to do it right on the fucking boardroom table so they start doing it theyre whanging away but things get out of hand her loverboy gets a little too worked up or else hes kinky and he squeezes her neck a little too hard and shes dead you with me so far yes so now loverboy has a problem hes come upstairs to fuck a girl but unfortunately hes killed her so what does he do what canhe do he goes back down rejoins the party and since he is a big samurai cocksman he tells one of his underlings that he has this little problem he has unfortunately snuffed out the life of a local whore very inconvenient for his busy schedule so the underlings run around and clean up the bosss mess they clean up incriminating evidence from the floor upstairs they remove the videotapes they go to her apartment and remove evidence there which is all fine except it takes time so somebody has to stall the police and thats where their smoothie suckass lawyer ishiguro comes in he delays us a good hour and a half so how does that sound there was a silence when he had finished i waited for connor to speak well connor said at last my hat is off to you tom that sequence of events sounds correct in many respects youre damned right it does graham puffed up damn fucking right the telephone rang the lab technician said is there a captain connor here connor went to answer the phone graham said to me im telling you a jap killed this girl and we are going to find him and fucking flay him flayhim i said why do you have it in for them anyway graham gave me a sullen look he said what are you talking about im talking about how you hate the japanese hey listen graham said lets get something straight peteysan i dont hate anybody i do my job black man white man japanese man it makes no difference to me okay tom it was late at night i didnt want to argue no hell you fucking think im prejudiced lets just drop it tom no hell were not going to drop it not now let me tell you something peteysan you got yourself this fucking liaison job isnt that right thats right tom and how come you applied for it because of your great love of japanese culture well at the time i was working in the press office no no cut the shit you applied for it graham said because there was an extra stipend isnt that right two three thousand a year an educational stipend it comes into the department from the japanamerica amity foundation and the department allows it as an educational stipend paid to members of the force so that they can further their education in japanese language and culture so howre those studies going peteysan im studying how often one night a week one night a week and if you miss classes do you lose your stipend no fucking right you dont in fact it doesnt make any difference if you go to classes at all the fact is buddy you got yourself a bribe you got three thousand dollars in your pocket and it comes right from the land of the rising sun of course its not that much nobody can buy you for three grand right of course not hey tom but the thing is they arent buying you theyre just influencingyou they just want you to think twice to tend to look favorably upon them and why not its human nature theyve made your life a little better they contribute to your wellbeing your family your little girl they scratch your back so why shouldnt you scratch theirs isnt that about it peteysan no it isnt i said i was getting angry yes it is graham said because thats how influence works its deniable you say it isnt there you tell yourself it isnt there but it is the only way you can be clean is to be clean man if you got no stake in it if you got no income from it then you can talk otherwise man they pay you and i say they ownyou just a fucking minute so dont you talk to me about hating man this country is in a war and some people understand it and some other people are siding with the enemy just like in world war ii some people were paid by germany to promote nazi propaganda new york newspapers published editorials right out of the mouth of adolf hitler sometimes the people didnt even know it but they did it thats how it is in a war man and youare a fucking collaborator i was grateful when at that moment connor came back to where we were standing graham and i were about to square off when connor said calmly now just so i understand tom according to your scenario after the girl was murdered what happened to the tapes oh hell those tapes are gone graham said youre never going to see those tapes again well its interesting because that call was the division headquarters it seems mr ishiguro is there and hes brought a box of videotapes with him for me to look at connor and i drove over graham took his own car i said why did you say the japanese would never touch graham grahams uncle connor said he was a prisoner of war during world war ii he was taken to tokyo where he disappeared grahams father went over after the war to find out what happened to him there were unpleasant questions about what happened you probably know that some american servicemen were killed in terminal medical experiments in japan there were stories about the japanese feeding their livers to subordinates as a joke things like that no i didnt know i said i think everybody would prefer to forget that time connor said and move on and probably correctly its a different country now what was graham going on about my stipend as a liaison officer connor said you told me it was fifty a week its a little more than that how much more about a hundred dollars a week fiftyfive hundred a year but thats to cover classes and books and commuting expenses babysitters everything so you get five grand connor said so what graham was saying i was influenced by it that the japanese had bought me connor said well they certainly try to do that and theyre extremely subtle they tried it with you oh sure he paused and often i accepted giving gifts to ensure that you will be seen favorably is something the japanese do by instinct and its not so different from what we do when we invite the boss over for dinner goodwill is goodwill but we dont invite the boss over for dinner when were up for a promotion the proper thing to do is to invite the boss early in the relationship when nothing is at stake then its just goodwill the same with the japanese they believe you should give the gift early because then it is not a bribe it is a gift a way of making a relationship with you before there is any pressure on the relationship and you think thats okay i think its the way the world works do you think its corrupting connor looked at me and said do you i took a long time to answer yes i think maybe so he started to laugh well thats a relief he said because otherwise the japanese would have wasted all their money on you whats so funny your confusion kohai graham thinks its a war connor said well thats true we are definitely at war with japan but lets see what surprises mr ishiguro has for us in the latest skirmish as usual the fifthfloor anteroom of the downtown detective division was busy even at two oclock in the morning detectives moved among the beatup prostitutes and twitching druggies brought in for questioning in the corner a man in a checked sport coat was shouting i said shut the fuck up over and over to a female officer with a clipboard in all the swirl and noise masao ishiguro looked distinctly out of place wearing his blue pinstripe suit he sat in the corner with his head bowed and his knees pressed together he had a cardboard box balanced on his knees when he saw us he jumped to his feet he bowed deeply placing his hands flat on his thighs a sign of additional respect he held the bow for several seconds then he immediately bowed again and this time he waited bent over staring at the floor until connor spoke to him in japanese ishiguros reply also in japanese was quiet and deferential he kept looking at the floor tom graham pulled me over by the water cooler holy christ he said it looks like we got a fucking confessionhappening here yeah maybe i said i wasnt convinced id seen ishiguro change his demeanor before i watched connor as he talked to ishiguro the japanese man remained hangdog he kept looking at the floor i never would have figured him graham said not in a million years never him how is that are you kidding to kill the girl and then to stay in the room and order us around what fucking nerves of steel but look at him now christ hes almost crying it was true tears seemed to be welling up in ishiguros eyes connor took the box and turned away crossing the room to us he gave me the box deal with this im going to take a statement from ishiguro so graham said did he confess to what the murder hell no connor said what makes you think that well hes over there bowing and scraping thats just sumimasen connor said i wouldnt take it too seriously hes practically crying graham said only because he thinks itll help him he didnt confess no but he discovered that the tapes had been removed after all that means he made a serious mistake with his public blustering in front of the mayor now he could be accused of concealing evidence he could be disbarred his corporation could be disgraced ishiguro is in big trouble and he knows it i said and thats why hes so humble yes in japan if you screw up the best thing is to go to the authorities and make a big show of how sorry you are and how bad you feel and how you will never do it again its pro forma but the authorities will be impressed by how youve learned your lesson thats sumimasen apology without end its the japanese version of throwing yourself on the mercy of the court its understood to be the best way to get leniency and thats all ishiguro is doing you mean its an act graham said his eyes hardening yes and no its difficult to explain look review the tapes ishiguro says he brought one of the vcrs because the tapes are recorded in an unusual format and he was afraid we wouldnt be able to play them okay i opened the cardboard box i saw twenty small eightmillimeter cartridges like audio cassette cartridges and i saw a small box the size of a walkman which was the vcr it had cables to hook to a tv okay i said lets have a look the first of the tapes that showed the fortysixth floor was a view from the atrium camera high up looking down the tape showed people working on the floor in what looked like an ordinary office day we fastforwarded through that shadows of sunlight coming through the windows swung in hot arcs across the floor and then disappeared gradually the light on the floor softened and dimmed as daylight came to an end one by one desk lights came on the workers moved more slowly now eventually they began to depart leaving their desks one by one as the population thinned we noticed something else now the camera moved occasionally panning one or another of the workers as they passed beneath yet at other times the camera would not pan eventually we realized the camera must be equipped for automatic focusing and tracking if there was a lot of movement in the frame several people going in different directions then the camera did not move but if the frame was mostly empty the camera would fix on a single person walking through and track him funny system graham said it probably makes sense for a security camera i said theyd be much more concerned about a single person on the floor than a crowd as we watched the night lights came on the desks were all empty now the tape began to flicker rapidly almost like a strobe something wrong with this tape graham said suspiciously they fucked around with it i dont know no wait its not that look at the clock on the far wall we could see the office clock the minute hands were sweeping smoothly from seventhirty toward eight oclock its time lapse i said what is it taking snapshots i nodded probably when the system doesnt detect anybody for a while it begins to take single frames every ten or twenty seconds until hey whats that the flickering had stopped the camera had begun to pan to the right across the deserted floor but there was nobody in the frame just empty desks and occasional night lights which flared in the video maybe they have a wide sensor i said that looks beyond the borders of the image itself either that or its being moved manually by a guard somewhere maybe down in the security room the panning image came to rest on the elevator doors the doors were at the far right in deep shadow beneath a kind of ceiling overhang that blocked our view jeez dark under there is someone there i cant see anything i said the image began to swim in and out of focus whats happening now graham said looks like the automatic focus is having trouble maybe it cant decide what to focus on maybe the overhang is bothering the logic circuits my video camera at home does the same thing the focus gets screwed up when it cant tell what i am shooting so is the camera trying to focus on something because i cant see anything it just looks black under there no look theres someone there you can see pale legs very faint christ graham said thats our girl standing by the elevator no wait now shes moving a moment later cheryl austin stepped from beneath the ceiling overhang and we saw her clearly for the first time she was beautiful and assured she moved unhesitatingly into the room she was direct purposeful in her movements with none of the awkward shuffling sloppiness of the young jesus shes goodlooking graham said cheryl austin was tall and slender her short blond hair made her seem even taller her carriage was erect she turned slowly surveying the room as if she owned it i cant believe were seeing this graham said i knew what he meant this was a girl who had been killed just a few hours before now we were seeing her on a videotape walking around just minutes before her death on the monitor cheryl picked up a paperweight on one of the desks turned it in her hand put it back she opened her purse closed it again she glanced at her watch starting to fidget she doesnt like to be kept waiting graham said and i bet she doesnt have much practice at it either not a girl like that she began to tap on the desk with her fingers in a distinct rhythm it seemed familiar to me she bobbed her head to the rhythm graham squinted at the screen is she talking is she saying something it looks like it i said we could barely see her mouth moving and then i suddenly put it together her movements everything i realized i could sync her lips i chew my nails and i twiddle my thumbs im real nervous but it sure is fun oh baby you drive me crazy jesus graham said youre right howd you know that goodness gracious great balls of cheryl stopped singing she turned toward the elevators ah here we go cheryl walked toward the elevators just as she stepped beneath the overhang she threw her arms around the man who had arrived they embraced and kissed warmly but the man remained beneath the overhang we could see his arms around cheryl but we could not see his face shit graham said dont worry i said well see him in a minute if not this camera another camera but i think we can say this is not somebody she just met this is somebody she already knows not unless shes realfriendly yeah look this guy isnt wasting any time the mans hands slid up the black dress raising her skirt he squeezed her buttocks cheryl austin pressed against his body their clinch was intense passionate together they moved deeper into the room turning slowly now the mans back was to us her skirt was bunched around her waist she reached down to rub his crotch the couple half walked half stumbled to the nearest desk the man bent her back against the desk and suddenly she protested pushing him away ah ah not so fast graham said our girl has standards after all i wondered if that was it cheryl seemed to have led him on then changed her mind i noticed that she had changed moods almost instantaneously it made me wonder if she had been acting all along if her passion was faked certainly the man did not seem particularly surprised by her sudden change sitting up on the desk she kept pushing at him almost angrily the man stepped away his back was still to us we couldnt see his face as soon as he had stepped back she changed again smiling kittenish now with slow movements she got off the desk and adjusted her skirt twisting her body provocatively as she looked around we could see his ear and the side of his face just enough to see that his jaw was moving he was talking to her she smiled at him and came forward slid her arms around his neck then they began kissing again their hands moving over each other walking slowly through the office toward the conference room so did she choose the conference room hard to say shit i still cant see his face by now they were near the center of the room and the camera was shooting almost directly down all we saw was the top of his head i said does he look japanese to you fuck who can tell how many other cameras were in that room four others well his face cant be blocked in all four well nail his ass i said you know tom this guy looks pretty big he looks taller than she is and she was a tall girl who can tell in this angle i cant tell anything except he has a suit on okay there they go toward the conference room as they approached the room she suddenly began to struggle oops graham said shes unhappy again moody young thing isnt she the man gripped her tightly and she spun trying to twist free he half carried her half dragged her to the room at the doorway she spun a final time grabbed the door frame struggling she lose the purse there probably i cant see clearly the conference room was located directly opposite the camera so we had a view of the entire room but the interior of the conference room was very dark so the two people were silhouetted against the lights of the skyscrapers through the outer glass windows the man lifted her up in his arms and set her down on the table rolled her onto her back she became passive liquid as he slid her skirt up her hips she seemed to be accepting moving to meet him and then he made a quick movement between their bodies and suddenly something flew away there go the panties it looked as if they landed on the floor but it was hard to tell for sure if they were panties they were black or some other dark color so much i thought for senator rowe the panties were gone by the time we got there graham said staring at the monitor fucking withholding of evidence pure and simple he rubbed his hands together you got any nakamoto stock buddy id sell it cause it isnt going to be worth shit by tomorrow afternoon on the screen she was still welcoming him and he was fumbling with his zipper when suddenly she tried to sit up and slapped him hard on the face graham said there we go a little spice the man grabbed her hands and tried to kiss her but she resisted him turning her face away he pushed her back on the table he leaned his weight on her body holding her there her bare legs kicked and churned the two silhouettes merged and separated it was difficult to determine exactly what was happening it looked as if cheryl kept trying to sit up and the man kept shoving her back he held her down one hand on her upper chest while her legs kicked at him and her body twisted on the table he still held her on the table but the whole scene was more arduous than arousing as it continued i had trouble with the image i was seeing was this a genuine rape or was she playacting after all she kept kicking and struggling but she wasnt succeeding in pushing him away the man might be stronger than she was but i had the feeling that she could have kicked him back if she had really wanted to and sometimes it looked as if her arms were locked around his neck instead of trying to push him away but it was difficult to know for sure when we were seeing uhoh trouble the man stopped his rhythmic pumping beneath him cheryl went limp her arms slid away from his shoulders dropped back on the table her legs fell slack on either side of him graham said is that it did it just happen i cant tell the man patted her cheek then shook her more vigorously he seemed to be talking to her he remained there for a while maybe thirty seconds and then he slipped away from her body she stayed on the table he walked around her he was moving slowly as if he could not believe it then he looked off to the left as if he had heard a sound he stood frozen for a moment and then he seemed to make up his mind he went into action moving around the room looking in a methodical way he picked up something from the floor the panties he took em himself graham said shit now the man moved around the girl and bent briefly over her body on the far side whats he doing there i dont know i cant see shit the man straightened and moved away from the conference room back into the atrium he was no longer silhouetted there was a chance we could identify him but he was looking back into the conference room back at the dead girl hey buddy graham said talking to the image on the monitor look over here buddy come on just for a minute on the screen the man continued to look at the dead girl as he took several more steps into the atrium then he began to walk quickly away to the left hes not going back to the elevators i said no but i cant see his face where is he going theres a stairwell at the far end graham said fire exit why is he going there instead of the elevator who knows i just want to see his face just once but now the man was to the far left of our camera and even though he was no longer turned away we could see only his left ear and cheekbone he walked quickly soon he would be gone from our view beneath the ceiling overhang at the far end of the room ah shit this angles no good lets look at another tape just a minute i said our man was moving toward a dark passageway that must lead to the staircase but as he went he passed a decorative giltframe mirror hanging on the wall right by the passage he passed it just as he went under the overhang into final darkness there how do you stop this thing i was pressing buttons on the player frantically i finally found the one that stopped it we went back then forward again again the man moved purposefully toward the dark passage with long quick strides he moved past the mirror and for an instant a single video frame we could see his face reflected in the mirror see it clearly and i pressed the button to freeze the frame bingo i said a fucking jap graham said just like i told you frozen in the mirror was the face of the killer as he strode toward the stairwell i had no trouble recognizing the tense features of eddie sakamura this one is mine graham said its my case im going to go bring the bastard in sure connor said i mean graham said id rather go alone of course connor said its your case tom do whatever you think best connor wrote down eddie sakamuras address for him its not that i dont appreciate your help graham said but id rather handle it myself now just so i have my facts straight you guys talked to this guy earlier tonight and you didnt bring him in thats right well dont worry about it graham said ill bury that in the report it wont come back to you i promise you graham was in a magnanimous mood pleased at the prospect of arresting sakamura he glanced at his watch fucking a less than six hours since the original call and we already have the murderer not bad we dont have the murderer quite yet connor said id bring him in right away if i were you im leaving now graham said oh and tom connor said as graham headed toward the door eddie sakamura is a strange guy but hes not known to be violent i doubt very much that hes armed he probably doesnt even own a gun he went home from the party with a redhead hes probably in bed with her now i think it would be advisable to bring him in alive hey graham said what is it with you two just a suggestion connor said you really think im going to shoot this little shithead youll go out there with a couple of black and whites for backup wont you connor said the patrolmen might be excitable im just giving you the background hey thanks for your fucking support graham said and he left he was so broad he had to turn slightly sideways to go through the door i watched him go why are you letting him do this alone connor shrugged its his case but youve been aggressive all night in pursuing his case why stop now connor said let graham have the glory after all what has it got to do with us im a cop on extended leave and youre just a corrupt liaison officer he pointed to the videotape you want to run that for me before you give me a ride home sure i rewound the tape i was thinking we could get a cup of coffee too connor said they make a good one in the sid labs at least they used to i said you want me to get coffee while you look at the tape that would be nice kohai connor said sure i started the tape for him and turned to leave oh and kohai while youre down there ask the night duty officer what facilities the department has for videotapes because all these need to be duplicated and we may need hard copies of individual frames especially if theres trouble about sakamuras arrest as japanbashing by the department we may need to release a picture to defend ourselves it was a good point okay i said ill check and i take mine black with one sugar he turned to look at the monitor the scientific investigation division or sid was in the basement of parker center it was after two in the morning when i got there and most of the sections were closed down sid was pretty much a ninetofive operation of course the teams worked at night collecting evidence from crime scenes but the evidence was then stored in lockers either downtown or at one of the divisions until the next morning i went to the coffee machine in the little cafeteria next to latent prints all around the room were signs reading did you wash your hands this means you and dont expose fellow officers to risk wash your hands the reason was that the sid teams used poisons especially criminalistics there was so much mercury arsenic and chromium floating around that in the old days officers had sometimes gotten sick by drinking from a styrofoam cup that another lab worker had merely touched but these days people were more careful i got two cups of coffee and went back to the nightduty desk jackie levine was on duty with her feet up on the desk she was a heavyset woman wearing toreador pants and an orange wig despite her bizarre appearance she was widely acknowledged to be the best print lifter in the department she was reading modern bridemagazine i said you going to do it again jackie hell no she said my daughter whos she marrying lets talk about something happy she said one of those coffees for me sorry i said but i have a question for you who handles videotape evidence here videotape evidence like tape from surveillance cameras who analyzes it makes hard copies all that well we dont get much call for that jackie said electronics used to do it here but i think they gave it up nowadays video either goes to valley or medlar hall she sat forward thumbed through a directory if you want you can talk to bill harrelson over at medlar but if its anything special i think we farm it out to jpl or the advanced imaging lab at usc you want the contact numbers or you want to go through harrelson something in her tone told me what to do maybe ill take the contact numbers yeah i would i wrote the numbers down and went back up to the division connor had finished the tape and was running it back and forth at the point where sakamuras face appeared in the mirror well i said thats eddie all right he appeared calm almost indifferent he took the coffee from me and sipped it terrible yeah i know it used to be better connor set the cup aside turned off the video recorder stood and stretched well i think weve done a good evenings work what do you say we get some sleep i have a big golf game in the morning at sunset hills okay i said i packed the tapes back in the cardboard box and set the vcr carefully in the box too connor said whatre you going to do with those tapes ill put em in the evidence locker connor said these are the originals and we dont have duplicates i know but i cant get dupes made until tomorrow exactly my point why dont you keep them with you take them home there were all sorts of departmental injunctions about taking evidence home it was against the rules to put it mildly he shrugged i wouldnt leave this to chance take the tapes with you and then you can arrange the duplication yourself tomorrow i stuck them under my arm i said you dont think anybody at the department would of course not connor said but this evidence is crucial and we wouldnt want anybody to walk by the evidence locker with a big magnet while we were asleep would we so in the end i took the tapes as we went out the door we passed ishiguro still sitting there contrite connor said something quickly to him in japanese ishiguro jumped to his feet bowed quickly and scurried out of the office is he really so scared yes connor said ishiguro moved quickly down the hall ahead of us head bent low he seemed almost a caricature of a mousy frightened man why i said hes lived here long enough to know that any case we might have against him for withholding evidence is not strong and we have even less of a case against nakamoto thats not the point connor said hes not worried about legalities hes worried about scandal because thats what would happen if we were in japan we came around the corner ishiguro was standing by the banks of elevators waiting we waited too there was an awkward moment the first elevator came and ishiguro stepped away for us to get on the doors closed on him bowing to us in the lobby the elevator started down connor said in japan he and his company could be finished forever why because in japan scandal is the most common way of revising the pecking order of getting rid of a powerful opponent its a routine procedure over there you uncover a vulnerability and you leak it to the press or to government investigators a scandal inevitably follows and the person or organization is ruined thats how the recruit scandal brought down takeshita as prime minister or the financial scandals brought down prime minister tanaka in the seventies its the same way the japanese screwed general electric a couple of years ago they screwed general electric in the yokogawa scandal you heard of it no well its classic japanese maneuvering a few years ago general electric made the best scanning equipment in the world for hospitals ge formed a subsidiary yokogawa medical to market this equipment in japan and ge did business the japanese way cutting costs below competitors to get market share providing excellent service and support entertaining customers giving potential buyers air tickets and travelers checks wed call it bribes but its standard business procedure in japan yokogawa quickly became the market leader ahead of japanese companies like toshiba the japanese companies didnt like that and complained about unfairness and one day government agents raided yokogawas offices and found evidence of the bribes they arrested several yokogawa employees and blackened the company name in scandal it didnt hurt ge sales in japan very much it didnt matter that other japanese companies also offer bribes for some reason it was the nonjapanese company that got caught amazing how that happens i said is it really that bad the japanese can be tough connor said they say business is war and they mean it you know how japan is always telling us that their markets are open well in the old days if a japanese bought an american car he got audited by the government so pretty soon nobody bought an american car the officials shrug what can they do their market is open they cant help it if nobody wants an american car the obstructions are endless every imported car has to be individually tested on the dock to make sure it complies with exhaustemission laws foreign drugs can only be tested in japanese laboratories on japanese nationals foreign skis were once banned because japanese snow was said to be wetter than european and american snow thats the way they treat other countries so its not surprising they worry about getting a taste of their own medicine then ishiguro is waiting for some scandal because thats what would happen in japan yes hes afraid that nakamoto will be finished in a single stroke but i doubt that it will chances are itll be business as usual in los angeles tomorrow i drove connor back to his apartment as he climbed out of the car i said well its been interesting captain thanks for spending the time with me youre welcome connor said call me any time if you need help in the future i hope your golf game isnt too early tomorrow actually its at seven but at my age i dont need much sleep ill be playing at the sunset hills isnt it a japanese course the purchase of the sunset hills country club was one of the more recent outrages in la the west los angeles golf course was bought for a huge cash price two hundred million dollars in at the time the new japanese owners said no changes would be made but now the american membership was slowly being reduced by a simple procedure whenever an american retired his place was offered to a japanese sunset hills memberships were sold in tokyo for a million dollars each where they were considered a bargain there was a long waiting list well connor said im playing with some japanese you do that often the japanese are avid golfers as you know i try to play twice a week sometimes you hear things of interest good night kohai good night captain i drove home i was pulling onto the santa monica freeway when the phone rang it was the dhd operator lieutenant we have a special services call officers in the field request assistance of the liaison i sighed okay she gave me the mobile number hey buddy it was graham i said hi tom you alone yet yeah im heading home why i was thinking graham said maybe we should have the japanese liaison on hand for this bust i thought you wanted to do it alone yeah well maybe you want to come over and help out with this bust just so everything is done by the book i said is this a cya i meant cover your ass hey you going to help me out or not sure tom im on my way well wait for you eddie sakamura lived in a small house on one of those narrow twisting streets high in the hollywood hills above the freeway it was am when i came around a curve and saw the two black and whites with their lights off and grahams tan sedan parked to one side graham was standing with the patrolmen smoking a cigarette i had to go back a dozen meters to find a place to park then i walked over to them we looked up at eddies house built over a garage at street level it was one of those twobedroom white stucco houses from the s the lights were on and we heard frank sinatra singing graham said hes not alone hes got some broads up there i said how do you want to handle it graham said we leave the boys here i told em no shooting dont worry you and i go up and make the bust steep stairs ran up from the garage to the house okay you take the front and ill take the back hell no graham said i want you with me buddy hes not dangerous right i saw the silhouette of a woman pass one of the windows she looked naked shouldnt be i said okay then lets do it we started up the stairs single file frank sinatra was singing my way we heard the laughter of women it sounded like more than one christ i hope they got some fucking drugs out i thought the chances of that were pretty good we reached the top of the stairs ducking to avoid being seen through the windows the front door was spanish heavy and solid graham paused i moved a few steps toward the back of the house where i saw the greenish glow of pool lights there was probably a back door going out to the pool i was trying to see where it was graham tapped my shoulder i came back he gently turned the handle of the front door it was unlocked graham took out his revolver and looked at me i took out my gun he paused held up three fingers count of three graham kicked the front door open and went in low shouting hold it police hold it right there before i got into the living room i could hear the women screaming there were two of them completely naked running around the room and shrieking at the top of their lungs eddie eddie eddie wasnt there graham was shouting where is he where is eddie sakamura the redhead grabbed a pillow from the couch to cover herself and screamed get out of here you fucker and then she threw the pillow at graham the other girl a blonde ran squealing into the bedroom we followed her and the redhead threw another pillow at us in the bedroom the blonde fell on the floor and howled in pain graham leaned over her with his gun dont shoot me she cried i didnt do anything graham grabbed her by the ankle there was all this twisting bare flesh the girl was hysterical where is eddie graham said where is he in a meeting the girl squealed where in a meeting and flailing around she kicked graham in the nuts with her other leg aw christ graham said letting the girl go he coughed and sat down hard i went back to the living room the redhead had her high heels on but nothing else i said where is he you bastards she said you fucking bastards i went past her toward a door at the far end of the room it was locked the redhead ran up and began to hit me on the back with her fists leave him alone leave him alone i was trying to open the locked door while she pounded on me i thought i heard voices from the other side of the door in the next moment grahams big bulk slammed into the door and the wood splintered the door opened i saw the kitchen lit by the green light of the pool outside the room was empty the back door was open shit by now the redhead had jumped on my back and locked her legs around my waist she was pulling my hair screaming obscenities i spun around in circles trying to throw her off me it was one of those strange moments where in the middle of all the chaos i was thinking be careful dont hurt her because it would look bad for a pretty young girl to end up with a broken arm or cracked ribs it would mean police brutality even though right now she was tearing my hair out by the roots she bit my ear and i felt pain i slammed myself back against the wall and i heard her grunt as the breath was knocked out of her she let go out the window i saw a dark figure running down the stairs graham saw it too fuck he said he ran i ran too but the girl must have tripped me because i fell over landing hard when i got to my feet i heard the sirens of the black and whites and their engines starting up then i was back outside running down the steps i was maybe ten meters behind graham about thirty feet when eddies ferrari backed out of the garage ground the gears and roared down the street the black and whites immediately took up pursuit graham ran for his sedan he had pulled out to follow while i was still running for my own car parked farther down the road as his car flashed past me i could see his face grim and angry i got into my car and followed you cant drive fast in the hills and talk on the phone i didnt even try i estimated i was half a kilometer behind graham and he was some distance behind the two patrol cars when i got to the bottom of the hill the overpass i saw the flashing lights going down the freeway i had to back up and pull around to the entrance below mulholland and then i joined traffic heading south when the traffic began to slow up i stuck my flasher on the roof and pulled into the righthand breakdown lane i got to the concrete embankment about thirty seconds after the ferrari hit it flat out at a hundred and sixty kilometers an hour i guess the gas tank had exploded on impact and the flames were jumping fifteen meters into the air the heat was tremendous it looked like the trees up on the hill might catch on fire you couldnt get anywhere near the twisted wreck of the car the first of the fire trucks pulled up with three more black and whites there were sirens and flashing lights everywhere i backed up my car to make room for the trucks then walked over to graham he smoked a cigarette as the firemen began to spray the wreck with foam christ graham said what a fucking cockup why didnt the backup patrolmen stop him when he was in the garage because graham said i told them not to shoot at him and we werent there they were trying to decide what to do when the guy drove away he shook his head this is going to look like shit in the report i said still its probably better you didnt shoot him maybe he ground out his cigarette by now the firemen had gotten the fire out the ferrari was a smoking hulk crumpled against the concrete there was a harsh smell in the air well graham said no point staying around here ill go back up to the house see if those girls are still there you need me for anything else no you might as well go tomorrow is another day shit itll be paperwork until we drop he looked at me he hesitated we in sync about this about what happened hell yes i said no way to handle it differently he said far as i can see no i said just one of those things okay buddy see you tomorrow good night tom we got into our cars i drove home mrs ascenio was snoring loudly on the sofa it was three fortyfive in the morning i tiptoed past her and looked in michelles room my daughter lay on her back her covers tossed aside her arms flung over her head her feet stuck through the bars of the crib i tucked the covers around her and went into my own room the television was still on i turned it off i pulled off my tie and sat down on the bed to remove my shoes i suddenly realized how tired i was i took off my coat and trousers and threw them onto the television set i lay down on my back and thought i should take off my shirt it felt sweaty and grimy on my body i closed my eyes for a moment and let my head sink back into the pillow then i felt a pinching and something tugging at my eyelids i heard a chirping sound and thought in a moment of horror that birds were pecking at my eyes i heard a voice saying open your eyes daddy open your eyes and i realized that it was my daughter trying to pull my eyelids up with small fingers yuuuh i said i glimpsed daylight rolled away and buried my face in the pillow daddy open your eyes open your eyes daddy i said daddy was out late last night daddy is tired she paid no attention daddy open your eyes open your eyes daddy open your eyes daddy i knew that she would continue saying the same thing over and over until i lost my mind or opened my eyes i rolled onto my back and coughed daddy is still tired shelly go see what mrs ascenio is doing daddy open your eyes cant you let daddy sleep a while daddy wants to sleep a little longer this morning its morning now daddy open your eyes open your eyes i opened my eyes she was right it was morning what the hell second day eat your pancakes i dont want any more just one more bite shelly sunlight streamed through the kitchen window i yawned it was seven oclock in the morning

when she wont eat at the big table but i wasnt having much luck today michelle stared at me is mommy coming i think so im not sure i didnt want to disappoint her were waiting to hear is mommy going

the last moment she turned her head aside pursing her lips no daddy all right i said i give up im not hungry daddy i can see that mrs ascenio was cleaning up the kitchen before she went back to her own apartment there was another fifteen minutes before my housekeeper elaine came to take michelle to day care i still had to get her dressed i was putting her pancakes in the sink when the phone rang it was ellen farley the mayors press aide are you watching watching what the news channel seven theyre doing the car crash right now they are call me back she said i went into the bedroom and turned on the television a voice was saying reported a highspeed chase on the hollywood freeway southbound which ended when the suspect drove his ferrari sportscar into the vine street overpass not far from the hollywood bowl observers say the car hit the concrete embankment at more than a hundred miles an hour instantly bursting into flames fire trucks were called to the scene but there were no survivors the drivers body was so badly burned that his glasses melted the officer in charge of the pursuit detective thomas graham said that the driver mr edward sakamura was wanted in connection with the alleged murder of a woman at a downtown location but today friends of mr sakamura expressed disbelief at this charge and claimed that police strongarm tactics panicked the suspect and caused him to flee there are complaints that the incident was racially motivated it is not clear whether police intended to charge mr sakamura with the murder and observers noted that this was the third highspeed pursuit on the freeway in the last two weeks questions of police judgment in these pursuits have arisen after a compton woman was killed in a highspeed pursuit last january neither detective graham nor his assistant lieutenant peter smith was available to be interviewed and we are waiting to hear if the officers will be disciplined or suspended by the department jesus daddy just a minute shel the image showed the crumpled smoking wreckage being loaded onto a flatbed truck for removal from the side of the highway there was a black smear on the concrete where the car had struck the wall the station cut back to the studio where the anchorwoman faced the camera and said in other developments knbc has learned that two police officers interviewed mr sakamura earlier in the evening in connection with the case but did not arrest him at that time captain john connor and lieutenant smith may face disciplinary review by the department with questions being raised of possible procedural violations however the good news is there are no longer delays for traffic moving southbound on the now over to you bob i stared numbly at the tv disciplinary review the phone rang it was ellen farley again you get all that yeah i did i cant believe it whats it about ellen none of this is coming from the mayors office if thats what youre asking but the japanese community has been unhappy with graham before they think hes a racist it looks like he played right into their hands i was there graham acted correctly yeah i know you were there pete frankly its unfortunate i dont want to see you tarred by the same brush i said graham acted correctly are you listening pete what about this suspension and disciplinary review thats the first i heard of it ellen said but that would be internally generated its coming from your own department by the way is it true did you and connor see sakamura last night yes and you didnt arrest him no we didnt have probable cause to arrest him when we talked to him later on we did ellen said do you really think he could have done this murder i know he did we have it on tape on tape are you serious yeah we have the murder on videotape from one of the nakamoto security cameras she was silent for a while i said ellen look ellen said off the record okay sure i dont know whats going on here pete theres more than i understand why didnt you tell me who the girl was last night im sorry about that i had a lot to take care of ellen a silence then pete this girl got around she knew a lot of people did she know the mayor silence how well did she know him listen ellen said lets just say she was a pretty girl and she knew a lot of people in this town personally i thought she was unbalanced but she was goodlooking and she had a hell of an effect on men you had to see it to believe it now theres a lot of irons in the fire you saw the timestoday no take a look if you ask me you want to be very correct the next couple of days dot your is and cross your ts do everything by the book and watch your back okay okay thanks ellen dont thank me i didnt call then her voice got softer take care of yourself peter i heard a dial tone daddy just a minute shel can i watch cartoons sure honey i found her a station with some cartoons and walked into the living room i opened the front door and picked up the timesfrom the mat it took me a while to find the story on the last page of the metro section charges of police racism cloud japanese fete i skimmed the first paragraph japanese officials of the nakamoto corporation complained about callous and insensitive police behavior which they said detracted from a starstudded opening night at their new skyscraper on figueroa at least one nakamoto official expressed the view that the police actions were racially motivated a spokesperson said we do not believe the los angeles police department would behave in this fashion if a japanese corporation were not involved we feel strongly that the actions of the police reflect a double standard for treatment of japanese at the hands of american officials mr hiroshi ogura chairman of the board of nakamoto was present at the party which drew such celebrities as madonna and tom cruise but he could not be reached for comment on the incident a spokesman said mr ogura is deeply disturbed that official hostility should mar this gathering he very much regrets the unpleasantness that occurred according to observers mayor thomas sent a staff member to deal with the police but with little result the police did not modify their behavior despite the presence of the special japanese liaison officer lieutenant peter smith whose job is to defuse racially sensitive situations and so on you had to read four paragraphs before you discovered that a murder had occurred that particular detail seemed to be almost irrelevant i looked back at the lead the story was from the city news service which meant there was no byline i felt angry enough to call my old contact at the times kenny shubik ken was the leading metro reporter he had been at the paper forever and he knew everything that was going on since it was still eight in the morning i called him at home ken pete smith oh hi he said glad you got my message in the background i heard what sounded like a teenage girl oh come on dad why cant i go ken said jennifer let me talk here for a minute what message i said ken said i called you last night because i thought you ought to know right away hes obviously working off a tip but do you have any idea whats behind it behind what i said i didnt know what he was talking about im sorry ken i didnt get your message really he said i called you about eleventhirty last night the dhd dispatcher said you had rolled out on a case but you had a car phone i told her it was important and for you to call me at home if necessary because i felt sure youd want to know in the background the girl said dad come on i have to decide what to wear jennifer damn it he said chill out to me he said you have a daughter dont you yeah i said but shes only two just wait ken said look pete you really didnt get my message no i said im calling about something else the story in this mornings paper what story the nakamoto coverage on page eight the one about callous and racist police at the opening jeez i didnt think we had a nakamoto story yesterday i know jodie was doing the party but that wont run until tomorrow you know japan draws the glitterati jeff didnt have anything on the scheds in metro yesterday jeff was the metro editor i said theres a story in the paper this morning about the murder what murder he said his voice sounded odd there was a murder at nakamoto last night about eightthirty one of the guests was killed ken was silent at the other end of the line putting things together finally he said were you involved homicide called me in as japanese liaison hmmm ken said listen let me get to my desk and see what i can find out lets talk in an hour and give me your numbers so i can call you direct okay he cleared his throat listen pete he said just between us do you have any problems like what like a morals problem or a problem with your bank account discrepancy about reported income anything i should know about as your friend no i said i dont need the details but if theres something that isnt quite right nothing ken cause if i have to go to bat for you i dont want to discover i have stepped in shit ken whats going on i dont want to go into detail right now but offhand i would say somebody is trying to fuck you in the ass ken said the girl said daddy thats disgusting well youre not supposed to be listening pete yeah i said im here call me in an hour ken said youre a pal i said i owe you fucking right you do ken said he hung up i looked around the apartment everything still looked the same morning sunlight was still streaming into the room michelle was sitting in her favorite chair watching cartoons and sucking her thumb but somehow everything felt different it was creepy it was like the world had tilted but i had things to do it was also getting late i had to get her dressed before elaine came to take her to day care i told her that she started to cry so i turned off the television set and she threw herself on the floor and began to kick and scream no daddy cartoons daddy i picked her up and slung her underarm to the bedroom to get her changed she was screaming at the top of her lungs the phone rang again this time it was the division dispatcher morning lieutenant i have your uncleared messages let me get a pencil i said i put michelle down she cried even louder i said can you go pick out which shoes you want to wear today sounds like you got a murder there the dispatcher said she doesnt want to get dressed for school michelle was tugging at my leg no daddy no school daddy yes school i said firmly she bawled go ahead i said to the dispatcher okay eleven fortyone last night you had a call from a ken subotik or subotnick la times he said please call him message reads the weasel is checking up on you he said you would know what that meant you can call him at home you have the number yes okay one fortytwo am this morning you had a call from a mr eddie saka looks like sakamura he said its urgent please call him at home its about the missing tape okay shit i said what time was that call one fortytwo am the call was forwarded to county general and i guess their switchboard couldnt locate you you were at the morgue or something yeah sorry lieutenant but once youre out of your car we have to go through intermediates okay anything else then at six fortythree am captain connor left a beeper number for you to call he said hes playing golf this morning okay and at seventen we had a call from robert woodson who is with senator mortons office senator morton wants to meet you and captain connor at one oclock today at the los angeles country club he asked that you call and confirm that you will attend the meeting with the senator i tried to reach you but your phone was busy will you call the senator i said i would call the senator i told the dispatcher to page connor for me at the golf course and have him call me in the car i heard the front door unlock elaine came in good morning she said im afraid shelly isnt dressed yet thats okay she said ill do it what time is mrs davis coming to pick her up were waiting to hear elaine had been through this routine many times before come on michelle lets pick your clothes for today time to get ready for school i looked at my watch and was on my way to get another cup of coffee when the phone rang lieutenant peter smith please it was the assistant chief jim olson hi jim morning pete he sounded friendly but jim olson never called anybody before ten oclock in the morning unless there was a big problem olson said looks like we got ourselves a rattlesnake by the tail you see the papers today yeah i did you happen to catch the morning news some of it the chiefs been calling me for damage control i wanted to get where you stand before i make a recommendation okay okay i just got off the phone with tom graham he admits last night was a prime screwup nobody is covered in glory im afraid not couple of naked broads impeded two ablebodied police officers and prevented apprehension of the suspect is that about it it sounded ridiculous i said you had to be there jim uhhuh he said well one good thing so far ive been checking if correct pursuit procedures were followed apparently they were we have recordings off the computers and we have voice recordings off the radio and its all strictly by the book thank god nobody even swears we can release those records to the media if this thing gets any worse so were covered there but its very unfortunate that sakamura is dead yes graham went back to get the girls but the house was deserted the girls were gone i see in all the rush nobody got the names of the girls no im afraid not that means we have no witnesses to the events in the house so were a little vulnerable uhhuh theyre cutting sakamuras body out of the wreck this morning to ship whats left to the morgue graham tells me as far as hes concerned the case is wrapped up i gather there are videotapes that show sakamura killed the girl graham says he is ready to file his concluding fivesevennine report is that how you see it the case closed i guess so chief sure then we can shut this fucker down the chief said the japanese community finds the nakamoto inquiry irritating and offensive they dont want it to continue any longer than necessary so if we can call it a day it would help its okay with me i said lets call it a day well thats good pete the chief said im going to speak to the chief see if we can head off any disciplinary action thanks jim try not to worry myself i dont see a disciplinary issue as long as we have videos that show sakamura did it yeah we do about those videos he said ive had marty looking in the evidence locker he cant seem to find em i took a deep breath and said no i have them you didnt log them in the evidence locker last night no i wanted to get copies made he coughed pete itd be better if you had followed procedure on that i wanted to get copies made i said tell you what jim said get your copies made and get the originals onto my desk by ten oclock okay okay it can take that long to locate the material from the evidence locker you know how it is he was saying he would cover for me thanks jim dont thank me because i didnt do anything he said far as i know procedure has been followed right but just between you and me get it done right away i can hold the fort for a couple of hours but somethings going on down here i dont know exactly where its coming from so dont push it okay okay jim im on my way now i hung up the phone and went to get copies made pasadena looked like a city at the bottom of a glass of sour milk the jet propulsion laboratory on the outskirts of town was nestled in the foothills near the rose bowl but even at eightthirty in the morning you couldnt see the mountains through the yellowwhite haze i tucked the box of tapes under my arm showed my badge signed the guards clipboard and swore i was an american citizen the guard sent me to the main building across an inner courtyard for decades the jet propulsion laboratory had served as the command center for american spacecraft that photographed jupiter and the rings of saturn and sent pictures back to earth as video images jpl was the place where modern videoimage processing had been invented if anybody could copy these tapes they could mary jane kelleher the press secretary took me up to the third floor we walked down a lime green corridor past several doors that opened into empty offices i mentioned it its true she said nodding weve been losing some good people peter where are they going i said mostly to industry we always lost a few to ibm in armonk or bell labs in new jersey but those labs dont have the best equipment or funding any more now its the japanese research labs like hitachi in long beach sanyo in torrance canon in inglewood theyre hiring a lot of american researchers now is jpl concerned about it sure she said everybody knows the best way to transfer technology is inside somebodys head but what can you do she shrugged researchers want to do research and america doesnt do so much r and d any more budgets are tighter so its better to work for the japanese they pay well and they genuinely respect research if you need a piece of equipment you get it anyway thats what my friends tell me here we are she took me into a laboratory crammed with video equipment black boxes stacked on metal shelves and on metal tables cables snaking across the floor a variety of monitors and display screens in the center of all this was a bearded man in his midthirties named kevin howzer he had an image on his monitor of a gear mechanism in shifting rainbow colors the desk was littered with coke cans and candy wrappers he had been up all night working kevin this is lieutenant smith from the lapd hes got some unusual videotapes he needs copied just copied howzer sounded disappointed you dont want anything doneto them no kevin she said he doesnt no problem i showed howzer one of the cassettes he turned it over in his hand and shrugged looks like a standard eightmillimeter cart whats on it highdefinition japanese tv you mean its an hd signal i guess so shouldnt be a problem you got a playback i can use yes i took the playback machine out of the box and handed it to him jeez they make things nice dont they beautiful unit kevin examined the controls in front yeah thats highdefinition all right i can handle it he turned the box around and peered at the plugs on the back then he frowned he swung his desk light over and opened the plastic flap on the cassette exposing the tape it had a faint silver tinge huh do these tapes involve anything legal actually they do he handed it back to me sorry i cant copy it why not see the silver color thats evaporated metal tape very high density ill bet the format has realtime compression and decompression coming out of the box i cant make you a copy because i cant match the formats which means i cant lay down the signal in an equivalent way that is guaranteed readable i can make you a copy but i cant be sure the copy is exact because i cant match formats so if you have any legal issues and i assume you do youre going to have to take it somewhere else to get it copied like where this could be the new proprietary dfour format if it is the only place that can copy it is hamaguchi hamaguchi the research lab in glendale owned by kawakami industries they have every piece of video equipment known to man over there i said do you think theyd help me to make copies sure i know one of the lab directors jim donaldson i can call over there for you if you like that would be great no problem hamaguchi research institute was a featureless mirrored glass building in an industrial park in north glendale i carried my box into the lobby behind the sleek reception desk i could see an atrium in the center of the building and smokedglasswalled laboratories on all sides i asked for dr jim donaldson and took a seat in the lobby while i was waiting two men in suits came in nodded familiarly to the receptionist and sat on the couch near me ignoring me they spread out glossy brochures on the coffee table see here one of them said this is what i was talking about this is the shot we end with this one closes i glanced over saw a view of wildflowers and snowcapped mountains the first man tapped the photos i mean thats the rockies my friend its real americana trust me thats what sells them and its a hell of a parcel how big did you say it is its a hundred and thirty thousand acres the biggest remaining piece of montana thats still available twenty by ten kilometers of prime ranch acreage fronting on the rockies its the size of a national park its got grandeur its got dimension scope its very high quality perfect for a japanese consortium and they talked price not yet but the ranchers you know theyre in a tough situation its legal now for foreigners to export beef to tokyo and beef in japan is something like twenty twentytwo dollars a kilo but nobody in japan will buy american beef if americans send beef it will rot on the docks but if they sell their ranch to the japanese then the beef can be exported because the japanese will buy from a japaneseowned ranch the japanese will do business with other japanese and ranches all around montana and wyoming have been sold the remaining ranchers see japanese cowboys riding on the range they see the other ranches putting in improvements rebuilding barns adding modern equipment all that because the other ranches can get high prices in japan so the american owners theyre not stupid they see the writing on the wall they know they cant compete so they sell but then what do the americans do stay and work for the japanese its not a problem the japanese need someone to teach them how to ranch and everybody on the ranch gets a raise the japanese are sensitive to american feelings theyre sensitive people the second man said i know but i dont like it i dont like the whole thing thats fine ted what do you want to do write your congressman theyre all working for the japanese anyway hell the japanese are running these ranches with american government subsidies the first man twisted a gold chain at his wrist he leaned close to his companion look ted lets not get all moral here because i cant afford it and neither can you we are talking a fourpercent overall and a fiveyear payout on a seven hundred mil purchase lets make sure we keep that in sight okay you personally are looking at two point four million in the first year alone and its a fiveyear payout right i know it just bothers me well ted i dont think youll be bothered when this deal closes but theres a couple of details we need to handle at that point they seemed to realize i was listening they stood up and moved out of earshot i heard the first man say something about assurances that the state of montana favors and approves and the second man was nodding slowly the first man punched him in the shoulder cheering him up lieutenant smith a woman was standing beside my chair yes im kristen dr donaldsons assistant kevin over at jpl called about you something about tapes you need help with yes i need them copied im sorry i wasnt here to take kevins call one of the secretaries took it and she didnt really understand the situation hows that unfortunately dr donaldson isnt here right now hes making a speech this morning i see and that makes it difficult for us with him not in the lab i just want to copy some tapes perhaps someone else in the lab can help me i said ordinarily yes but im afraid its impossible today it was the japanese wall very polite but a wall i sighed it was probably unrealistic to imagine a japanese research company would help me even with something as neutral as copying tapes i understand nobodys in the lab this morning at all they were all working late on a rush project last night and i guess they were here to all hours so everybodys late coming in today thats what the other secretary didnt understand people are coming in late so i dont know what to tell you i made one last attempt as you know my boss is the chief of police this is the second place ive stopped at already this morning hes really riding me to get this duplicated right away id love to help you i know dr donaldson would be happy to weve done special work for the police before and im sure we can duplicate whatever material you have maybe later today or if youd care to leave it with us im afraid i cant do that okay sure i understand well im sorry lieutenant perhaps you can come back later in the day she gave a little shrug i said probably not i guess its just my bad luck that everybody had to work last night yes its a pretty unusual situation what was it something came up research problem i really dont know we have so much video capability on site occasionally we get a rush request for something unusual a tv commercial that needs a special effect or something like that we worked on that new michael jackson video for sony or somebody needs to restore tape that has been ruined you know rebuild the signal but i dont know what came up last night except it must have been a lot of work something like twenty tapes to be worked on and a real rush i hear they didnt finish until after midnight i thought it cant be i was trying to think what connor would do how he would handle it i decided it was worth a stab in the dark i said well im sure nakamoto is grateful for all your hard work oh they are because it turned out real well for them they were happy i said you mentioned that mr donaldson was giving a speech dr donaldson yes where is he doing that at a corporatetraining seminar at the bonaventure hotel management techniques in research he must be pretty tired this morning but hes always a good speaker thanks i gave her my card youve been very helpful and if there is ever anything you think of or want to tell me call me okay she glanced at my card thank you i turned to go as i was leaving an american in his late twenties wearing an armani suit and the smug look of an mba who reads the fashion magazines came down and said to the other two men gentlemen mr nakagawa will see you now the men leapt up grabbing their glossy brochures and pictures and followed the assistant as he walked in calm measured strides toward the elevator i went back outside into the smog the sign in the hallway read working together japanese and american management styles inside the conference room i saw one of those twilight business seminars where men and women sit at long tables covered in gray cloth taking notes in semigloom as a lecturer drones on at the podium while i was standing there in front of a table with the name tags of latecomers a bespectacled woman came over to me and said have you registered did you get your packet i turned slightly and flashed my badge i said i would like to speak to dr donaldson hes our next speaker hes on in seven or eight minutes can someone else help you itll just take a moment she hesitated but theres so little time before he speaks then you better get going she looked as if i had slapped her i dont know what she expected i was a police officer and id asked to speak to somebody did she think it was negotiable i felt irritable remembering the young fashion plate in the armani suit walking in measured steps like a person of weight and importance as he led the real estate salesmen away why did that kid think he was important he might have an mba but he was still just answering the door for his japanese boss now i watched the woman circle the conference room moving toward the dais where four men waited to speak the business audience was still taking notes as the sandyhaired man at the podium said there isa place for the foreigner in a japanese corporation not at the top of course perhaps not even in the upper echelons but there is certainly a place you must realize that the place you hold as a foreigner in a japanese corporation is an important one that you are respected and that you have a job to do as a foreigner you will have some special obstacles to overcome but you can do that you can succeed if you remember to know your place i looked at the businessmen in their suits with their heads bowed taking notes i wondered what they were writing know your place the speaker continued many times you hear executives say i have no place in a japanese corporation and i had to quit or you will hear people say they didnt listen to me i had no chance to get my ideas implemented no chance for advancement those people didnt understand the role of a foreigner in japanese society they were not able to fit in and so they had to leave but that is theirproblem the japanese are perfectly ready to accept americans and other foreigners in their companies indeed they are eager to have them and you will be accepted so long as you remember your place a woman raised her hand and said what about prejudice against women in japanese corporations there is no prejudice against women the speaker said ive heard that women cant advance that is simply not true then why all the lawsuits sumitomo corp just settled a big antidiscrimination suit i read onethird of japanese corporations have had suits brought by american employees what about that it is perfectly understandable the speaker said any time a foreign corporation begins to do business in a new country it is likely to make mistakes while it gets used to the habits and patterns of the country when american corporations first went multinational in europe in the fifties and sixties they encountered difficulties in the countries they entered and there were lawsuits then so it is not remarkable that japanese corporations also have some period of adjustment coming into america it is necessary to be patient a man said with a laugh is there ever a time when its notnecessary to be patient with japan but he sounded rueful not angry the others in the room continued to make notes officer im jim donaldson what is this about i turned dr donaldson was a tall thin man with glasses and a precise almost prissy air he was dressed in collegiate style a tweed sport coat and a red tie but he had the nerd pack of pens peeking out of his shirt pocket i guessed he was an engineer i just had a couple of questions about the nakamoto tapes the nakamoto tapes the ones in your laboratory last night my laboratory mr ah smith lieutenant smith i gave him my card lieutenant im sorry but i dont know what youre talking about tapes in my lab last night kristen your secretary said everybody in the lab was working late on some tapes yes thats true most of my staff and the tapes came from nakamoto from nakamoto he shook his head who told you that she did i assure you lieutenant the tapes were not from nakamoto i heard there were twenty tapes yes at least twenty im not sure of the exact number but they were from mccannerickson an ad campaign for asahi beer we had to do a logo transformation on every ad in the campaign now that asahi beer is the number one beer in america but the question of nakamoto lieutenant he said impatiently glancing at the podium let me explain something i work for hamaguchi research labs hamaguchi is owned by kawakami industries a competitor of nakamoto competition among the japanese corporations is very intense veryintense take my word for it my lab didnt do any work on any nakamoto tapes last night such a thing would never happen under any circumstances if my secretary said it did shes mistaken its absolutely out of the realm of possibility now i have to give a speech is there anything else no i said thanks there was scattered applause as the speaker on the podium finished i turned and left the room i was driving away from the bonaventure when connor called in from the golf course he sounded annoyed i got your page i had to interrupt my game this better be good i told him about the one oclock appointment with senator morton all right he said pick me up here at tenthirty anything else i told him about my trips to jpl and hamaguchi then my conversation with donaldson connor sighed that was a waste of time why because hamaguchi is funded by kawakami and theyre in competition with nakamoto there is no way they would do anything to help nakamoto thats what donaldson told me i said where are you going now to the usc video labs im still trying to get the tapes copied connor paused anything else i should know no fine see you at tenthirty why so early tenthirty he said and hung up as soon as i hung up the phone rang you were supposed to call me it was ken shubik at the times he sounded sulky sorry i got tied up can we talk now sure you got information for me listen he paused are you anywhere around here about five blocks from you then come by for a cup of coffee you dont want to talk on the phone well come on ken you always want to talk on the phone shubik was like all the timesreporters he sat at his desk in front of his computer and wore a headset and talked on the phone all day long it was his preferred way of doing things he had all his stuff in front of him he could type his notes into the computer as he talked when i was a press officer my office had been at police headquarters in parker center two blocks from the times building and still a reporter like ken would rather talk to me on the phone than see me in person come on by pete that was clear enough ken didnt want to talk on the phone okay fine i said see you in ten minutes the los angeles timesis the most profitable newspaper in america the newsroom takes up one entire floor of the times building and thus is the area of a city block the space has been skillfully subdivided so you are never confronted by how large it actually is and how many hundreds of people work there but still it seems you walk for days past reporters sitting at clusters of modular workstations with their glowing computer screens their blinking telephones and their tackedup pictures of the kids kens workstation was in metro on the east side of the building i found him standing by his desk pacing waiting for me he took me by the elbow coffee he said lets get coffee what is it i said you dont want to be seen with me no shit i want to avoid the weasel hes down hustling that new girl on foreign she doesnt know any better yet ken nodded toward the far end of the newsroom there by the windows i saw the familiar figure of willy wilhelm known to everyone as weasel wilhelm willys narrow ferretlike face was at this moment composed into a mask of smiling attentiveness as he joked with a blond girl sitting before a terminal very cute yeah a little big in the rear shes dutch ken said shes only been here a week she hasnt heard about him most organizations had a person like the weasel somebody who is more ambitious than scrupulous somebody who finds a way to make himself useful to the powers that be while being roundly hated by everyone else that was the case with weasel wilhelm like most dishonest people the weasel believed the worst about everybody he could always be counted on to portray events in their most unflattering light insisting that anything less was a coverup he had a nose for human weakness and a taste for melodrama he cared nothing for the truth of any situation and he considered a balanced appraisal weak as far as the weasel was concerned the underlying truth was always strong stuff and that was what he dealt in the other reporters at the timesdespised him ken and i went into the central hallway i followed him toward the coffee machines but he led me into the library in the middle of the floor the timeshad a library that was larger and better equipped than many college facilities so what is it about wilhelm i said he was in here last night ken said i came by after the theater to pick up some notes i needed for a morning interview i was doing from home and i saw the weasel in the library maybe eleven oclock at night you know how ambitious the little turd is i could see it in his face he had the scent of blood so naturally you want to know about what naturally i said the weasel was an accomplished backstabber a year earlier he had managed to get the editor of the sunday calendar fired only at the last minute did he fail to land the job himself ken said so i whisper to lilly the night librarian what is it whats the weasel up to she says hes checking police reports on some cop so thats a relief i think but then i begin to wonder i mean im still the senior metro reporter i still do a story out of parker center a couple of times a month what does he know that i dont for all i know this should be my story so i say to lilly whats the name of this cop let me guess i said thats right ken said peter j smith what time was this about eleven great i said i thought youd want to know ken said i do so i said to lilly this is last night i said lilly what kind of stuff is he pulling and hes pulling everything all the old clips from the morgue and apparently hes got a source inside parker whos going to leak him internal affairs records some kind of a hearing about child molestation charge brought a couple of years ago ah shit i said that true ken said there was a hearing i said but it was bullshit ken looked at me fill me in it was three years back i said i was still working detective my partner and i answered a domestic violence call in ladera heights hispanic couple fighting both very drunk woman wants me to arrest her husband and when i refuse to says hes sexually abusing her baby i go look at the baby the baby looks okay i still refuse to arrest the husband the woman is pissed the next day she comes in and accuses meof sexual molestation theres a preliminary hearing charges dismissed as without merit okay ken said now you got any travel thats questionable i frowned travel the weasel was trying to locate travel records last night airplane trips junkets padded expenses i shook my head it doesnt ring a bell yeah i figured he must be wrong about that one youre a single parent youre not going on any junkets no way good we were walking deeper into the library we came to a corner where we could see out to the metro section of the newsroom through glass walls i saw the weasel still talking to the girl chatting her up i said what i dont understand ken is why me i mean i got no heat on me at all no controversy i havent been a working detective for three years im not even a press officer any more im liaison i mean what i do is political so why is a timesreporter gunning for me at eleven oclock on a thursday night you mean ken said he was staring at me like i was an idiot like there was drool coming down my chin i said you think the japanese are doing this i think the weasel does jobs for people he is a scumbag for hire he does jobs for the studios record companies brokerage houses even the realtors hes a consultant the weasel now drives a mercedes sl you know oh yeah pretty good on a reporters salary wouldnt you say yeah i would so you got on the wrong side of somebody you do that last night maybe because somebody called the weasel to track you down i said i cant believe this believe it ken said the only thing that worries me is the weasels source inside parker center somebody in the departments leaking him internal affairs stuff you okay inside your own department as far as i know good because the weasel is up to his usual tricks this morning i talked to roger bascomb our inhouse counsel and guess who called him all hot and bothered with a question last night the weasel and you want to guess what the question was i said nothing the question was does serving as a police pressofficer make an individual a public personality as in a public personality who cant sue for libel i said jesus right and the answer who cares about the answer you know how this works all the weasel has to do is call a few people and say hi this is bill wilhelm over here at the la times were going with a story tomorrow that says lieutenant peter smith is a child molester do you have any comment on that a few wellplaced calls and the story doesnt even have to run the editors can kill it but the damage is already done i said nothing i knew what ken was telling me was true i had seen it happen more than once i said what can i do ken laughed you could arrange one of your famous incidents of la police brutality thats not funny nobody at this paper would cover it i can promise you that you could fucking kill him and if somebody made a home video hey people here would payto see it on video ken ken sighed i can dream okay theres one thing last year after wilhelm was involved in the ah change of management over in calendar i got an anonymous package in the mail so did a few other people nobody did anything about it at the time its pretty dirty pool you interested yeah ken took a small manila envelope from the inside pocket of his sport coat it had one of those strings that you wrap back and forth to close it inside was a series of photos printed in a strip it showed willy wilhelm engaged in an intimate act with a darkhaired man his head buried in his lap you cant see the weasels face too well in all the angles ken said but its him all right action snap of the reporter entertaining his source having a drink with him so to speak who is the guy it took us a while his name is barry borman hes the regional head of sales for kaisei electronics in southern california what can i do with this give me your card ken said ill clip it to the envelope and have it delivered to the weasel i shook my head i dont think so itd sure make him think twice no i said its not for me ken shrugged yeah it might not work anyway even if we squeeze the weasels nuts the japanese probably have other ways i still havent been able to find out how that story ran last night all i hear is orders from the top orders from the top whatever that means it could mean anything somebody must have written it i tell you i cant find out but you know the japanese have a powerful influence at the paper its more than just the ads they take its more than their relentless pr machine drumming out of washington or the local lobbying and the campaign contributions to political figures and organizations its the sum of all those things and more and its starting to be insidious i mean you can be sitting around in a staff meeting discussing some article that we might run and you suddenly realize nobody wants to offendthem it isnt a question of whether a story is right or wrong news or not news and it isnt a onetoone equation like we cant say that or theyll pull their ads its more subtle than that sometimes i look at my editors and i can tell they wont go with certain stories because they are afraid they dont even know what they are afraid of theyre just afraid so much for a free press hey ken said this is not the time for sophomore bullshit you know how it works the american press reports the prevailing opinion the prevailing opinion is the opinion of the group in power the japanese are now in power the press reports the prevailing opinion as usual no surprises just take care i will and dont hesitate to call if you decide you want to arrange mail service i wanted to talk to connor i was beginning to understand why connor had been worried and why he had wanted to conclude the investigation quickly because a wellmounted campaign of innuendo is a fearsome thing a skillful practitioner and the weasel was skillful would arrange it so that a new story came out day after day even when nothing happened you got headlines like grand jury undecided on policemans guilt when in fact the grand jury hadnt met yet but people saw the headlines day after day and drew their own conclusions the truth was there was always a way to spin it at the end of the innuendo campaign if your subject was found blameless you could still mount a headline like grand jury fails to find policeman guilty or district attorney unwilling to prosecute accused cop headlines like that were as bad as a conviction and there was no way to bounce back from weeks of negative press everybody remembered the accusation nobody remembered the exoneration that was human nature once you were accused it was tough to get back to normal it was getting creepy and i had a lot of bad feelings i was a little preoccupied pulling into the parking lot next to the physics department at usc when the phone rang again it was assistant chief olson peter yes sir its almost ten oclock i thought youd be down here putting the tapes on my desk you promised them to me ive been having trouble getting the tapes copied is that what youve been doing sure why because from the calls i get it sounds like you arent dropping this investigation jim olson said in the last hour youve been out asking questions at a japanese research institute then youve interrogated a scientist who works for a japanese research institute youre hanging around some japanese seminar lets get it straight peter is the investigation over or not its over i said im just trying to get the tapes copied make sure thats all it is he said right jim for the good of the whole department and the individuals in it i want this thing behind us right jim i dont want to lose control of this situation i understand i hope you do he said get the copies made and get your ass down here and he hung up i parked the car and went into the physics building i waited at the top of the lecture hall while phillip sanders finished his lecture he stood in front of a blackboard covered with complex formulas there were about thirty students in the room most of them seated down near the front i could see the backs of their heads dr sanders was about forty years old one of those energetic types in constant motion pacing back and forth tapping the equations on the blackboard in short emphatic jabs with his chalk as he pointed to the signal covariant ratio determination and the factorial delta bandwidth noise i couldnt even guess what subject he was teaching finally i concluded it must be electrical engineering when the bell rang on the hour the class stood and packed up their bags i was startled nearly everyone in the class was asian both men and women those that werent oriental were indian or pakistani out of thirty students only three were white thats right sanders said to me later as we walked down the hallway toward his laboratory a class like physics doesnt attract americans its been that way for years industry cant find them either we would be up shit creek if we didnt have the orientals and indians who come here to get doctorates in math and engineering and then work for american companies we continued down some stairs and turned left we were in a basement passageway sanders walked quickly but the trouble is its changing he continued my asian students are starting to go home koreans are going back to korea taiwanese the same even indians are returning home the standard of living is going up in their countries and theres more opportunity back home now some of these foreign countries have large numbers of welltrained people he led me briskly down a flight of stairs do you know what city has the highest number of phds per capita in the world boston seoul korea think about thatas we rocket into the twentyfirst century now we were going down another corridor then briefly outside into sunlight down a covered walkway and back into another building sanders kept glancing back over his shoulder as if he was afraid of losing me but he never stopped talking and with foreign students going home we dont have enough engineers to do american research to create new american technology its a simple balance sheet not enough trained people even big companies like ibm are starting to have trouble trained people simply dont exist watch the door the door swung back toward me i went through i said but if there are all these hightech job opportunities wont they begin to attract students not like investment banking or law sanders laughed america may lack engineers and scientists but we lead the world in the production of lawyers america has half the lawyers in the entire world think of that he shook his head we have four percent of the world population we have eighteen percent of the world economy but we have fifty percent of the lawyers and thirtyfive thousand more every year pouring out of the schools thats where our productivitys directed thats where our national focus is half our tv shows are about lawyers america has become land of lawyers everybody suing everybody disputing everybody in court after all three quarters of a million american lawyers have to do something they have to make their three hundred thousand a year other countries think were crazy he unlocked a door i saw a sign that said advanced imaging laboratory in handpainted lettering and an arrow sanders led me down a long basement hallway even our brightest kids are badly educated the best american kids now rank twelfth in the world after the industrialized countries of asia and europe and thats our top students at the bottom its worse onethird of high school graduates cant read a bus schedule theyre illiterate we came to the end of the hallway and turned right and the kids i see are lazy nobody wants to work i teach physics it takes years to master but all the kids want to dress like charlie sheen and make a million dollars before theyre twentyeight the only way you can make that kind of money is in law investment banking wall street places where the game is paper profits something for nothing but thats what the kids want to do these days maybe at usc trust me everywhere they all watch television he swung another door open still another corridor this one smelled moldy damp i know i know im oldfashioned sanders said i still believe that every human being stands for something you stand for something i stand for something just being on this planet wearing the clothes we wear doing the work we do we each stand for something and in this little corner of the world he said we stand for cutting the crap we analyze network news and see where they have been fucking around with the tape we analyze tv commercials and show where the tricks are sanders suddenly stopped whats the matter wasnt there someone else he said didnt you come here with someone else no just me oh good sanders continued on at his same breakneck pace i always worry about losing people down here ah okay here we are the lab good this door is just where i left it with a flourish he threw the door open i stared at the room shocked i know it doesnt look like much sanders said that i thought was a serious understatement i was looking at a basement space with rusty pipes and fittings hanging down from the ceiling the green linoleum on the floor curled up in several places to expose concrete beneath arranged around the room were battered wooden tables each heaped with equipment and drooping wires down the sides at each table a student sat facing monitors in several places water plinked into buckets on the floor sanders said the only space we could get was here in the basement and we dont have the money to put in little amenities like a ceiling never mind doesnt matter just watch your head he moved forward into the room i am about a hundred and eighty centimeters tall not quite six feet and i had to crouch to enter the room from somewhere in the ceiling above i heard a harsh rasping sizzle skaters sanders explained sorry were underneath the ice rink you get used to it actually its not bad now when they have hockey practice in the afternoon then its a bit noisy we moved deeper into the room i felt like i was in a submarine i glanced at the students at their workstations they were all intent on their work nobody looked up as we passed sanders said what kind of tape do you want to duplicate eightmillimeter japanese security tape it might be difficult difficult i doubt that very much sanders said you know back in my youth i wrote most of the early video imageenhancement algorithms you know despeckling and inversion and edge tracing that stuff the sanders algorithms were the ones everybody used i was a graduate student at cal tech then i worked at jpl in my spare time no no we can do it i handed him a tape he looked at it cute little bugger i said what happened to all your algorithms there was no commercial use for them he said back in the eighties american companies like rca and ge got out of commercial electronics entirely my image enhancement programs didnt have much use in america he shrugged so i tried to sell them to sony in japan and the japanese had already patented the products in japan you mean they already had the algorithms no they just had patents in japan patenting is a form of war the japanese patent like crazy and they have a strange system it takes eight years to get a patent in japan but your application is made public after eighteen months after which royalties are moot and of course japan doesnt have reciprocal licensing agreements with america its one of the ways they keep their edge anyway when i got to japan i found sony and hitachi had some related patents and they had done what is called patent flooding meaning they covered possible related uses they didnt have the rights to use my algorithms but i discovered i didnt have the rights either because they had already patented the useof my invention he shrugged its complicated to explain anyway thats ancient history by now the japanese have devised much more complicated video software far surpassing anything we have theyre years ahead of us now but we struggle along in this lab ah just the person we need dan are you busy a young woman looked up from the computer console large eyes hornrim glasses dark hair her face was partially blocked by the ceiling pipes youre not dan sanders said sounding surprised wheres dan theresa picking up a midterm theresa said im just helping run the realtime progressions theyre finishing now i had the impression that she was older than the other students it was hard to say why exactly it certainly wasnt her clothes she wore a bright colored headband and a u tshirt under a jeans jacket but she had a calm quality that made her seem older can you switch to something else sanders said walking around the table to look at the monitor because we have a rush job here we have to help out the police i followed sanders ducking pipes sure i guess the woman said she started to shut down units on the desk her back was turned to me and then finally i could see her she was dark exoticlooking almost eurasian in fact she was beautiful dropdead beautiful she looked like one of those high cheekboned models in magazines and for a moment i was confused because this woman was too beautiful to be working in some basement electronics laboratory it didnt make sense say hello to theresa asakuma he said the only japanese graduate student working here hi i said i blushed i felt stupid i felt that information was coming at me too fast and all things considered i would rather not have a japanese handling these tapes but her first name wasnt japanese and she didnt look japanese she looked eurasian or perhaps part japanese so exotic maybe she was even good morning lieutenant she said she extended her left hand the wrong hand for me to shake she held it out to me sideways the way someone does when their right hand is injured i shook hands with her hello miss asakuma theresa okay isnt she beautiful sanders said acting as if he took credit for it just beautiful yes i said actually im surprised youre not a model there was an awkward moment i couldnt tell why she turned quickly away it never interested me she said and sanders immediately jumped in and said theresa lieutenant smith needs us to copy some tapes thesetapes sanders held one out to her she took it in her left hand and held it to the light her right hand remained bent at the elbow pressed to her waist then i saw that her right arm was withered ending in a fleshy stump protruding beyond the sleeve of her jeans jacket it looked like the arm of a thalidomide baby quite interesting she said squinting at the tape eightmillimeter high density maybe its the proprietary digital format weve been hearing about the one that includes realtime image enhancement im sorry i dont know i said i was feeling foolish for having said anything about being a model i dug into my box and brought out the playback machine theresa immediately took a screwdriver and removed the top she bent over the innards i saw a green circuit board a black motor and three small crystal cylinders yes its the new setup very slick dr sanders look theyre doing it with just three heads the board must generate component rgb because over here you think this is compression circuitry probably digital to analog converter sanders said very neat so small he turned to me holding up the box you know how the japanese can make things this way and we cant they kaizenem a process of deliberate patient continual refinements each year the products get a little better a little smaller a little cheaper americans dont think that way americans are always looking for the quantum leap the big advance forward americans try to hit a home run to knock it out of the park and then sit back the japanese just hit singles all day long and they never sit back so with something like this youre looking at an expression of philosophy as much as anything he talked like this for a while pivoting the cylinders admiring it finally i said can you copy the tapes sure theresa said from the converter we can run a signal out of this machine and lay it down on whatever media you like you want threequarter optical master vhs vhs i said thats easy she said but will it be an accurate copy the people at jpl said they couldnt guarantee the copy would be accurate oh hell jpl sanders said they just talk like that because they work for the government we get things donehere right theresa but theresa wasnt listening i watched her plugging cables and wires moving swiftly with her good hand using her stump to stabilize and hold the box like many disabled people her movements were so fluid it was hardly noticeable that her right hand was missing soon she had the small playback machine hooked to a second recorder and several different monitors whatre all these to check the signal you mean for playback no the big monitor there will show the image the others let me look at the signal characteristics and the data map how the image has been laid down on the tape i said you need to do that no i just want to snoop im curious about how theyve set up this highdensity format sanders said to me what is the actual source material its from an office security camera and this tape is original i think so why well if its original material we want to be extra careful with it sanders said he was talking to theresa instructing her we dont want to set up any feedback loops scrambling the media surface or signal leaks off the heads that will compromise the integrity of the data stream dont worry she said i got it handled she pointed to her setup see that itll warn of an impedance shift and im monitoring the central processor too okay sanders said he was beaming like a proud parent how long will this take i said not long we can lay down the signal at very high speed the rate limit is a function of the playback device and it seems to have a fastforward scan so maybe two or three minutes per tape i glanced at my watch i have a tenthirty appointment i cant be late for and i dont want to leave these you need all of them done actually just five are critical then lets do those first we ran the first few seconds of each tape one after another looking for the five that came from the cameras on the fortysixth floor as each tape started i saw the camera image on the central monitor of theresas table on the side monitors signal traces bounced and jiggled like an intensive care unit i mentioned it thats just about right she said intensive care for video she ejected one tape stuck in another and started it up oops did you say this material was original its not these tapes are copies how do you know because we got a windup signature theresa bent over the equipment staring at the signal traces making fine adjustments with her knobs and dials i think thats what you got yes sanders said he turned to me you see with video its difficult to detect a copy in the image itself the older analog video shows some degradation in successive generations but in a digital system like this there is no difference at all each copy is literally identical to the master then how can you say the tapes are copies theresa isnt looking at the picture sanders said shes looking at the signal even though we cant detect a copy from the image sometimes we can determine the image came from another video playback instead of a camera i shook my head how theresa said it has to do with how the signal is laid down in the first halfsecond of taping if the recording video is started before the playback video there is sometimes a slight fluctuation in the signal output as the playback machine starts up its a mechanical function the playback motors cant get up to speed instantaneously there are electronic circuits in the playback machine to minimize the effect but theres always an interval of getting up to speed and thats what you detected she nodded its called a windup signature sanders said and that never happens if the signal is coming direct from a camera because a camera has no moving parts a camera is instantaneously up to speed at all times i frowned so these tapes are copies is that bad sanders said i dont know if they were copied they might also be changed right in theory yes sanders said in practice wed have to look carefully and it would be very hard to know for certain these tapes come from a japanese company yes nakamoto i nodded yes frankly im not surprised they gave you copies sanders said the japanese are extremely cautious theyre not very trusting of outsiders and japanese corporations in america feel the way we would feel doing business in nigeria they think theyre surrounded by savages hey theresa said sorry sanders said but you know what i mean the japanese feel they have to put up with us with our ineptitude our slowness our stupidity our incompetence that makes them selfprotective so if these tapes have any legal significance the last thing theyd do is turn the originals over to a barbarian policeman like you no no theyd give you a copy and keep the original in case they need it for their defense fully confident that with your inferior american video technology youd never be able to detect that it was a copy anyway i frowned how long would it take to make copies not long sanders said shaking his head the way theresa is scanning now five minutes a tape i imagine the japanese can do it much faster say two minutes a tape in that case they had plenty of time to make copies last night as we talked theresa was continuing to shuffle the tapes looking at the first portions of each as each image came up shed glance at me i would shake my head i was seeing all the different security cameras finally the first of the tapes from the fortysixth floor appeared the familiar office image i had seen before thats one okay here we go laying it onto vhs theresa started the first copy she ran the tape forward at high speed the images streaky and quick on the side monitors the signals bounced and jittered nervously she said does this have something to do with the murder last night yes you know about that she shrugged i saw it on the news the killer died in a car crash thats right i said she was turned away the threequarter profile of her face was strikingly beautiful the high curve of her cheekbone i thought of what a playboy eddie sakamura was known to be i said did you know him no she said after a moment she added he was japanese another moment of awkwardness descended on our little group there was something that both theresa and sanders seemed to know that i did not but i didnt know how to ask so i watched the video once again i saw the sunlight moving across the floor then the room lights came up as the office personnel thinned now the floor was empty and then at high speed cheryl austin appeared followed by the man they kissed passionately ah ha sanders said is this it yes he frowned as he watched the action progress you mean the murder is recorded yes i said on multiple cameras youre kidding sanders fell silent watching events proceed with the streaky highspeed image it was difficult to see more than the basic events the two people moving to the conference room the sudden struggle forcing her back on the table stepping away suddenly leaving the room in haste nobody spoke we all watched the tape i glanced at theresa her face was blank the image was reflected in her glasses eddie passed the mirror and went into the dark passageway the tape ran on for a few more seconds and then the cassette popped out thats one you say there are multiple cameras how many all together five i think i said she marked the first cassette with a stickon label she started the second tape in the machine and began another highspeed duplication i said these copies are exact oh yes so theyre legal sanders frowned legal in what sense well as evidence in a court of law oh no sanders said these tapes would never be admissible in a court of law but if theyre exact copies its nothing to do with that all forms of photographic evidence including video are no longer admissible in court i havent heard that i said it hasnt happened yet sanders said the case law isnt entirely clear but its coming all photographs are suspect these days because now with digital systems they can be changed perfectly perfectly and thats something new remember years ago how the russians would remove politicians from photographs of their may day line ups it was always a crude cutandpaste job and you could always see that something had been done there was a funny space between the shoulders of the remaining people or a discoloration on the back wall or you could see the brushstrokes of the retoucher who tried to smooth over the damage but anyway you could see it fairly easily you could see the picture had been altered the whole business was laughable i remember i said photographs always had integrity precisely because they were impossible to change so we considered photographs to represent reality but for several years now computers have allowed us to make seamless alterations of photographic images a few years back the national geographicmoved the great pyramid of egypt on a cover photo the editors didnt like where the pyramid was and they thought it would compose better if it was moved so they just altered the photograph and moved it nobody could tell but if you go back to egypt with a camera and try to duplicate that picture youll find you cant because there is no place in the real world where the pyramids line up that way the photograph no longer represents reality but you cant tell minor example and someone could do the same thing to this tape in theory any video can be changed on the monitor i watched the murder occurring a second time this camera was from the far end of the room it didnt show the actual murder very well but afterward sakamura was clearly visible as he walked toward the camera i said the image could be changed how sanders laughed these days you can make any damn change you want could you change the identity of the murderer technically yes sanders said mapping a face onto a complex moving object is now possible technically possible but as a practical matter itd be a bitch to do i said nothing but it was just as well sakamura was our leading suspect and he was dead the chief wanted the case finished so did i of course sanders said the japanese have all sorts of fancy video algorithms for surface mapping and threedimensional transformations they can do things that we cant begin to imagine he drummed his fingers on the table again what is the timetable of these tapes whats their history i said the murder happened at eightthirty last night as shown on the clock we were told the tapes were removed from the security office around eight fortyfive pm we asked for them and there was some backandforth with the japanese as always and when did you finally take possession they were delivered to division headquarters around onethirty am okay sanders said that means they had the tapes from eight fortyfive to onethirty right a little less than five hours sanders frowned five tapes with five different camera angles to change in five hours sanders shook his head no way it just cant be done lieutenant yeah theresa said its impossible even for them its just too many pixels to change i said youre sure about that well theresa said the only way it could be done that fast is with an automated program and even the most sophisticated programs need you to polish the details by hand things like bad blur can give it all away bad blur i said i found i liked asking her questions i liked looking at her face bad motion blur sanders said video runs at thirty frames a second you can think of each frame of video as a picture thats shot at a shutter speed of onethirtieth of a second which is very slow much slower than pocket cameras if you film a runner at a thirtieth of a second the legs are just streaks blurs thats called motion blur and if you alter it by a mechanical process it starts to look wrong the image appears too sharp too crisp edges look odd its back to the russians you can see its been changed for realistic motion you need the right amount of blur i see theresa said and theres the color shift right sanders said inside the blur itself there is a color shift for example look there on the monitor the man is wearing a blue suit and his coat is swinging out as he spins the girl around the room now if you take a frame of that action and blow it up to its pixels you will find that the coat is navy but the blur is progressive shades of lighter blue until at the edge it seems almost transparent you cant tell from a single frame exactly where the coat ends and the background begins i could vaguely imagine it okay if the edge colors dont blend smoothly you will notice it immediately it can take hours to clean up a few seconds of tape as in a commercial but if you dont do it you will see it like that he snapped his fingers so even though they duplicated the tapes they couldnt have altered them not in five hours sanders said they just didnt have time then we are seeing what actually happened no doubt about it sanders said but well poke around with this image anyway after you go theresa wants to fiddle with it i know she does so do i check in with us later today well tell you if theres anything funny but basically it cant be done and it wasnt done here as i pulled into the parking circle at the sunset hills country club i saw connor standing in front of the big stucco clubhouse he bowed to the three japanese golfers standing with him and they bowed back then he shook hands with them all tossed the clubs into the back seat and got into my car youre late kohai sorry its only a few minutes i was held up at usc your lateness inconvenienced everyone as a matter of politeness they felt obliged to keep me company in front of the club while i waited for you men of their position are not comfortable standing around they are busy but they felt obligated and could not leave me there you embarrassed me very much and you reflected poorly on the department im sorry i didnt realize start to realize kohai youre not alone in the world i put the car in gear and drove out i looked at the japanese in the rearview mirror they were waving as we left they did not appear unhappy or in a rush to leave who were you playing with aokisan is the head of tokio marine in vancouver hanadasan is a vicepresident of mitsui bank in london and kenichi asaka runs all of toyotas southeast asian plants from kl to singapore hes based in bangkok what are they doing here theyre on vacation connor said a short holiday in the states for golf they find it pleasant to relax in a slowerpaced country like ours i drove up the winding drive to sunset boulevard and stopped to wait for the light where to the four seasons hotel i turned right heading toward beverly hills and why are these men playing golf with you oh we go way back he said a few favors here and there over the years im nobody important but relationships must be maintained a phone call a small gift a game when youre in town because you never know when you will need your network relationships are your source of information your safety valve and your early warning system in the japanese way of seeing the world who asked for this game hanadasan was already intending to play i just joined him im quite a good golfer you know why did you want to play because i wanted to know more about the saturday meetings connor said i remembered the saturday meetings on the video we had seen at the newsroom sakamura had grabbed cheryl austin and said you dont understand this is all about the saturday meetings and did they tell you connor nodded apparently they began a long time ago he said nineteen eighty or so first they were held in the century plaza and later in the sheraton and finally in the biltmore connor stared out the window the car jounced over the potholes on sunset boulevard for several years the meetings were a regular event prominent japanese industrialists who happened to be in town would attend an ongoing discussion of what should be done about america of how the american economy should be managed what yes thats outrageous why connor said whybecause this is ourcountry you cant have a bunch of foreigners sitting around in secret meetings and deciding how to manage it the japanese dont see it that way connor said im sure they dont im sure they think they have a goddamn right connor shrugged as a matter of fact thats exactly what they think and the japanese believe they have earned the right to decide christ because they have invested heavily in our economy they have lent us a lot of money peter a lotof money hundreds of billions of dollars for most of the last fifteen years the united states has run a billion dollars of trade deficit a weekwith japan thats a billion dollars every week that they must do something with a torrent of money roaring toward them they dont especially want so many dollars what can they do with all their excess billions they decided to lend the money back to us our government was running a budget deficit year after year we werent paying for our own programs so the japanese financed our budget deficit they invested in us and they lent their money based on certain assurances from our government washington assured the japanese that we would set our house in order we would cut our deficit we would improve education rebuild our infrastructure even raise taxes if necessary in short we would clean up our act because only then does an investment in america make sense uhhuh i said but we did none of those things we let the deficit get worse and we devalued the dollar we cut its value in half in you know what that did to japanese investments in america it fucked them whatever they invested in now paid half its previous return i vaguely remembered something about this i said i thought we did that to help our trade deficit to boost exports we did but it didnt work our trade balance with japan got worse normally if you devalue your currency by half the cost of everything imported doubles but the japanese slashed prices on their vcrs and copiers and held their market share remember business is war all we really accomplished was to make american land and american companies cheap for the japanese to buy because the yen was now twice as strong as it had been we made the biggest banks in the world all japanese and we made america a poor country what does this have to do with the saturday meetings well connor said suppose you have an uncle who is a drunk he says if you lend him money hell stop drinking but he doesnt stop drinking and youd like to get your money you want to salvage what you can from your bad investment also you know that your uncle being a drunk is likely to get loaded and hurt somebody your uncle is out of control so something has to be done and the family sits down together to decide what to do about their problem uncle thats what the japanese decided to do uhhuh connor must have heard the skepticism in my voice look he said get this conspiracy stuff out of your head do you want to take over japan do you want to run their country of course not no sensible country wants to take over another country do business yes have a relationship yes but not take over nobody wants the responsibility nobody wants to be bothered just like with the drunken uncle you only have those meetings when youre forced to its a last resort so thats how the japanese see it they see billions and billions of their dollars kohai invested in a country thats in deep trouble thats filled with strange individualistic people who talk constantly who confront each other constantly who argue all the time people who arent well educated who dont know much about the world who get their information from television people who dont work very hard who tolerate violence and drug use and who dont seem to object to it the japanese have billions of dollars in this peculiar land and they would like a decent return on their investment and even though the american economy is collapsing it will soon be third in the world after japan and europe its still important to try and hold it together which is all theyre trying to do thats it i said theyre just doing the good work of saving america somebody needs to do it connor said we cant go on this way well manage thats what the english always said he shook his head but now england is poor and america is becoming poor too why is it becoming poor i said speaking louder than i intended the japanese say its because america has become a land without substance we let our manufacturing go we dont make things anymore when you manufacture products you add value to raw materials and you literally create wealth but america has stopped doing that americans make money now by paper manipulation which the japanese say is bound to catch up to us because paper profits dont reflect real wealth they think our fascination with wall street and junk bonds is crazy and therefore the japanese ought to manage us they think someoneought to manage us theyd prefer we do it ourselves jesus connor shifted in his seat save your outrage kohai because according to hanadasan the saturday meetings stopped in oh yes that was when the japanese decided not to worry about whether america would clean up its act they saw advantages in the present situation america is asleep and inexpensive to buy so there arent saturday meetings any more there are occasional ones because of nichibei kankei the ongoing japaneseamerican relationship the economies of the two countries are interlocked by now neither country can pull out even if they wanted to but the meetings are no longer important they are basically social functions so what sakamura said to cheryl austin is wrong and her death had nothing to do with the saturday meetings what does it have to do with my friends seemed to think it was personal a chijou no motsure a crime of passion involving a beautiful irokichigaiwoman and a jealous man and you believe them well the thing is they were unanimous all three of these businessmen of course japanese are reluctant to express disagreement among themselves even on the golf course of an underdeveloped peasant country but i have learned that unanimity toward a gaijinmay cover a multitude of sins you think they were lying not exactly connor shook his head but i had the impression they were telling me something by not telling me this morning was a game of hara no saguriai my friends were not forthcoming connor described his golf game there had been long silences all morning everyone in the foursome was polite and considerate but spoken comments were rare and reserved most of the time the men walked over the course in complete silence and you had gone there for information i said how could you stand it oh i was getting information but as he explained it it was all unspoken basically the japanese have an understanding based on centuries of shared culture and they are able to communicate feelings without words its the closeness that exists in america between a parent and child a child often understands everything just from a parents glance but americans dont rely on unspoken communication as a general rule and the japanese do it is as if all japanese are members of the same family and they can communicate without words to a japanese silences have meaning its nothing mystical or wonderful connor said for the most part it is because the japanese are so hemmed in by rules and conventions they end up unable to say anything at all for politeness to save face the other person is obliged to read the situation the context and the subtle signs of body posture and unstated feeling because the first person feels he cant actually put anything into words any speaking at all would be indelicate so the point must be gotten across in other ways i said and thats how your morning was spent not talking connor shook his head he felt he had quite clear communication with the japanese golfers and wasnt troubled by the silences at all because i was asking them to talk about other japanese members of their family i had to frame my questions with great delicacy just as i would if i were asking whether your sister was in jail or any subject that was painful or awkward for you i would be attentive to how long it took you to answer and the pauses between your statements the tone of your voice all sorts of things beyond the literal communication okay okay it means you get the feeling by an intuition and what was the intuition you got they said we are mindful that you have performed services for us in the past we feel a desire to help you now but this murder is a japanese matter and thus we are unable to tell you everything that we might like to from our reticence you may draw useful conclusions about the underlying issue thats what they said to me and what is the underlying issue well connor said they mentioned microcon several times that hightech company yes the one thats being sold apparently its a small company in silicon valley that makes specialized computer machinery and there are political problems about the sale they referred to those problems several times so this murder has something to do with microcon i think so he shifted in his chair by the way what did you learn at usc about the tapes for one thing that they were duplicated connor nodded i assumed that he said you did ishiguro would never give us the originals the japanese think everybody who is not japanese is a barbarian they mean it literally barbarian stinking vulgar stupid barbarian theyre polite about it because they know you cant help the misfortune of not being born japanese but they still think it i nodded that was more or less what sanders had said too the other thing connor said is that the japanese are extremely successful but they are not daring they are plotters and plodders so theyre not going to give us the originals because they dont want to take any chances now what else did you learn about the tapes what makes you think there was something else i said when you looked at the tapes he said im sure you noticed an important detail that and then we were interrupted by the telephone captain connor said a cheerful voice over the speaker phone this is jerry orr over at sunset hills country club you left without taking the papers with you the papers the application orr said you need to fill it out captain of course its just routine i can assure you there wont be any problem with it considering who your sponsors are my sponsors connor said yes sir orr said and congratulations as you know its almost impossible to obtain a membership at sunset these days but mr hanadas company had already bought a corporate membership some time ago and they have decided to put it in your name i must say its a very nice gesture from your friends yes it is connor said frowning i was looking at him they know how fond you are of playing golf here orr said you know the terms of course hanada will purchase the membership over five years but after that time itll be transferred to your name so when you retire from club membership youre free to sell it now will you be picking up the paperwork here or should i send it to your home connor said mr orr please convey my heartfelt appreciation to mr hanada for his very great generosity i hardly know what to say but i will have to call you back about this thats fine you just let us know where to send it ill call you back connor said he pushed the button to end the call and stared forward frowning there was a long silence i said how much is a membership at that club worth seven fifty maybe a million i said pretty nice gift from your friends i was thinking again of graham and the way graham had always implied that connor was in the pocket of the japanese there didnt seem to be much doubt of it now connor was shaking his head i dont get it whats not to get i said jesus captain seems pretty straightforward to me no i dont get it connor said and then the phone rang again this time it was for me lieutenant smith its louise gerber im so glad i was able to reach you i didnt recognize her name i said yes since tomorrow is saturday i was wondering if you had any time to look at a house then i remembered who she was a month earlier i had gone out with a broker to look at houses michelle is getting older and i wanted to get her out of an apartment to get her a backyard if i could it was pretty discouraging even with a real estate slump the smallest houses were four and five hundred thousand i couldnt possibly qualify for that on my salary this is a very special situation she said and i thought of you and your little girl its a small house in palms very small but its a corner lot and it has a charming backyard flowers and a lovely lawn the asking is three hundred but the reason i thought of you is that the seller is willing to take back all the paper on it i think you could get it for very little down do you want to see it i said who is the seller i dont really know its a special situation the house is owned by an elderly woman who has gone into a nursing home and her son who lives in topeka intends to sell it but he wants an income flow instead of an outright sale the propertys not formally listed yet but i know the seller is motivated if you could get in tomorrow you might be able to do something and the backyard is charming i can just see your little girl there now connor was looking at me i said miss gerber id have to know more about it who the seller is and so on she sounded surprised gee i thought youd jump at it a situation like this doesnt come along very often dont you want to look at it connor was looking at me nodding he mouthed say yes ill have to get back to you about this i said all right lieutenant she said she sounded reluctant please let me know i will i hung up what the hell is going on i said because there wasnt any way to get around it between us we had just been offered a lot of money a lotof money connor shook his head i dont know is it to do with microcon i dont know i thought microcon was a small company this doesnt make sense he looked very uneasy what exactly ismicrocon i said i think i know who to ask microcon ron levine said lighting a big cigar sure i can tell you about microcon its an ugly story we were sitting in the newsroom of american financial network a cable news operation located near the airport through the window of rons office i could see the white satellite dishes on the roof of the adjacent garage ron puffed on his cigar and grinned at us he had been a financial reporter at the timesbefore taking an oncamera job here afn was one of the few television operations where the oncamera people werent scripted they had to know what they were talking about and ron did microcon he said was formed five years ago by a consortium of american computer manufacturers the company was intended to develop the next generation of xray lithography machines for computer chips at the time microcon started up there were no american manufacturers of lithography machines theyd all been put out of business in the eighties under intense competition from the japanese microcon developed new technology and has been building machines for american companies okay okay i said two years ago microcon was sold to darleyhiggins a management company in georgia darleys other operations were foundering the company decided to sell microcon to raise cash they found a buyer in akai ceramics an osaka company that already made lithography machines in japan akai had plenty of cash and was willing to acquire the american company for a high price then congress moved to stop the sale why the decline of american business is starting to disturb even congress weve lost too many basic industries to japan steel and shipbuilding in the sixties television and computer chips in the seventies machine tools in the eighties one day somebody wakes up and realizes these industries are vital for american defense weve lost the ability to make components essential to our national security were entirely dependent on japan to supply them so congress starts to worry but i hear the sale is going through anyway why do you guys have something to do with the sale in a sense connor said lucky you ron said puffing on his cigar if youre involved in a sale to the japanese its like striking oil everybody gets rich you two are looking at some pretty big gifts i imagine connor nodded very big im sure ron said theyll take care of you buy you a house or a car get you cheap financing something like that i said why would they do that ron laughed why would they eat sushi its the way they conduct business connor said but isnt microcon a small sale yeah pretty small the companys worth a hundred million akais buying it for a hundred and fifty on top of that they probably have another twenty million in incentives to the current corporate officers maybe ten million in legal ten million in consultant fees spread around washington and ten million in miscellaneous gifts for people like you so call it two hundred million in total i said two hundred million for a hundredmillion company why are they paying more than its worth theyre not ron said as far as theyre concerned theyre getting a bargain why because ron said if you own the machines that are used to make something like computer chips you own the downstream industries that depend on those machines microcon will give them control over the american computer industry and as usual were allowing it to happen just the way we lost our television industry and our machinetool industry what happened to the tv industry i said he glanced at his watch after world war ii america was the worlds leading manufacturer of televisions twentyseven american companies like zenith rca ge and emerson had a solid technological lead over foreign manufacturers american companies were successful around the world except in japan they couldnt penetrate the closed japanese market they were told if they wanted to sell in japan they had to license their technology to japanese companies and they did reluctantly under pressure from the american government which wanted to keep japan as a friendly ally against russia okay okay now licensing is a bad idea it means japan gets our technology for their own use and we lose japan as an export market pretty soon japan begins to make cheap blackandwhite tvs and exports them to america something we cant do in japan right by sixty percent of american blackandwhite sales are imports by one hundred percent are imports weve lost the blackandwhite market american workers dont make those sets any more those jobs are gone from america we say it doesnt matter our companies have moved on to color but the japanese government starts an intensive program to develop a colortelevision industry once again japan licenses american technology refines it in their protected markets and floods us with exports once again exports drive out american companies exactly the same story by only three american companies still make color tvs by theres only one zenith but japanese sets were better and cheaper i said they may have been better ron said but they were only cheaper because they were sold below production cost to wipe out american competitors thats called dumping its illegal under both american and international law then why didnt we stop it good question especially since dumping was only one of many illegal japanese marketing techniques they also fixed prices they had something called the tenthday group japanese managers met every ten days in a tokyo hotel to set prices in america we protested but the meetings continued they also pushed distribution of their products by collusive arrangements the japanese allegedly paid millions in kickbacks to american distributors like sears they engaged in massive customs fraud and they destroyed the american industry which could not compete of course our companies protested and sued for relief there were dozens of cases of dumping fraud and antitrust brought against japanese companies in federal court dumping cases are usually resolved within a year but our government provided no help and the japanese are skilled footdraggers they paid american lobbyists millions to plead their case by the time the suits came to trial twelve years later the battle was over in the marketplace and of course all during this time american companies could never fight back in japan they couldnt even get a foot in the door in japan youre saying the japanese took over the television industry illegally ron shrugged they couldnt have done it without our help he said our government was coddling japan which they saw as a tiny emerging country and american industry was perceived as not needing government help theres always been a strain of antibusiness sentiment in america but our government never seemed to realize its just not the same here when sony develops the walkman we dont say nice product now you have to license it to ge and sell it through an american company if they seek distribution we dont tell them im sorry but american stores all have preexisting arrangements with american suppliers youll have to distribute through an american company here if they seek patents we dont say patents take eight years to be awarded during which time your application will be publicly available so that our companies can read what youve invented and copy it free of charge so that by the time we issue a patent our companies will already have their own version of your technology we dont do any of those things japan does all of them their markets are closed our markets are wide open its not a level playing field in fact its not a playing field at all its a oneway street and by now we have a defeatist business climate in this country american companies got their asses handed to them in blackandwhite television they got their asses handed to them in color television the us government refused to help our companies fight illegal japanese trade practices so when ampex invented the vcr they didnt even try to make a commercial product they just licensed the technology to japan and moved on and pretty soon you find that american companies dont do research why develop new technology if your own government is so hostile to your efforts that you wont be able to bring it to market but isnt american business weak and badly managed thats the standard line ron said as promoted by the japanese and their american spokesmen its only with a few episodes that people ever glimpsed how outrageous the japanese really were like the houdaille case you know that one houdaille was a machinetool company that claimed its patents and licenses were being violated by companies in japan a federal judge sent houdailles lawyer to japan to gather evidence but the japanese refused to issue him a visa youre kidding what do they care ron said they know well never retaliate when the houdaille case came before the reagan administration it did nothing so houdaille got out of machine tools because nobody can compete against dumped products thats the whole point of doing it dont you lose money if you dump for a while yes but youre selling millions of units so you can refine your production lines and get your costs down a couple of years later you really can make the products for a lower cost meanwhile youve wiped out the competition and you control the market you see the japanese think strategically theyre in for the long haul for how things will look fifty years from now an american company has to show a profit every three months or the ceo and the officers will be out on the street but the japanese dont care about shortterm profits at all they want market share business is like warfare to them gaining ground wiping out the competition getting control of a market thats what theyve been doing for the last thirty years so the japanese dumped steel televisions consumer electronics computer chips machine tools and nobody stopped them and we lost those industries japanese companies and the japanese government target specific industries which they take over industry after industry year after year while we sit around and spout off about free trade but free trade is meaningless unless there is also fair trade and the japanese dont believe in fair trade at all you know theres a reason the japanese love reagan they cleaned up during his presidency in the name of free trade he spread our legs real wide why dont americans understand this i said connor laughed why do they eat hamburgers its the way they are kohai from the newsroom a woman called somebody named connor here call for you from the four seasons hotel connor glanced at his watch and stood up excuse me he walked out into the newsroom through the glass i saw him talking on the phone making notes you realize ron said its all still going on why is a japanese camera cheaper in new york than in tokyo you ship it halfway around the world pay import duty and distribution costs and its still cheaper how is that possible japanese tourists buy their own products here because theyre cheaper meanwhile american products in japan cost seventy percent more than here why doesnt the american government get tough i dont know part of the answer is up there he pointed to the monitor in his office a distinguishedlooking man was talking above a running tickertape the sound was turned low you see that guy thats david rawlings professor of business at stanford specialist in the pacific rim hes a typical turn that up will you he might be talking about microcon i turned the knob on the set i heard rawlings say think american attitudes are completely irrational after all japanese companies are providing jobs for americans while american companies are moving jobs offshore taking them away from their own people the japanese cant understand what the complaints are about ron sighed typical bullshit he said on the screen professor rawlings was saying i think the american people are rather ungrateful for the help our country is getting from foreign investors ron laughed rawlings is part of the group we call the chrysanthemum kissers academic experts who deliver the japanese propaganda line they dont really have a choice because they need access to japan to work and if they start to sound critical their contacts in japan dry up doors are closed to them and in america the japanese will whisper in certain ears that the offending person is not to be trusted or that their views are out of date or worse that theyre racist anybody who criticizes japan is a racist pretty soon these academics begin to lose speaking engagements and consulting jobs they know thats happened to their colleagues who step out of line and they dont make the same mistake connor came back into the room he said is there anything illegal about this microcon sale sure ron said depending on what washington decides to do akai ceramics already has sixty percent of the american market microcon will give it a virtual monopoly if akai were an american company the government would block the sale on antitrust grounds but since akai is not an american company the sale isnt scrutinized closely in the end itll probably be allowed you mean a japanese company can have a monopoly in america but an american company cant thats the usual outcome these days ron said but american laws often promote the sale of our companies to foreigners like matsushita buying universal studios universals been for sale for years several american companies tried to buy it but couldnt westinghouse tried in no deal violates antitrust rca tried no deal violates conflict of interest but when matsushita came in there were no laws against it at all recently our laws changed under present law rca could buy universal but back then no microcon is just the latest example of crazy american regulations i said but what do american computer companies say about the microcon sale ron said american companies dont like the sale but they dont oppose it either why not because american companies feel overregulated by the government already forty percent of all american exports are covered by security regulations our government doesnt allow our computer companies to sell to eastern europe the cold war is over but the regulations still exist meanwhile the japanese and germans are selling products like mad so the americans want less regulation and they see any attempt to block the microcon sale as government interference i said it still doesnt make sense to me i agree ron said the american companies are going to get killed in the next few years because if japan is the sole source of chipmaking machines theyre in a position to withhold the machines from american companies would they do that theyve done it before ron said ion implanters and other machines but the american companies cant get together they squabble among themselves and meanwhile the japanese are buying hightech companies at the rate of about one every ten days for the last six years were being disemboweled but our government doesnt pay attention because we have something called cfius the committee on foreign investment in the united states that monitors the sale of hightech companies except cfius never does anything of the last five hundred sales only one was blocked company after company gets sold and nobody in washington says boo finally senator morton makes a stink and says wait a minute here but nobodys listening to him the sale is going through anyway thats what i heard today the japanese pr machine is hard at work cranking out favorable publicity and they are tenacious they are on top of everything i mean everything there was a knock at the door and a blond woman stuck her head in sorry to disturb you ron she said but keith just got a call from the los angeles representative for nhk japanese national television he wants to know why our reporter is bashing japan ron frowned bashing japan whats he talking about he claims our reporter said on air the damn japanese are taking over this country come on ron said nobody would say that on air whos supposed to have said that lenny in new york over the backhaul the woman said ron shifted in his chair uhoh he said did you check the tapes yeah she said theyre tracing the download now in the main control room but i assume its true hell i said whats the backhaul our satellite feed we pick up segments from new york and washington every day and replay them theres always about a minute before and after that isnt aired we cut it out but the raw transmission can be picked up by anybody with a private dish who wants to hunt for our signal and people do we warn the talent to be careful what they do in front of a camera but last year louise unbuttoned her blouse and miked herself and we got calls from all over the country rons phone rang he listened for a moment and said okay i understand and hung up they checked the tape lenny was talking on camera before the feed and he said to louise the goddamn japanese are going to own this country if we dont wise up it wasnt on air but he did say it he shook his head ruefully the nhk guy knows we didnt run it yeah but hes saying it can be picked up and hes protesting on that basis hell ron said so they even monitor our backhaul jesus what does keith want to do keith says hes tired of warning new york talent he wants you to handle it does he want me to call the nhk guy he says use your judgment but we have a deal with nhk for the halfhour show we send them every day and he doesnt want that risked he thinks you should apologize ron sighed now i have to apologize for what wasnt even on air god damnit he looked at us guys i have to go was there anything else no i said good luck listen ron said we all need good luck you know nhk is starting global news network with a billion dollars in capitalization theyre going to take on ted turners cnn around the world and if past history is any guide he shrugged kiss the american media goodbye as we were leaving i heard ron say on the phone mr akasaka ron levine over here at afn yes sir yes mr akasaka sir i wanted to express my concern and deep apologies about what our reporter said over the satellite we closed the door and left where now i said the four seasons hotel is favored by stars and politicians and it has a graceful entrance but we were parked around the corner by the service entrance a large dairy truck was pulled up to a loading dock and kitchen staff was unloading cartons of milk we had been waiting here for five minutes connor glanced at his watch i said why are we here were complying with the supreme court kohai at the loading dock a woman in a business suit came out looked around and waved connor waved back she disappeared again connor got out his billfold and took out a couple of twenties one of the first things i learned as a detective connor said is that hotel staff can be extremely helpful particularly since the police have so many restrictions these days we cant go into a hotel room without a warrant if we did whatever we found in a search would be inadmissible right right but the maids can go in valet and housekeeping and room service can go in uhhuh so ive learned to maintain contacts at all the big hotels he opened the door ill only be a moment he walked to the loading dock and waited i tapped the steering wheel with my hands the words came into my head i changed my mind this love is fine goodness gracious great balls of fire on the loading dock a maid in uniform came out and talked to connor briefly he took notes she held something golden in the palm of her hand he didnt touch it he just looked at it and nodded she slipped it back in her pocket then he gave her money she went away you shake my nerves and you rattle my brain too much love drives a man insane you broke my will but what a thrill a valet came out onto the loading dock carrying a mans blue suit on a hanger connor asked a question and the valet looked at his watch before he answered then connor crouched down and peered closely at the lower edges of the suit coat he opened the jacket and examined the trousers on the hanger the valet took away the first suit and brought a second one out onto the dock this one was a blue pinstripe suit connor repeated his inspection he seemed to find something on the coat and scraped it carefully into a small glassine bag then he paid the valet and walked back to the car i said checking senator rowe checking a number of things he said but yes senator rowe rowes aide had white panties in his pocket last night but cheryl was wearing black panties thats true connor said but i think we are making progress whatve you got in the bag he took the little glassine bag out and held it to the light i saw small dark strands through the plastic carpet fibers i think dark like the carpet at the nakamoto conference room have to check with the lab to be sure meanwhile we have another problem to solve start the car where are we going darleyhiggins the company that owns microcon in the lobby beside the receptionist a workman was mounting large gold letters on the wall darleyhiggins inc beneath that it read excellence in management more workmen were laying carpet in the hallway we showed our badges and asked to see the head of darleyhiggins arthur greiman the receptionist had a southern accent and an upturned nose mr greiman is in meetings all day is he expecting you were here about the microcon sale then you want mr enders our vicepresident for publicity he speaks to people about microcon all right connor said we sat down on a couch in the reception area on a couch across the room sat a pretty woman in a tight skirt she had a roll of blueprints under her arm the workmen continued to hammer i said i thought the company was in financial trouble whyre they redecorating connor shrugged the secretary answered the phone routing the calls darleyhiggins one moment please darleyhiggins oh please hold senator darleyhiggins yes thank you i picked up a brochure from the coffee table it was the annual report of darleyhiggins management group with offices in atlanta dallas seattle san francisco and los angeles i found a picture of arthur greiman he looked happy and selfsatisfied the report included an essay signed by him entitled a commitment to excellence the secretary said to us mr enders will be right with you thank you connor said a moment later two men in business suits walked out into the hallway the woman with the blueprints stood she said hello mr greiman hello beverly the older man said ill be with you in a minute connor stood up too the secretary immediately said mr greiman these men just a minute greiman said he turned to the man with him who was younger in his early thirties just make sure you get it straight with roger greiman said the younger man was shaking his head he wont like it i know he wont but tell him anyway six million four in direct compensation for the ceo is the minimum but arthur just tell him i will arthur the younger man said smoothing his tie he lowered his voice but the board may balk at raising you above six when company earnings are down so much were not talking about earnings greiman said were talking about compensation it has nothing to do with earnings the board has to match current compensation levels for chief executives if roger cant bring the board into line on this im going to cancel the march meeting and ask for changes you tell him that okay i will arthur but just do it call me tonight right arthur they shook hands the younger man walked off unhappily the receptionist said mr greiman these gentlemen greiman turned to us connor said mr greiman wed like to speak to you for a minute about microcon and he turned slightly aside and showed his badge greiman exploded in rage oh for christs sake not again this is goddamned harassment harassment what would you call it ive had senatorial staffers here ive had the fbi here now i have the la police were not criminals we own a company and we have the right to sell it where is louis the receptionist said mr enders is coming connor said calmly mr greiman im sorry to disturb you we have only one question itll just take a minute greiman glowered whats your question how many bidders were there for microcon thats none of your business he said anyway our agreement with akai stipulates that we cant discuss the sale publicly in any way connor said was there more than one bidder look you have questions you talk to enders im busy he turned to the woman with blueprints beverly what have you got for me i have a revised layout for the boardroom mr greiman and tile samples for the washroom a very nice gray i think youll like good good he led her down the hallway away from us connor watched them go and then abruptly turned toward the elevator come on kohai lets get some fresh air why does it matter if there were other bidders i said when we were back in the car it goes back to the original question we had connor said who wants to embarrass nakamoto we know the sale of microcon has strategic significance thats why congress is upset but that almost certainly means other parties are upset too in japan exactly who will know that akai the japanese receptionist tittered when she saw connors badge connor said we would like to see mr yoshida yoshida was the head of the company one moment please she got up and hurried away almost running akai ceramics was located on the fifth floor of a bland officeblock in el segundo the decor was spare and industriallooking from the reception area we could see into a large space which was not partitioned lots of metal desks and people at the phones the soft click of word processors i looked at the office pretty bare all business connor said nodding in japan ostentation is frowned on it means you are not serious when old mr matsushita was the head of the third biggest company in japan he still took the regular commercial jet between his head offices in osaka and tokyo he was the head of a fiftybilliondollar company but no private jets for him as we waited i looked at the people working at the desks a handful were japanese most were caucasian everyone wore blue suits there were almost no women in japan connor said if a company is doing poorly the first thing that happens is the executives cut their own salaries they feel responsible for the success of the company and they expect their own fortunes to rise and fall as the company succeeds or fails the woman came back and sat at her desk without speaking almost immediately a japanese man wearing a blue suit came toward us he had gray hair hornrimmed glasses and a solemn manner he said good morning i am mr yoshida connor made the introductions we all bowed and exchanged business cards mr yoshida took each card with both hands bowing each time formally we did the same i noticed that connor did not speak japanese to him yoshida led us to his office it had windows looking toward the airport the furnishings were austere would you like coffee or tea no thank you connor said we are here in an official capacity i understand he gestured for us to sit down we would like to talk to you about the purchase of microcon ah yes a troubling matter but i am not aware that it should involve the police perhaps it doesnt connor said can you tell us about the sale or is the agreement sealed mr yoshida looked surprised sealed not at all it is all very open and has been from the beginning we were approached by mr kobayashi representing darleyhiggins in tokyo in september of last year that was the first we learned the company was for sale frankly we were surprised that it would be offered we began negotiations in early october the negotiating teams had the basis of a rough agreement by midnovember we proceeded to the final stage of negotiations but then the congress raised objections on november sixteenth connor said you said you were surprised that the company would be offered for sale yes certainly why is that mr yoshida spread his hands on his desk and spoke slowly we understood that microcon was a governmentowned company it had been financed in part by funds from the american government thirteen percent of capitalization if i remember in japan that would make it a governmentowned company so naturally we were cautious to enter into negotiations we do not want to offend but we received assurance from our representatives in washington there would be no objection to the purchase i see but now there are difficulties as we feared i think now we make a cause for americans in washington some people are upset we do not wish this you didnt expect washington would make objections mr yoshida gave a diffident shrug the two countries are different in japan we know what to expect here there is always an individual who may have another opinion and speak it but akai ceramics does not wish a high profile it is awkward now connor nodded sympathetically it sounds as if you want to withdraw many in the home office criticize me for not knowing what would happen but i tell them it is impossible to know washington has no firm policy it changes every day according to the politics he smiled and added or i would say that is how it seems to us but you expect the sale to go forward this i cannot say perhaps the criticism from washington will be too much and you know the tokyo government wants to be friends with america they give pressure on business not to make purchases that will upset america rockefeller center and universal studios these purchases that make criticism for us we are told to be yojinbukai it means discreet connor said careful yes wary he looked at connor you speak japanese a little yoshida nodded for a moment he seemed to consider switching to japanese but did not we wish to have friendly relations he said these criticisms of us we feel they are not fair the darleyhiggins company has many financial difficulties perhaps bad management perhaps some other reason i cannot say but that is not our fault we are not responsible for that and we did not seek microcon it was offered to us now we are criticized for trying to help he sighed outside a big jet took off from the airport the windows rattled connor said and the other bidders for microcon when did they drop out mr yoshida frowned there were no other bidders the company was privately offered darleyhiggins did not wish to make known their financial difficulties so we cooperated with them but now the press makes many distortions about us we feel very kizu tsuita wounded yes he shrugged that is how we feel i hope you understand my poor english there was a pause in fact for the next minute or so nobody said anything connor sat facing yoshida i sat beside connor another jet took off and the windows vibrated again still nobody spoke yoshida gave a long sigh connor nodded yoshida shifted in his chair and folded his hands over his belly connor sighed and grunted yoshida sighed both men seemed to be entirely focused something was taking place but i was not clear what i decided it must be this unspoken intuition finally yoshida said captain i wish no misunderstanding akai ceramics is an honorable company we have no part in any complications that have occurred our position is difficult but i will assist you in whatever way i can connor said i am grateful not at all then yoshida stood up connor stood up i stood up we all bowed and then we all shook hands please do not hesitate to contact me again if i can be of assistance thank you connor said yoshida led us to the door to his office we bowed again and he opened the door outside was a freshfaced american man in his forties i recognized him at once he was the blond man who had been in the car with senator rowe the night before the man who hadnt introduced himself ah richmondsan yoshida said very good luck you are here these gentlemen are just asking about microcon baishu he turned to us perhaps you will like to talk to mr richmond his english is much better than mine he can give you many more details you may wish to know bob richmond myers lawson and richmond his handshake was firm he was suntanned and looked as though he played a lot of tennis he smiled cheerfully small world isnt it connor and i introduced ourselves i said did senator rowe get back all right oh yes richmond said thanks for your help he smiled i hate to think how hes feeling this morning but i guess its not the first time he shifted back and forth on the balls of his feet like a tennis player waiting for a serve he looked slightly concerned i must say you two are the last people i ever expected to see here is there anything i should know about i represent akai in the microcon negotiations no connor said mildly were just getting general background is this to do with what happened at nakamoto last night connor said not really just background if you like we can talk in the conference room unfortunately connor said were late for an appointment but perhaps we can talk later you bet richmond said happy to ill be back in my office in about an hour he gave us his card thats fine connor said but richmond still seemed worried he walked with us to the elevator mr yoshida is from the old school he said im sure he was polite but i can tell you he is furious about what happened with this microcon thing hes taking a lot of heat from akai tokyo and its very unfair he really was sandbagged by washington he got assurances there would be no objection to the sale and then morton pulled the rug out from under him connor said is that what happened no question about it richmond said i dont know what johnny mortons problem is but he came right out of left field on this we made all the proper filings cfius registered no objection until long after the negotiations were concluded you cant do business like this i just hope john sees the light and lets this thing go through because at the moment it looks pretty racist racist really sure its exactly like the fairchild case remember that one fujitsu tries to buy fairchild semiconductor in eightysix but congress blocks the sale saying its against national security congress doesnt want fairchild sold to a foreign company couple of years later fairchild is going to be sold to a french company and this time theres not a peep from congress apparently its okay to sell to a foreign company just not a japanesecompany id say thats racist policy pure and simple we came to the elevator anyway call me ill make myself available thank you connor said we got on the elevator the doors closed asshole connor said i was driving north toward the wilshire exit to meet senator morton i said why is he an asshole bob richmond was the assistant trade negotiator for japan under amanda marden until last year he was privy to all the strategy meetings of the american government one year later he turns around and starts working for the japanese who now pay him five hundred thousand a year plus bonuses to close this deal and hes worth it because he knows everything there is to know is that legal sure its standard procedure they all do it if richmond worked for a hightech company like microsoft hed have to sign an agreement that he wouldnt work for a competing company for five years because you shouldnt be able to peddle trade secrets to the opposition but our government has easier rules why is he an asshole this racist stuff connor snorted he knows better richmond knows exactly what happened with the fairchild sale and it had nothing to do with racism no and theres another thing richmond knows the japanese are the most racist people on earth they are absolutely in fact when the japanese diplomats the car phone rang i pushed the speaker button and said lieutenant smith over the speaker a man said jesus finally where the hell have you guys been i want to get to sleep i recognized the voice fred hoffmann the watch commander from the night before connor said thanks for getting back to us fred what is it you wanted well im curious connor said about the nakamoto calls you got last night you and everybody else in this town hoffmann said i got half the department on my ass about this jim olson is practically camping on my desk going through the paperwork even though it was all routine at the time if youd just review what happened sure first thing i got the transmittal from metro that was the original phonein metro wasnt sure what it meant because the caller had an asian accent and sounded confused or maybe on drugs he kept talking about problems with the disposition of the body they couldnt get it clear what he was talking about anyway i dispatched a black and white about eightthirty then when they confirmed a homicide i assigned tom graham and roddy merino for which i got all kindsof shit later uhhuh but what the hell they were up on the roster next you know were supposed to stay in strict rotation for detective assignments to avoid the appearance of special treatment thats policy i was just following it uhhuh anyway then graham calls in at nine oclock and reports theres trouble at the scene and there is a request for the special services liaison again i check the list pete smith is the sso on call so i give graham his number at home and i guess he called you pete yes i said he did all right connor said what happened after that about two minutes after graham calls maybe nine ohfive i get a call from somebody with an accent i would say it sounds like an asian accent but i dont know for sure and the guy says that on behalf of nakamoto he is requesting captain connor be assigned to the case the caller didnt identify himself sure he did i made him identify himself and i wrote down the name koichi nishi and he was from nakamoto thats what he said hoffmann said im just sitting there working the phone what the hell do i know i mean this morning nakamoto is formally protesting the fact that connor was assigned to the case and saying they have nobody named koichi nishi employed by them theyre claiming its all a fabrication but let me tell you somebody called me im not making it up im sure youre not connor said you say the caller had an accent yeah his english was pretty good you know almost hip but there was a definite accent the only thing i thought was funny was that he seemed to know a hell of a lot about you oh yeah first thing he says to me do i know your phone number or should he give it to me i say i know the number im thinking i dont need some japanese to tell me the phone numbers of people on the force then he says you know captain connor doesnt always answer his phone be sure to send somebody down there to pick him up interesting connor said so i called pete smith and told him to swing by and pick you up and thats all i knew i mean this is all in the context of some political problem theyre having at nakamoto i knew graham was unhappy i figured other people were unhappy too and everybody knows connor has special relationships with the community so i put it through and now there is all this shit coming down fucking beats me tell me about the shit connor said it starts maybe eleven oclock last night when the chief called me about graham why did i assign graham i tell him why but hes still not happy then right at the end of my watch maybe five am there is the business about how connor got brought in how did it happen why did it happen and now theres a story in the timesand this whole thing about racism by the police i dont know which way to turn here i keep explaining i did the routine thing by the book nobody is buying that but its true im sure it is connor said just one more thing fred did you ever listen to the original metro call damn right i did i heard it about an hour ago why did the voice that called in sound like mr nishi hoffmann laughed christ who knows captain maybe youre asking me if one asian voice sounds like another asian voice i heard earlier honestly i dont know the original voice on the call sounded pretty confused maybe in shock maybe on drugs im not sure all i know is whoever mr nishi actually was he knew a hell of a lot about you well thats very helpful get some rest connor thanked him and hung up i pulled off the freeway and headed down wilshire to our meeting with senator morton okay senator now look this way please a little more thats it thats verystrong very masculine i like it a lot yes bloody good now i will need three minutes please the director a tense man wearing a bomber jacket and a baseball cap climbed down off the camera and barked orders in a british accent jerry get a scrim there the sun is too bright and can we do something about his eyes i need a little fill in the eyes please ellen you see the shine on his right shoulder flag it love pull the collar smooth the microphone is visible on his tie and i cant see the gray in his hair bring it up and straighten out the carpeting on the ground so he doesnt trip when he walks people please come on now were losing our lovely light connor and i were standing to one side with a cute production assistant named debbie who held a clipboard across her breasts and said meaningfully the director is edgar lynn should we recognize that name connor said hes the mostexpensive and mostsoughtafter commercial director in the world he is a greatartist edgar did the fantasticapple commercial and oh lots of others and he has directed famous movies too edgar is justthe best she paused and not too crazy really across from the camera senator john morton stood patiently while four people fussed with his tie his jacket his hair his makeup morton was wearing a suit he was standing under a tree with the rolling golf course and the skyscrapers of beverly hills in the background the production crew had laid down a strip of carpet for him to walk on as he approached the camera i said and how is the senator debbie nodded pretty good i think he has a shot connor said you mean a chance for the presidency yeah especially if edgar can do his magic i mean lets face it senator morton is not exactly mel gibson you know what i mean hes got a big nose and hes a little bald and those freckles are a problembecause they photograph so prominently they distract you from his eyes and the eyes are what sell a candidate the eyes connor said oh yeah people get elected on their eyes she shrugged as if it was common knowledge but if the senator puts himself in edgars hands edgar is a great artist he can make it happen edgar lynn walked past us huddled with the cameraman christ clean up the luggage under his eyes lynn said and get the chin firm that chin with a hard inky low and up okay the cameraman said the production assistant excused herself and we waited watching senator morton was still some distance away being worked over by the makeup and wardrobe people mr connor mr smith i turned a young man in a blue pinstripe suit was standing beside us he looked like a senate staffer well turnedout attentive polite im bob woodson with the senators office thank you for coming youre welcome connor said i know the senator is eager to talk to you woodson said im sorry this seems to be running a little late we were supposed to finish shooting by one he glanced at his watch now i guess it may be quite a while but i know the senator wants to talk to you connor said do you know what about someone shouted runthrough runthrough for sound and camera please the cluster around senator morton vanished and woodson turned his attention to the camera edgar lynn was back looking through the lens there still isnt enough gray ellen you will have to add gray to his hair it isnt reading now woodson said i hope he doesnt make him look too old debbie the production assistant said its just for the shot it isnt reading for the shot so we add some gray see ellen is just putting it at the temples itll make him distinguished i dont want him old especially when hes tired he sometimes looks old dont worry the assistant said all right now lynn said thats enough for now senator shall we try a runthrough senator morton said where does this begin line a script girl said perhaps like me morton said then weve already done the first part edgar lynn said thats right love we start here with your turn to the camera and you give us a very strong very direct masculinelook and begin perhaps like me right okay morton said remember think masculine think strong think in control morton said can we shoot it woodson said lynns going to piss him off edgar lynn said all right shoot the rehearsal here we go senator morton walked toward the camera perhaps like me he said youre concerned about the erosion of our national position in recent years america is still the greatest military power but our security depends on our ability to defend ourselves militarily andeconomically and it is economically that america has fallen behind how far behind well under the last two administrations america has gone from the greatest creditor nation to the greatest debtor nation the world has ever seen our industries have fallen behind the rest of the world our workers are less educated than workers in other countries our investors demand shortterm gain and cripple our industries ability to plan for the future and as a result our standard of living is declining rapidly the outlook for our children is bleak connor murmured somebody is actually saying it and in this time of national crisis morton continued many americans have another concern as well as our economic power fades we are vulnerable to a new kind of invasion many americans fear that we may become an economic colony of japan or europe but especially japan many americans feel that the japanese are taking over our industries our recreation lands and even our cities he gestured to the golf course with skyscrapers in the background and in doing so some fear that japan now has the power to shape and determine the future of america morton paused beneath the tree he gave the appearance of thinking how justified are these fears for the american future how much should we be concerned there are some who will tell you foreign investment is a blessing that it helps our nation others take the opposite view and feel we are selling our precious birthright which view is correct which should which is which oh fuckwhats the line again cut cut edgar lynn called take five everybody i need to clean up a few things and then we can do it for real very good senator i liked it the script girl said which should we believe for the future of america senator he repeated which should we believe for the future of he shook his head no wonder i cant remember it lets change that line margie lets change that line please never mind bring me a script ill change it myself and the crowd of makeup and wardrobe people descended on him again touching him up and fluffing him down woodson said wait here ill try and get you a few minutes with him we stood beside a humming trailer with power cables coming out of it as soon as morton approached us two aides came running up brandishing thick books of computer printout john you better look at this john you better consider this morton said what is it john this is the latest gallup and fielding john this is the crossreferenced analysis by voter agebrackets and bottom line john the president is right dont tell me that im running againstthe president but john hes right about the cword you cant say the cword in your television ad i cant say conservation you cant say it john its death john the figures show it you want us to run over the figures john no morton said he glanced at connor and me ill be right with you he said with a smile but look here john its very clear john conservation means diminution of lifestyle people are already experiencing diminution of lifestyle they dont want any more of it but thats wrong morton said thats not how it works john its what the voters think but theyre wrong about this john you want to educate the voters well and good yes i do want to educate the voters conservation is not synonymous with diminution of lifestyle it is synonymous with more wealth power and freedom the idea is not to make do with less the idea is to do all the things you are doing now heat your house drive your car using less gas and oil lets have more efficient heaters in our houses more efficient cars on our streets lets have cleaner air better health it can be done other countries have done it japan has done it john please not japan in the last twenty years morton said japan cut the energy cost of finished goods by sixty percent america has done nothing japan can now make goods cheaper than we can because japan has pushed investment in energyefficient technology conservation is competitive and we arent being competitive fine john conservation andstatistics reallyboring nobody cares john the american people care morton said john they absolutely dont and they arent going to listen look john we have ageregressions here particularly among the over fiftyfives which is the most solid voting block and they are straight ahead on this issue they want no decreases no conservation the old people of america dont want it but older people have children and grandchildren they must care about the future older people dont give a flying fuck john its right here in black and white they think their kids dont care about them and theyre right so they dont care about their kids its that simple but certainly the children children dont vote john please john listen to us no conservation john competitiveness yes look to the future yes face our problems yes a new spirit yes but no conservation just look at the numbers dont do it please morton said ill think about it fellas the two aides seemed to realize that that was all they were going to get they closed their printouts with a snap you want us to send margie over to rewrite no im thinking about it maybe margie should just rough out a few lines no okay john okay you know morton said as they were leaving some day an american politician is going to do what he thinks is right instead of what the polls tell him and its going to look revolutionary the two aides turned back together john come on youre tired its been a long trip we understand john trust us on this we have the figures we are telling you with ninetyfive percent confidence intervals how the people feel i know damn well how they feel they feel frustrated and i know why its been fifteen years since theyve had any leadership john lets not do this one again this is the twentieth century leadership is the quality of telling people what they want to hear they walked away immediately woodson came up carrying a portable phone he started to speak but morton held up his hand not now bob senator i think you need to take this not now woodson backed away morton glanced at his watch youre mr connor and mr smith yes connor said lets walk morton said he started away from the film crew toward a hill overlooking the rolling course it was friday not many people were playing we stood about fifty meters from the crew i asked you to come morton said because i understand youre the officers in charge of the nakamoto business i was about to protest that it wasnt true that graham was the officer in charge when connor said thats true we are i have some questions about that case i gather its been resolved now it seems to be is your investigation finished for all practical purposes yes connor said the investigation is concluded morton nodded im told you officers are particularly knowledgeable about the japanese community is that right one of you has even lived in japan connor gave a slight bow you were the one playing golf with hanada and asaka today morton said youre well informed i spoke with mr hanada this morning we have had contact in the past on other matters morton turned abruptly and said my question is this is the nakamoto business related to microcon how do you mean connor said the sale of microcon to the japanese has come before the senate finance committee which i chair weve been asked for a recommendation by staff from the committee on science and technology which must actually authorize the sale as you know the sale is controversial in the past i have gone on record as opposing the sale for a variety of reasons youre familiar with all this yes connor said i still have problems about it morton said microcons advanced technology was developed in part with american taxpayer money im outraged that our taxpayers should pay for research that is being sold to the japanese who will then use it to compete against our own companies i feel strongly we should be protecting american capacity in hightech areas i feel we should be protecting our intellectual resources i feel we should be limiting foreign investment in our corporations and our universities but i seem to be alone in this i cant find support in the senate or in industry commerce wont help me the trade reps worried itll upset the rice negotiations rice even the pentagon is against me on this and i just wondered since nakamoto is the parent company of akai ceramics whether the events of last night had any relationship to the proposed sale he paused he was looking at us in an intense way it was almost as if he expected that we would know something connor said im not aware of any linkage has nakamoto done anything unfair or improper to promote the sale not that i am aware no and your investigation is formally concluded yes i just want to be clear because if i back down on my opposition to this sale i dont want to find that ive stuck my hand in a box of snakes one could argue that the party at nakamoto was an attempt to win over opponents to the sale so a change of position can be worrisome you know in congress they can get you coming and going with a thing like this connor said are you abandoning your opposition to the sale from across the lawn an aide said senator theyre ready for you sir well morton shrugged im out on a limb with this thing nobody agrees with my position on microcon personally i think its another fairchild case but if this battle cant be won i say lets not fight it plenty of other battles to be fought anyway he straightened smoothed his suit senator when youre ready sir and he added theyre concerned about the light theyre concerned about the light morton said shaking his head dont let us keep you connor said anyway morton said i wanted your input i understand you to say that last night had nothing to do with microcon the people involved had nothing to do with it im not going to read next month that someone was working behind the scenes trying to promote or block the sale nothing like that not as far as i know connor said gentlemen thank you for coming he said he shook both of our hands and started away then he came back i appreciate your treating this matter as confidential because you know we have to be careful we are at war with japan he smiled wryly loose lips sink ships yes connor said and remember pearl harbor christ that too he shook his head he dropped his voice becoming one of the boys you know i have colleagues who say sooner or later were going to have to drop another bomb they think itll come to that he smiled but i don t feel that way usually still smiling he headed back to the camera crew as he walked he collected people first a woman with script changes then a wardrobe man then a sound man fiddling with his microphone and adjusting the battery pack at his waist and the makeup woman until finally the senator had disappeared from view and there was just a cluster of people moving awkwardly across the lawn i said i like him i was driving back into hollywood the buildings were hazy in the smog why shouldnt you like him connor said hes a politician its his job to make you like him then hes good at his job very good i think connor stared out the window silently i had the sense that something was troubling him i said didnt you like what he was saying in the commercial it sounded like all the things you say yes it did then whats the matter nothing connor said i was just thinking about what he actually said he mentioned fairchild of course connor said morton knows the real story about fairchild very well i started to ask him what it was but he was already telling me have you ever heard of seymour cray for years he was the best designer of supercomputers in the world cray research made the fastest computers in the world the japanese were trying to catch up with him but they just couldnt do it he was too brilliant but by the mideighties japanese chip dumping had put most of crays domestic suppliers out of business so cray had to order his customdesigned chips from japanese manufacturers there was nobody in america to make them and his japanese suppliers experienced mysterious delays at one point it took them a yearto deliver certain chips he had ordered and during that time his japanese competitors made great strides forward there was also a question of whether they had stolen his new technology cray was furious he knew they were fucking with him he decided that he had to form a liaison with an american manufacturer and so he chose fairchild semiconductor even though the company was financially weak far from the best but cray couldnt trust the japanese anymore he had to make do with fairchild so now fairchild was making his next generation of custom chips for him and then he learned that fairchild was going to be sold to fujitsu his big competitor it was concern about situations like that and the national security implications that led congress to block the sale to fujitsu and then well blocking the sale didnt solve fairchilds financial problems the company was still in trouble and it eventually had to be sold there was a rumor it was going to be bought by bull a french company that didnt compete in supercomputers that sale might have been permitted by congress but in the end fairchild was sold to an american company and microcon is another fairchild yes in the sense that microcon will give the japanese a monopoly on vital chipmaking machinery once they have a monopoly they can withhold the machines from american companies but now i think that was when the phone rang i left it on the speakerphone it was lauren my exwife peter i said hello lauren peter i am calling to inform you that im going to pick up michelle early today her voice sounded tense formal you are i didnt know you were picking her up at all i never said that peter she answered quickly of course im picking her up i said okay fine by the way whos rick there was a pause really that is beneath you peter why i said im just curious michelle mentioned it this morning she said he has a black mercedes is he the new boyfriend peter i hardly think that is on the same level i said the same level as what lets not play games she said this is difficult enough im calling to tell you i have to pick up michelle early because im taking her to the doctor why shes over her cold im taking her for an examination peter for what an examination i heard you i said but the physician who will examine her is robert strauss he is an expert im told i have been asking people in the office who is the best person i dont know how this is going to turn out peter but i want you to know i am concerned particularly in the light of your history lauren what are you talking about im talking about child abuse she said im talking about sexual molestation what theres no getting around it at this point you know youve been accused of it in the past i felt churning nausea whenever a relationship goes sour theres always some residue of resentment some pockets of bitterness and anger as well as lots of private things that you know about the other person that you can use against them if you choose to do that lauren never had lauren you know that abuse charge was trumped up you know everything about that we were married at the time i only know what you told me her voice sounded distant now moralistic a little sarcastic her prosecutors voice lauren for christs sake this is ridiculous whats going on it is not ridiculous i have my responsibilities as a mother well for gods sake youve never been particularly worried about your responsibilities as a mother before and now you its true that i have a demanding career she said in an icy tone but there has never been any question that my daughter comes first and i deeply deeplyregret if my past behavior in any way contributed to this unpleasant circumstance now i had the feeling that she wasnt talking to me she was rehearsing trying out the words to see how they would sound before a judge clearly peter if there is child abuse michelle cannot continue to live with you or even to see you i felt pain in my chest a wrenching what are you talking about who told you there was child abuse peter i dont think its appropriate for me to comment at this point in time was it wilhelm who called you lauren peter theres no point in going into this im officially notifying you that im going to pick michelle up at four pm i want her ready to go at four this afternoon lauren i have my secretary miss wilson listening on the line and making stenographic notes of our conversation im giving you formal notice of my intention to pick up my daughter and take her for a physical examination do you have any questions about my decision no four oclock then thank you for your cooperation and let me add on a personal note peter im truly sorry that it has come to this and she hung up i had been involved in sex abuse cases when i was a detective i knew how it worked the fact is you usually cant determine anything from a physical exam its always equivocal and if a kid is questioned by a psychologist who hammers her with questions the kid will eventually start to go along and make up answers to please the psychologist normal procedure requires the psychologist to videotape the kids to prove that the questioning wasnt leading but the situation is almost always unclear when it finally comes before a judge and the judge must therefore rule conservatively which means if there is a possibility of abuse to keep the child away from the accused parent or at least not allow unsupervised visitation no overnight visits or perhaps not even thats enough connor said sitting beside me in the car come back now sorry i said but its upsetting im sure now what havent you told me about what the molestation charge nothing theres nothing to it kohai he said quietly i cant help you if you wont tell me it had nothing to do with sexual molestation i said it was something else entirely it was about money connor said nothing he just waited looking at me ah hell i said and i told him you have these times in your life when you believe you know what youre doing but you really dont later on you can look back and you see you werent acting right at all you drifted into something and you were completely screwed up but at the time you thought everything was fine what happened to me was i was in love lauren was one of those patricianacting girls lean and graceful and understated she looked like she grew up with horses and she was younger than me and beautiful i always knew it wouldnt work between us but i was trying to make it work anyway we had gotten married and had begun living together and she was starting to be dissatisfied dissatisfied with my apartment where it was located how much money we had all of that she was throwing up which didnt help she had crackers in the car crackers by the bed crackers everywhere she was so miserable and so unhappy that i tried to please her in little ways get her things bring her things cook her meals do little domestic things it wasnt my usual way but i was in love i was drifting into this habit of pleasing her trying to please her and there was constant pressure more this more that more money more more we also had a specific problem her health insurance through the das office didnt cover pregnancy and neither did mine after we got married we couldnt get coverage in time to pay for the baby it was going to cost eight thousand dollars and we had to come up with it neither of us had the money laurens father was a doctor in virginia but she didnt want to ask him for the money because he disapproved of her marrying me in the first place my family doesnt have any money so there wasnt any money she worked for the da i worked for the department she had a lot of debts on her mastercard and owed money on her car we had to come up with eight thousand dollars its hanging over our heads how we are going to do this and it gets to be an unspoken thing at least from her that i should handle it so one night in august im out on a domestic violence call in ladera heights hispanic couple theyve been drinking and going at it pretty good shes got a split lip and hes got a black eye and their kids screaming in the next room but pretty soon we calm them down and we can see that nobody is seriously injured so were about to leave and the wife sees were about to leave at that point she starts yelling that the husband has been fooling with the daughter physically abusing the daughter when the husband hears this he looks really pissed and i think its bullshit the wife is just doing something to harass him but the wife insists we check the daughter so i go into the kids room and the kid is about nine months old and screaming red in the face and i pull the covers back to check for bruises and there i see a kilo of white brick under the covers with the kid so i dont know its one of those situations theyre married so shed have to testify against her husband theres no probable cause the search is invalid on and on if hes got a halfway decent lawyer he can beat this no problem so i go out and call the guy in i know i cant do anything all im thinking is that if his kid ever got this brick in her mouth chewed on it it would kill her i want to talk to him about that i figure ill fuck him over a little scare him a little so now its him and me in the kids room the wife is still out in the living room with my partner and suddenly the guy pulls out an envelope two centimeters thick he cracks it open i see hundreddollar bills an inch thick of hundreddollar bills and he says thanks for your help officer theres got to be ten thousand dollars in that envelope maybe more i dont know the guy holds out the envelope and looks at me expecting me to take it i say something lame about how its dangerous to hide shit in a kids bed right away the guy picks up the brick puts it on the floor kicks it out of sight under the bed then he says you are right thank you officer i would hate something happens to my daughter and he holds out the envelope so everything is in turmoil the wife is outside screaming at my partner the kid is in here screaming at us the guy is holding the envelope he smiles and nods like go ahead and take it its yours and i think i dont know what i thought next thing i know im out in the living room and i say everything is fine with the kid and now the woman starts to scream in her drunken way that i abused her child now its me not the husband and that i am in a conspiracy with the husband that we are both child abusers my partner figures shes crazy drunk and we leave and thats it my partner says you were in that room a while and i say i had to check the kid and thats it except the next day she comes in and makes a formal complaint that i abused her child shes hung over and she has a record but even so its a serious charge and it goes through the system as far as the preliminary where it gets thrown out as entirely without merit thats it thats what happened thats the whole story and the money connor said i went to vegas for the weekend i won big i paid taxes on thirteen thousand in unearned income that year whose idea was that lauren she told me how to handle it so she knows what happened sure and the department investigation did the preliminary board issue a report i dont think it got that far they just heard it orally and dismissed it theres probably a notation in the file but not an actual report all right connor said now tell me the rest so i told him about ken shubik and the times and the weasel connor listened silently frowning as i talked he began to suck air through his teeth which was the japanese way of expressing disapproval kohai he said when i finished you are making my life extremely difficult and certainly you make me appear foolish when i should not why didnt you tell me this earlier because it has nothing to do with you kohai he was shaking his head kohai i was thinking about my daughter again about the possibility just the possibility that i would not be able to see her that i would not be able to look connor said i told you it could be unpleasant take my word for it it can get much more unpleasant than this this is only the beginning it can get nasty we must proceed quickly and try to wrap everything up i thought everything was wrapped up connor sighed and shook his head its not he said and now we must resolve everything before you meet your wife at four oclock so lets make sure we are done by then christ id say its pretty fucking wrapped up graham said he was walking around sakamuras house in the hollywood hills the last of the sid teams was packing up cases to leave i dont know why the chief has such a bug up his ass on this graham said the sid boys have been doing most of their work right here on the spot because hes in such a rush but thank god everything ties up perfect sakamura is our boy we combed his bed for pubic hair it matches the pubic hair found on the girl we got dried saliva off his toothbrush it matches blood type and genetic markers for the sperm inside the dead girl matchup is ninetyseven percent sure its his come inside her and his pubic hair on her body he fucked her and then he killed her and when we came to arrest him he panicked made a break for it and died as a result where is connor outside i said through the windows i could see connor standing down by the garage talking to policemen in a blackandwhite patrol car connor was pointing up and down the street they were answering questions whats he doing down there graham said i said i didnt know damn i dont understand him you can tell him the answer to his question is no what question he called me an hour ago graham said said he wanted to know how many pairs of reading glasses we found here we checked the answer is no reading glasses lots of sunglasses couple of pairs of womens sunglasses but thats it i dont know why he cared strange man isnt he what the hell is he doing now we watched as connor paced back and forth around the squad car then pointed up and down the road again one man was in the car talking on the radio do you understand him graham said no i dont hes probably trying to track down the girls graham said christ i wish we had gotten the id on that redhead especially now its turned out this way she must have fucked him too we could have gotten some sperm from her and made an exact match with all the factors and i look like a horses ass letting the girls get away but shit who knew it was going to go that way it was all so fast naked girls up here prancing around a guy gets a little confused its natural shit they were goodlooking werent they i said they were and theres nothing left of sakamura graham said i talked to the peo boys an hour ago theyre downtown cutting the corpse out of the car but i guess hes burned beyond identification the mes office is going to try but good luck he stared unhappily out the window you know what we did the best we could with this fucking case he said and i think we did pretty good we got the right guy we did it fast no fuss no muss but all i hear now is a lot of japanbashing fuck you cant win uhhuh i said and christthey have juice now graham said the heat on my ass is terrific i got the chief calling me wanting this thing wrapped up i got some reporter at the timesinvestigating me hauling out some old shit about a questionable use of force on a hispanic back in nothing to it but this reporter hes trying to show ive always been a racist and what is the background of his story that last night was a racist incident so i am now an example of racism rearing its ugly head again i tell you the japanese are masters of the smear job its fucking scary i know i said they getting to you too i nodded for what child abuse christ graham said and you got a daughter yes doesnt it piss you off innuendo and smear tactics peteysan nothing to do with reality but try and tell that to a reporter who is it i asked the reporter talking to you linda jensen i think she said i nodded linda jensen was the weasels protege somebody once said that linda didnt fuck her way to the top she fucked other peoples reputations to the top she had been a gossip columnist in washington before graduating to the big time in los angeles i dont know graham said shifting his bulk personally i think its not worth it theyre turning this country into another japan youve already got people afraid to speak afraid to say anything against them people just wont talk about whats happening it would help if the government passed a few laws graham laughed the government they ownthe government you know what they spend in washington every year four hundred million fucking dollars a year thats enough to pay the campaign costs of everybody in the united states senate andthe house of representatives that is a lot of fucking money now you tell me would they spend all that money year after year if it wasnt paying off for them of course they wouldnt shit the end of america buddy hey looks like your boss wants you i looked out the window connor was waving to me i said i better go good luck graham said listen i may take a couple of weeks off yeah when maybe later today graham said the chief mentioned it he said as long as the fucking timesis on my ass maybe i should im thinking of a week in phoenix i got family there anyway i wanted you to know i might be going okay sure i said connor was still waving to me he seemed impatient i hurried down to see him as i came down the steps i saw a black mercedes sedan pull up and a familiar figure emerge it was weasel wilhelm by the time i got down there the weasel had his notepad and tape recorder out a cigarette hung from the corner of his mouth lieutenant smith he said i wonder if i could talk to you im pretty busy i said come on connor called to me times awasting he was holding the door open for me i started toward connor the weasel fell in step with me he held a tiny black microphone toward my face im taping i hope you dont mind after the malcolm case we have to be extra careful i wonder if you would comment on racial slurs allegedly made by your associate detective graham during last nights nakamoto investigation no i said i kept walking weve been told he referred to them as fucking japs i have no comment i said he also called them little nips do you think that kind of talk is appropriate to an officer on duty sorry i dont have a comment willy he held the microphone up to my face as we walked it was annoying i wanted to slap it away but i didnt lieutenant smith were preparing a story on you and we have some questions about the martinez case do you remember that one it was a couple of years back i kept walking im pretty busy now willy i said the martinez case resulted in accusations of child abuse brought by sylvia morelia the mother of maria martinez there was an internal affairs investigation i wondered if you had any comment no comment ive already talked to your partner at that time ted anderson i wondered if you had any comment on that sorry i dont then you arent going to respond to these serious allegations against you the only one i know thats making allegations is you willy actually thats not entirely accurate he said smiling at me im told the das office has started an investigation i said nothing i wondered if it was true under the circumstances lieutenant do you think the court made a mistake in granting you custody of your young daughter all i said was sorry no comment willy i tried to sound confident i was starting to sweat connor said come on come on no time i got into the car connor said to wilhelm son im sorry but were busy got to go he slammed the car door i started the engine lets go connor said willy stuck his head in the window do you think that captain connors japanbashing represents another example of the departments lack of judgment in racially sensitive cases see you willy i rolled up the window and started driving down the hill a little faster wouldnt bother me connor said sure i said i stepped on the gas in the rearview mirror i saw the weasel running for his mercedes i took the turn faster tires squealing how did that lowlife know where to find us he monitoring the radio we havent been on the radio connor said you know im careful about the radio but maybe the patrol car phoned in something when we arrived maybe we have a bug in this car maybe he just figured wed turn up here hes a scumbag and hes connected to the japanese hes their plant at the times usually the japanese are a little more classy about who they associate with but i guess hell do everything they want done nice car huh i notice its not japanese cant be obvious connor said he following us no i think we lost him where are we going now usc sanders has had enough time screwing around by now we drove down the street down the hill toward the freeway by the way i said what was all that about the reading glasses just a small point to be verified no reading glasses were found right right just sunglasses thats what i thought connor said and graham says hes leaving town today hes going to phoenix uhhuh he looked at me you want to leave town too no i said okay connor said i got down the hill and onto the going south in the old days it would be ten minutes to usc now it was more like thirty minutes especially now right at midday but there werent any fast times anymore traffic was always bad the smog was always bad i drove through haze you think im being foolish i said you think i should pick up my kid and run too its one way to handle it he sighed the japanese are masters of indirect action its their instinctual way to proceed if someone in japan is unhappy with you they never tell you to your face they tell your friend your associate your boss in such a way that the word gets back the japanese have all these ways of indirect communication thats why they socialize so much play so much golf go drinking in karaokebars they need these extra channels of communication because they cant come out and say whats on their minds its tremendously inefficient when you think about it wasteful of time and energy and money but since they cannot confront because confrontation is almost like death it makes them sweat and panic they have no other choice japan is the land of the end run they never go up the middle yeah but so behavior that seems sneaky and cowardly to americans is just standard operating procedure to japanese it doesnt mean anything special theyre just letting you know that powerful people are displeased letting me know that i could end up in court over my daughter my relationship with my kid could be ruined my own reputation could be ruined well yes those are normal penalties the threat of social disgrace is the usual way youre expected to know of displeasure well i think i know it now i said i think i get the fucking picture its not personal connor said its just the way they proceed yeah right theyre spreading a lie in a sense no not in a sense its a fucking lie connor sighed it took me a long time to understand he said that japanese behavior is based on the values of a farm village you hear a lot about samurai and feudalism but deep down the japanese are farmers and if you lived in a farm village and you displeased the other villagers you were banished and that meant you died because no other village would take in a troublemaker so displease the group and you die thats the way they see it it means the japanese are exquisitely sensitive to the group more than anything they are attuned to getting along with the group it means not standing out not taking a chance not being too individualistic it also means not necessarily insisting on the truth the japanese have very little faith in truth it strikes them as cold and abstract its like a mother whose son is accused of a crime she doesnt care much about the truth she cares more about her son the same with the japanese to the japanese the important thing is relationships between people thats the real truth the factual truth is unimportant yeah fine i said but why are they pushing now whats the difference this murder is solved right no its not connor said its not no thats why we have all the pressure obviously somebody badly wantsit to be over they want us to give it up if they are squeezing me and squeezing graham how come theyre not squeezing you they are connor said how by making me responsible for what happens to you how are they making you responsible i dont see that i know you dont but they do believe me they do i looked at the line of cars creeping forward blending into the haze of downtown we passed electronic billboards for hitachi in computers in america for canon americas copy leader and honda number one rated car in america like most of the new japanese ads they were bright enough to run in the daytime the billboards cost thirty thousand dollars a day to rent most american companies couldnt afford them connor said the point is the japanese know they can make it very uncomfortable by raising the dust around you they are telling me handle it because they think i can get this thing done finish it off can you sure you want to finish it off now then we can go have a beer and enjoy some japanese truth or do you want to get to the bottom of why cheryl austin was killed i want to get to the bottom me too connor said so lets do it kohai i think sanderss lab will have interesting information for us the tapes are the key now phillip sanders was spinning like a top the lab is shut down he said he threw up his hands in frustration and theres nothing i can do about it nothing connor said when did it happen an hour ago buildings and grounds came by and told everybody in the lab to leave and they locked it up just like that theres a big padlock on the front door now i said and the reason was a report that structural weakness in the ceiling has made the basement unsafe and will invalidate the universitys insurance if the skating rink comes crashing down on us some talk about how student safety comes first anyway they closed the lab pending an investigation and report by a structural engineer and when will that happen he gestured to the phone im waiting to hear maybe some time next week maybe not until next month next month yeah exactly sanders ran his hand through his wild hair i went all the way to the dean on this one but the deans office doesnt know its coming from high up in the university up where the board of governors knows rich donors who make contributions in multimilliondollar chunks the order came from the highest levels sanders laughed these days it doesnt leave much mystery i said meaning what you realize japan is deeply into the structure of american universities particularly in technical departments its happened everywhere japanese companies now endow twentyfive professorships at mit far more than any other nation because they know after all the bullshit stops that they cant innovate as well as we can since they need innovation they do the obvious thing they buy it from american universities sure listen at the university of california at irvine theres two floors of a research building that you cant get into unless you have a japanese passport theyre doing research for hitachi there an american university closed to americans sanders swung around waving his arms and around here if something happens that they dont like its just a phone call from somebody to the president of the university and what can he do he cant afford to piss the japanese off so whatever they want they get and if they want the lab closed its closed i said what about the tapes everything is locked in there they made us leave everything really they were in a hell of a rush it was gestapo stuff pushing and prodding us to get out you cant imagine the panic at an american university if it thinks it may lose some funding he sighed i dont know maybe theresa managed to take some tapes with her you could ask her where is she i think she went ice skating i frowned ice skating thats what she said she was going to do so you could check over there and he looked right at connor in a particularly meaningful way theresa asakuma wasnt ice skating there were thirty little kids in the rink with a young teacher trying in vain to control them they looked like fourth graders their laughter and yells echoed in the high ceiling of the rink the building was almost deserted the bleachers empty a handful of fraternity boys sat up in one corner looking down and punching each other on the shoulder on our side up high near the ceiling a janitor mopped a couple of adults who looked like parents stood at the railing down near the ice opposite us a man was reading a newspaper i didnt see theresa asakuma anywhere connor sighed wearily he sat on the wooden bleachers and leaned back he crossed his legs taking his ease i stood there watching him what are you doing shes obviously not here have a seat but youre always in such a rush have a seat enjoy life i sat down next to him we watched the kids skating around the perimeter of the ice the teacher was shouting alexander alexander ive told you before no hitting dont you hit her i leaned back against the bleachers i tried to relax connor watched the kids and chuckled he appeared entirely at ease without a care in the world i said do you think sanders is right the japanese squeezed the university sure connor said and all that business about japan buying into american technology buying professorships at mit its not illegal theyre supporting scholarship a noble ideal i frowned so you think its okay no he said i dont think its okay at all if you give up control of your own institutions you give up everything and generally whoever pays for an institution controls it if the japanese are willing to put up the money and if the american government and american industry arent then the japanese will control american education you know they already own ten american colleges own them outright bought them for the training of their young people so that they can be assured of the ability to send young japanese to america but they already can do that lots of japanese go to american universities yes but as usual the japanese are planning ahead they know in the future it may get tougher they know that sooner or later there will be a backlash no matter how diplomatically they play it and they are in the acquisition phase now so theyre playing it very diplomatically because the fact is countries dont like to be dominated they dont like to be occupied economically or militarily and the japanese figure some day the americans will wake up i watched the kids skating in the rink i listened to their laughter i thought of my daughter i thought of the four oclock meeting i said why are we sitting here because he said so we sat there the teacher was rounding the kids up now leading them off the ice skates off here skates off here please that means you too alexander alexander you know connor said if you wanted to buy a japanese company you couldnt do it the people in the company would consider it shameful to be taken over by foreigners it would be a disgrace they would never allow it i thought you could i thought the japanese had liberalized their rules connor smiled technically yes technically you can buy a japanese company but as a practical matter you cant because if you want to take over a company you first have to approach its bank and get the agreement of the bank thats what is necessary in order to proceed and the bank doesnt agree i thought general motors owns isuzu gm owns a third of isuzu not a controlling interest and yes there are isolated instances but overall foreign investment in japan has declined by half in the last ten years one company after another finds the japanese market just too tough they get tired of the bullshit the hassles the collusion the rigged markets the dango the secret agreements to keep them out they get tired of the government regulations the run around and eventually they give up they just give up most other countries have given up germans italians french everybodys getting tired of trying to do business in japan because no matter what they tell you japan is closed a few years ago t boone pickens bought onefourth of the stock of a japanese company but he couldnt get on the board of directors japan is closed so what are we supposed to do the same thing the europeans are doing connor said reciprocity tit for tat one of yours for one of mine everybody in the world has the same problem with japan its just a question of what solution works best the european solution is pretty direct works well at least so far on the rink some teenage girls began to do warmups and a few tentative leaps now the schoolteacher was leading her charges along the corridor past us as she went by she said is one of you lieutenant smith yes maam i said one kid said do you have a gun the teacher said that woman asked me to tell you that what youre looking for is in the mens locker room it is i said the kid said can i see it the teacher said you know the oriental woman i think she was oriental yes connor said thank you i want to see the gun another kid said quiet stupid dont you know anything theyre undercover i want to see the gun connor and i started walking away the kids trailed after us still asking to see our guns across the rink the man with the newspaper looked up curiously he watched us leave nothing like an inconspicuous exit connor said the mens locker room was deserted i started going through the green metal lockers one after another looking for the tapes connor didnt bother i heard him call to me back here he was in the rear by the showers you found the tapes no he was holding open a door we went down a flight of concrete stairs to a landing there were two doors one opened onto a belowgrade truck entrance the other went into a dark hallway with wooden beams this way connor said we went down this hallway crouched over we were underneath the rink again we passed throbbing stainlesssteel machinery and then came to a series of doors do you know where were going i said one of the doors was ajar he pushed it open the room lights were out but i could see that we were in the lab off in a corner i saw a faint monitor glow we walked toward it theresa asakuma leaned back from the table pushed her glasses up on her forehead and rubbed her beautiful eyes its okay as long as we dont make much noise she said they had a guard outside the main door earlier i dont know if hes still there a guard yeah they were serious about shutting down the lab it was spectacular like a drug bust it really surprised the americans and you i dont have the same expectations about this country connor pointed to the monitor in front of her it showed a freezeframe image of the couple embracing as they moved toward the conference room the same image seen from other camera angles was reproduced on other monitors on the desk some of the monitors had superimposed red lines radiating out from the night lights what have you learned from the tapes theresa pointed to the main screen im not certain she said to be completely certain i would have to run d modeling sequences to match the dimensions of the room and keep track of all the light sources and the shadows cast by all the sources i havent done that and i probably cant with the equipment in this room it would probably require an overnight run on a mini maybe i could get time next week from the astrophysics department the way things are going maybe not but in the meantime i have a strong feeling which is the shadows dont match in the darkness connor nodded slowly as if that made sense to him i said which shadows dont match she pointed to the screen as these people move around the floor the shadows they cast dont line up exactly theyre in the wrong place or the wrong shape often its subtle but i think it is there and the fact that the shadows dont match means she shrugged id say the tapes have been altered lieutenant there was a silence altered how im not sure how much has been done but it seems clear that there was another person in that room at least part of the time another person you mean a third person yes someone watching and that third person has been systematically erased no shit i said it was making my head spin i looked at connor he was staring intently at the monitors he seemed completely unsurprised i said did you already know this i suspected something of the sort why well early in the investigation it seemed likely that the tapes were going to be altered why i said connor smiled details kohai those little things we forget he glanced at theresa as if he was reluctant to talk too much in front of her i said no i want to hear this when did you first know the tapes were altered in the nakamoto security room why because of the missing tape what missing tape i said he had mentioned it before think back connor said in the security room the guard told us that he changed the tapes when he came on duty around nine oclock yes and the tape recorders all had timers showing an elapsed time of about two hours each recorder started about ten or fifteen seconds later than the previous one because that was the time interval it took him to change each tape right i remembered all that and i pointed out to him one tape recorder that didnt fit the sequence its tape was only running for half an hour so i asked if it was broken and the guard seemed to think it was yes thats what he said i was letting him off the hook actually he knew perfectly well it was not broken it wasnt no it was one of the few mistakes that the japanese have made but they only made it because they were stuck they couldnt get around it they couldnt beat their own technology i leaned back against the wall i looked apologetically at theresa she looked beautiful in the semidarkness of the monitors im sorry im lost thats because you are rejecting the obvious explanation kohai think back if you saw a line of tape recorders each one running a few seconds later than the one before and you saw one recorder way out of sequence what would you think that someone had changed the tape in that one recorder at a later time yes and thats exactly what happened one tape was switched later yes i frowned but why all of the tapes were replaced at nine oclock so none of the replacements showed the murder anyway correct connor said then why switch one tape after that good question its puzzling i couldnt make sense of it for a long time but now i know connor said you have to remember the timing the tapes were all changed at nine then one tape was changed again at tenfifteen the obvious assumption was that something important happened between nine oclock and tenfifteen that it was recorded on the tape and the tape was therefore taken away for some reason i asked myself what could this important event be i thought back i frowned i couldnt think of anything theresa began to smile and nod as if something had just amused her i said you know i can guess she said smiling well i said im glad everyone seems to know the answer except me because i cant think of anything important being recorded on that tape by nine oclock the yellow barrier was up isolating the crime scene the girls body was on the other side of the room there were a lot of japanese standing by the elevators and graham was calling me on the phone for help but nobody actually began an investigation until i got there at about ten then we had a lot of back and forth with ishiguro i dont think anybody crossed the tape until almost tenthirty say tenfifteen at the earliest so if somebody looked at a recording all it would show is a deserted room and a girl lying on the table thats all connor said very good except you have forgotten something theresa said did anybody cross the room anybody at all no i said we had the yellow barrier up nobody was allowed on the other side of the tape in fact and then i remembered wait a minute there was somebody that little guy with the camera i said he was on the other side of the barrier taking pictures thats right connor said what little guy she said a japanese guy he was taking pictures we asked ishiguro about him he said his name was ah mr tanaka connor said thats right mr tanaka and you asked ishiguro for the film from his camera i frowned but we never got it no connor said and frankly i never thought we would theresa said this man was taking pictures i doubt that he was actually taking pictures connor said perhaps he was because he was using one of those little canons the ones that shoot video stills instead of film right would there be any use for those in retouching there might be she said the images might be used for texture mapping theyd go in fast because they were already digitized connor nodded then perhaps he was taking pictures after all but it was clear to me that his picturetaking was just an excuse to allow him to walk on the other side of the yellow line ah theresa said nodding i said how do you know that think back connor said i had been standing facing ishiguro when graham yelled aw christ what is this and i looked back over my shoulder and saw a short japanese man about ten meters beyond the yellow tape the mans back was turned to me he was taking pictures of the crime scene the camera was very small it fitted into the palm of his hand do you remember how he moved connor said he moved in a distinctive way i tried to recall it i couldnt graham had gone forward to the tape saying for christs sake you cant be in there this is a goddamned crime scene you cant take pictures and there was a general uproar graham was yelling at tanaka but he continued to be entirely focused on his work shooting the camera and backing toward us despite all the yelling tanaka didnt do what a normal person would do turn around and walk toward the tape instead he backed up to the yellow stripe and still turned away ducked his head and went under it i said he never turned around he backed up all the way correct that is the first mystery why would he back up now i think we know we do theresa said he was repeating the walk of the girl and the killer in reverse so it would be laid down on videotape and he would have a good record of where the shadows in the room were thats right connor said i remembered that when i protested ishiguro had said to me this is our employee he works for nakamoto security and i had said this is outrageous he cant take pictures and ishiguro had explained but this is for our corporate use and meanwhile the man had disappeared in the crowd slipping through the knot of men at the elevator but this is for our corporate use damn it i said so tanaka left us went downstairs and removed a single tape because that tape had a record of his own walk across the room and the shadows he cast correct and he needed that tape to make changes in the original tapes correct i was finally beginning to understand but now even if we can figure out how the tapes were altered they wont stand up in a court of law is that right thats right theresa said any good lawyer will make sure theyre inadmissible so the only way to go forward is to get a witness who can testify to what was done sakamura might know but hes dead so were stuck unless we can somehow get our hands on mr tanaka i think we better get him in custody right away i doubt that will ever happen connor said why not you think theyll keep him from us no i dont think they have to it is very likely that mr tanaka is already dead connor immediately turned to theresa are you good at your job yes she said very good i think so we have little time left work with peter see what you can extract from the tape gambatte try very hard trust me that your efforts will be rewarded in the meantime i have some calls to make i said youre leaving yes ill need the car i gave him the keys where are you going im not your wife im just asking i said dont worry about it i need to see some people he turned to go but why do you say tanaka is dead well perhaps hes not well discuss it when there is more time right now we have a lot to finish before four oclock that is our true deadline i think you have surprises in store for you kohai just call it my chokkan my intuition okay you have trouble or something unexpected call me on the car phone good luck now work with this lovely lady urayamashii ne and he left we heard the rear door close i said to theresa what did he say he said he envies you she smiled in the darkness lets begin she pressed buttons on the equipment in rapid succession the tape rolled back to the beginning of the sequence i said how are we going to do this there are three basic approaches to learn how video has been doctored the first is blur and color edges the second is shadow lines we can try to work with those elements but ive been doing that for the last two hours and i havent gotten very far and the third method reflected elements i havent looked at them yet i shook my head basically reflected elements res are portions of the scene that are reflected within the image itself like when sakamura walks out of the room and his face is reflected in the mirror there are almost certainly other reflections in that room a desk lamp may be chrome and it may show the people distorted as they pass the walls of the conference room are glass we may be able to pull a reflection off the glass a silver paperweight on a desk with a reflection in it a glass vase of flowers a plastic container anything shiny enough to make a reflection i watched her reset the tapes and prepare to run forward her one good hand moved quickly from one machine to the next as she talked it was odd to stand next to a woman so beautiful who was so unselfconscious of her beauty in most images there is something reflective theresa said outside there are car bumpers wet streets glass windowpanes and inside a room there are picture frames mirrors silver candlesticks chrome tablelegs theres always something but wont they fix the reflections too if they have time yes because now there are computer programs to map an image onto any shape you can map a picture onto a complicated twisted surface but it takes time so lets hope they had no time she started the tapes forward the first portion was dark as cheryl austin first appeared by the elevators i looked at theresa i said how do you feel about this what do you mean helping us the police you mean because i am japanese she glanced at me and smiled it was an odd crooked smile i have no illusions about japanese do you know where sako is no it is a city a town really in the north in hokkaido a provincial place there is an american airfield there i was born in sako my father was a kokujinmechanic you know that word kokujin niguro a black man my mother worked in a noodle shop where the air force personnel went they married but my father died in an accident when i was two years old there was a small pension for the widow so we had some money but my grandfather took most of it because he insisted he had been disgraced by my birth i was ainokoand niguro they are not nice words what he called me but my mother wanted to stay there to stay in japan so i grew up in sako in this place i heard the bitterness in her voice you know what the burakuminare she said no i am not surprised in japan the land where everyone is supposedly equal no one speaks of burakumin but before a marriage a young mans family will check the family history of the bride to be sure there are no burakuminin the past the brides family will do the same and if there is any doubt the marriage will not occur the burakuminare the untouchables of japan the outcasts the lowest of the low they are the descendants of tanners and leather workers which in buddhism is unclean i see and i was lower than burakumin because i was deformed to the japanese deformity is shameful not sad or a burden shameful it means you have done something wrong deformity shames you and your family and your community the people around you wish you were dead and if you are half black the ainokoof an american big nose she shook her head children are cruel and this was a provincial place a country town she watched the tape go forward so i am glad to be here you americans do not know in what grace your land exists what freedom you enjoy in your hearts you cannot imagine the harshness of life in japan if you are excluded from the group but i know it very well and i do not mind if the japanese suffer a little now from my efforts with my one good hand she glared at me the intensity turned her face to a mask does that answer your question lieutenant yes i said it does when i come to america i think the americans are very foolish about the japanese but never mind here is the sequence now you watch the top two monitors i will watch the bottom three look carefully for objects that reflect look closely here it comes i watched the monitors in the darkness theresa asakuma was feeling bitter about the japanese but so was i the incident with weasel wilhelm had made me angry angry the way somebody whos scared can be angry one sentence he had said kept coming back to my mind again and again under the circumstances dont you think the court made a mistake in granting you custody of your young daughter i never wanted custody in all the turmoil of the divorce of lauren moving out packing up this is yours this is mine in all that the last thing i wanted was custody of a sevenmonthold baby shelly was just starting to move around the living room holding onto the furniture she would say mama her first word but lauren didnt want the responsibility and kept saying i cant handle it peter i just cant handle it so i took custody what else could i do but now it was almost two years later i had changed my life i had changed my job my schedule she was mydaughter now and the thought of giving her up was like twisting a knife in my stomach under the circumstances lieutenant dont you think on the monitor i watched as cheryl austin waited in the darkness for the arrival of her lover i watched the way she looked around the room the court made a mistake no i thought the court didnt make a mistake lauren couldnt handle it and had never been able to handle it half the time she skipped on her weekends she was too busy to see her own daughter once after a weekend she returned michelle to me michelle was crying lauren said i just dont know what to do with her i checked her diapers were wet and she had a painful rash michelle always gets a rash when her diapers arent changed promptly lauren hadnt changed her diapers often enough during the weekend so i changed her and there were streaks of shit in michelles vagina she hadnt cleaned her own daughter properly dont you think the court made a mistake no i didnt under the circumstances dont you think fuck it i said theresa stabbed a button stopped the tapes the images froze on the monitors all around us what is it she said what did you see nothing she looked at me im sorry i was thinking of something else dont she started the tape again on multiple monitors the man embraced cheryl austin images from the different cameras were coordinated in an eerie way it was as if we could see all sides of the event front and back top and sides it was like a moving architectural blueprint and it felt creepy to watch my two monitors showed the view from the far end of the room and from high above looking straight down cheryl and her lover were small in one monitor and in the other one i saw only the tops of their heads but i watched standing alongside me theresa asakuma breathed slowly regularly in and out i glanced at her pay attention i looked back the lovers were in a passionate embrace the man pressed cheryl back against a desk in my top view i could see her face looking straight up as she lay back beside her a framed picture on the desk fell over there i said theresa stopped the tape what she said there i pointed to the framed picture it lay flat facing upward reflected in the glass we could see the outline of the mans head as he bent over cheryl it was very dark just a silhouette can you get an image from that i said i dont know lets try her hand moved swiftly across the controls touching them briefly the video image is digital she said its in the computer now well see what we can do with it the image began to jump growing larger in increments as she zoomed in on the picture frame the image moved past cheryls frozen grainy face her head thrown back in an instant of passion moved down from her shoulder toward the frame as the picture enlarged it became more grainy it began to decompose into a pattern of dots like a newspaper photo held too close to your face then the dots themselves enlarged formed edges turned into small blocks of gray pretty soon i couldnt tell what we were looking at is this going to work i doubt it but theres the edge of the frame and theres the face i was glad she could see it i couldnt lets sharpen she pressed buttons computer menus dropped down flashed back the image became crisper grittier but i could see the frame and the outline of the head sharpen again she did that all right now we can adjust our grayscale the face in the frame began to emerge from the gloom it was chilling enlarged so much the grain was severe each pupil of the eyes was a single black spot and we really couldnt see who it was the mans eyes were open and his mouth was twisted distorted in passion or arousal or hate but we couldnt really tell not really is that a japanese face she shook her head theres not enough detail in the original you cant bring it out ill work on it later but i think no it wont ever be there lets go on the images snapped back into full movement cheryl suddenly shoved the man away pushing his chest with the flat of her hand the face disappeared from the picture frame we were back to the original five views the couple broke and she complained pushing him repeatedly her face looked angry now that i had seen the mans face reflected in the frame i wondered if she had become frightened of what she saw but it was impossible to tell the lovers stood in the deserted room discussed where to go she was looking around he nodded his head she pointed toward the conference room he seemed to agree or accept they kissed clinched again there was a familiarity in the way they joined and parted joined again theresa saw it too she knows him yes id say still kissing the couple moved awkwardly toward the conference room at this point my monitors were no longer very useful the far camera showed the whole room and the couple moving laterally across it from right to left but the figures were tiny and difficult to see they were moving between the desks heading toward wait i said what was that she went back frame by frame there i said i pointed to the image see that whats that as the couple moved across the room the camera tracked past a large japanese calligraphy scroll hanging on the wall near the elevator the scroll was encased in glass for a brief moment there was a glint of light in the glass that was what had caught my eye a glint of light theresa frowned its not a reflection from the couple she said no lets look she began zooming again the image jumped toward the hanging scroll growing grittier with each step the glint enlarged broke in two fragments there was a fuzzy spot of light in one corner and a vertical slit of light running almost the length of the picture lets rock it she said she began to make the image go forward and back one frame at a time flipping from one to the other in one frame the vertical slit was missing in the next frame it was there the vertical bar lasted for the next ten frames then it was gone never to reappear but the fuzzy spot in the corner was always present hmmm she pushed in on the spot under everincreasing magnification it disintegrated until it looked like a cluster of stars from an astronomy picture but it seemed to have some kind of internal organization i could almost imagine an x shape to it i said so yes she said lets sharpen she did that the computers worked on the data the fuzzy cluster resolved itself now it looked like roman numerals i ix what the hell is that i said she kept working edge trace she said the outline of the roman numerals appeared more clearly theresa continued to try and resolve it as she worked in some ways the image seemed to get better and in some ways less clear but eventually we could recognize it tix its the reflection of an exit sign she said theres an exit at the far end of the room opposite the elevators is that right yes i said its being reflected in the glass of the scroll thats all it is she flipped to the next frame but this vertical bar of light thats interesting see it appears and is gone she ran it back and forth several times and then i figured it out theres a fire exit back there i said and a staircase going downstairs that must be the reflection of the light from the stairwell as someone opens the door and closes it again you mean someone came into the room she said from the back stairs yes interesting lets try and see who it is she ran the tapes forward at this high magnification the grainy image spattered and popped like fireworks on the screen it was as if the smallest components of the image had a life of their own their dance independent of the image they assembled to make but it was exhausting to watch i rubbed my eyes jesus okay there i looked up she had frozen the image i couldnt see anything but erratic blackandwhite dots there seemed to be a pattern but i couldnt tell what it was it reminded me of the sonograms when lauren was pregnant the doctor would say the head is here thats the babys stomach there but i couldnt see anything it was just abstract my daughter still in the womb the doctor had said see she wiggled her fingers see her heart is beating i had seen that i had seen the heart beating the little heart and the little ribs under the circumstances lieutenant dont you think see theresa said thats his shoulder thats the outline of the head now he is moving forward see him getting larger and now he is standing in that far passageway looking around the corner he is cautious you can see the profile of his nose for a moment as he turns to look see that i know its hard watch carefully now he is looking at them he is watching them and suddenly i could see it the spots seemed to fall into place i saw a silhouetted man standing in the hallway by the far exit he was watching across the room the lovers were wrapped up in their kiss they didnt notice the new arrival but someone was watching them it gave me a chill can you see who he is she shook her head impossible we are at the limits of everything i cannot even resolve eyes a mouth nothing then lets go on the tapes snapped back full speed i was jarred by the sudden return to normal size and normal movement i watched as the lovers kissing passionately continued to cross the room so now they are being watched theresa said interesting what kind of a girl is this i said i believe the term is torigaru onnai she said she is light in her bird toriwhat never mind i mean she is a loose woman theresa shook her head men always say things like that to me it looks like she loves him but she is troubled in her mind the lovers were approaching the conference room and cheryl suddenly twisted away attempting to break free from the man if she loves him shes got a strange way of showing it i said she senses something is wrong why i dont know perhaps she hears something the other man i dont know whatever the reason cheryl was struggling with the lover who now had both arms around her waist and was almost dragging her into the conference room cheryl twisted once more at the door as the man tried to pull her in a good chance here theresa said the tape froze again all the walls of the conference room were glass through the outer walls the lights of the city were visible but the inner walls facing the atrium were dark enough to act as a black mirror since cheryl and her lover were near the inner glass walls their images were rejected in the glass as they struggled theresa ran the tape forward frame by frame looking for an image that might hold up from time to time she zoomed in probed the pixels zoomed back out it was difficult the two people were moving quickly and they were often blurred and the lights from the skyscrapers outside sometimes obscured otherwise good images it was frustrating it was slow stop zoom in slide around in the image trying to locate a section that had enough detail give up go forward again stop again finally theresa sighed its not working that glass is murder then lets keep going i saw cheryl grab the door frame trying to keep from being pulled into the conference room the man finally pulled her free she slid backward with a look of terror on her face and then she swung her arms back to hit the man her purse went flying then they were both inside the room silhouettes moving quickly turning the man shoved her back against the table and cheryl appeared in the camera that aimed straight down on the conference room her short blond hair contrasted with the dark wood of the table her mood changed again she stopped struggling for a minute she had a look of expectation excitement she licked her lips her eyes followed the man as he leaned over her he slid her skirt up her hips she smiled pouted whispered in his ear he pulled her panties away a quick jerk she smiled at him it was a tense smile halfaroused halfpleading she was excited by her own fear his hands caressed her throat standing in the darkened laboratory with the hiss of skaters on the ice above we watched the final violent act again and again it played on five monitors different angles as her pale legs went up onto his shoulders and he crouched over her hands fumbling at his trousers with repetition i noticed small things not seen before the way she slid down the table to meet him wiggling her hips the way his back arched at the moment of penetration the change in her smile catlike knowing calculating how she urged him on saying something her hands around his back caressing the sudden change in mood the flash of anger in her eyes the abrupt slap the way she fought him first to arouse him and then later struggling in a different way because then something was wrong the way her eyes bulged and she had a look of real desperation her hands pushing his arms shoving his coat sleeves up revealing the tiny metallic sparkle of cuff links the glint of her watch her arm falling back palm open five fingers pale against the black of the table then a tremor the fingers twitching and stillness his slowness to understand something was wrong the way he went rigid for a moment then took her head in his hand moved it back and forth trying to arouse her before he finally pulled away even looking at his back you could almost feel his horror he remained slow as if in a trance pacing around the room in aimless half steps first this way then that trying to recover his wits to decide what to do each time i saw the sequence repeated i felt a different way the first few times there was a tension a voyeuristic sensation itself almost sexual and then later i felt progressively more detached more analytical as if i was drifting away moving back from the monitor and finally the entire sequence seemed to break down before my eyes the bodies losing their human identities altogether becoming abstractions elements of design shifting and moving in dark space theresa said this girl is sick it looks that way she is not a victim not this one maybe not we watched it again but i no longer knew why we were watching finally i said lets go forward theresa we had been running the sequence to a certain point on the tape counter and then going back to run again so we had seen a part of the tape again and again but we hadnt gone farther almost immediately as we went forward something remarkable happened the man stopped pacing and looked sharply off to one side as if he had seen something or heard something the other man i said perhaps she pointed to the monitors this is the area in the tapes where the shadows do not seem to match up now we know why something was erased she ran the tape backward on the side monitor view we could see the man look up in the direction of the exit he gave every appearance that he had seen someone but he did not appear frightened or guilty she zoomed in the man was just a silhouette you cant see anything can you profile what about it i am looking at the jaw line yes see the jaw is moving he is talking talking to the other man or to himself but he is certainly looking off and now see he has sudden new energy the man was moving around the conference room his behavior purposeful i remembered how confusing this part had been when i saw it the night before at the police station but with five cameras it was clear we could see exactly what he was doing he picked up the panties from the floor and then he bent over the dead girl and removed her watch no kidding i said he took her watch i could only think of one reason why the watch must have an inscription the man put the panties and the watch in his pocket and was turning to go when the image froze again theresa had stopped it what is it i said she pointed to one of the five monitors there she said she was looking at the side view from the overall camera it showed the conference room as seen from the atrium i saw the silhouette of the girl on the table and the man inside the conference room yeah so there she said pointing they forgot to erase that one in the corner of the screen i saw a ghostly form the angle and the lighting were just right to enable us to see him it was a man the third man he had come forward and now was standing in the middle of the atrium looking toward the killer inside the conference room the image of the third man was complete reflected in the glass but it was faint can you get that can you make it out i can try she said the zooms began she punched in saw the image decompose she sharpened it heightened contrast the image streaked and went dull flat she coaxed it back reconstituted it she moved closer enlarging it it was tantalizing we could almost make an identification almost but not quite frame advance she said now one by one the frames clicked ahead the image of the man was alternately sharper blurred sharp and then at last we saw the waiting man clearly no shit i said you know who he is yes i said its eddie sakamura after that we made swift progress we knew without a doubt that the tapes had been altered and the identity of the killer had been changed we watched as the killer came out of the room and moved toward the exit with a regretful look back at the dead girl i said how could they change the killers face in just a few hours they have very sophisticated mapping software she said its by far the most advanced in the world the japanese are becoming much better in software soon they will surpass the americans in that as they already have in computers so they did it with better software even with the best software it would be daring to try it and the japanese are not daring so i suspect this particular job was not so hard because the killer spends most of his time kissing the girl or in shadow so you cant see his face i am guessing they had the idea very late as an afterthought to make a change of identity because they saw that they only had to change this part coming up there where he passes the mirror in the mirror i saw the face of eddie sakamura clearly his hand brushing the wall showing the scar you see she said if they changed that the rest of the tape could pass in all the cameras it was a golden opportunity and they took it that is what i think on the monitors eddie sakamura went past the mirror into shadow she ran it back lets look she put up the reflection in the mirror and stepzoomed in to the face until it broke into blocks ah she said you see the pixels you see the regularity someone has done some retouching here here on the cheekbone where there is a shadow beneath his eye normally you get some irregularity at the edge between two gray scales here the line is cleaned up it has been repaired and let me see the image spun laterally yes here too more blocks i couldnt tell what she was looking at what is it his right hand where the scar is you see the scar has been added you can tell from the way the pixels configure i couldnt see it but i took her word for it then who was the actual killer she shook her head it will be difficult to determine we have searched the reflections and we have not found it there is a final procedure which i did not try because it is the easiest of all but it is also the easiest to change that is to search the shadow detail shadow detail yes we can try to do image intensification in the black areas of the picture in the shadows and the silhouettes there may be a place where there is enough ambient light to enable us to derive a recognizable face we can try she didnt sound enthusiastic about the prospects you dont think it will work she shrugged no but we might as well try it is all that is left okay i said lets do it she started to run the tape in reverse walking eddie sakamura backward from the mirror toward the conference room wait a minute i said what happens after the mirror we havent looked at that part i looked earlier he goes under an overhang and moves away toward the staircase lets see it anyway all right the tape ran forward quickly eddie sakamura went toward the exit his face flashed in the mirror as he went past it the more often i saw it the more fake that moment looked it even seemed as if a small delay a tiny pause had been added to his movement to help us make the identification now the killer walked on into a dark passage leading toward the staircase which was somewhere around the corner out of view the far wall was light so he was silhouetted but there was no detail visible in the silhouette he was entirely dark no she said i remember this part nothing here too dark kuronbo what they used to call me black person i thought you said you could do shadow detail i can but not here anyway i am sure this part has been retouched they know we will examine the section of tape on either side of the mirror they know we will go in with pixel microscopes and scan every frame so they will have fixed that area carefully and they will blacken the shadows on this person okay but even so hey she said suddenly what was that the image froze i saw the outline of the killer walking away toward the white wall in the background the exit sign above his head looks like a silhouette yes but something is wrong she ran the tape backward slowly as i watched i said machigai no umi oshete kudasaii it was a phrase i had learned from one of my early classes she smiled in the darkness i must help you with your japanese lieutenant are you asking me if there has been a mistake yes the word is umu not umi umiis ocean umumeans you are asking yes or no about something and yes i believe there may have been a mistake the tape continued backward the silhouette of the killer coming back toward us she sucked in her breath in surprise there isa mistake i cannot believe it do you see it now no i said she ran the tape forward for me i watched as the man walked away in silhouette there do you see it now no im sorry she was becoming irritable pay attention look at the shoulder watch the shoulder of the man see how it rises and falls with each step in a rhythmic way and then suddenly there you see it i did finally the outline seemed to jump to get bigger yes exactly to jump bigger she adjusted the controls quite a lot bigger lieutenant they tried to blend the jump into the upstep to make it less conspicuous but they did not try very hard it is clear anyway and what does that mean it means they are arrogant she said she sounded angry i couldnt tell why so i asked her yes now it pisses me off she said she was zooming in on the image her one hand moving quickly it is because they have made an obvious mistake they expect we will be sloppy we will not be thorough we will not be intelligent we will not be japanese but oh i hatethem the image moved shifted she was concentrating on the outline of the head now you know takeshita noboru i said is that a manufacturer no takeshita was prime minister a few years ago he made a joke about visiting american sailors on a navy ship he said america is now so poor the navy boys cannot afford to come ashore to enjoy japan everything is too expensive for them he said they could only remain on their ship and give each other aids big joke in japan he said that she nodded if i was american and someone said that to me i would take this ship away and tell japan to go fuck itself pay for its own defense you didnt know takeshita said this no american news she shook her head such nothing she was furious working quickly her fingers slipped on the controls the image jumped back lost definition shit fuck take it easy theresa fuck take it easy were going to score now she moved in on the silhouetted head isolating it then following it frame by frame i saw the image jump larger distinctly you see that is the join she said that is where the changed image goes back to the original here on its original material on the tape this is the original man walking away from us now the silhouette moved toward the far wall she proceeded frame by frame then the outline began to change shape ah okay good what i hoped for what is it he is taking a last look a look back at the room see the head is turning there is his nose and now the nose is gone again because he has turned completely now he is looking back at us the silhouette was dense black lot of good it does us watch more controls the detail is there she said it is like dark exposure on film the detail has been recorded but we cannot see it yet so now i have enhancement and now i will get the shadow detail now and in a sudden shocking moment the dark silhouette blossomed the wall behind flaring white making a kind of halo around the head the dark face became lighter and we could see the face for the first time distinctly and clearly huh white man she sounded disappointed my god i said you know who he is yes i said the features were twisted with tension the lip turned up in a kind of snarl but the identity was unmistakable i was looking at the face of senator john morton i sat back staring at the frozen image i heard the hum of the machinery i heard water dripping into buckets somewhere in the darkness of the laboratory i heard theresa breathing alongside me panting like a runner who has finished a race i sat there and just stared at the screen everything fell into place like a jigsaw puzzle that assembled itself before my eyes julia young she has a boyfriend who travels a lot shes always traveling new york washington seattle she meets him shes madly in love with him jenny in the tv studio morton has a young girlfriend thats driving him crazy makes him jealous some young girl eddie she likes to cause trouble this girl she likes to make turmoil jenny ive seen this girl hanging around at parties with some of the washington types for about six months now eddie she was a sick girl she liked pain jenny morton heads the senate finance committee the one thats been having hearings about this microcon sale cole the security guard in the bar they have the big guys in their pocket they own em we cant beat em now and connor somebody wants this investigation to be over they want us to give it up and morton so your investigation is formally concluded hell i said she said who is he hes a senator oh she looked at the screen and why do they care about him he has a powerful position in washington and i think he has something to do with the sale of a company maybe other reasons too she nodded i said can we print a picture of this no we dont have equipment for hard copies the lab cant afford it then what can we do i need something to take with me i can take a polaroid for you she said not great but okay for now she started poking around the lab stumbling in the dark finally she came back with a camera she moved close to the screen and shot several copies we waited for them to come out standing in the blue light from the monitors thanks i said for all your help you are welcome and im sorry why i know you expected it would be a japanese man i realized she was speaking for herself i didnt answer her the pictures darkened they were good quality the image clear as i slipped them in my pocket i felt something hard there i brought it out you have a japanese passport she said no its not mine its eddies i put it back in my pocket i have to go i said i have to find captain connor all right she turned back to the monitors what are you going to do i said i will stay and work more i left her went out the back door and made my way down the dark passageway to the outside blinking in the harsh daylight i went to a pay phone and called connor he was in the car where are you i said back at the hotel what hotel the four seasons connor said its senator mortons hotel what are you doing there i said do you know that kohai he said open line remember call yourself a taxi and meet me at westwood boulevard we will meet there in twenty minutes but how no more questions and he hung up i looked at the building at westwood boulevard it had a plain brown facade just a door with a painted number on one side was a french bookstore on the other side was a watch repair place i went up and knocked on the door i noticed a small sign in japanese characters beneath the numbers nothing happened so i opened the door i found myself in an elegant tiny sushi bar it had only four seats for customers connor was alone there sitting at the far end he waved to me say hello to imae the best sushi chef in los angeles imaesan sumisusan the chef nodded and smiled he put something on the shelf before my seat kore o dozo sumisusan i sat down domo imaesan hai i looked at the sushi it was some kind of pink fish eggs with a raw yellow egg yolk sitting on top i thought it looked revolting i turned to connor he said kore o tabetakoto arukai i shook my head sorry you lost me youll have to work on your japanese for your new girlfriend what new girlfriend connor said i thought you would thank me i gave you all that time with her you mean theresa he smiled you can do much worse kohai and i gather you have in the past anyway i asked you if you knew what that was he pointed to the sushi no i dont quail egg and salmon roe he said good protein energy you need it i said do i have to imae said make you strong for girlfriend and he laughed he said something quickly in japanese to connor connor replied and the two had a good laugh whats funny i said but i wanted to change the subject so i ate the first of the sushi if you got past the slimy texture it was actually very good imae said good very good i said i ate the second one and turned to connor you know what we found on those tapes its unbelievable connor held up his hand please you must learn the japanese way to have relaxation everything in its place oaiso onegai shimasu hai connorsan the sushi chef produced the bill and connor peeled off money he bowed and there was a rapid exchange in japanese were leaving now yes connor said ive already eaten and you my friend cant afford to be late for what for your exwife remember wed better go to your apartment now and meet her i was driving again connor was staring out the window how did you know it was morton i didnt connor said at least not until this morning but it was clear to me last night that the tape had been altered i thought of all the effort that theresa and i had gone to all the zooming and inspection and image manipulation youre telling me you just looked at the tape and you could tell yes how there was one glaring error remember when you met eddie at the party he had a scar on his hand yes it looked like an old burn scar which hand was it on which hand i frowned i thought back to the meeting eddie in the cactus garden at night smoking cigarettes flicking them away eddie turning moving nervously holding the cigarettes the scar had been on his left hand i said thats right connor said but the scar appears on the tape too i said you see it clearly when he walks past the mirror his hand touches the wall for a moment i stopped on the tape his righthand had touched the wall jesus i said yes connor said they made a mistake maybe they got confused about what was a reflection and what wasnt but i imagine they were working hastily and they couldnt remember which hand it was and they just added the scar anyway mistakes like that happen so last night you saw the scar on the wrong hand yes and i knew at once that the tape was changed connor said i had to prepare you to analyze the tape in the morning so i sent you to sid to get names of places that would work on the tape and then i went home to bed but you allowed us to arrest eddie why you must have known that eddie wasnt the killer sometimes you have to let things play out connor said it was clear we were meant to think that eddie killed the girl so play it out but an innocent man died i said i wouldnt call eddie innocent connor said eddie was in this up to his neck and senator morton how did you know it was morton i didnt until he called us in for that little meeting today then he gave himself away how he was smooth you have to think about what he actually said connor said wedged in between all the bullshit he asked us three times if our investigation was finished and he asked us if the murder had anything to do with microcon when you think about it thats a very peculiar question why he has contacts mr hanada other people he told us that no connor said shaking his head if you take away all the bullshit what senator morton told us was his train of thought is the investigation over and can you connect it to microcon because i am now going to change my position on the microcon sale okay but he never explained a crucial point why was he changing his position on the microcon sale he told us why i said he had no support nobody cares connor handed me a xerox i glanced at it it was a page from a newspaper i gave it back im driving tell me this is an interview senator morton gave in the washington post he repeats his stand on microcon its against the interest of national defense and american competitiveness to sell the company blah blah eroding our technology base and selling off our future to the japanese blah blah that was his position on thursday morning on thursday night he attends a party in california by friday morning he has a different view of microcon the sale is fine with him now you tell me why jesus i said what are we going to do because there is a thing about being a policeman most of the time you feel pretty good but at certain points it comes back to you that you are just a cop the truth is youre pretty far down the ladder and you are reluctant to take on certain kinds of people certain kinds of power it gets messy it gets out of control you can have your ass handed to you what do we do i said again one thing at a time connor said is this your apartment building up here the tv minivans were lined up along the street there were several sedans with press signs behind the windshield a knot of reporters stood outside the front door to my apartment and along the street among the reporters i saw weasel wilhelm leaning against his car i didnt see my exwife keep driving kohai connor said go to the end of the block and turn right why i took the liberty of calling the das office a while ago i arranged for you to meet your wife in the park down here you did i thought it would be better for everybody i drove around the corner hampton park was adjacent to the elementary school at this hour of the afternoon kids were outside playing baseball i drove slowly along the street looking for a parking place i passed a sedan with two people inside there was a man in the passenger seat smoking a cigarette there was a woman behind the wheel drumming her fingers on the dashboard it was lauren i parked the car ill wait here connor said good luck she always favored pale colors she was wearing a beige suit and a cream silk blouse her blond hair was pulled back no jewelry sexy and businesslike at the same time her particular talent we walked along the sidewalk on the edge of the park looking at the kids playing ball neither of us said anything the man who had come with her waited in the car a block away we could see the press clustered outside my apartment lauren looked at them and said jesus christ peter i cant believe you i really cant this is very badly handled this is very insensitive to my position i said who told them not me someone did someone told them you were coming at four oclock well it wasnt me you just happened to show up with full makeup on i was in court this morning okay fine fuck you peter i said fine such a fucking detective she turned and we walked back the way we had come moving away from the press she sighed look she said lets try and be civil about this okay i dont know how you managed to get yourself into this mess peter im sorry but youre going to have to give up custody i cant permit my daughter to be raised in a suspect environment i cant allow that i have my position to think of my reputation in the office lauren was always preoccupied with appearances why is the environment suspect why child abuse is an extremely serious allegation peter theres no child abuse the allegations from your past must be dealt with you know all about those allegations i said you were married to me you know everything about it she said stubbornly michelle has to be tested fine the exam will be negative at this point i dont really care what the exam shows its gone beyond that peter im going to have to get custody for my peace of mind oh for christs sake yes peter you dont know what its like to raise a child itll take too much time away from your career i have no choice peter you have left me no choice now she sounded long suffering martyrdom was always one of her strong suits i said lauren you know the past accusations are false youre just running with this thing because wilhelm called you he didnt call me he called the assistant da he called my boss lauren im sorry peter but you brought it on yourself lauren i mean it lauren this is very dangerous she laughed harshly tell me you think i dont know how dangerous this is peter this could be my ass what are you talking about what do you thinkim talking about you son of a bitch she said furiously im talking about las vegas i was silent i didnt follow her line of thought at all look she said how many times have you been to las vegas just once and the one time you went you won big lauren you know all about that yes i do clearly i do and what is the timing of your big winning trip to las vegas and the accusations against you of child abuse a week apart two weeks apart so that was it she was worried that somebody could put those two things together that it could be traced back somehow and that it would implicate her you should have made another trip last year i was busy if you remember peter i told you to go every year for the next couple of years establish a pattern i was busy i had a child to raise well she shook her head now were here i said whats the problem theyll never figure it out that was when she really exploded never figure it out theyve alreadyfigured it out they already know peter im sure theyve already talked to martinez or hernandez or whoever that couple is but they cant possibly for christs sake how do you think somebody gets a job as japanese liaison how did youget the job peter i frowned thinking back it was more than a year ago there was a posting of the job in the department a list of candidates applied for it yes and then what i hesitated the truth was i wasnt sure exactly what happened administratively i had just applied for the job and had forgotten all about it until it came through i had been busy in those days working in the press section was a hectic job ill tell you what happens lauren said the chief of special services for the department makes a final determination of appropriate candidates in consultation with members of the asian community well thats probably true but i dont see and do you know how long the members of the asian community take to review the list of candidates three months peter thats long enough to learn everything about the people on that list everything they know everything from the size of your shirt collar to your financial status and believe me they know about the allegations of child abuse and your trip to las vegas and they can put it together anybodycan put it together i was going to protest when i found myself remembering what ron said earlier in the day now they watch the backhaul she said youre going to stand there and tell me you dont know how all this works that you werent paying attention to the process christ peter come on you understood what was involved in that liaison job you wanted the money just like everybody else who has anything to do with the japanese you know how they make their deals theres something for everyone you get something the department gets something the chief gets something everybody gets taken care of and in return they get to pick exactly the kind of person they want as a liaison they know they have a handle on you going in and now they have a handle on me too all because you didnt take your goddamn trip to las vegas last year and establish a pattern the way i told you to so now you think you have to get custody of michelle she sighed at this point were just playing out our roles she glanced at her watch and looked toward the reporters i saw that she was impatient to get on with it to meet the press and make the speech she had already prepared for herself lauren had always had a strong sense of drama are you sure what your role is lauren because its going to get very messy around here in the next few hours you may not want to be involved i aminvolved no i took the polaroid out of my pocket and showed it to her whats this thats a video frame from the nakamoto security tapes taken last night at the time of the murder of cheryl austin she frowned at the picture youre kidding no youre going with this we have to youre going to arrest senator morton youre outof your fucking mind maybe youll never see daylight peter maybe theyll bury you so fast and so deep youll never know what hit you maybe you cant make this work you know you cant in the end its only going to harm michelle i didnt say anything to that i found i liked her less all the time we walked along her spike heels clicking on the sidewalk finally she said peter if you insist on following this reckless course of action theres nothing i can do as your friend i advise you not to but if you insist there is nothing i can do to help you i didnt answer i waited and watched her in the hard sunlight i saw she was starting to get wrinkles i saw the dark roots of her hair the fleck of lipstick on her tooth she took off her sunglasses and glanced at me her eyes worried then she turned away looking toward the press she tapped the sunglasses in the palm of her hand if this is really whats happening peter i think maybe i had better hold off a day and let events take their course all right you understand im not dropping my concerns peter i understand but i dont think the question of michelles custody should be mixed up in some other crazy controversy of course not she put her sunglasses back on i feel sorry for you peter i really do at one time you had a promising future in the department i know youve been mentioned for a position under the chief but nothing can save you if you do this i smiled well you have anything besides photographic evidence i dont know if i should give you too many details because if you only have photographic evidence you have no case peter the da wont touch it photographic evidence doesnt fly anymore its too easily doctored the courts know it if all you have is a picture of this guy doing the crime it wont wash well see peter she said you are going to lose everything your job your career your child everything wake up dont do it she started back toward her car i walked with her we didnt say anything i waited for her to ask how michelle was but she never did it wasnt surprising she had other things to think about finally we arrived at her car and she went around to the drivers side to get in lauren she looked at me over the top of the car lets keep it clean for the next twentyfour hours okay no wellplaced calls to anybody dont worry she said i never heard any of this frankly i wish i never heard of you and she got in the car and drove off as i watched her go i felt my shoulders drop and a tension leave me it was more than the fact that id done what i set out to do i had talked her out of it at least for a while it was more than that there was something else finally gone connor and i went up the rear stairs of my apartment building avoiding the press i told him what had happened he shrugged this was a surprise to you how the liaisons are chosen yeah i guess i never paid attention he nodded thats how it happens the japanese are very skilled at providing what they call incentives originally the department had qualms about letting outsiders say anything about which officers would be chosen but the japanese said they simply wanted to be consulted their recommendations wouldnt be binding and they pointed out that it made sense for them to have some input in the choice of liaisons uhhuh and just to show they were evenhanded they proposed a contribution to the officers relief fund to benefit the whole department how much was that i think half a million and the chief was asked to come to tokyo and consult on criminal recordkeeping systems threeweek trip oneweek stopover in hawaii all first class and lots of publicity which the chief loves we got to the secondfloor landing went up to the third so connor said by the time its all finished its rather difficult for the department to ignore the recommendations of the asian community too much is at stake i feel like quitting i said thats always an option he said anyway you got your wife to back off my exwife she got the point right away shes a finely tuned political animal lauren is but i had to tell her who the murderer was he shrugged theres not much she can do in the next couple of hours i said but what about these pictures she says they wont stand up in court and sanders said the same thing the day of photographic evidence is over do we have any other evidence ive been working on that connor said i think were all right how connor shrugged we came to the back entrance to my apartment i unlocked the door and we went into the kitchen it was empty i went down the corridor to the front hall my apartment was quiet the doors to the living room were closed but there was the distinct smell of cigarette smoke elaine my housekeeper was standing in the front hall looking out the window at the reporters on the street below she turned when she heard us she looked frightened i said is michelle all right yes where is she playing in the living room i want to see her elaine said lieutenant theres something i have to tell you first never mind connor said we already know he threw open the door to the living room and i had the biggest shock of my life john morton sat in the makeup chair at the television studio a kleenex tucked around his collar while the girl powdered his forehead standing at his side his aide woodson said this is how they recommend you handle it he handed a fax to morton the basic throughline woodson said is that foreign investment invigorates america america is made stronger by the influx of foreign money america has much to learn from japan and we arent learning it morton said gloomily well the argument can be made woodson said its a viable position and as you can see the way marjorie shaped it it doesnt read as a change of position so much as a refinement of your previous view you can skate on this one john i dont think it is going to be an issue is the question even going to come up i think so ive told the reporters you are prepared to discuss a modification of your position on microcon how you now favor the sale wholl ask it probably frank pierce of the times morton nodded hes okay yeah business orientation should be fine you can talk about free markets fair trade lack of national security issues on this sale all that the makeup girl finished and morton stood up from the chair senator im sorry to bother you but could i have your autograph sure he said its for my son sure he said woodson said john we have a rough assembly of the commercial if you want to see it its very rough but you might like to give comments ive set it up for you in the next room how much time have i got nine minutes to airtime fine he started out the door and saw us good evening gentlemen he said you need me for anything just a short conversation senator connor said ive got to look at a tape morton said then we can talk but ive only got a couple of minutes thats all right connor said we followed him into another room which overlooked the studio below down there on a beigecolored set that said newsmakers three reporters were shuffling through their notes and being fitted with microphones morton sat in front of a television set and woodson plugged in a cassette we saw the commercial that was shot earlier in the day it had a timecode running at the bottom of the frame and it opened with senator morton looking determined walking over the golf course the basic message was that america had lost its economic competitiveness and that we had to get it back its time for all of us to pull together morton said on the monitor everyone from our politicians in washington to our leaders of business and labor to our teachers and children to all of us in our homes we need to pay our bills as we go and cut the government deficit we need to increase savings to improve our roads and education we need a government policy of energy conservation for our environment for our childrens lungs and for our global competitiveness the camera moved close to the senators face for his closing remarks there are some who say that we are entering a new era of global business he said they say it no longer matters where companies are located or where things are made that ideas of national economies are oldfashioned and out of date to those people i say japan doesnt think so germany doesnt think so the most successful countries in the world today maintain strong national policies for energy conservation for the control of imports for promotion of exports they nourish their industries protecting them against unfair competition from abroad business and government work together to look after their own people and their jobs and those countries are doing better than america because those economic policies reflect the real world their policies work ours dont we do not live in an ideal world and until we do america had better face the truth we had better build our own brand of hardnosed economic nationalism we had better take care of americans because nobody else will i want to make it clear the industrial giants of japan and germany are not the cause of our problems those countries are challenging america with new realities and it is up to us to face those realities and meet their economic challenge head on if we do so our great country will enter an era of unparalleled prosperity but if we continue as we are mouthing the ancient platitudes of a free market economy disaster awaits us the choice is ours join me in choosing to meet the new realities and to make a better economic future for the american people the screen went blank morton sat back when does this run itll start in nine weeks test run in chicago and the twin cities associated focus groups any modifications then the national break in july long after microcon oh yes okay good go with it woodson took the tape and left the room morton turned to us well what can i do for you connor waited until the door had closed then he said senator you can tell us about cheryl austin there was a pause morton looked at each of us a blank expression came over his face cheryl austin yes senator im not sure that i know who yes senator connor said and he handed morton a watch it was a womans gold rolex where did you get this morton said his voice was low now icy a woman knocked on the door six minutes senator she closed the door where did you get this he repeated dont you know connor said you havent even looked at the back at the inscription where did yet get this senator wed like you to talk to us about her he took a glassine bag from his pocket and set it on the table next to morton it contained a pair of womens black panties i have nothing to say to you gentlemen morton said nothing at all connor took a videotape from his pocket and set it next to the senator this is a tape from one of five different cameras which recorded the incident on the fortysixth floor the tape has been altered but it was still possible to extract an image that shows who the person with cheryl austin was i have nothing to say morton said tapes can be edited and changed and then changed again it doesnt mean anything this is all lies and baseless allegation im sorry senator connor said morton stood up and began to pace i want to impress upon you gentlemen the severity of the charges that you are considering tapes can be altered these particular tapes have been in the custody of a japanese corporation which it could be argued has a wish to exert influence over me whatever they may or may not show i assure you they will not stand up to scrutiny the public will clearly see this as an attempt to blacken the name of one of the few americans willing to speak up against the japanese threat and as far as i am concerned you two are pawns in the hands of foreign powers you dont understand the consequences of your actions you are making damaging allegations without proof you have no witnesses to anything that may allegedly have happened in fact i would even say senator connors voice was soft but insistent before you go any farther and say anything you may regret would you look down at the studio theres somebody there you need to see what is the meaning of this just look senator if you would please snorting angrily morton strode to the window and looked down at the studio i looked too i saw the reporters swiveling in their chairs laughing and joking with each other as they waited to ask questions i saw the moderator adjusting his tie and clipping on his mike i saw a workman wiping the shiny sign that said newsmakers and in the corner standing right where we had told him to stand i saw a familiar figure with his hands in his pockets looking up at us eddie sakamura of course connor had put it all together when he opened the door to my living room and saw my daughter sitting on the floor playing with her tinkertoys with eddie sakamura he hadnt even blinked he just said hello eddie i was wondering how long itd take you to get here ive been here all day eddie said he sounded put out you guys never come here i wait and wait have a peanut butter jelly sandwich with shelly you have nice girl lieutenant cute girl eddie is funny my daughter said he smokes daddy i see that i said i felt slow and stupid i was still trying to understand my daughter came over and held her arms up pick me up daddy i picked her up very nice girl eddie said we made a windmill see he spun the spokes of the tinkertoy works i said i thought you were dead me he laughed no never dead tanaka dead mess hell out of my car too he shrugged i have bad luck with ferraris so does tanaka connor said i said tanaka michelle said daddy can i watch cinderella not right now i said why was tanaka in the car panicky guy eddie said very nervous guy maybe guilty too must have got scared i dont know for sure connor said you and tanaka took the tapes yes sure right after ishiguro says to tanaka get the tapes so tanaka gets them sure but i know tanaka so i go along tanaka takes them to some lab connor nodded and who went to the imperial arms i know ishiguro sends some men to clean up i dont know who and you went to the restaurant sure yes then i went to the party rods party no problem and what about the tapes eddie i told you tanaka takes them i dont know where hes gone he works for ishiguro for nakamoto i understand connor said but he didnt take all the tapes did he eddie gave a crooked grin hey you kept some no just one just a mistake you know in my pocket he smiled michelle said daddy can i watch disney channel sure i said i put her down elaine will help you my daughter went away connor kept talking to eddie slowly the sequence of events came out tanaka had gone off with the tapes and at some point in the evening apparently realized that one was missing he figured it out eddie said and he came back to eddies house to collect the missing tape he had interrupted eddie with the girls he had demanded the tape i dont know for sure but after i talk to you i figure they set me up we have a big argument and then the police came graham came eddie nodded slowly tanakasan shit a brick hey hes unhappy japanese man so you made him tell you everything oh yeah captain he tells me very fast and in return you told him where the missing tape was sure in my car i give him the keys so he can unlock it he has the keys tanaka had gone into the garage to get the tape the patrolmen downstairs ordered him to halt he started the car and drove off i watch him go john drives like shit so it had been tanaka who was driving the car when it hit the embankment it was tanaka who had burned to death eddie explained that he hid in the shrubbery behind the swimming pool and waited until everybody left cold as shit out there he said i said to connor you knew all this i suspected the reports of the crash said that the body was badly burned and that even the glasses had melted eddie said hey i dont wear glasses exactly connor said even so i asked graham to check the next day he never found any glasses in eddies house so it couldnt have been eddie in the car the next day when we went to eddies house i had the patrolmen check the license plates on all the cars parked on the street sure enough there was a yellow toyota sedan a short distance up the road registered to akira tanaka hey pretty good eddie said smart i said where were you all this time at jasmines house very nice house whos jasmine redhead number very nice woman got a jacuzzi too but why did you come here connor said to me he had to you have his passport right eddie said and me i have your business card you give me home address and phone i need my passport lieutenant i got to go now so i come here and wait and holy shit all the reporters cameras everything so i stay low play with shelly he lit a cigarette turned nervously so what do you say lieutenant how about you give me my passport netsutuku no harm done im dead anyway okay not just yet connor said come on john eddie you have to do a little job first hey what job i got to go captain just one job eddie morton took a deep breath and turned away from the studio window i had to admire his selfcontrol he seemed completely calm it appears he said that my options at this moment are somewhat reduced yes senator connor said he sighed you know it was an accident it really was connor nodded sympathetically i dont know what it was about her morton said she was beautiful of course but it wasnt it wasnt that i only met her a short time ago four five months ago i thought she was a nice girl texas girl sweet but it was one of those things it just happened she had this way of getting under your skin it was crazy unexpected i started to think about her all the time i couldnt she would call me when i was on a trip she would find out when i was on a trip somehow and pretty soon i couldnt tell her to stay away i couldnt she always seemed to have money always had a plane ticket she was crazy sometimes she would make me so mad it was like my i dont know demon everything changed when she was around crazy i had to stop seeing her and eventually i had the feeling she was paid for someone was paying her someone knew all about her and me so i had to stop it bob told me hell everybody in the office told me i couldnt finally i did it was over but when i came to that reception there she was shit he shook his head it just happened what a mess the girl stuck her head in the door two minutes senator theyre asking for you downstairs if youre ready morton said to us id like to do this first of course connor said his selfpossession was extraordinary senator morton conducted a televised interview with three reporters for half an hour without a trace of tension or discomfort he smiled cracked jokes bantered with the reporters it was as if he had no problems at all at one point he said yes its true that the british and the dutch both have larger investments in america than the japanese but we cant ignore the reality of targeted adversarial trade as practiced by japan where business and government make a planned attack on some segment of the american economy the british and dutch dont operate that way we havent lost basic industries to those countries but weve lost many to japan that is a real difference and thats the reason for concern he added and of course if we want to buy a dutch or english company we can but we cant buy a japanese company the interview continued but nobody asked him about microcon so he steered it in reply to a question he said americans should be able to criticize japan without being called racists or bashers every country has conflicts with other countries its inevitable our conflicts with japan should be freely discussed without these ugly epithets my opposition to the microcon sale has been termed racist but it is nothing of the sort finally one reporter asked him about the microcon sale morton hesitated then he leaned forward across the table as you know george i have opposed the microcon sale from the beginning i still oppose it it is time for americans to take steps to preserve the assets of this nation its real assets its financial assets and its intellectual assets the microcon sale is unwise my opposition continues therefore i am pleased to say that i have just learned akai ceramics has withdrawn its bid to purchase the microcon corporation i think this is the best solution all around i applaud akai for its sensitivity on this matter the sale will not go forward i am very pleased i said what the bid was withdrawn connor said i guess it is now morton was cheerful as the interview drew to a close since ive been characterized as so critical of japan perhaps youll let me express my admiration for a moment the japanese have a wonderful lighthearted side and it shows up in the most unlikely places you probably know that their zen monks are expected to write a poem close to the moment of death its a very traditional art form and the most famous poems are still quoted hundreds of years later so you can imagine theres a lot of pressure on a zen roshiwhen he knows hes nearing death and everyone expects him to come up with a great poem for months its all he can think about but my favorite poem was written by one particular monk who got tired of all the pressure it goes like this and then he quoted this poem birth is thus death is thus poem or no poem whats the fuss all the reporters started laughing so lets not take all this japan business too seriously morton said thats another thing we can learn from the japanese at the end of the interview morton shook hands with the three reporters and stepped away from the set i saw that ishiguro had arrived in the studio very redfaced he was sucking air through his teeth in the japanese manner morton said cheerfully ah ishigurosan i see you have heard the news and he slapped him on the back hard ishiguro glowered i am extremely disappointed senator it will not go well from this point he was clearly furious hey morton said you know what tough shit we had an arrangement ishiguro hissed yes we did morton said but you didnt keep your end of it did you the senator came over to us and said i suppose you want me to make a statement let me get this makeup off and we can go all right connor said morton walked away toward the makeup room ishiguro turned to connor and said totemo taihenna koto ni narimashita ne connor said i agree it is difficult ishiguro hissed through his teeth heads will roll yours first connor said so omowa nakai the senator was walking toward the stairway going up to the second floor woodson came over to him leaned close and whispered something the senator threw his arm around his shoulder they walked arm in arm a moment then the senator went upstairs ishiguro said bleakly konna hazuja nakatta no ni connor shrugged i am afraid i have little sympathy you attempted to break the laws of this country and now there is going to be big trouble eraikoto ni naruyo ishigurosan we will see captain ishiguro turned and gave eddie a frosty look eddie shrugged and said hey i got no problems know what i mean compadre you got all problems now and he laughed the floor manager a heavyset guy wearing a headset came over is one of you lieutenant smith i said i was a miss asakuma is calling you you can take it over there he pointed to a livingroom set couch and easy chairs against a morning city skyline i saw a blinking telephone by one chair i walked over and sat in the chair and picked up the phone lieutenant smith hi its theresa she said i liked the way she used her first name listen ive been looking at the last part of the tape the very end and i think there may be a problem oh what kind of a problem i didnt tell her morton had already confessed i looked across the stage the senator had already gone upstairs he was out of sight woodson his aide was pacing back and forth at the foot of the stairs a pale stricken look on his face nervously he fingered his belt feeling it through his suit coat then i heard connor say ah shit and he broke into a run sprinting across the studio toward the stairs i stood up surprised dropped the phone and followed him as connor passed woodson he said you son of a bitch and then he was taking the stairs two at a time racing upward i was right behind him i heard woodson say something like i hadto when we got to the second floor hallway connor shouted senator that was when we heard the single cracking report it wasnt loud it sounded like a chair falling over but i knew that it was a gunshot second night the sun was setting on the sekitei the shadows of the rocks rippled over the concentric circles of raked sand i sat and stared at the patterns connor was somewhere inside still watching television i could faintly hear the newscast of course a zen temple would have a television set on the premises i was starting to become accustomed to these contradictions but i didnt want to watch tv any more i had seen enough in the last hour to know how the media was going to play it senator morton had been under a great deal of stress lately his family life was troubled his teenage son had recently been arrested for drunk driving after an accident in which another teenager had been seriously injured the senators daughter was rumored to have had an abortion mrs morton was not available for comment although reporters were standing outside the family townhouse in arlington the senators staff all agreed that the senator had been under enormous pressure lately trying to balance family life and his own impending candidacy the senator had not been himself he had been moody and withdrawn and in the words of one staffer he seemed to have been troubled by something personal while no one questioned the senators judgment one colleague senator dowling said that morton had become a bit of a fanatic about japan lately perhaps an indication of the strain he was under john didnt seem to think accommodation with japan was possible anymore and of course we all know that we have to make an accommodation our two nations are now too closely bound together unfortunately none of us could have known the strain he was really under john morton was a private man i sat watching the rocks in the garden turn gold then red an american zen monk named bill harris came out and asked me if i wanted tea or perhaps a coke i said no he went away looking back inside i saw flickering blue light from the tube i couldnt see connor i looked back at the rocks in the garden the first gunshot had not killed senator morton when we kicked open the bathroom door he was bleeding from the neck staggering to his feet connor shouted dont just as morton put the gun in his mouth and fired again the second shot was fatal the gun kicked out of his hands and went spinning across the tile floor of the bathroom it came to rest near my shoes there was a lot of blood on the walls then people started screaming i had turned back and i saw the makeup girl in the doorway holding her hands to her face and screaming at the top of her lungs eventually when the paramedics came they sedated her connor and i had stayed until the division sent bob kaplan and tony marsh they were the detectives in charge and we were free to go i told bob wed give statements whenever he wanted them and we left i noticed that ishiguro had already gone so had eddie sakamura that had bothered connor that damn eddie he said where is he who cares i said theres a problem with eddie connor said what problem didnt you notice how he acted around ishiguro he was too confident connor said muchtoo confident he should have been frightened and he wasnt i shrugged you said it yourself eddies crazy who knows why he does what he does i was tired of the case and tired of connors endless japanese nuances i said i thought eddie had probably gone back to japan or to mexico where he had said earlier that he wanted to go i hope youre right connor said he led me toward the rear entrance to the station connor said he wanted to leave before the press arrived we got into our car and left he directed me to the zen center we had been there ever since i had called lauren but she was out of the office i called theresa at the lab but her line was busy i called home and elaine said that michelle was fine and the reporters had all gone she asked if i wanted her to stay and give michelle dinner i said yes that i might be home late and then for the next hour i watched television until i didnt want to watch any more it was almost dark the sand was purplegray my body was stiff from sitting and it was growing chilly my beeper went off i was getting a call from the division or perhaps it was theresa i got up and went inside on the television set senator stephen rowe was expressing sympathy for the bereaved family and talking about the fact that senator morton had been overstressed senator rowe pointed out that the akai offer had not been withdrawn the sale was so far as rowe knew still going through and there would not now be any serious opposition hmmm connor said the sale is back on i said it seems it was never off connor was obviously worried you dont approve of the sale im worried about eddie he was so cocky its a question of what ishiguro will do now who cares i was tired the girl was dead morton was dead and the sale was going forward connor shook his head remember the stakes he said the stakes are huge ishiguro isnt concerned about a sordid little murder or even the strategic purchase of some hightech company ishiguro is concerned about nakamotos reputation in america nakamoto has a large corporate presence in america and it wants it to be larger eddie can damage that reputation how he shook his head i dont know for sure my beeper went off again i called in it was frank ellis the watch officer at division headquarters for the evening hey pete he said we got a call for special services sergeant matlovsky down at vehicle impound hes asking for language assistance what is it i said he says hes got five japanese nationals down there demanding to inspect the wrecked vehicle i frowned what wrecked vehicle that ferrari the one in the highspeed pursuit apparently its pretty ragged the impact crushed it and there was a fire and the body was cut out with torches by the vhdv teams this morning but the japanese insist on inspecting the vehicle anyway matlovsky cant tell from the paperwork whether its okay to let somebody look at it or not you know whether its material to an ongoing investigation or not and he cant speak the language to understand the japanese one of the japanese claims to be related to the deceased so you want to go down there and handle it i sighed am i on tonight i was on last night well youre on the board you traded nights with allen looks like i dimly remembered i had traded nights with jim allen so he could take his kid to a kings hockey game i had agreed to it a week ago but it seemed like something from my distant past okay i said ill handle it i went back to tell connor i had to leave he listened to the story and suddenly jumped to his feet of course of coursewhat was i thinking of damn he pounded his hand in his fist lets go kohai were going to impound impound absolutely not then what are we doing oh damn it im a fool he said he was already heading for the car i hurried after him as i pulled up in front of eddie sakamuras house connor leapt from the car and raced up the steps i parked and ran after him the sky was deep blue it was almost night connor was taking the steps two at a time i blame myself he said i should have seen it earlier i should have understood what it meant what whatmeant i said i was panting a little at the top of the steps connor threw open the front door we went inside the living room was exactly as i had last seen it earlier in the day when i had stood there talking to graham connor went quickly from room to room in the bedroom a suitcase lay open armani and byblos jackets lay on the bed waiting to be packed the little idiot connor said he should never have come back here the pool lights were on outside they cast a green rippling pattern on the ceiling connor went outside the body lay face down in the water naked floating in the center of the pool a dark silhouette in the glowing green rectangle connor got a skimmer pole and pushed eddie toward the far edge we hauled him up onto the concrete lip the body was blue and cold beginning to stiffen he appeared unmarked they would be careful about that connor said about what about not letting anything show but im sure we can find the proofs he got out his penlight and peered inside eddies mouth he inspected the nipples and the genitals yes there see the rows of red dots on the scrotum and there on the side of the thigh alligator clips yes for the electric shock coil damn connor said why didnt he tell me all that time when we were driving from your apartment to the television station to see the senator he could have said something then he could have told me the truth about what connor didnt answer me he was lost in his own thoughts he sighed you know in the end we are just gaijin foreigners even in his desperation were excluded and anyway he probably wouldnt tell us because he fell silent he stared at the corpse finally he slid the body back into the water it floated out again let somebody else do the paperwork connor said standing up we dont need to be the ones who found the body it doesnt matter he watched eddie drift back to the center of the pool the head tilted down slightly the heels bobbed on the surface i liked him connor said he did favors for me i even met his family when i was in japan some of his family not the father he watched the body rotate slowly but eddie was okay and now i want to know i was lost i had no idea what he was talking about but i didnt think i should say anything connor looked angry come on he said finally we have to move fast theres only a couple of possibilities and once again we have fallen behind events but if its the last thing i do i want to get that son of a bitch what son of a bitch ishiguro we were driving back to my apartment you take the night off he said im going with you i said no ill do this alone kohai its better if you dont know know what i said we went on like this for a while he didnt want to tell me finally he said tanaka went to eddies house last night because eddie had the tape presumably the original right and tanaka wanted it back thats why they had an argument when you and graham came and all hell broke loose eddie told tanaka the tape was in the ferrari so tanaka went down there panicked when he saw the police and drove the car away right i always assumed the tape was destroyed in the crash and the fire yes but obviously it wasnt because eddie wouldnt dare be so cocky around ishiguro unless he still had a tape the tape would be his ace in the hole he knew it but he obviously didnt understand how ruthless ishiguro would be they tortured him for the tape yes but eddie must have surprised them he didnt tell them how do you know because connor said otherwise there wouldnt be five japanese nationals asking to inspect the wreck of a ferrari in the middle of the night so theyre still looking for the tape yes or evidence of the tape they may not even know how many are missing at this point i thought it over what are you going to do i said find the tape connor said because it matters people are dying for that tape if we can find the original he shook his head itll put ishiguro in deep shit which is just where he belongs i pulled up in front of my apartment building as elaine had said all the reporters were gone the street was quiet dark i still want to go with you i said again connor shook his head im on extended leave he said youre not youve got your pension to think of and you dont want to know exactly what i am going to do tonight i can guess i said youre going to retrace eddies steps from last night eddie left his house and went to stay with the redhead maybe he went somewhere else too look connor said lets not waste more time kohai i have some contacts and some people i can lean on leave it at that if you need me you can call me on the car phone but dont call unless you have to because ill be busy but come on kohai out of the car spend a nice night with your kid you did a good job but your job is finished now finally i got out of the car sayonara connor said with an ironic wave and he drove off daddy daddy she ran toward me arms outstretched pick me up daddy i picked her up hi shelly daddy can i watch sleeping beauty i dont know have you had dinner yet she ate two hot dogs and an ice cream cone elaine said she was washing dishes in the kitchen jeez i said i thought we were going to stop feeding her junk food well its all she would eat elaine said she was irritable it was the end of a long day with a twoyearold daddy can i watch sleeping beauty just a minute shelly im talking to elaine i tried that soup elaine said but she wouldnt touch it she wanted a hot dog daddy can i watch disney channel michelle i said elaine said so i thought it was better that she eat something i think she was thrown off you know the reporters and everything all the excitement daddy can i sleeping beauty she was squirming in my arms patting my face to get my attention okay shel now daddy okay i put her down she ran into the living room and turned on the tv pushing the remote without hesitation i think she watches too much television they all do elaine said shrugging daddy i went into the living room and plugged in the cassette i fastforwarded to the credits then let it run not this part she said impatiently so i fastforwarded to the beginning of the action pages turning in a book this part this part she said tugging at my hand i let the tape run at normal speed michelle sat in the chair and started sucking her thumb she pulled her thumb out of her mouth and patted the seat beside her here daddy she said she wanted me to sit with her i sighed i looked at the room it was a mess her crayons and coloring books were scattered over the floor and the large tinkertoy windmill let me clean up i said ill be right here with you she popped her thumb back in her mouth and turned to the screen her attention was total i cleaned up the crayons and put them back in the cardboard box i folded up her coloring books and set them on the shelf i was suddenly tired and sat down for a minute on the floor next to michelle on the screen three fairies red green and blue were flying into the throne room of the castle thats merryweather michelle said pointing shes the blue one from the kitchen elaine said can i fix you a sandwich lieutenant thatd be great i said i found i just wanted to sit there and be with my daughter i wanted to forget everything at least for a while i was grateful that connor had dropped me off i sat and watched the tv dumbly elaine brought in a salami sandwich with lettuce and mustard i was hungry elaine looked at the tv shook her head and went back into the kitchen i ate my sandwich and michelle insisted on a few bites she likes salami i worry about the additives in it but i guess its no worse than hot dogs after i had the sandwich i felt a little better i got up to finish cleaning up the room i picked up the tinkertoy windmill and started taking it apart putting the sticks back into the cardboard tube michelle said no this no this in a pained voice i thought she didnt want me to take apart the windmill but that wasnt it at all she was cupping her hands over her eyes she didnt like to see maleficent the bad witch i fastforwarded past the witch and she relaxed again i dismantled the tinkertoy windmill and put everything back into the tube container i put the metal cap on the tube and set it on the lowest shelf of the bookcase that was where it always went i like to keep the toys low so michelle can get to them herself the tube fell off the shelf onto the carpet i picked it up again there was something on the shelf a small gray rectangle i knew at once what it was it was an eightmillimeter video cassette with japanese writing on the label elaine said lieutenant do you need anything else she had her coat on she was ready to go hang on a minute i said i went to the phone and called the switchboard downtown i asked them to connect me to connor in my car i waited impatiently elaine looked at me just another minute elaine i said on the tv the prince was singing a duet with sleeping beauty while birds chirped michelle was sucking her thumb the operator said im sorry there is no answer from the car okay i said do you have a forwarding number for captain connor a pause hes not on our active roster i know that but did he leave a number i dont have anything lieutenant im trying to find him wait a minute she put me on hold i swore elaine stood in the front hallway she was waiting to go the operator came back on lieutenant captain ellis says that captain connor has gone gone he was here a while ago but hes gone now you mean he was downtown yes but hes gone now i dont have a number for him im sorry i hung up what the hell was connor doing downtown elaine was still standing in the front hallway lieutenant i said just a minute elaine lieutenant i have a i said just a minute i started pacing i didnt know what to do i was suddenly overwhelmed with fear they had killed eddie for the tape they wouldnt hesitate to kill anybody else i looked at my daughter watching television with her thumb in her mouth i said to elaine wheres your car in the garage okay look i want you to take michelle and i want you to go the phone rang i grabbed it hoping it was connor hello moshi moshi connorsan desu ka hes not here i said as soon as the words were out of my mouth i cursed myself but it was too late the damage was done very good lieutenant the voice said heavily accented you have what we want dont you i said i dont know what you are talking about i think you do lieutenant i could hear a faint hiss on the line the call was coming from a car phone they could be anywhere they could be right outside damn i said who is this but i heard only a dial tone elaine said what is it lieutenant i was running to the window i saw three cars doubleparked in the street below five men getting out of them dark silhouettes in the night i tried to stay calm elaine i said i want you to take michelle and both of you go into my bedroom get under the bed i want you to stay under there and be very quiet no matter what happens do you understand no daddy do it now elaine no daddy i want to watch sleeping beauty you can watch it later i had taken out my gun and was checking the clip elaines eyes were wide she took michelle come on honey michelle squirmed in her arms protesting no daddy michelle she went silent shocked at my tone elaine carried her into the bedroom i loaded another clip and put it in my jacket pocket i turned off the lights in the bedroom and in michelles room i looked at her crib and the covers with little elephants sewn into it i turned off the lights in the kitchen i went back into the living room the tv was still playing the wicked witch was instructing her raven to find sleeping beauty you are my last hope my pet do not fail me she said to the bird the bird flew away i stayed low i moved toward the door the phone rang again i crawled back to answer it hello kohai it was connors voice i heard the static hiss of the car phone i said where are you you have the tape yes i have the tape where are you at the airport well get here right away and call for backup jesus i heard a sound on the landing outside my door a soft sound like footsteps i hung up the phone i was sweating christ if connor was at the airport he was twenty minutes away from me maybe more maybe more i was going to have to handle this on my own i watched the door listening intently but i didnt hear anything else on the landing outside from the bedroom i heard my daughter say i want sleeping beauty i want daddy i heard elaine whispering to her michelle whimpered then it was quiet the phone rang again lieutenant the heavily accented voice said there is no need for backups christ they were listening to the car phone we want no harm lieutenant we want only one thing will you be so kind to bring the tape out to us i have the tape i said we know i said you can have it good it will be better i knew i was on my own i was thinking fast my sole idea was get them away from here get them away from my daughter but not here i said there was a knock at the front door quick insistent rapping damn i could feel events closing in around me things were happening too fast i was crouched down on the floor with the phone pulled down from the table above trying to stay below the windows the knock came again i said into the phone you can have the tape but first call off your boys say again please christ a fucking language problem call your men away get them out in the street i want to see lieutenant we must have tape i know that i said ill give it to you while i talked i kept my eyes on the door i saw the knob turning someone was trying to open the front door slowly quietly then the knob was released something white slid under the door a business card lieutenant please cooperate i crawled forward and picked up the card it said jonathan connor captain los angeles police department then i heard a whisper from the other side kohai i knew it was a trick connor said he was at the airport so it had to be a trick perhaps i can be of assistance kohai those were the words he had used before at the start of the case i was confused to hear them open the fucking door kohai it was connor i reached up and opened the door he slipped into the room bent over he was dragging something blue a kevlar vest i said i thought you were he shook his head and whispered knew they must be here had to be ive been waiting in the car in the alley behind the house how many are there in front i think five maybe more he nodded the accented voice on the phone said lieutenant you are there lieutenant i held the receiver away from my ear so connor could listen while i talked im here i said on the tv there was a loud witchs cackle lieutenant i hear something with you its just sleeping beauty i said what sreeping booty the voice said puzzled what is this television i said its the television now i heard whispers at the other end of the line the rush of a car going by on the street it reminded me that the men were in an exposed position outside standing there on a residential street lined with apartment buildings on both sides lots of windows people that might look out at any time or people walking by the men would have to move quickly perhaps they already were connor was tugging at my jacket signaling me to undress i slid out of my coat as i spoke into the phone all right i said what do you want me to do you bring tape to us i looked at connor he nodded yes all right i said but first get your people back i am sorry connor made a fist his face turned to a snarl he wanted me to be angry he covered the phone and whispered in my ear a japanese phrase pay attention i said yoku kike at the other end there was a grunt surprise wakatta the men come away and now you come lieutenant okay i said im coming i hung up the phone connor whispered thirty seconds and disappeared out the front door i was still buttoning up my shirt around the vest kevlar is bulky and hot immediately i started to sweat i waited thirty seconds staring at the face of my watch watching the hand go around and then i went outside someone had turned the lights out in the hallway i tripped over a body i got to my feet and looked at a slender asian face it was just a kid surprisingly young a teenager he was unconscious breathing shallowly i moved slowly down the stairs there wasnt anybody on the secondfloor landing i kept going down i heard canned laughter from a television behind one of the doors on the second floor a voice said so tell us where did you go on this first date i continued down to the ground floor the front door of the apartment building was glass i looked out and saw only parked cars and a hedge a short section of lawn in front of the building the men and the cars were somewhere off to the left i waited i took a breath my heart was pounding i didnt want to go out there but all i could think was to get them away from my daughter to move the action away from my i stepped out into the night the air was cold on my sweating face and neck i took two steps forward now i could see the men they stood about ten meters away beside their cars i counted four men one of them waved to me beckoning me over i hesitated where were the others i couldnt see anybody except the men by the cars they waved again beckoning me i started toward them when suddenly a heavy thumping blow from behind knocked me flat onto my face on the wet grass it was a moment before i realized what had happened i had been shot in the back and then the gunfire erupted all around me automatic weapons the street was lit up like lightning from the gunfire the sound echoed off the apartment buildings on both sides of the street glass was shattering i heard people shouting all around me more gunfire i heard the sound of ignitions cars roaring down the street past me almost immediately there was the sound of police sirens and tires squealing and the glare of searchlights i stayed where i was face down on the grass i felt like i was there for about an hour then i realized that the shouts now were all in english finally someone came and crouched over me and said dont move lieutenant let me look first i recognized connors voice his hand touched my back probing then he said can you turn over lieutenant i turned over standing in the harsh light of the searchlights connor looked down at me they didnt penetrate he said but youre going to have a hell of a sore back tomorrow he helped me to my feet i looked back to see the man who had shot me but there was nobody there just a few shell casings glinting dull yellow in the green grass by the front door third day the headline read vietnamese gang violence erupts on westside the story reported that peter smith an lapd special services officer was the target of a vicious grudge attack by an orange county gang known as the bitch killers lieutenant smith had been shot twice before backup police units arrived on the scene to disperse the attacking youths none of the suspects had been apprehended alive but two had been killed in the shooting i read the papers in the bathtub soaking my aching back i had two large ugly bruises on either side of my spine it hurt to breathe i had sent michelle to stay with my mother in san diego for the weekend until things were sorted out elaine had driven her down late last night i continued reading according to the story the bitch killers was thought to be the same gang that had walked up to a black twoyearold boy rodney howard and shot the child in the head while he was playing on his tricycle in the front yard of his inglewood home a week earlier that incident was rumored to be an initiation into the gang and the viciousness of it had touched off a furor about whether the lapd was able to handle gang violence in southern california there were a lot of reporters outside my door again but i wasnt talking to any of them the phone rang constantly but i let the answering machine take it i just sat in the tub and tried to decide what to do in the middle of the morning i called ken shubik at the times i wondered when youd check in he said you must be pleased about what about being alive ken said these kids are murder you mean the vietnamese kids last night i said they spoke japanese no yes ken we didnt get that story right not really that explains it he said explains what that was the weasels story and the weasel is in bad odor today theres even talk of firing him nobody can figure it out but somethings happening around here he said somebody high in editorial all of a sudden has a bug up his ass about japan anyway were starting a series investigating japanese corporations in america oh yeah of course youd never know it from todays paper you see the business section no why darleyhiggins announced the sale of microcon to akai its on page four of the business section twocentimeter story thats it not worth any more i guess just another american company sold to the japanese i checked since there have been a hundred and eighty american hightech and electronics companies bought by the japanese its not news any more but the paper is starting to investigate thats the word it wont be easy because all the emotional indicators are down the balance of payments with japan is dropping of course it only looks better because they dont export so many cars to us now they make them here and theyve farmed out production to the little dragons so the deficits appear in their columns not japans theyve stepped up purchases of oranges and timber to make things look better basically they treat us as an underdeveloped country they import our raw materials but they dont buy our finished goods they say we dont make anything they want maybe we dont ken tell it to the judge he sighed but i dont know if the public gives a damn thats the question even about the taxes i was feeling a little dull taxes were doing a big series on taxes the government is finally noticing that japanese corporations do a lot of business here but they dont pay much tax in america some of them pay none which is ridiculous they control their profits by overpricing the japanese subcomponents that their american assembly plants import its outrageous but of course the american government has never been too swift about penalizing japan before and the japanese spend half a billion a year in washington to keep everybody calmed down but youre going to do a tax story yeah and were looking at nakamoto my sources keep telling me nakamotos going to get hit with a pricefixing suit pricefixing is the name of the game for japanese companies i pulled a list of whos settled lawsuits nintendo in pricefixing games mitsubishi that year pricefixing tvs panasonic in minolta in and you know thats just the tip of the iceberg then its good youre doing the story i said he coughed you want to go on record about the vietnamese who speak japanese no i said were all in this together he said i dont think it would do any good i said i had lunch with connor at a sushi bar in culver city as we were pulling up someone was placing a closed sign in the window he saw connor and flipped it to say open they know me here connor said you mean they like you its hard to know about that they want your business no connor said probably hiroshi would prefer to close it wont be profitable for him to keep his people on just for two gaijincustomers but i come here often he is honoring the relationship it doesnt really have to do with business or liking we got out of the car americans dont understand he said because the japanese system is fundamentally different yeah well i think theyre starting to understand i said i told him ken shubiks story about pricefixing connor sighed its a cheap shot to say the japanese are dishonest theyre not but they play by different rules americans just dont get it thats fine i said but pricefixing is illegal in america he said yes but its normal procedure in japan remember kohai fundamentally different collusive agreements are the way things are done the nomura stock scandal showed that americans get moralistic about collusion instead of just seeing it as a different way of doing business which is all it is we went into the sushi bar there was a lot of bowing and greeting connor spoke japanese and we sat at the bar we didnt order i said arent we going to order no connor said it would be offensive hiroshi will decide for us what we would like so we sat at the bar and hiroshi brought us dishes i watched him cutting fish the phone rang from the far end of the sushi bar a man said connorsan onna no hito ga matteru to ittemashita yo domo connor said nodding he turned to me and pushed back from the bar guess we wont eat after all time for us to go to our next appointment you brought the tape with you yes good where are we going to see your friend he said miss asakuma we were bouncing along the potholes of the santa monica freeway heading downtown the afternoon sky was gray it looked like rain my back hurt connor was looking out the window humming to himself in all the excitement i had forgotten about theresas call the night before she had said she was looking at the last part of the tape and she thought there was a problem have you talked to her theresa briefly i gave her some advice last night she said there was a problem with the tape oh she didnt mention that to me i had the feeling he wasnt telling me the truth but my back was throbbing and i wasnt in the mood to press him there were times when i thought connor had become japanese himself he had that reserve that secretive manner i said you never told me why you left japan oh that he sighed i had a job working for a corporation advising on security but it didnt work out why not well the job was all right it was fine then what was it he shook his head most people whove lived in japan come away with mixed feelings in many ways the japanese are wonderful people theyre hardworking intelligent and humorous they have real integrity they are also the most racist people on the planet thats why theyre always accusing everybody else of racism theyre so prejudiced they assume everybody else must be too and living in japan i just got tired after a while of the way things worked i got tired of seeing women move to the other side of the street when they saw me walking toward them at night i got tired of noticing that the last two seats to be occupied on the subway were the ones on either side of me i got tired of the airline stewardesses asking japanese passengers if they minded sitting next to a gaijin assuming that i couldnt understand what they were saying because they were speaking japanese i got tired of the exclusion the subtle patronizing the jokes behind my back i got tired of being a nigger i just got tired i gave up sounds to me like you dont really like them no connor said i do i like them very much but im not japanese and they never let me forget it he sighed again i have many japanese friends who work in america and its hard for them too the differences cut both ways they feel excluded people dont sit next to them either but my friends always ask me to remember that they are human beings first and japanese second unfortunately in my experience that is not always true you mean theyre japanese first he shrugged family is family we drove the rest of the way in silence we were in a small room on the third floor of a boardinghouse for foreign students theresa asakuma explained it was not her room it belonged to a friend who was studying in italy for a term she had set up the small vcr and a small monitor on a table i thought i should get out of the lab she said running the machine fast forward but i wanted you to see this this is the end of one of the tapes you brought me it begins right after the senator has left the room she slowed the tape and i saw the wide view of the fortysixth floor of the nakamoto building the floor was deserted the pale body of cheryl austin lay on the dark conference table the tape continued to roll nothing happened it was a static scene i said what are we looking at just wait the tape continued still nothing happened and then i saw clearly the girls leg twitch what was that a spasm im not sure now the girls arm outlined against the dark wood moved there was no question about it the fingers closed and opened shes still alive theresa nodded thats the way it looks now watch the clock the clock on the wall said i watched it nothing happened the tape ran for two more minutes connor sighed the clock isnt moving no she said i first noticed the grain pattern on a close scan the pixels were jumping back and forth meaning what we call it rock and roll its the usual way to disguise a freezeframe a normal freeze is visible to the eye because the smallest units of the image are suddenly static whereas in a regular picture theres always some small movement even if its just random so what you do is you rock and roll cycling three seconds of image over and over it gives a little movement makes the freeze less obvious youre saying the tape was frozen at eight thirtysix yes and the girl was apparently still alive at that time i dont know for sure but maybe connor nodded so thats why the original tape is so important what original tape she said i produced the tape i had found in my apartment the night before run it connor said in crisp color we saw the fortysixth floor it was from the side camera with a good view of the conference room and it was one of the original tapes we saw the murder and we saw morton leave the girl behind on the table the tape ran on we watched the girl can you see the wall clock not in this angle how much time do you think has gone by theresa shook her head its time lapse i cant say a few minutes then the girl moved on the table her hand twitched and then her head moved she was alive there was no question about it and in the glass of the conference room we saw the shape of a man he walked forward appearing from the right he entered the room looking back once to make sure he was alone it was ishiguro very deliberately he walked to the edge of the table placed his hands on the girls neck and strangled her jesus it seemed to take a long time the girl struggled toward the end ishiguro held her down long after she had stopped moving hes not taking any chances no connor said hes not finally ishiguro stepped back from the body shot his cuffs straightened his suit jacket all right connor said you can stop the tape now ive seen enough we were back outside weak sunlight filtered through the smoggy haze cars roared by bouncing in the potholes the houses along the street looked cheap to me in disrepair we got in our car what now i said he handed me the car phone call downtown he said and tell them we have a tape that shows ishiguro did the murder tell them were going to nakamoto now to arrest ishiguro i thought you didnt like car phones just do it connor said were about finished anyway so i did it i told the dispatcher what our plan was where we were going they asked if we wanted backup connor shook his head so i said we didnt need backup i hung up the phone now what lets go to nakamoto after seeing the fortysixth floor so many times on videotape it was strange to find myself there again although it was saturday the office was busy and active secretaries and executives were hurrying about and the office looked different during the day sunlight poured in through the large windows on all sides and the surrounding skyscrapers looked close even in the la haze looking up i saw that the surveillance cameras had been removed from the walls to the right the conference room where cheryl austin had died was being remodeled the black furniture was gone workmen were installing a blond wood table and new beige chairs the room looked completely different on the other side of the atrium a meeting was being held in the large conference room sunlight streamed in through the glass walls on forty people sitting on both sides of a long table covered in green felt japanese on one side americans on the other everyone had a neat stack of documents in front of them prominent among the americans i noticed the lawyer bob richmond standing beside me connor sighed what is it the saturday meeting kohai you mean thats the saturday meeting eddie was talking about connor nodded the meeting to conclude the microcon sale there was a receptionist seated near the elevators she watched us staring for a moment then said politely can i help you gentlemen thank you connor said but were waiting for someone i frowned from where we were standing i could clearly see ishiguro inside the conference room seated near the center of the table on the japanese side smoking a cigarette the man to his right leaned over to whisper something to him ishiguro nodded and smiled i glanced over at connor just wait connor said several minutes passed and then a young japanese aide hurried across the atrium and entered the conference room once inside he moved more slowly circling the table unobtrusively until he was standing behind the chair of a distinguished grayhaired man seated toward the far end of the table the aide bent and whispered something to the older man iwabuchi connor said who is he head of nakamoto america based in new york iwabuchi nodded to the young aide and got up from the table the aide pulled his chair out for him iwabuchi moved down the line of japanese negotiators as he passed one man he brushed him lightly on the shoulder iwabuchi continued to the end of the table then opened the glass doors and walked outside onto a terrace beyond the conference room a moment later the second man stood to leave moriyama connor said head of the los angeles office moriyama also went outside onto the terrace the two men stood in the sun and smoked cigarettes the aide joined them speaking quickly his head bobbing the senior men listened intently then turned away the aide remained standing there after a moment moriyama turned back to the aide and said something the aide bowed quickly and returned to the conference room he moved to the seat of another man darkhaired with a mustache and whispered in his ear shirai connor said head of finance shirai stood up but did not go onto the terrace instead he opened the inner door crossed the atrium and disappeared into an office on the far side of the floor in the conference room the aide went to still a fourth man whom i recognized as yoshida the head of akai ceramics yoshida also slipped out of the room going into the atrium whats going on i said theyre distancing themselves connor said they dont want to be there when it happens i looked back at the terrace and saw the two japanese men outside moving casually along the length of the terrace toward a door at the far end i said what are we waiting for patience kohai the young aide departed the meeting in the conference room proceeded but in the atrium yoshida pulled the young aide over and whispered something the aide returned to the conference room hmmm connor said this time the aide went to the american side of the table and whispered something to richmond i couldnt see richmonds face because his back was to us but his body jerked he twisted and leaned back to whisper something to the aide the aide nodded and left richmond remained seated at the table shaking his head slowly he bent over his notes and then he passed a slip of paper across the table to ishiguro thats our cue connor said he turned to the receptionist showed her his badge and we walked quickly across the atrium toward the conference room a young american in a pinstripe suit was standing in front of the table and saying now if you will direct your attention to rider c the summary statement of assets and connor came into the room first i was right after him ishiguro looked up showing no surprise good afternoon gentlemen his face was a mask richmond said smoothly gentlemen if this can wait were in the middle of something rather complicated here connor interrupted him mr ishiguro you are under arrest for the murder of cheryl lynn austin and then he read him his miranda rights while ishiguro stared fixedly at him the others in the room were entirely silent nobody moved at the long table it was like a still life ishiguro remained seated this is an absurdity mr ishiguro connor said would you please stand richmond said softly i hope you guys know what you are doing ishiguro said i know my rights gentlemen connor said mr ishiguro would you please stand ishiguro did not move the smoke from his cigarette curled up in front of him there was a long silence then connor said to me show them the tape one wall of the conference room consisted of video equipment i found a playback machine like the one i had used and plugged the tape in but no image came up on the big central monitor i tried pushing various buttons but couldnt get a picture from a rear corner a japanese secretary who had been taking notes hurried up to help me bowing apologetically she pushed the proper buttons bowed again and returned to her place thank you i said on the screen the image came up even in the bright sunlight it was clear it was right at the moment we had seen in theresas room the moment where ishiguro approaches the girl and holds the struggling body down richmond said what is this its a fake ishiguro said its a fraud connor said this is a tape taken by nakamoto security cameras on the fortysixth floor thursday night ishiguro said its not legal its a fraud but nobody was listening everybody was looking at the monitor richmonds mouth was open jesus he said on the tape it seemed to take a long time for the girl to die ishiguro was glaring at connor this is nothing but a sensational publicity stunt he said it is a fabrication it means nothing jesus christ richmond said staring at the screen ishiguro said it has no legal basis it is not admissible it will never stand up this is just a disruption he broke off for the first time he had looked down to the other end of the table and he saw that iwabuchis chair was empty he looked the other way his eyes darted around the room moriyamas chair was empty shirais chair yoshidas chair ishiguros eyes twitched he looked at connor in astonishment then he nodded gave a guttural grunt and stood everyone else was staring at the screen he walked up to connor im not going to watch this captain when you are through with your charade you will find me outside he lit a cigarette squinting at connor then we will talk kicchiirito na he opened the door and walked onto the terrace he left the door open behind him i started to follow him out but connor caught my eye he shook his head fractionally i remained where i was i could see ishiguro outside standing at the railing he smoked his cigarette and turned his face to the sun then he glanced back at us and shook his head pityingly he leaned against the railing and put his foot on it in the conference room the tape continued one of the american lawyers a woman stood up snapped her briefcase shut and walked out of the room nobody else moved and finally the tape ended i popped it out of the machine there was silence in the room a slight wind ruffled the papers of the people at the long table i looked out at the terrace it was empty by the time we got out to the railing we could hear the sirens faintly on the street below down on ground level the air was dusty and we heard the deafening sound of jackhammers nakamoto was building an annex next door and construction was in full swing a line of big cement trucks was pulled up along the curb i pushed my way through the cluster of japanese men in blue suits and broke through to look down into the pit ishiguro had landed in a wet concrete pouring his body lay sideways just the head and one arm sticking above the soft concrete surface blood ran in spreading fingers across the gray surface workmen in blue hardhats were trying to fish him out using bamboo poles and ropes they werent having much success finally a workman in thighhigh rubber boots waded in to pull the body out but it proved more difficult than he expected he had to call for help our people were already there fred perry and bob wolfe wolfe saw me and walked up the hill he had his notebook out he shouted over the din of the jackhammers you know anything about this pete yeah i said got a name masao ishiguro wolfe squinted spell that i started to try to spell it talking over the sound of the construction finally i just reached in my pocket and fished out his card i gave it to wolfe this is him yeah whered you get it long story i said but hes wanted for murder wolfe nodded let me get the body out and well talk fine eventually they used the construction crane to pull him out ishiguros body sagging and heavy with concrete was lifted into the air and swung past me over my head bits of cement dripped down on me and spattered on the sign at my feet the sign was for the nakamoto construction company and it said in bold letters building for a new tomorrow and underneath please excuse the inconvenience it took another hour to get everything settled at the site and the chief wanted our reports by the end of the day so afterward we had to go down to parker to do the paperwork it was four oclock before we went across the street to the coffee shop next to antonios bail bond shop just to get away from the office i said why did ishiguro kill the girl in the first place connor sighed its not clear the best i can understand it is this eddie was working for his fathers kaishaall along one of the things he did was supply girls for visiting dignitaries hed been doing that for years it was easy he was a party guy he knew the girls the congressmen wanted to meet the girls and he got a chance to make friends with the congressmen but in cheryl he had a special opportunity because senator morton head of the finance committee was attracted to her morton was smart enough to break off the affair but eddie kept sending her in private jets to meet him unexpectedly keeping the thing alive eddie liked her too he had sex with her that afternoon and it was eddie who arranged for her to come to the party at nakamoto knowing that morton would be there eddie was pushing morton to block the sale so eddie was preoccupied with the saturday meeting by the way on the newsstation tape you thought he said no cheapie to cheryl he was saying nichibei the japaneseamerican relationship but i think eddie just intended for cheryl to meet morton i doubt he had any idea about the fortysixth floor he certainly didnt expect her to go up there with morton the idea of going there must have been suggested during the party by someone from nakamoto the company left the floor accessible for a very simple reason theres a bedroom suite up there that executives sometimes use somewhere in the back i said how did you know that connor smiled hanadasan mentioned he had once used it apparently its quite luxurious so you dohave contacts i have a few i imagine nakamoto was probably just being accommodating too they may have installed cameras up there with the idea of blackmail but im told there were no cameras in the bedroom suite and the fact that they had a camera right in the conference room suggests to me that phillips was right the cameras were placed to kaizenthe office workers certainly they couldnt have expected the sexual encounter to occur where it did anyway when eddie saw cheryl going off with morton to another part of the nakamoto building it must have alarmed the hell out of him so he followed them he witnessed the murder which i believe was probably accidental and eddie then helped out his friend morton calling him over getting him out of there eddie went back to the party with morton what about the tapes ah you remember we talked about bribery one of eddies bribes was to a lowlevel security officer named tanaka i believe eddie supplied him with drugs anyway eddie had known him for a couple of years and when ishiguro ordered tanaka to pull the tapes tanaka told eddie and eddie went down and got the tapes himself yes together with tanaka but phillips said eddie was alone phillips lied because he knew tanaka thats also why he didnt make more of a fuss tanaka said it was all right but when phillips told us the story he left tanaka out and then ishiguro sent a couple of guys to clean out cheryls apartment tanaka took the tapes someplace to get them copied eddie went to the party in the hills but eddie kept one yes i thought it over but when we talked to eddie at the party he told a completely different story connor nodded he lied even to you his friend connor shrugged he thought he could get away with it what about ishiguro why did he kill the girl to get morton in his pocket and it worked they got morton to change his position on microcon for a while there morton was going to allow the sale to go forward ishiguro would kill her for that for some corporate sale no i dont think it was calculated at all ishiguro was highstrung under great pressure he felt he had to prove himself to his superiors he had much at stake so much that he behaved differently from an ordinary japanese under these circumstances and in a moment of extreme pressure he killed the girl yes as he said she was a woman of no importance jesus but i think theres more to it than that morton was very ambivalent about the japanese i had the sense there was a lot of resentment those jokes about dropping the bomb all that and having sex on the boardroom table its disrespectful wouldnt you say it must have infuriated ishiguro and who called in the murder eddie why to embarrass nakamoto eddie got morton safely back to the party and then called in probably from a phone somewhere at the party when he called he didnt know about the security cameras yet then tanaka told him about them and eddie started to worry that ishiguro might set him up so he called back and he asked for his friend john connor yes i said so eddie was koichi nishi connor nodded his little joke koichi nishi is the name of a character in a famous japanese movie about corporate corruption connor finished his coffee and pushed away from the counter and ishiguro why did the japanese abandon him ishiguro had played it too fast and loose he acted too independently thursday night they dont like that nakamoto would have sent him back pretty soon he was destined to spend the rest of his life in japan in a madogiwazoku a window seat somebody whos bypassed by corporate decisions and stares out the window all day in a way its a life sentence i thought it over so when you used the car phone calling the station telling them what you planned who was listening hard to say connor shrugged but i liked eddie i owed him one i didnt want to see ishiguro go home back in the office there was an elderly woman waiting for me she was dressed in black and she introduced herself as cheryl austins grandmother cheryls parents died in a car crash when she was four and she had raised the little girl afterward she wanted to thank me for my help in the investigation she talked about what cheryl had been like as a little girl how she had grown up in texas of course she was pretty she said and the boys surely did like her always a bunch of them hanging around you couldnt shake them off with a stick she paused of course i never thought she was entirely right in the head but she wanted to keep those boys around and she liked them to fight over her too i remember she was seven or eight shed get those kids brawling in the dust and shed clap her hands and watch them go at it by the time she was teenage she was real good at it knew just what to do it wasnt real nice to see no something was wrong in the head she could be mean and that song she always played it day and night about lose my mind id think jerry lee lewis of course i knew why that was her daddys favorite song when she was just a little bit of a thing hed drive her to town in his convertible with his arm around her and the radio making that awful racket shed have her best sundress on she was such a pretty thing when she was a child the image of her mother then the woman started to cry thinking about that i got her a kleenex tried to be sympathetic and pretty soon she wanted to know what had happened how cheryl had died i didnt know what to say to her as i was coming out of the groundfloor entrance to parker center walking out by the fountains a japanese man in a suit stopped me he was about forty with dark hair and a mustache he greeted me formally and gave me his card it took a moment to realize that this was mr shirai the head of finance for nakamoto i wanted to see you in person sumisusan to express to you how much my company regrets the behavior of mr ishiguro his actions were not proper and be acted without authority nakamoto is an honorable company and we do not violate the law i want to assure you that he does not represent our company or what we stand for in doing business in this country the work of mr ishiguro put him in contact with many investment bankers and men who make leveraged buyouts frankly i believe he was too long in america he adopted many bad habits here so there it was an apology and an insult in the same moment i didnt know what to say to him either finally i said mr shirai there was the offer of financing for a small house oh yes yes perhaps you didnt hear of it actually i believe i have heard something of that i said i was wondering what you intended to do about that offer now there was a long silence just the splash of the fountains off to my right shirai squinted at me in the hazy afternoon light trying to decide how to play it finally he said sumisusan the offer is improper it is of course withdrawn thank you mr shirai i said connor and i drove back to my apartment neither of us talked i was driving on the santa monica freeway the signs overhead had been spraypainted by gangs i was aware of how uneven and bumpy the roadway was to the right the skyscrapers around westwood stood hazy in smog the landscape looked poor and decrepit finally i said so is that all this was just competition between nakamoto and some other japanese company over microcon or what connor shrugged multiple purposes probably the japanese think in those ways and to them america is now only an arena for their competition that much is true were just not very important in their eyes we came to my street there was a time when i thought it was pleasant a little treelined street of apartments with a playground at the end of the block for my daughter now i wasnt feeling that way the air was bad and the street seemed dirty unpleasant i parked the car connor got out shook my hand dont be discouraged i am dont be its very serious but it can all change its changed before it can change again i guess what are you going to do now he asked i dont know i said i feel like going somewhere else but theres nowhere to go he nodded leave the department probably certainly leave special services its too unclear for me he nodded take care kohai thanks for your help you too sempai i was tired i climbed the stairs to my apartment and went inside it was quiet with my daughter gone i got a can of coke from the refrigerator and walked into the living room but my back hurt when i sat in the chair i got up again and turned on the television i couldnt watch it i thought of how connor said everybody in america focused on the unimportant things it was like the situation with japan if you sell the country to japan then they will own it whether you like it or not and people who own things do what they want with them thats how it works i walked into my bedroom and changed my clothes on the bedside table i saw the pictures from my daughters birthday that i had been sorting when all this started the pictures that didnt look like her that didnt fit the reality anymore i listened to the tinny laughter from the television in the other room i used to think things were basically all right but theyre not all right i walked into my daughters room i looked at her crib and her covers with the elephants sewn on it i thought of the way she slept so trustingly lying on her back her arms thrown over her head i thought of the way she trusted me to make her world for her now and i thought of the world that she would grow into and as i started to make her bed i felt uneasy in my heart transcript of march int all right pete i think that about does it for us unless you have anything else subj no im done int i understand you resigned from the special services subj thats right int and you made a written recommendation to chief olson that the asian liaison program be changed you said the connection with the japanamerica amity foundation should be severed subj yes int why is that subj if the department wants specially trained officers we should pay to train them i just think its healthier int healthier subj yes its time for us to take control of our country again its time for us to start paying our own way int have you had a response from the chief subj not yet im still waiting if you dont want japan to buy it dont sell it akio morita afterword people deny reality they fight against real feelings caused by real circumstances they build mental worlds of shoulds oughts and mighthavebeens real changes begin with real appraisal and acceptance of what is then realistic action is possible these are the words of david reynolds an american exponent of japanese morita psychotherapy he is speaking of personal behavior but his comments are applicable to the economic behavior of nations as well sooner or later the united states must come to grips with the fact that japan has become the leading industrial nation in the world the japanese have the longest lifespan they have the highest employment the highest literacy the smallest gap between rich and poor their manufactured products have the highest quality they have the best food the fact is that a country the size of montana with half our population will soon have an economy equal to ours but they havent succeeded by doing things our way japan is not a western industrial state it is organized quite differently and the japanese have invented a new kind of trade adversarial trade trade like war trade intended to wipe out the competition which america has failed to understand for several decades the united states keeps insisting the japanese do things our way but increasingly their response is to ask why should we change were doing better than you are and indeed they are what should the american response be it is absurd to blame japan for successful behavior or to suggest that they slow down the japanese consider such american reactions childish whining and they are right it is more appropriate for the united states to wake up to see japan clearly and to act realistically in the end that will mean major changes in the united states but it is inevitably the task of the weaker partner to adjust to the demands of a relationship and the united states is now without question the weaker partner in any economic discussion with japan a century ago when admiral perrys american fleet opened the nation japan was a feudal society the japanese realized they had to change and they did starting in the s they brought in thousands of western specialists to advise them on how to change their government and their industries the entire society underwent a revolution there was a second convulsion equally dramatic after world war ii but in both cases the japanese faced the challenge squarely and met it they didnt say let the americans buy our land and our institutions and hope they will teach us to do things better not at all the japanese invited thousands of experts to visit and then sent them home again we would do well to take the same approach the japanese are not our saviors they are our competitors we should not forget it acknowledgments for advice and assistance during my research i am grateful to nina easton james flanigan ken reich and david shaw all of the los angeles times steve clemons of the japan america society of southern california senator al gore jim wilson of the jet propulsion laboratory kevin oconnor of hewlettpackard lieutenant fred nixon of the los angeles police department ron insana of cnbcfnn and keith manasco for suggestions and corrections of the manuscript at various points i am indebted to mike backes douglas crichton james fallows karel van wolferen and sonny mehta valery wright shepherded the manuscript through seemingly endless revisions shinoi osuka and later sumi adachi sovak assisted ably with the japanese text and roger mcpeek gave me his understanding of video technology and future security systems the subject of japaneseamerican relations is highly controversial i wish to state clearly that the views expressed in this novel are my own and are not to be attributed to any of the individuals listed above bibliography this novel questions the conventional premise that direct foreign investment in american high technology is by definition good and therefore should be allowed to continue without restraint or limitation i suggest things are not so simple although this book is fiction my approach to japans economic behavior and americas inadequate response to it follows a wellestablished body of expert opinion much of it listed in the bibliography indeed in preparing this novel i have drawn heavily from a number of the sources below i hope
