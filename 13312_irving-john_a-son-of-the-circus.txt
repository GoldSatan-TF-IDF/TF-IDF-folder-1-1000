john irving a son of the circus for salman authors notes this novel isnt about india i dont know india i was there only once for less than a month when i was there i was struck by the countrys foreignness it remains obdurately foreign to me but long before i went to india i began to imagine a man who has been born there and has moved away i imagined a character who keeps coming back again and again hes compelled to keep returning yet with each return trip his sense of indias foreignness only deepens india remains unyieldingly foreign even to him my indian friends said make him an indiandefinitely an indian but not an indian they told me that everywhere he goesincluding where he lives outside indiashould also strike him as foreign the point is hes always the foreigner you just have to get the details right they said i went to india at the request of martin bell and his wife mary ellen mark martin and mary ellen asked me to write a screenplay for them about the child performers in an indian circus ive been working on that screenplay and this novel simultaneously for more than four years as of this writing im revising the screenplay which is also titled a son of the circus although it isnt the same story as the novel probably ill continue to rewrite the screenplay until the film is producedif the film is produced martin and mary ellen took me to india in a sense they began a son of the circus i also owe a great deal to those indian friends who were with me in bombay in january of im thinking of ananda jaisingh particularlyand to those members of the great royal circus who gave me so much of their time when i was living with the circus in junagadh most of all im indebted to four indian friends whove read and reread the manuscript their efforts to overcome my ignorance and a multitude of errors made my writing possible i want to acknowledge them by name their importance to a son of the circus is immeasurable my thanks to dayanita singh in new delhi to farrokh chothia in bombay to dr abraham verghese in el paso texas and to rita mathur in toronto i would also like to thank my friend michael ondaatje who introduced me to rohinton mistryit was rohinton who introduced me to rita and my friend james salter has been extremely tolerant and goodhumored in allowing me to make mischievous use of several passages from his elegant novel a sport and a pastime thanks jim as always i have other writers to thank my friend peter matthiessen who read the earliest draft and wisely suggested surgery my friends david calicchio craig nova gail godwin and ron hansen not to mention his twin brother rob also suffered through earlier drafts and im indebted to ved mehta for his advice through correspondence as usual i have more than one doctor to thank too for his careful reading of the penultimate draft my thanks to dr martin schwartz in toronto in addition im grateful to dr sherwin nuland in hamden connecticut and to dr burton berson in new york they provided me with the clinical studies of achondroplasia since this novel was completed the gene for achondroplasia was found the chief research biologist of the university of california at irvine dr john j wasmuth wrote to me that he wished he had read a son of the circus before he wrote the article describing identification of the gene for achondroplastic dwarfismbecause i would have plagiarized some of your statements i can only guess that my main character the fictional dr daruwalla would have been pleased the generosity of june callwood and of john flannerythe director of nursing at casey house in torontois also much appreciated and over the four years ive been writing a son of the circus the work of three assistants has been outstanding heather cochran alison rivers and allan reeder but theres only one reader whos read or heard aloud every draft of this story my wife janet for literally the thousands of pages shes endurednot to mention her tolerance of enforced traveli thank her with all my love lastly i want to express my affection for my editor harvey ginsberg who officially retired before i handed him the page manuscript retired or not harvey edited me i repeat i dont know india and a son of the circus isnt about india it is however a novel set in indiaa story about an indian but not an indian for whom india will always remain an unknown and unknowable country if ive managed to get the details right my indian friends deserve the credit j i the crow on the ceiling fan blood from dwarfs usually the dwarfs kept bringing him backback to the circus and back to india the doctor was familiar with the feeling of leaving bombay for the last time almost every time he left india he vowed that hed never come back then the years would passas a rule not more than four or fiveand once again hed be taking the long flight from toronto that he was born in bombay was not the reason at least this was what the doctor claimed both his mother and father were dead his sister lived in london his brother in zürich the doctors wife was austrian and their children and grandchildren lived in england and in canada none of them wanted to live in indiathey rarely visited the countrynor had a single one of them been born there but the doctor was fated to go back to bombay he would keep returning again and againif not forever at least for as long as there were dwarfs in the circus achondroplastic dwarfs comprise the majority of circus clowns in india they are the socalled circus midgets but theyre not midgetstheyre dwarfs achondroplasia is the most common type of shortlimbed dwarfism an achondroplastic dwarf can be born of normal parents but the dwarfs children have a percent chance of being dwarfs this type of dwarfism is most often the result of a rare genetic event a spontaneous mutation which then becomes a dominant characteristic in the dwarfs children no one has discovered a genetic marker for this characteristicand none of the best minds in genetics are bothering to search for such a marker quite possibly only dr farrokh daruwalla had the farfetched idea of finding a genetic marker for this type of dwarfism by the passion of such a wishful discovery the doctor was driven to gather samples of dwarf blood the whimsy of his idea was plain his dwarfblood project was of no orthopedic interest and he was an orthopedic surgeon genetics was only one of his hobbies yet although farrokhs visits to bombay were infrequent and the duration of his stay was always short no one in india had ever drawn blood from so many dwarfs no one had bled as many dwarfs as dr daruwalla had bled in those indian circuses that passed through bombay or in such circuses as frequented the smaller towns in gujarat and maharashtra it was with affection that farrokh was called the vampire this is not to suggest that a physician in dr daruwallas field in india wouldnt stumble across a fair number of dwarfs they suffer from chronic orthopedic problemsaching knees and ankles not to mention low back pain their symptoms are progressive according to their age and weight as dwarfs grow older and heavier their pain gradually radiates into the buttocks posterior thighs and calves at the hospital for sick children in toronto dr daruwalla saw very few dwarfs however at the hospital for crippled children in bombaywhere from time to time upon his return visits farrokh enjoyed the title of honorary consultant surgeonthe doctor examined many dwarf patients but these dwarfs although they would provide dr daruwalla with their family histories would not readily give him their blood it would have been unethical of him to draw the dwarfs blood against their will the majority of orthopedic ailments afflicting achondroplastic dwarfs dont necessitate testing their blood therefore it was only fair that farrokh would explain the scientific nature of his research project and that he would ask these dwarfs for their blood almost always the dwarfs said no a case in point was dr daruwallas closest dwarf acquaintance in bombay in the vernacular of friendship farrokh and vinod went back a long way for the dwarf was the doctors most visceral connection to the circusvinod was the first dwarf whom dr daruwalla had asked for blood they had met in the examining room of the doctors office at the hospital for crippled children their conversation coincided with the religious holiday of diwali which had brought the great blue nile circus to bombay for an engagement at cross maidan a dwarf clown vinod and his normal wife deepa had brought their dwarf son shivaji to the hospital to have the childs ears examined vinod had never imagined that the hospital for crippled children concerned itself with earsears werent a common area of orthopedic complaintbut the dwarf correctly assumed that all dwarfs were cripples yet the doctor could never persuade vinod to believe in the genetic reasons for either his or his sons dwarfism that vinod came from normal parents and was nonetheless a dwarf was not in vinods view the result of a mutation the dwarf believed his mothers story that the morning after she conceived she looked out the window and the first living thing she saw was a dwarf that vinods wife deepa was a normal womanalmost beautiful by vinods descriptiondidnt prevent vinods son shivaji from being a dwarf however in vinods view this was not the result of a dominant gene but rather the misfortune of deepa forgetting what vinod had told her the morning after deepa conceived the first living thing she looked at was vinod and that was why shivaji was also a dwarf vinod had told deepa not to look at him in the morning but she forgot that deepa was almost beautiful or at least a normal woman and yet she was married to a dwarfthis was the result of her having no dowry shed been sold to the great blue nile circus by her mother and since deepa was still very much a novice trapeze artist she earned almost no money at all only a dwarf would be marrying her vinod said as for their child shivaji recurrent and chronic middleear infections are common among achondroplastic dwarfs until the age of or if untreated such infections often lead to significant hearing loss vinod himself was half deaf but it simply wasnt possible for farrokh to educate vinod on this matter or on other matters pertaining to the genetics of his and shivajis type of dwarfism his socalled trident hands for examplethe stubby fingers were characteristically splayed dr daruwalla also noted the dwarfs short broad feet and the flexed position of his elbows which could never be fully extended the doctor tried to make vinod admit that like his sons his fingertips reached only to his hips his abdomen protruded andeven lying on his backthe dwarf exhibited the typical forward curvature of the spine this lumbar lordosis and a tilted pelvis explain why all dwarfs waddle dwarfs are just naturally waddling vinod replied he was religiously stubborn and utterly unwilling to part with as much as a single vacutainer of his blood there he sat on the examining table shaking his head at dr daruwallas theories of dwarfism vinods head like the heads of all achondroplastic dwarfs was exceedingly large his face failed to convey a visible intelligence unless a bulging forehead could be attributed to brain power the midface again typical of achondroplasia was recessed the cheeks and the bridge of the nose were flattened although the tip of the nose was fleshy and upturned the jaw protruded to such a degree that vinods chin was prominent and while his thrusting head did not communicate the greatest common sense vinods overall manner proclaimed a personality of great determination his aggressive appearance was further enhanced by a trait common among achondroplastic dwarfs because their tubular bones are shortened their muscle mass is concentrated creating an impression of considerable strength in vinods case a life of tumbling and other acrobatics had given him especially well delineated shoulder muscles his forearms and his biceps bulged he was a veteran circus clown but he looked like a miniature thug farrokh was a little afraid of him and just what are you wanting with my blood the dwarf clown asked the doctor im looking for that secret thing which made you a dwarf dr daruwalla replied being a dwarf is no secret vinod argued im looking for something in your blood that if i find it will help other people not to give birth to dwarfs the doctor explained why are you wanting to put an end to dwarfs the dwarf asked it doesnt hurt to give blood dr daruwalla reasoned the needle doesnt hurt all needles are hurting vinod said so youre afraid of needles farrokh asked the dwarf i am just needing my blood right now vinod answered the almostbeautiful deepa wouldnt permit the doctor to prick her dwarf child with a needle either although both deepa and vinod suggested that the great blue nile circus which was in bombay for another week was full of other dwarfs who might give dr daruwalla their blood vinod said hed be happy to introduce the doctor to the blue niles clowns furthermore vinod advised the doctor to bribe the clowns with alcohol and tobacco and it was at vinods prompting that farrokh revised his stated reason for wanting the dwarfs blood tell them you are using their blood to give strength to a dying dwarf vinod suggested this was the way the dwarfblood project began it had been years ago when dr daruwalla drove to the circus grounds at cross maidan he brought his needles his plastic needle holders his glass vials or vacutainers to bribe the dwarfs he brought two cases of kingfisher lager and two cartons of marlboro cigarettes according to vinod the latter were popular among his fellow clowns because of the dwarfs high regard for the marlboro man as it turned out farrokh should have left the beer at home in the stillness of the earlyevening heat the great blue niles clowns drank too many kingfishers two dwarfs fainted while the doctor was drawing their blood which provided further evidence for vinod that he should retain every drop of his own even poor deepa guzzled a kingfisher shortly before her performance she complained of a slight dizziness which was exacerbated when she hung by her knees from the high trapeze deepa then tried swinging in a sitting position but the heat had risen to the top of the tent and the dwarfs wife felt that her head was trapped in the hottest possible air she felt only a little better when she gripped the bar in both hands and swung herself with more and more force hers was the simplest exchange for an aerialist to master but she still hadnt learned how to let the catcher grab her wrists before she tried to grab his deepa simply would release the bar when her body was parallel to the ground then shed throw back her head so that her shoulders dropped below the level of her feet and the catcher would catch hold of her by her ankles ideally when the catcher caught her deepas head was approximately feet above the safety net but the dwarfs wife was a beginner and she let go of the trapeze before her body was fully extended the catcher had to lunge for her he was able to grab only one of her feet and he caught her at an unfortunate angle deepa screamed so loudly when her hip was dislocated that the catcher thought the best thing he could do for her was to drop her into the safety net which he did dr daruwalla had never seen a more awkward fall a small dark girl from rural maharashtra deepa might have been but she looked to the doctor her dwarf son shivaji was not quite two her mother had sold her to the great blue nile when deepa was or at an age when her mother might also have been tempted to sell her to a brothel deepa knew she was lucky to have been sold to a circus she was so thin that the blue nile had at first tried to train her as a contortionista socalled boneless girl a plastic lady but as deepa grew older she became too inflexible to be boneless even vinod was of the opinion that deepa was too old when she began her training as a flyer most trapeze artists learn to fly when theyre children the dwarfs wife was if not almost beautiful at least pretty from a certain distance her forehead was pockmarked and she bore the stigmata of rickets frontal bossing rachitic rosary its called a rosary because at every junction of rib and cartilage theres a marblelike protuberance like a bead deepa was so smallbreasted that her chest was nearly as flat as a boys however her hips were womanly and it was partly the way the safety net sagged with her weight that made her appear to be lying facedown in the net while her pelvis was tilted uptoward the empty swinging trapeze from the way shed fallen and was lying in the safety net farrokh felt almost certain that the problem was deepas hip not her neck or back but until someone could keep her from flopping around in the net the doctor didnt dare go to her vinod had instantly crawled into the net now farrokh told him to clamp deepas head between his knees and hold her shoulders with his hands only when the dwarf securely held heronly when deepa couldnt move her neck or her back or even rotate her shouldersdid dr daruwalla dare to enter the net in the time it had taken vinod to crawl into the net with her and all the time that the dwarf held his wifes head tightly between his kneeswhile dr daruwalla crawled into the sagging net and made his slow awkward way toward themthe net never stopped swaying and the empty trapeze that dangled above them moved out of rhythm with the net farrokh had never been in a safety net before he was a nonathlete who was even years ago noticeably plump arid his climb into the trapeze artists net was a monumental struggle aided only by his gratitude for his first samples of dwarf blood as dr daruwalla proceeded on all fours across the dipping swaying net to where poor deepa lay in her dwarf husbands clutches the doctor most resembled a fat tentative mouse traversing a vast spiderweb farrokhs unreasonable fear of being pitched out of the net at least distracted him from the murmuring of the circus audience they were impatient for the rescue process to hurry up that the loudspeaker had introduced him to the restless crowd did nothing to prepare dr daruwalla for the arduousness of his adventure here is coming the doctor the ringmaster had declared over the loudspeaker in a melodramatic effort to hold the crowd but what a long time it took the doctor to reach the fallen flyer furthermore farrokhs weight caused the net to dip nearer the ground he was like an ungainly lover approaching his prey in a soft bed that sags in the middle then suddenly the net sagged so steeply that dr daruwalla was thrown off balance clumsily he fell forward the plump physician thrust his fingers through the holes in the net since hed already removed his sandals before climbing into the net he tried to insert his toes like claws through the holes in the net too but in spite of this effort to slow his own momentum which was now of a pace to at last be of interest to the bored audience gravity prevailed dr daruwalla pitched headfirst into the sequined belly of deepas tight singlet deepas neck and back were undamagedthe doctor had correctly diagnosed her injury from his view of her fall her hip was dislocated it hurt her when farrokh fell upon her abdomen the doctors forehead was scratched by the pink and fireenginered sequins that formed a star over deepas pelvis and the bridge of dr daruwallas nose ground to a sharp halt against her pubis under vastly different circumstances their collision might have been sexually thrilling but not to a woman with a dislocated hip and with her head clamped tightly between a dwarfs knees for dr daruwallathe fallen flyers pain and her screams notwithstandingthis encounter with deepas pubic bone would be recorded as his single extramarital experience farrokh would never forget it here hed been called out of the audience to aid a dwarfs wife in distress and then in full view of the unimpressed crowd the doctor had ended up with his face jammed into the injured womans crotch was it any wonder he couldnt forget her or the mixed sensations that shed caused him even today so many years later farrokh felt flushed with embarrassment and titillation for his memory of the trapeze artists taut belly still excited him where his cheek had come to rest against her inner thigh farrokh could still feel how her tights were soaked with sweat all the time he heard deepa screaming in pain as the doctor clumsily struggled to move his weight off her he also heard the cartilage in his nose cracking for deepas pubis was as hard as an ankle or an elbow and when dr daruwalla breathed in her dangerous aroma he thought hed at last identified the smell of sex which struck him as an earthy commingling of death and flowers it was there in the swaying safety net that vinod first accused him all this is happening because you are wanting blood from dwarfs the dwarf said the doctor dwells on lady duckworths breasts in years the indian customs authorities had detained dr daruwalla only twice both times the disposable hypodermic needlesabout a hundred of themhad caught their attention it had been necessary for the doctor to explain the difference between syringes which are used to give injections and vacutainers which are used to draw blood in the vacutainer system neither the glass vials nor the plastic needle holders are equipped with plungers the doctor wasnt carrying syringes for putting drugs in he was carrying vacutainers for taking blood out whose blood is being taken out the customs man had asked even the answer to that question had been easier to explain than the problem that currently presented itself to the doctor the current problem was dr daruwalla had upsetting news for the famous actor with the unlikely name of inspector dhar not sure of the degree to which dhar would be distressed the doctor was impelled by cowardice he planned to give the movie star the bad news in a public place inspector dhars poise in public was renowned farrokh felt he could rely on the actor to keep his composure not everyone in bombay would have thought of a private club as a public place but dr daruwalla believed that the choice was both private and public enough for the crisis at hand that morning when dr daruwalla had arrived at the duckworth sports club he had thought it was unremarkable to see a vulture high in the sky above the golf course he didnt consider the bird of death as an omen attached to the unwelcome news he carried the club was in mahalaxmi not far from malabar hill everyone in bombay knew why vultures were attracted to malabar hill when a corpse was placed in the towers of silence the vulturesfrom as far as miles outside bombaycould scent the ripening remains farrokh was familiar with doongarwadi the socalled towers of silence are seven huge cairns on malabar hill where the parsis lay out the naked cadavers of their dead to be picked clean by the carrion eaters as a parsi dr daruwalla was descended from persian zoroastrians who had come to india in the seventh and eighth centuries to escape muslim persecution farrokhs father however was such a virulent acerbic atheist that the doctor had never been a practicing zoroastrian and farrokhs conversion to christianity would doubtless have killed his godless father except that his father was already dead the doctor didnt convert until he was almost because dr daruwalla was a christian his own mortal body would never be exposed in the towers of silence but despite his fathers inflammatory atheism farrokh respected the habits of his fellow parsis and practicing zoroastriansand he expected to see vultures flying to and from ridge road nor was the doctor surprised that the particular vulture above the duckworth golf course appeared in no hurry to arrive at the towers of silence the area was entangled with vines and not even other parsis unless they were dead were welcome at the burial wells in general dr daruwalla wished the vultures well the limestone cairns contributed to the swift decomposition of even the larger bones and those parts of parsis that stayed intact were washed away in the monsoon season in regard to disposing of the dead in the doctors opinion the parsis had found an admirable solution as for the living dr daruwalla had this morning as on most mornings been up early his first surgeries at the hospital for crippled children where he continued to enjoy the title of honorary consultant surgeon included one operation for clubfoot and another for wryneck the latter is an infrequent operation nowadays and it was not the sort of surgery that reflected farrokhs main interest in practicing orthopedics albeit intermittently in bombay dr daruwalla was interested in bone and joint infections in india such infections typically follow a motorvehicle accident and a compound fracture the fracture is exposed to the air because the skin is broken and five weeks after the injury pus is bubbling from a sinus a puckered opening in the wound these infections are chronic because the bone is dead and dead bone behaves like a foreign body dead bone is called sequestrum in bombay farrokhs fellow orthopedists liked to call him dead bone daruwallathose who knew him best called him dwarf blood daruwalla too teasing aside infected bones and joints were not another hobbythey were farrokhs field in canada it often seemed to the doctor that his orthopedic practice involved almost as many sports injuries as birth defects or spasmodic contractions in toronto dr daruwalla still specialized in orthopedics for children but he felt more essentially neededhence more exhilaratedin bombay in india it was common to see orthopedic patients with little handkerchiefs tied around their legs the handkerchiefs covered sinus tracts which drained small amounts of pusfor years in bombay there was also more willingness among patients and surgeons to accept amputations and the quick fitting of a simple prosthesis such solutions were unacceptable in toronto where dr daruwalla was known for a new technique in microvascular surgery in india without removal of the dead bone there was no cure often there was too much dead bone to removeto take it out would compromise the ability of the limb to bear weight but in canada with the aid of prolonged intravenous antibiotics farrokh could combine deadbone removal with a plastic procedurea muscle and its blood supply are brought into the infected area dr daruwalla couldnt duplicate such procedures in bombay unless he limited his practice to very rich people in hospitals like jaslok at the hospital for crippled children the doctor resorted to the quick restoration of a limbs function this often amounted to an amputation and a prosthesis in place of a cure to dr daruwalla a sinus tract draining pus wasnt the worst thing in india he let the pus drain and in keeping with the enthusiasm characteristic of converts to christianitythe doctor was a confirmed anglican who was both suspicious and in awe of catholicsdr daruwalla was also exhilarated by the christmas season which in bombay isnt as garishly festooned with commercial enterprise as it has become in christian countries this particular christmas was cautiously joyous for the doctor hed attended a catholic mass on christmas eve and an anglican service on christmas day he was a holiday churchgoer if hardly a regular one yet his double churchgoing was an inexplicable overdosefarrokhs wife was worried about him the doctors wife was viennese the former julia zilkno relation to the city mayor of that name the former fräulein zilk came from an aristocratic and imperious family of roman catholics during the daruwalla familys short infrequent visits to bombay the daruwalla children had attended jesuit schools however this wasnt because the children were brought up as catholicsit was only the result of farrokh maintaining family connections with these schools which were otherwise difficult to get into the daruwalla children were confirmed anglicans theyd received anglican schooling in toronto but despite farrokhs preference for a protestant faith hed been pleased to entertain his few jesuit acquaintances on boxing day they were much livelier conversationalists than the anglicans he knew in bombay christmas itself was a glad tiding surely it was a season that produced in the doctor an effusion of goodwill in the spirit of christmas farrokh could almost forget that the effects of his yearold conversion to christianity were weakening and dr daruwalla didnt give a second thought to the vulture high above the golf course at the duckworth club the only cloud on the doctors horizon was how to tell inspector dhar the upsetting news these were not glad tidings for dhar but until this unforeseen bad news it hadnt been that bad a week it was the week between christmas and new years the weather in bombay was uncommonly cool and dry the active membership of the duckworth sports club had reached considering that there was a year waiting list for new members this number had been rather gradually achieved that morning there was a meeting of the membership committee of which the distinguished dr daruwalla was guest chairman to determine whether member number should receive any special notification of his extraordinary status the suggestions ranged from a plaque in the snooker room where there were sizable gaps among the trophies to a small reception in the ladies garden where the usual bloom of the bougainvillea was diminished by an undiagnosed blight to a simple typewritten memo thumbtacked alongside the list of temporarily elected members farrokh had often objected to the title of this list which was posted in a locked glass case in the foyer of the duckworth club he complained that temporarily elected meant merely nominatedthey werent elected at allbut this term had been the accepted usage since the club had been founded years ago a spider crouched beside the short column of names it had crouched there for so long it was presumed deador perhaps the spider was also seeking permanent membership this was dr daruwallas joke but the joke was old it was rumored to have been repeated by all members it was midmorning and the committeemen were drinking thums up cola and gold spot orange soda in the card room when dr daruwalla suggested that the matter be dropped stopped said mr dua who was deaf in one ear from a tennis injury never to be forgotten his doubles partner had doublefaulted and flung his racquet since he was only temporarily elected at the time this shocking display of bad temper had put an end to the partners quest for permanent membership i move dr daruwalla now shouted that member number six thousand not be notified the motion was quickly seconded and passed not even so much as a typewritten memo would announce the event dr sorabjee farrokhs colleague at the hospital for crippled children said facetiously that the decision was among the wisest ever made by the membership committee in truth dr daruwalla thought no one wanted to risk disturbing the spider in the card room the committeemen sat in silence satisfied with the conclusion of their business the ceiling fans only slightly ruffled the trim decks of cards that stood perfectly in place at the appropriate tables which were topped with tightly stretched green felt a waiter removing an empty thums up bottle from the table where the committeemen sat paused to straighten one errant deck of cards before leaving the room although only the top two cards of the deck had been edged out of alignment by the nearest ceiling fan that was when mr bannerjee walked into the card room looking for his golfing opponent mr lal old mr lal was late for their regular nine holes and mr bannerjee told the committee the amusing results of their competition together the day before mr lal had lost a onestroke lead in a spectacular blunder on the ninth hole hed chipped a shot entirely over the green and into a profusion of the blighted bougainvillea where hed hacked away in misery and in vain rather than return to the clubhouse mr lal had shaken mr bannerjees hand and marched in a fury to the bougainvillea there mr bannerjee had left him mr lal was intent on practicing how to escape from this trap should he ever blunder into it again petals were flying when mr bannerjee parted from his friend that evening the gardener the head mali no less was dismayed to observe the damage to the vines and to the flowers but old mr lal was among the more venerable of the duckworths membersif he insisted on learning how to escape the bougainvillea no one would be so bold as to prevent him and now mr lal was late dr daruwalla suggested to mr bannerjee that quite possibly his opponent was still practicing and that he should search for him in the rained bougainvillea thus the committee meeting disbanded in characteristic and desultory laughter mr bannerjee went seeking mr lal in the mens dressing room dr sorabjee went off to the hospital for office calls mr dua whose deafness somehow suited his retirement from the percussiveness of the tire business wandered into the snooker room to have a crack at some innocent balls which he would barely hear others stayed where they were turning to the ready decks of cards or else they found comfort in the cool leather chairs in the reading room where they ordered kingfisher lagers or london diet beers it was getting on toward late morning but it was generally thought to be too early for gin and tonics or adding a shot of rum to the thums up colas in the mens dressing room and the clubhouse bar the younger members and actual athletes were returning from their sets of tennis or their badminton or their squash for the most part they were tea drinkers at this time of the morning those returning from the golf course heartily complained about the mess of flower petals that by now had drifted over the ninth green these golfers wrongly assumed that the bougainvillea blight had taken a new and nasty turn mr bannerjee told his story several more times each time the efforts of mr lal to defeat the bougainvillea were described in more reckless and damaging terms a generous good humor pervaded the clubhouse and the dressing room mr bannerjee didnt seem to mind that it was now too late in the morning to play golf the unexpected cool weather could not change the habits of the duckworthians they were used to playing their golf and tennis before in the morning or after in the afternoon during the midday hours the members drank or lunched or simply sat under the ceiling fans or in the deep shade of the ladies garden which was never exclusively used by or especially full of ladiesnot nowadays yet the gardens name was unchanged from purdah times when the seclusion of women from the sight of men or strangers was practiced by some muslims and hindus farrokh found this odd for the founding members of the duckworth sports club were the british who were still welcome there and even comprised a small proportion of the membership to dr daruwallas knowledge the british had never practiced purdah the duckworths founders had intended the club for any and all citizens of bombay provided that theyd distinguished themselves in community leadership as farrokh and the other members of the membership committee would attest the definition of community leadership could be argued for the length of the monsoon and beyond by tradition the chairman of the duckworth club was the governor of maharashtra yet lord duckworth himself for whom the club was named had never been governor lord d as he was called had long sought the office but the eccentricities of his wife were too notorious lady duckworth was afflicted with exhibitionism in generaland with the astonishing wild habit of exposing her breasts in particular although this affliction endeared both lord and lady duckworth to many members of the club it was a gesture thought lacking in gubernatorial merit dr daruwalla stood in the penetrating cool of the empty dance hall viewingas he often didthe splendid and abundant trophies and the spellbinding old photographs of members past farrokh enjoyed such controlled sightings of his father and of his grandfather and of the countless avuncular gentlemen among his fathers and grandfathers friends he imagined that he could remember every man whod ever laid a hand on his shoulder or touched the top of his head dr daruwallas familiarity with these photographs belied the fact that the doctor himself had spent very few of his years in india when he was visiting bombay dr daruwalla was sensitive to anyone or anything that reminded him of how little he knew or understood the country of his birthplace the more time he spent in the haven of the duckworth club the more the doctor could sustain the illusion that he was comfortable being in india at home in toronto where hed spent most of his adult life the doctor enjoyed the reputationespecially among indians whod never been to india or whod never gone backof being a genuine old india hand he was even considered quite brave after all it was every few years that farrokh returned to his native land under what were presumed to be primitive conditionspracticing medicine in a country of such claustrophobic overpopulation and where were the amenities that could live up to a canadian standard of comfort werent there water shortages and bread strikes and the rationing of oil or rice not to mention food adulteration and those gas cylinders that always ran out of gas in the midst of a dinner party and one often heard about the shoddy construction of buildings the falling plaster and so on but only rarely did dr daruwalla return to india during the monsoon months which were the most primitive in bombay furthermore to his fellow torontonians farrokh tended to downplay the fact that he never stayed in india for long in toronto the doctor spoke of his childhood as a bombayite as if it had been both more colorful and more authentically indian than it truly had been educated by the jesuits dr daruwalla had attended st ignatius school in mazagaon for recreation hed enjoyed the privileges of organized sports and dances at the duckworth club when he reached university age he was sent to austria even his eight years in vienna where he completed medical school were tame and controlledhed lived the whole time with his elder brother but in the duckworths dance hall in the sacred presence of those portraits of members past dr daruwalla could momentarily imagine that he truly came from somewhere and that he belonged somewhere increasingly as he approached the doctor acknowledged only to himself that in toronto he often acted far more indian than he was he could instantly acquire a hindi accent or drop it depending on the company he kept only a fellow parsi would know that english had been his veritable mother tongue and that the doctor would have learned his hindi in school during farrokhs visits to india he was similarly ashamed of himself for how completely european or north american he pretended to be in bombay his hindi accent disappeared one had only to hear the doctors english to be convinced that hed been totally assimilated in canada in truth it was only when he was surrounded by the old photographs in the dance hall of the duckworth club that dr daruwalla felt at home of lady duckworth dr daruwalla had only heard her story in each of her stunning photographs her breasts were properly if not modestly covered yes a highly elevated and sizable bosom could be detected in her pictures even when lady duckworth was well advanced in years and yes her habit of exposing herself supposedly increased as she grew olderher breasts were reported to be well formed and well worth revealing into her seventies shed been when she revealed herself in the clubs circular driveway to a horde of young people arriving for the sons and daughters of members ball this incident resulted in a multivehicle collision that was reputed to bear responsibility for the enlargement of the speed bumps which were implanted the entire length of the access road in farrokhs opinion the duckworth club was permanently fixed at the speed indicated by those signs posted at both ends of the drive dead slow but this for the most part contented him the admonition to go dead slow didnt strike dr daruwalla as an imposition although the doctor did regret not being alive for at least one glimpse of lady duckworths longago breasts the club couldnt have been dead slow in her day as he had sighed aloud in the empty dance hall perhaps a hundred times dr daruwalla sighed again and softly said to himself those were the good old days but it was only a joke he didnt really mean it those good old days were as unknowable to him as canadahis cold adopted countryor as the india he only pretended to be comfortable in furthermore farrokh never spoke or sighed loudly enough to be heard by anyone else in the vast cool hall he listened he could hear the waiters and the busboys in the dining room setting the tables for lunch he could hear the clicks and thumps of the snooker balls and the flat authoritative snap of a card turned faceup on a table and although it was now past two diehards were still playing tennis by the soft slowly paced pops of the ball dr daruwalla concluded that it wasnt a very spirited match it was unmistakably the head gardeners truck that sped along the access road hitting each of the speed bumps with abandon there followed the resounding clatter of hoes and rakes and spades and then an abstract cursingthe head mali was a moron there was a photograph that farrokh was particularly fond of and he looked intently at it then he closed his eyes so that he might see the picture better in lord duckworths expression there was much charity and tolerance and patience yet there was something stupefied in his faraway gaze as if hed only recently recognized and accepted his own futility although lord duckworth was broadshouldered and had a deep chest and he firmly held a sword there was also a kind of gentle idiots resignation at the turneddown corners of his eyes and the drooping ends of his mustache he was perpetually almost the governor of maharashtra but never the governor and the hand that he placed around lady duckworths girlish waist was clearly a hand that touched her without weight that held her without strengthif it held her at all lord d committed suicide on new years eve precisely at the turn of the century for many more years lady duckworth would reveal her breasts but it was agreed that as a widow although she exposed herself more often she did so halfheartedly cynics said that had she lived and continued to show india her gifts lady d might have thwarted independence in the photograph that so appealed to dr daruwalla lady duckworths chin was tilted down her eyes mischievously gazing up as if shed just been caught peering into her own thrilling cleavage and had instantly looked away her bosom was a broad strong shelf supporting her pretty face even fully clothed there was something unrestrained about the woman her arms hung straight down at her sides but her fingers were spread wide apartwith her palms presented to the camera as if for crucifixionand a wild strand of her allegedly blond hair which was otherwise held high off her graceful neck was childishly twisted and coiled like a snake around one of the worlds perfect little ears in future years her hair turned from blond to gray without losing its thick body or its deep luster her breasts despite being so often and so long exposed never sagged dr daruwalla was a happily married man however he would have admittedeven to his dear wifethat he was in love with lady duckworth for hed fallen in love with her photographs and with her story when he was a child but it could have a lugubrious effect on the doctorif he spent too much time in the dance hall reviewing the photographs of members past most of the members past were deceased as the circus people said of their dead they had fallen without a net of the living the expression was reversed whenever dr daruwalla inquired after vinods healththe doctor never failed to ask about the dwarfs wife toovinod would always reply we are still falling in the net of lady duckworthat least from her photographsfarrokh would say that her breasts were still falling in the net possibly they were immortal mr lal has missed the net and then suddenly a small and seemingly unimportant incident distracted dr daruwalla from his entrancement with lady duckworths bosom the doctor would need to be in touch with his subconscious to remember this for it was only a slight disturbance from the dining room that drew his attention a crow with something shiny seized in its beak had swept in from the open veranda and had landed rakishly on the broad oarshaped blade of one of the ceiling fans the bird precariously tilted the fan but it continued to ride the blade around and around shitting in a consistently circular formon the floor on a portion of one tablecloth and on a salad plate just missing a fork a waiter flapped a napkin and the crow took flight again raucously cawing as it escaped through the veranda and rose above the golf course that stood shimmering in the noon sun whatever had been in its beak was gone perhaps swallowed first the waiters and busboys rushed to change the befouled tablecloth and place setting although it was still early for lunch then a sweeper was summoned to mop the floor owing to his earlymorning surgeries dr daruwalla lunched earlier than most duckworthians farrokhs appointment for lunch with inspector dhar was at half past noon the doctor strolled into the ladies garden where he located a break in the dense bower that afforded him a view of the expanse of sky above the golf course there he seated himself in a rosecolored wicker chair his little pot belly seemed to get his attention especially when he sat down farrokh ordered a london diet beer although he wanted a kingfisher lager to dr daruwallas surprise he saw a vulture possibly the same vulture above the golf course again the bird was lower in the sky as if it was not en route to or from the towers of silence but as if it was descending knowing how ferociously the parsis defended their burial rites it amused farrokh to imagine that they might be offended by any distraction caused to any vulture perhaps a horse had dropped dead on the mahalaxmi race course maybe a dog had been killed in tardeo or a body had washed ashore at haji alis tomb whatever the reason here was one vulture that was not performing the sacred chore at the towers of silence dr daruwalla looked at his watch he expected his luncheon companion at any moment he sipped his london diet beer trying to pretend it was a kingfisher lagerhe was imagining that he was slim again farrokh had never been slim while he watched the vulture carve its descending spirals another vulture joined it and then another this gave him an unexpected chill farrokh quite forgot to prepare himself for the news he had to deliver to inspector dharnot that there was any good way to do it the doctor grew so entranced by the birds that he didnt notice the typically smooth eerily graceful arrival of his handsome younger friend putting his hand on dr daruwallas shoulder dhar said someones dead out there farrokhwho is it this caused a new waiterthe same waiter whod driven the crow off the ceiling fanto mishandle a soup tureen and a ladle the waiter had recognized inspector dhar what shocked him was to hear the movie star speak english without a trace of a hindi accent the resounding clatter seemed to herald mr bannerjees sudden arrival in the ladies garden where he seized both dr daruwalla and inspector dhar by an arm the vultures are landing on the ninth green he cried i think its poor mr lal he must have died in the bougainvillea dr daruwalla whispered in inspector dhars ear the younger mans expression never changed as farrokh said this is your line of work inspector typical of the doctor this was a joke yet without hesitation inspector dhar led them across the fairways they could see a dozen of the leathery birds flapping and hopping in their ungainly fashion dirtying the ninth green their long necks rose above and then probed into the bougainvillea their hooked beaks brightly spattered with gore mr bannerjee wouldnt step on the green and the smell of putrefaction that clung to the vultures took dr daruwalla by surprise he stopped overcome near the flag at the ninth hole but inspector dhar parted the stinking birds as he kicked his way straight ahead into the bougainvillea the vultures rose all around him my god thought farrokh he looks like hes a real police inspectorhes just an actor but he doesnt know it the waiter whod saved the ceiling fan from the crow and had wrestled with the soup tureen and ladle with less success also followed the excited duckworthians a short distance onto the golf course but he turned back to the dining room when he saw inspector dhar scatter the vultures the waiter was among that multitude of fans who had seen every inspector dhar movie hed seen two or three of them a halfdozen times therefore he could safely be characterized as a young man who was enthralled by cheap violence and criminal bloodshed not to mention enamored of bombays most lurid elementthe citys sleaziest underscum which was so lavishly depicted in all the inspector dhar movies but when the waiter saw the flock of vultures that the famous actor had put to flight the reality of an actual corpse in the vicinity of the ninth green greatly upset him he retreated to the club where his presence had been missed by the elderly disapproving steward mr sethna who owed his job to farrokhs late father inspector dhar has found a real body this time the waiter said to the old steward mr sethna said your station today is in the ladies garden kindly remain at your station old mr sethna disapproved of inspector dhar movies he was exceptionally disapproving in general a quality regarded as enhancing to his position as steward at the duckworth club where he routinely behaved as if he were empowered with the authority of the club secretary mr sethna had ruled the dining room and the ladies garden with his disapproving frowns longer than inspector dhar had been a memberalthough mr sethna hadnt always been steward for the duckworthians hed previously been steward at the ripon club a club that only parsis join and a club unsullied by sports of any kind the ripon club existed for the purpose of good food and good conversation period dr daruwalla was also a member there the ripon and the duckworth suited farrokhs diverse nature as a parsi and a christian a bombayite and a torontonian an orthopedic surgeon and a dwarfblood collector dr daruwalla could never have been satisfied by just one club as for mr sethna who was descended from a notsooldmoney family of parsis the ripon club had suited him better than the duckworth however circumstances that had brought out his highly disapproving nature had led to his dismissal there his highly disapproving nature had already led mr sethna to lose his notsoold money and the stewards money had been exceedingly difficult to lose it was money from the raj british money but mr sethna had so disapproved of it that hed most cunningly and deliberately pissed it all away hed endured more than a normal lifetime at the mahalaxmi race course and all hed retained from his betting years was a memory of the tattoo of the horses hooves which he expertly drummed on his silver serving tray with his long fingers mr sethna was distantly related to the guzdars an oldmoney family of parsis whod kept their money theyd been shipbuilders for the british navy alas it happened that a young ripon club member had offended mr sethnas extendedfamily sensibilities the stern steward had overheard compromising mention of the virtue of a guzdar young ladya cousin many times removed because of the vulgar wit that amused these younger nonreligious parsis thered also been compromising mention of the cosmic intertwinement between spenta mainyu the zoroastrian spirit of good and angra mainyu the spirit of evil in the case of mr sethnas guzdar cousin the spirit of sex was said to be winning her favors the young dandy who was doing this verbal damage wore a wig a vanity of which mr sethna also disapproved therefore mr sethna poured hot tea on top of the gentlemans head causing him to leap to his feet and literally snatch himself bald in the presence of his surprised luncheon companions mr sethnas actions although considered most honorable among many oldmoney and newmoney parsis were judged as unsuitable behavior for a steward violent aggression with hot tea were the stated grounds for mr sethnas dismissal but the steward received the highest recommendation imaginable from dr daruwallas father it was on the strength of the elder daruwallas praise that mr sethna was instantly hired at the duckworth club farrokhs father viewed the tea episode as an act of heroism the impugned guzdar young lady was above reproach mr sethna had been correct in defending the mistreated girls virtue the steward was such a fanatical zoroastrian that farrokhs fiercely opinionated father had described mr sethna as a parsi who carried all of persia on his shoulders to everyone whod suffered his disapproving frowns in the duckworth club dining room or in the ladies garden old mr sethna looked like a steward who would gladly pour hot tea on anyones head he was tall and exceedingly lean as if he generally disapproved of eating and he had a hooked disdainful nose as if he also disapproved of how everything smelled and the old steward was so fairskinnedmost parsis are fairerskinned than most indiansthat mr sethna was presumed to be racially disapproving too at present mr sethna looked disapprovingly at the commotion that engulfed the golf course his lips were thin and tightly closed and he had the narrow jutting tufted chin of a goat he disapproved of sports and most avowedly disliked the mixing of sporting activities with the more dignified pursuits of dining and sharp debate the golf course was in riot halfdressed men came running from the locker roomas if their sporting attire when they were fully clothed werent distasteful enough as a parsi mr sethna had a high regard for justice he thought there was something immoral about a death which was so enduringly serious occurring on a golf course which was so disturbingly trivial as a true believer whose naked body would one day lie in the towers of silence the old steward found the presence of so many vultures profoundly moving he preferred therefore to ignore them and to concentrate his attention and his scorn on the human turmoil the moronic head mali had been summoned he stupidly drove his rattling truck across the golf course gouging up the grass that the assistant malis had recently groomed with the roller mr sethna couldnt see inspector dhar who was deep in the bougainvillea but he had no doubt that the crude movie star was in the thick of this crisis the steward sighed in disapproval at the very idea of inspector dhar then there came a highpitched ringing of a fork against a water glassa vulgar means by which to summon a waiter mr sethna turned to the offending table and realized that he not the waiter was being summoned by the second mrs dogar she was called the beautiful mrs dogar to her face and the second mrs dogar behind her back mr sethna didnt find her especially beautiful and he most adamantly disapproved of second marriages furthermore it was generally admitted among the members of the club that mrs dogars beauty was coarse in nature and had faded over time no amount of mr dogars money could improve his new wifes garish tastes no degree of physical fitness which the second mrs dogar was reputed to worship to excess could conceal from even the most casual observer that she was at least to mr sethnas critical eye she was already pushing if not past he also thought she was much too tall and there was many a golfloving duckworthian who took offense at her outspoken insensitive opinion that golf was insufficient exercise for anyone in pursuit of good health this day mrs dogar was lunching alonea habit of which mr sethna also disapproved at a proper club the steward believed women wouldnt be allowed to eat alone the marriage was still new enough that mr dogar often joined his wife for lunch the marriage was also old enough that mr dogar felt free to cancel these luncheon dates should some matter of more important business intervene and lately hed taken to canceling at the last minute which left his wife no time to make plans of her own mr sethna had observed that being left alone made the new mrs dogar restless and cross on the other hand the steward had also observed a certain tension between the newlyweds when they dined together mrs dogar was inclined to speak sharply to her husband who was considerably older than she was mr sethna supposed this was a penalty to be expected for he especially disapproved of men who married younger women but the steward thought it best to put himself at the aggressive wifes disposal lest she shatter her water glass with another blow from her fork the fork itself looked surprisingly small in her large sinewy hand my dear mr sethna said the second mrs dogar mr sethna answered how may i be of service to the beautiful mrs dogar you may tell me what all the fuss is about mrs dogar replied mr sethna spoke as deliberately as he would pour hot tea it is most assuredly nothing to upset yourself about the old parsi said it is merely a dead golfer the upsetting news still tingling thirty years ago there were more than circuses of some merit in india today there arent more than that are any good many of them are named the great this or the great that among dr daruwallas favorites were the great bombay the jumbo the great golden the gemini the great rayman the famous the great oriental and the raj kamal of them all farrokh felt most fond of the great royal circus before independence it was called simply the royal in it became the great it began as a twopole tent in the great royal added two more poles but it was the owner whod made such a positive impression on farrokh because pratap walawalkar was such a welltraveled man he seemed the most sophisticated of the circus owners to dr daruwalla or else farrokhs fondness for pratap walawalkar was simply because the great royals owner never teased the doctor about his interest in dwarf blood in the s the great royal traveled everywhere business was bad in egypt best in iran business was good in beirut and singapore pratap walawalkar saidand of all the countries where the circus traveled bali was the most beautiful travel was too expensive now with a halfdozen elephants and two dozen big cats not to mention a dozen horses and almost a dozen chimpanzees the great royal rarely traveled outside the states of maharashtra and gujarat with uncounted cockatoos and parrots and dozens of dogs not to mention people including almost a dozen dwarfs the great royal never left india this was the real history of a real circus but dr daruwalla had committed these details to that quality of memory which most of us reserve for our childhoods farrokhs childhood had failed to make much of an impression on him he vastly preferred the history and the memorabilia hed absorbed as a behindthescenes observer of the circus he remembered pratap walawalkar saying in an offhand manner ethiopian lions have brown manes but theyre just like other lionsthey wont listen to you if you dont call them by their right names farrokh had retained this morsel of information as if it were part of a beloved bedtime story in the early mornings en route to his surgeries even in canada the doctor often recalled the big basins steaming over the gas rings in the cooks tent in one pot was the water for tea but in two of the basins the cook was heating milk the first milk that came to a boil wasnt for teait was to make oatmeal for the chimpanzees as for tea the chimps didnt like it hot they liked their tea tepid farrokh also remembered the extra flatbread it was for the elephantsthey enjoyed roti and the tigers took vitamins which turned their milk pink as an orthopedic surgeon dr daruwalla could make no medical use of these cherished details nevertheless hed breathed them in as if they were his own background dr daruwallas wife wore wonderful jewelry some of which had belonged to his mother none of it was at all memorable to the doctor who however could describe in the most exact detail a tigerclaw necklace that belonged to pratap singh the ringmaster and wildanimal trainer for the great royal circusa man much admired by farrokh pratap singh had once shared his remedy for dizziness with the doctor a potion of red chili and burned human hair for asthma the ringmaster recommended a clove soaked in tiger urine you allow the clove to dry then you grind it up and inhale the powder moreover the animal trainer warned the doctor you should never swallow a tigers whiskers swallowing tiger whiskers will kill you had farrokh read of these remedies in some crackpots column in the times of india hed have written a scathing letter for publication in the opinion section in the name of real medicine dr daruwalla would have denounced such holistic folly which was his phrase of choice whenever he addressed the issue of socalled unscientific or magical thinking but the source of the humanhairandredchili recipe as well as of the tigerurine cure not to mention the tigerwhiskers warning was the great pratap singh in dr daruwallas view the ringmaster and wildanimal trainer was undeniably a man who knew his business this kind of lore and blood from dwarfs enhanced farrokhs abiding feeling that as a result of flopping around in a safety net and falling on a poor dwarfs wife he had become an adopted son of the circus for farrokh the honor of clumsily coming to deepas rescue was lasting whenever any circus was performing in bombay dr daruwalla could be found in a frontrow seat he could also be detected mingling with the acrobats and the animal trainersmost of all he enjoyed observing the practice sessions and the tent life these intimate views from the wing of the main tent these closeups of the troupe tents and the cagesthey were the privileges that made farrokh feel hed been adopted at times he wished he were a real son of the circus instead farrokh supposed he was merely a guest of honor nevertheless this wasnt a fleeting honornot to him ironically dr daruwallas children and grandchildren were unimpressed by the indian circuses these two generations had been born and raised in london or toronto theyd not only seen bigger and fancier circusestheyd seen cleaner the doctor was disappointed that his children and grandchildren were so dirtobsessed they considered the tent life of the acrobats and the animal trainers to be shabby even underprivileged although the dirt floors of the tents were swept several times daily dr daruwallas children and grandchildren believed that the tents were filthy to the doctor however the circus was an orderly wellkept oasis surrounded by a world of disease and chaos his children and grandchildren saw the dwarf clowns as merely grotesque in the circus they existed solely to be laughed at but farrokh felt that the dwarf clowns were appreciatedmaybe even loved not to mention gainfully employed the doctors children and grandchildren thought that the risks taken by the child performers were especially harsh yet farrokh felt that these acrobatic children were the lucky onestheyd been rescued dr daruwalla knew that the majority of these child acrobats were like deepa sold to the circus by their parents whod been unable to support them others were orphanstheyd been truly adopted if they hadnt been performing in the circus where they were well fed and protected theyd have been begging they would be the street children you saw doing handstands and other stunts for a few rupees in bombay or in the smaller towns throughout gujarat and maharashtra where even the great royal circus more frequently performedthese days fewer circuses came to bombay during diwali and the winter holidays there were still two or three circuses performing in or around the city but tv and the videocassette recorder had hurt the circus business too many people rented movies and stayed at home to hear the daruwalla children and grandchildren discuss it the child acrobats who were sold to the circus were longsuffering child laborers in a highrisk profession their hardworking noescape existence was tantamount to slavery untrained children were paid nothing for six months thereafter they started with a salary of rupees a dayonly rupees a month less than dollars but dr daruwalla argued that safe food and a safe place to sleep were better than nothing what these children were given was a chance circus people boiled their water and their milk they bought and cooked their own food they dug and cleaned their own latrines and a welltrained acrobat was often paid or rupees a month even if it was only dollars granted although the great royal took good care of its children farrokh couldnt say with certainty that the child performers were as well treated in all the indian circuses the performances in several of these circuses were so abjectnot to mention unskilled and carelessthat the doctor surmised that the tent life in such places was shabbier too life was surely shabby in the great blue nile indeed among the great this and great that circuses of india the great blue nile was the shabbiestor at least the least great deepa would agree a former child contortionist the dwarfs wife reincarnated as a trapeze artist was lacking both in polish and in common sense it wasnt merely the beer that had made her let go of the bar too soon deepas injuries were complicated but not severe in addition to the dislocation of her hip joint shed suffered a tear in the transverse ligament not only would dr daruwalla brand deepas hip with a memorable scar but in prepping the area he would be confronted by the irrefutable blackness of deepas pubic hair this would be a dark reminder of the disturbing contact between her pubis and the bridge of his nose farrokhs nose was still tingling when he helped deepa be admitted to the hospital out of guilt hed left the circus grounds with her but the admitting process had barely begun when the doctor was summoned by one of the hospital secretaries thered been a phone call for him while he was en route from the blue nile do you know any clowns the secretary asked him well as a matter of fact yes farrokh admitted dwarf clowns asked the secretary yesseveral i just met them the doctor added farrokh was too ashamed to admit that hed also just bled them apparently one of them has been injured at that circus at cross maidan the secretary said not vinod dr daruwalla exclaimed yes thats him she said thats why they want you back at the circus what happened to vinod dr daruwalla asked the somewhat disdainful secretary she was one of many medical secretaries who embraced sarcasm i couldnt ascertain the clowns condition from a phone message she replied the description was hysterical i gather he was trampled by elephants or shot from a cannon or both and now that this dwarf lies dying he is declaring you to be his doctor and so to the circus grounds at cross maidan did dr daruwalla go all the way back to the deeply flawed performance of the great blue nile the doctors nose tingled for years merely remembering the dwarfs wife would activate farrokhs nose and now the fact that mr lal had fallen without a net for the body on the golf course was indeed deadeven this evidence of death reminded dr daruwalla that deepa had survived her fall and her unwelcome and painful contact with the clumsy doctor the famous twin upon inspector dhars intrusion the vultures had risen but theyd not departed dr daruwalla knew that the carrion eaters still floated overhead because their putrescence lingered in the air and their shadows drifted back and forth across the ninth green and the bougainvillea where dhara mere moviestar detectiveknelt beside poor mr lal dont touch the body dr daruwalla said i know the veteran actor replied coldly oh hes not in a good mood farrokh thought it would be unwise to tell him the upsetting news now the doctor doubted that dhars mood would ever be good enough to make him magnanimous upon receiving such newsand who could blame him an overwhelming sense of unfairness lay at the heart of it for dhar was an identical twin whod been separated from his brother at birth although dhar had been told the story of his birth dhars twin knew nothing of the story dhars twin didnt even know he was a twin and now dhars twin was coming to bombay dr daruwalla had always believed that nothing good could come from such deception although dhar had accepted the willful arbitrariness of the situation a certain aloofness had been the cost he was a man who as far as farrokh knew withheld affection and resolutely withstood any display of affection from others who could blame him the doctor thought dhar had accepted the existence of a mother and father and identical twin brother hed never seen dhar had abided by that tiresome adage which is still popularly evokedto let sleeping dogs lie but now this most upsetting news was surely in that category of another tiresome adage which is still popularly evokedthis was the last straw in dr daruwallas opinion dhars mother had always been too selfish for motherhood and years after the accident of conception the woman was demonstrating her selfishness again that shed arbitrarily decided to take one twin and abandon the other was sufficient selfishness for a normal lifetime that shed chosen to protect herself from her husbands potentially harsh opinion of her by keeping from him the fact that thered ever been a twin was selfishness of a heightened even of a monstrous kind and that shed so sheltered the twin whom shed kept from any knowledge of his identical brother was yet again as selfish as it was deeply insensitive to the feelings of the twin shed left behind the twin who knew everything well the doctor thought dhar knew everything except that his twin was coming to bombay and that his mother had begged dr daruwalla to be sure that the twins didnt meet in such circumstances dr daruwalla felt briefly grateful for the distraction of old mr lals apparent heart attack except when eating farrokh embraced procrastination as one greets an unexpected virtue the belch of exhaust from the head gardeners truck blew a wave of flower petals from the wrecked bougainvillea over dr daruwallas feet he stared in surprise at his lightbrown toes in his darkbrown sandals which were almost buried in the vivid pink petals that was when the head mali whod left the truck running sidled over to the ninth green and stood smirking beside dr daruwalla the mali was clearly more excited by the sight of inspector dhar in action than he appeared to be disturbed by the death of poor mr lal with a nod toward the scene unfolding in the bougainvillea the gardener whispered to farrokh it looks just like a movie this observation quickly returned dr daruwalla to the crisis at hand namely the impossibility of shielding dhars twin from the existence of his famous brother who even in a city of movie stars was indubitably the most recognizable star in bombay even if the famous actor agreed to keep himself in hiding his identical twin brother would constantly be mistaken for inspector dhar dr daruwalla admired the mental toughness of the jesuits but the twinwho was what the jesuits call a scholastic in training to be a priestwould have to be more than mentally tough in order to endure a recurring mistaken identity of this magnitude and from what farrokh had been told of dhars twin selfconfidence was not high on the mans listed features after all who is almost and only in training to be a priest the doctor wondered given bombays feelings for dhar dhars jesuit twin might be killed despite his conversion to christianity dr daruwalla had little faith in the powers of a presumably naïve american missionary to surviveor even comprehendthe depth of resentment that bombay harbored for inspector dhar for example it was common in bombay to deface all the advertisements for all the inspector dhar movies only on the higherplaced hoardingsthose largerthanlife billboards that were everywhere in the citywas the giant likeness of inspector dhars cruel handsome face spared the abundant filth that was flung at it from street level but even above human reach the familiar face of the detested antihero couldnt escape creative defilement from bombays most expressive birds the crows and the forktailed kites appeared to be drawn as to a target to the dark piercing eyesand to that sneer which the famous actor had perfected all over town dhars movieposter face was spotted with bird shit but even his many detractors admitted that inspector dhar achieved a kind of perfection with his sneer it was the look of a lover who was leaving you while thoroughly relishing your misery all of bombay felt the sting of it the rest of the world even most of the rest of india didnt suffer the sneer with which inspector dhar constantly looked down upon bombay the boxoffice success of the inspector dhar movies was inexplicably limited to maharashtra and stood in violent contradiction to how unanimously dhar himself was loathed not only the character but also the actor who brought him to life was one of those luminaries in popular culture whom the public loves to hate as for the actor who took responsibility for the role he appeared to so enjoy the passionate hostility he inspired that he undertook no other roles he used no other namehe had become inspector dhar it was even the name on his passport it was the name on his indian passport which was a fake india doesnt permit dual citizenship dr daruwalla knew that dhar had a swiss passport which was genuine he was a swiss citizen in truth the crafty actor had a swiss life for which he would always be grateful to farrokh the success of the inspector dhar movies was based at least in part on how closely dhar had guarded his privacy and how well hidden hed kept his past no amount of public scrutiny which was considerable could unearth more biographical information on the mystery man than he permittedand like his movies dhars autobiography was highly farfetched and contrived wholly lacking in credible detail that inspector dhar had invented himself and that he appeared to have got away with his preposterous and unexaminable fiction was surely a contributing reason for the virulence with which he was despised but the fury of the film press only fed dhars stardom since he refused to give these gossip journalists the facts they wrote completely fabricated stories about him dhar being dhar this suited him perfectlylies merely served to heighten his mystery and the general hysteria he inspired inspector dhar movies were so popular dhar must have had fans probably a multitude of admirers but the film audience swore that they despised him dhars indifference to his audience was also a reason to hate him the actor himself suggested that even his fans were largely motivated to watch his films because they longed to see him fail their faithful attendance even if they hoped to witness a flop assured dhar of one hit after another in the bombay cinema demigods were common hero worship was the norm what was uncommon was that inspector dhar was loathed but that he was nonetheless a star as for twins separated at birth the irony was that this is an extremely popular theme with hindi screenwriters such a separation frequently happens at the hospitalor during a storm or in a railway accident typically one twin takes a virtuous path while the other wallows in evil usually there is some key that links themmaybe a torn tworupee note each twin keeps a half and often at the moment they are about to kill each other the telltale half of the tworupee note flutters out from one twins pocket thus reunited the twins vent their alwaysjustifiable anger on a real villain an inconceivable scoundrel conveniently introduced to the audience at an earlier stage in the preposterous story how bombay hated inspector dhar but dhar was a real twin truly separated at birth and dhars actual story was more unbelievable than any story concocted in the imagination of a hindi screenwriter moreover almost no one in bombay or in all of maharashtra knew dhars true story the doctor as closet screenwriter on the ninth green with the pink petals of the bougainvillea caressing his feet dr daruwalla could detect the hatred that the moronic head mali felt for inspector dhar the lout still lurked at farrokhs side clearly relishing the irony that dhar who only pretended to be a police inspector found himself playing the role in close proximity to an actual corpse dr daruwalla then remembered his own first response to the awareness that poor mr lal had fallen prey to vultures he recalled how hed relished the irony too what had he whispered to dhar this is your line of work inspector farrokh was mortified that hed said this if dr daruwalla felt vaguely guilty that he knew very little about either his native or his adopted country and if his selfconfidence was a mild casualty of his general outofitness in both bombay and toronto the doctor was more clearly and acutely agonized by anything in himself that identified him with the lowly massesthe poor slob on the street the mere commoner in short his fellow man if it embarrassed him to be a passive resident of both canada and india which was a passivity born of insufficient knowledge and experience it shamed him hugely to catch himself thinking like anyone else he may have been alienated but he was also a snob and here in the presence of death itself dr daruwalla was humiliated by his apparent lack of originalitynamely he discovered he was on the same wavelength as an entirely stupid and disagreeable gardener the doctor was so ashamed that he briefly turned his attention to mr lals griefstricken golfing partner mr bannerjee whod approached no closer than a spot within reach of the numbernine flag which hung limply from the slender pole stuck in the cup then dhar spoke quite suddenly and with more curiosity than surprise theres quite a lot of blood by one ear he said i suppose the vultures were pecking at him for some time dr daruwalla replied he wouldnt venture any nearer himselfafter all he was an orthopedist not a medical examiner but it doesnt look like that said inspector dhar oh stop playing the part of a policeman farrokh said impatiently dhar gave him a stern reproachful look which the doctor believed he absolutely deserved he sheepishly scuffed his feet in the flowers but several bright petals of the bougainvillea were caught between his toes he was embarrassed by the visible cruelty on the head malis eager face he felt ashamed of himself for not attending to the living for quite clearly mr bannerjee was suffering all alonethere was nothing the doctor could do for mr lal to poor mr bannerjee dr daruwalla must have seemed indifferent to the body and of the upsetting news that he couldnt yet bring himself to impart to his dear younger friend farrokh felt afraid oh the injustice that such unwelcome news should be my burden dr daruwalla thoughtmomentarily forgetting the greater unfairness to dhar for hadnt the poor actor already contended with quite enough dhar had not only kept his sanity which nothing less than the fierce maintenance of his privacy could ensure hed honored dr daruwallas privacy too for dhar knew that the doctor had written the screenplays for all the inspector dhar moviesdhar knew that farrokh had created the very character whom dhar was now condemned to be it was supposed to be a gift dr daruwalla remembered hed so loved the younger man as he would his own sonhed expressly written the part just for him now to avoid the reproachful look that dhar gave him farrokh knelt down and picked the petals of bougainvillea from between his toes oh dear boy what have i gotten you into dr daruwalla thought although dhar was almost he was still a boy to dr daruwalla the doctor had not only invented the character of the controversial police inspector hed not only created the movies that inspired madness throughout maharashtra hed also fabricated the absurd autobiography that the famous actor attempted to pass off to the public as the story of his life quite understandably the public didnt buy it farrokh knew that the public wouldnt have bought dhars true story either inspector dhars fictional autobiography manifested a fondness for shock value and sentiment that was remindful of his films he claimed to have been born out of wedlock he said his mother was an americancurrently a hasbeen hollywood movie starand his father was an actual bombay police inspector long since retired forty years ago inspector dhar was the hollywood mother had been shooting a film in bombay the police inspector responsible for the stars security had fallen in love with her their trysting place had been the taj mahal hotel when the movie star knew she was pregnant she struck a deal with the inspector at the time dhar was born the lifetime support of an indian police inspector seemed no more prohibitive an expense to the hollywood star than her habit of adding coconut oil to her bath or so the story went a baby especially out of wedlock and with an indian father would have compromised her career according to dhar his mother had paid the police inspector to take full responsibility for the child enough money was involved so that the inspector could retire he clearly passed on his intimate knowledge of police business including the bribes to his son in his movies inspector dhar was always above being bribed all the real police inspectors in bombay said that if they knew who dhars father was they would kill him all the real policemen made it clear that they would enjoy killing inspector dhar too to dr daruwallas shame it was a story full of holes beginning with the unknown movie more movies are made in bombay than in hollywood but in no american films were made in maharashtraat least none that were ever released and suspiciously there were no records of the policemen assigned to foreign film sets for security although copious records exist in other years suggesting that the accounts for were liberated from the files doubtless by means of a bribe but why as for the socalled hasbeen hollywood star if she was an american in bombay making a movie she would have been considered a hollywood stareven if she was an unknown actress and a terrible actress and even if the movie had never been released inspector dhar had claimed at best indifference regarding her identity it was said that dhar had never been to the united states although his english was reported to be perfect even accentless he said that he preferred to speak hindi and that he dated only indian women dhar had confessed at worst a mild contempt for his mother whoever she was and he professed a fierce and abiding loyalty to his father which was marked by dhars resolute vow to keep his fathers identity secret it was rumored that they met only in europe it must be said in dr daruwallas defense that the improbable nature of his fiction was at least based on reality the fault rested with the unexplained gaps in the story inspector dhar made his first movie in his early twenties but where was he as a child in bombay such a handsome man wouldnt have gone unnoticed as a boy especially as a teenager furthermore his skin was simply too faironly in europe or in north america would he have been called darkskinned he had such darkbrown hair that it was almost black and such charcoalgray eyes that they were almost black too but if he actually had an indian father there wasnt a discernible trace of even a fairskinned indian in the son everyone said that possibly the mother was a blueeyed blonde and all that the police inspector could contribute to the child was a racially neutralizing effect and a fervor for homicide cases nevertheless all of bombay complained that the boxoffice star of its hindi movie madness looked to all the world like a percent north american or european there was no credible explanation for his allwhite appearance which fueled the rumor that dhar was the child of farrokhs brother whod married an austrian and since it was well known that farrokh was married to this europeans sister it was also rumored that dhar was the doctors child the doctor expressed boredom for the notion in spite of the fact that there were many living duckworthians who could remember dr daruwallas father in the company of an ephemeral fairskinned boy who was only an occasional summer visitor and this suspiciously allwhite boy was reputed to be the senior daruwallas grandson but the best way to answer these charges farrokh knew was not to answer them beyond the bluntest denial its well known that many indians think fair skin is beautiful in addition dhar was ruggedly handsome however it was considered perverse of inspector dhar that he refused to speak english in public or spoke it with an obviously exaggerated hindi accent it was rumored that he spoke accentless english in private but how would anyone know inspector dhar granted only a limited number of interviews which were restricted to questions regarding his art he insisted that his personal life was a forbidden topic dhars personal life was the only topic of possible interest to anyone when cornered by the film press at a nightclub at a restaurant at a photo session in connection with the release of a new inspector dhar movie the actor would apply his famous sneer it didnt matter what question he was asked either he answered facetiously or regardless of the question he would say in hindi or in english with his phony accent i have never been to the united states i have no interest in my mother if i have babies they will be indian babies they are the most clever and dhar could return and outlast anyones stare he could also manipulate the eye of any camera alarmingly he possessed an increasingly bulky strength until he was in his midthirties his muscles had been well defined his stomach flat whether it was middle age or whether dhar had yielded to the usual bodily measurements for success among bombays matinee idolsor whether it was his love of weight lifting in tandem with his professed capacity for beerthe actors stoutness threatened to overtake his reputation as a tough guy in bombay he was perceived as a wellfed tough guy his critics liked to call him beer belly but not to his face after all dhar wasnt in bad shape for a guy who was almost as for dr daruwallas screenplays they deviated from the usual masala mixture of the hindi cinema farrokhs scripts were both corny and tawdry but the vulgarity was decidedly westernthe heros own nastiness was extolled as a virtue dhar was routinely nastier than most villainsand the peculiar sentimentality bordered on undergraduate existentialism dhar was beyond loneliness in that he appeared to enjoy being alienated from everyone there were token gestures to the hindi cinema which dr daruwalla viewed with the mocking irony of an outsider gods frequently descended from the heavens usually to provide inspector dhar with inside information and all the villains were demonic if ineffectual villainy in general was represented by criminals and the majority of the police force sexual conquest was reserved for inspector dhar whose heroism operated both within and above the law as for the women who provided the sexual conquests dhar remained largely indifferent to them which was suspiciously european there was music of the standard hindi combination choruses of girls oohing and aahing to the clamor of guitars tablas violins and vinas and inspector dhar himself despite his ingrained cynicism would occasionally lipsync a song although he lipsynced well the lyrics are not worth repeatinghe would snarl such poetry as baby i guarantee it youre gonna find me gratifying such songs in the hindi cinema are in hindi but this was another instance of how the inspector dhar films were deliberately scripted against the grain dhars songs were in english with his deplorable hindi accent even his theme song which was sung by an allgirl chorus and repeated at least twice in every inspector dhar movie was in english it too was loathed it was also a hit although hed written it it made dr daruwalla cringe to hear it so you say inspector dhar is a mere mortal so you say so you say he looks like a god to us so you say this is a little rain shower so you say so you say it looks like the monsoon to us if dhar was a good lipsyncer he also demonstrated no enthusiasm for the muchmaligned art one critic had dubbed him lazy lips another critic complained that nothing energized dharhe lacked enthusiasm for everything as an actor dhar had mass appealpossibly because he seemed constantly depressed as if sordidness were a magnet to him and his eventual triumph over evil were a perpetual curse therefore a certain wistfulness was ascribed to every victim whom inspector dhar sought to rescue or avenge a graphic violence attended dhars punishment of each and every evildoer as for sex satire prevailed in place of lovemaking old newsreel footage of a rocking train would be substituted ejaculation was characterized by listless waves breaking on shore furthermore and in compliance with the rules of censorship in india nudity which was not permitted was replaced by wetness there was much fondling fully clothed in the rain as if inspector dhar solved crimes only during the monsoon season the occasional nipple could be glimpsed or at least imagined under a fully soaked sari this was more titillating than erotic social relevance and ideology were similarly muted if not altogether absent both in toronto and in bombay these latter instincts were similarly undeveloped in dr daruwalla beyond the commonplace observation that the police were thoroughly corrupted by a system based on bribery there was little preaching scenes of violent but maudlin death followed by scenes of tearful mourning were more important than messages intended to inspire a national conscience the character of inspector dhar was brutally vindictive he was also utterly incorruptibleexcept sexually women were easily and simplistically identified as good or bad yet dhar permitted himself the greatest liberties with bothindeed with all well with almost all he wouldnt indulge a western woman and in every inspector dhar movie there was always at least one western ultrawhite woman who craved a sexual adventure with inspector dhar that he faithfully and cruelly spurned her was his signature his trademark and the part of his films that made indian women and young girls adore him whether this aspect of dhars character reflected his feelings for his mother or gave fictional evidence of his stated intentions to sire only indian babieswell who knew who really knew anything about inspector dhar hated by all men loved by all women who said that they hated him even the indian women whod dated him were uniform in the zeal they demonstrated in protection of his privacy they would say hes not at all like he is in his movies no examples were ever forthcoming they would say hes very oldfashioned a real gentleman no examples were ever asked for hes very modest reallyand very quiet they would say everyone could believe he was quiet there were suspicions that he never spoke an unscripted linethese were happy mindless contradictions of the rumor regarding his accentless english no one believed anything or else they believed everything theyd ever heard that he had two wivesone in europe that he had a dozen childrennone he would acknowledge all of them illegitimate that he actually lived in los angeles in his vile mothers house in the face of all rumors and in keeping with the violent contrasts created by the extreme popularity of his movies and the extreme animosity toward him that was inspired by his sneer dhar himself remained inscrutable no small amount of sarcasm was detectable in his sneer no other thickset middleaged man could possibly have seemed so selfpossessed dhar endorsed only one charity so totally and convincingly did he solicit the publics support of his personal crusade that he had achieved a philanthropic status as high as any among the several benefactors of bombay he made television commercials for the hospital for crippled children the advertisements were made at dhars own expense and they were devastatingly effective dr daruwalla was the author of these commercials as well on the tv inspector dhar faces the camera in medium closeup wearing a loosefitting white shirta collarless or mandarinstyle kurtaand he holds his practiced sneer only as long as he imagines it takes to get the viewers full attention then he says you may love to hate mei make a lot of money and i dont give any of it to anyone except to these children there then follows a series of shots of dhar among the crippled children at the orthopedic hospital a deformed little girl crawls toward inspector dhar who holds out his hands to her inspector dhar is surrounded by staring children in wheelchairs inspector dhar lifts a little boy from a swirling whirlpool bath and carries him to a clean white table where two nurses assemble the childs leg braces for himthe boys legs arent as big around as his arms regardless inspector dhar was still hated on occasion he was even attacked local bullies wanted to see if he was as tough and practiced in the martial arts as the police inspector he portrayed apparently he was he would respond to any and all verbal abuse with a queerly restrained version of his sneer it made him appear mildly drunk but if physically threatened he wouldnt hesitate to retaliate in kind once assaulted by a man with a chair dhar struck back with a table he was reputed to be as dangerous as his screen persona hed occasionally broken other peoples bones perhaps from his understanding of orthopedics hed caused serious injuries to the joints of his assailants he was capable of real damage but dhar didnt pick fights he simply won them his trashy films were hastily made his publicity appearances minimal the rumor was he spent next to no time in bombay his chauffeur was an unfriendly dwarf a former circus clown whom the filmgossip press had confidently labeled a thug vinod was proud of this allegation and except for the plentiful number of indian women whod dated him dhar wasnt known to have any friends his most public acquaintancewith an infrequent visitor to bombay an honorary consultant surgeon at the hospital for crippled children who was the hospitals usual spokesman for its foreign fundraising effortswas accepted as a longstanding relationship that had withstood invasions from the media dr daruwallaa distinguished canadian physician and family man and a son of the former chief of staff of bombays hospital for crippled children the late dr lowji daruwallawas witheringly brief to the press when asked about his relationship to and with inspector dhar dr daruwalla would say im a doctor not a gossip besides the younger and the elder man were seen together only at the duckworth club the media werent welcome there and among the members of the club eavesdropping except by the old parsi steward was generally deplored there was however much speculation about how inspector dhar could conceivably have become a member of the duckworth club movie stars werent welcome there either and given the year waiting list and the fact that the actor became a member when he was only dhar must have applied for membership when he was four or someone had applied for him furthermore it had not been sufficiently demonstrated to many duckworthians that inspector dhar had distinguished himself in community leadership some members pointed to his efforts for the hospital for crippled children but others argued that inspector dhars movies were destructive to all of bombay quite understandably there was no suppressing the rumors or the complaints that circulated through the old club on this subject dr daruwalla is stricken with selfdoubt there was also no suppressing the exciting news about the dead golfer in the bougainvillea near the ninth green true to his fictional character inspector dhar himself had located the body doubtless the press would expect dhar to solve the crime it didnt appear there had been a crime although there was talk among the duckworthians that mr lals excesses on the golf course were of a criminal nature and surely his exertions in the wrecked bougainvillea hadnt served the old gentleman well the vultures had spoiled a clear impression but it seemed that mr lal had been the victim of his own chip shot his lifelong opponent mr bannerjee told dr daruwalla that he felt as if hed murdered his friend he always fell apart at the ninth hole mr bannerjee exclaimed i never should have teased him about it dr daruwalla was thinking that hed often teased mr lal along similar lines it had been irresistible to tease mr lal in regard to the zeal with which he played a game for which he manifested minimal talent but now that he appeared to have died at the game mr lals enthusiasm for golf seemed less funny than before farrokh found himself sensing some faint analogy between his creation of inspector dhar and mr lals golf game and this unwanted connection came to him as the result of a sudden unpleasant odor it wasnt as strong an impression as the stench of a man defecating at close quarters but instead the smell was at once more familiar and more removedsunrotted garbage perhaps or clogged drains farrokh thought of potted flowers and human urine farfetched or not the nature of the comparison between mr lals lethal golf habit and dr daruwallas screenwriting was simply this the inspector dhar movies were judged to be of no artistic merit whatsoever but the labors that the doctor performed to write these screenplays were intense the nature of inspector dhars character was crude to most viewers and outrageously offensive to many but the doctor had created dhar out of the purest love and farrokhs fragile selfesteem rested as much on his sense of himself as a closet writer as it did on his established reputation as a surgeon even if he was only a screenwriter and worse even though he was perceived to be such a shameless hacksuch a whore for the moneythat he wouldnt even lend his name to his creations understandably since the actor who played inspector dhar had himself become in the public eye the very character he portrayed the authorship of the screenplays was ascribed to dhar what gave farrokh so much pleasure was the actual writing of the screenplays themselves yet despite his own enjoyment of the craft the results were ridiculed and hated recently in the light of certain death threats that inspector dhar had received dr daruwalla had even considered retiring the doctor had meant to sound out the actor in regard to this notion if i stop farrokh wondered what will dhar do if i stop what will i do hed also wondered for hed long suspected that dhar wouldnt be opposed to the idea of getting out of the business of being dharespecially now to suffer the verbal abuse of the times of india was one thing death threats were something altogether different and now this unlikely association to mr lals golf game this unveiled reek of sunrotted garbage this ancient smell from a clogged drainor had someone been peeing in the bougainvillea these thoughts were most unwelcome dr daruwalla suddenly saw himself as the poor doomed mr lal he thought he was as bad but as compulsive a writer as mr lal had been a golfer for example hed not only written another screenplay theyd already finished the final cut of the picture coincidentally the new movie would be released shortly before or after the arrival in bombay of dhars twin dhar himself was just hanging aroundhe was under contract for a very limited number of interviews and photo opportunities to publicize the new release this forced intimacy with the film press could never be limited enough to suit dhar also there was every reason to believe that the new film might make as much trouble as the last and so the time to stop is now thought dr daruwalla before i begin another one but how could he stop it was something he loved and how could he hope to improve farrokh was doing the best that he could like poor mr lal he was hopelessly returning to the ninth green each time the flowers would fly but the golf ball would remain more or less unresponsive each time he would be kneedeep in the blighted bougainvillea slashing wildly at the little white ball then one day the vultures would be overhead and descending there was just one choice either hit the ball and not the flowers or stop the game dr daruwalla understood this yet he couldnt decideno more than he could bring himself to tell inspector dhar the upsetting news after all the doctor thought how can i hope to be any better than my proven abilities and how can i stop it when it is merely what i do it soothed him to think of the circus like a child whos proud to recite the names of santas reindeer or the seven dwarfs farrokh tested himself by remembering the names of the great royals lions ram raja wazir mother diamond shanker crown max hondo highness lillie mol leo and tex and then there were the cubs sita gita julie devi bheem and lucy the lions were most dangerous between their first and second feedings of meat the meat made their paws slippery while they paced in their cages in expectation of their second serving they often slipped and fell down or they slid sideways into the bars after their second feeding they calmed down and licked the grease off their paws with lions you could count on certain things they were always themselves lions didnt try to be what they couldnt be the way dr daruwalla kept trying to be a writerthe way i keep trying to be an indian he thought and in years hed not found a genetic marker for achondroplastic dwarfism nor had anyone encouraged him to look but he kept trying the doctors dwarfblood project wasnt dead he wouldnt let it dienot yet because an elephant stepped on a seesaw by the time dr daruwalla was in his late fifties the exuberant details of the doctors conversion to christianity were entirely absent from his conversation it was as if he were slowly becoming unconverted but years agoas the doctor drove to the circus grounds at cross maidan to assess what damage had been done to the dwarffarrokhs faith was still new enough that hed already imparted the miraculous particulars of his belief to vinod if the dwarf was truly dying the doctor was at least slightly comforted by his memory of their religious discussionfor vinod was a deeply religious man in the coming years farrokhs faith would comfort him less deeply and he would one day flee from any religious discourse with vinod over time the dwarf would strike the doctor as a giant zealot but while the doctor was en route to discover whatever disaster had befallen the dwarf at the great blue nile he found it heartening to dwell on the dwarfs expressed excitement over the parallels between vinods version of hinduism and dr daruwallas christianity we are having a kind of trinity too the dwarf had exclaimed brahma shiva vishnuis that what you mean the doctor asked all creation is being in the hands of three gods vinod said first is brahma the god of creationthere is only one temple in all of india to him second is vishnu the god of preservation or existence and third is shiva the god of change change farrokh asked i thought shiva was the destroyerthe god of destruction why is everyone saying this the dwarf exclaimed all creation is being cyclicthere is no finality i am liking it better to think of shiva as the god of change sometimes death is change too i see dr daruwalla replied thats a positive way of looking at it this is our trinity the dwarf went on creation preservation change i guess i dont understand the female forms farrokh boldly admitted the power of the gods is being represented by the females vinod explained durga is the female form of shivashe is the goddess of death and destruction but you just said shiva was the god of change the doctor interjected his female form durga is the goddess of death and destruction the dwarf repeated i see dr daruwalla responded it seemed best to say so durga is looking after mei am praying to her vinod added the goddess of death and destruction is looking after you farrokh inquired she is always protecting me the dwarf insisted i see dr daruwalla said he guessed that being protected by the goddess of death and destruction had a kind of karmic ring to it finally farrokh found vinod lying in the dirt under the bleachers it appeared that the dwarf had fallen through the wooden planks from perhaps the fourth or fifth row of seats the roustabouts had cleared the crowd from only a small section of the audience area below which vinod lay unmoving but how and why the dwarf had landed there wasnt immediately clear was there a clown act that required audience participation on the far side of the ring a desultory gathering of dwarf clowns was bravely trying to keep the crowds attention it was the familiar farting clown actthrough a hole in the seat of his colorful pants one dwarf kept farting talcum powder on the other dwarfs they didnt appear to be weakened or otherwise the worse for giving the doctor a vacutainer of their blood which vinod had shamelessly entreated them to do just as shamelessly dr daruwalla had lied to themexactly as vinod had advised him the dwarfs blood would be used to give strength to a dying dwarf vinod had even compounded this fiction by telling his fellow clowns that hed already been bled to the doctors satisfaction this time mercifully the ringmasters voice on the loudspeaker had not heralded the doctors arrival since vinod lay under the bleacher seats most of the crowd couldnt see him farrokh knelt in the dirt which was littered with the audiences leavings greasy paper cones softdrink bottles peanut shells and discarded betelnut pieces on the underside of the bleachers farrokh could see the white stripes of lime paste that streaked the wooden planks the paan users had wiped their fingers under their seats i think i am not ending up here vinod whispered to the doctor i think i am not dyingjust changing try not to move dr daruwalla replied just tell me where youre hurting i am not moving i am not hurting the dwarf answered i am just not feeling my backside quite in character for a man of faith the dwarf lay stoically suffering with his trident hands crossed upon his chest he complained later that no one had dared to approach him except a vendora channawalla with his tray of nuts around his neck vinod had told the vendor about the numbness in his backside hence the ringmaster assumed that the dwarf had broken his neck or his back vinod thought that someone should at least have talked to him or listened to the story of his life someone should have held his head or offered him water until the stretcher bearers in their dirtywhite dhotis came for him this is shivathis is being his business the dwarf told dr daruwalla this is changenot death i think if durga is doing this then okayi am dying but i think i am merely changing lets hope so dr daruwalla replied he made vinod grip his fingers then the doctor touched the backs of vinods legs i am feeling you only a little the dwarf responded im touching you only a little farrokh explained this is meaning i am not dying said the dwarf this is merely the gods advising me what are they telling you the doctor asked they are saying i am ready to leave the circus vinod answered at least this circus slowly the faces from the great blue nile gathered around them the ringmaster the boneless girls and the plastic ladieseven the lion tamer who toyed with his whip but the doctor wouldnt allow the stretcher bearers to move the dwarf until someone explained how vinod had been injured vinod believed that only the other dwarfs could describe the accident properly for this reason the farting clown act had to be halted by now the act had deteriorated in the usual fashion the offending dwarf was farting talcum powder into the frontrow seats since the front row of the audience was chiefly populated with children the farting was considered no great offense however the crowd was already dispersing the farting clown act was never funny for very long the great blue nile had exhausted its entire repertoire in a halfsuccessful effort to keep the audience seated until the doctor arrived now the gathering clowns confessed to the doctor that vinod had been injured in other acts before once hed fallen off a horse once hed been chased and bitten by a chimpanzee once when the blue nile had a female bear the bear had butted vinod into a bucket of diluted shaving lather this was a scripted part of the act but the bear had butted vinod too hardhed had his breath knocked out and as a consequence the dwarf had then inhaled and swallowed the soapy water vinods fellow clowns had also seen him hurt in the cricketplaying elephants act apparently to the degree that dr daruwalla could understand the stunt at all one elephant was the bowler and a second elephant was the batsman it held and swung the bat with its trunk vinod was the cricket ball it hurt to be bowled by one elephant and batted by another even though the bat was made of rubber as farrokh would learn later the great royal circus never put their dwarf clowns at such risk but this was the great blue nile the terrible teeterboard accident which was responsible for vinods pained position under the bleacher seats was simply another elephant act of ill repute the acts in an indian circus are called items in terms of accuracy the elephant on a teeterboard item wasnt as precise as the cricketplaying elephants but it was a favorite with children who were more familiar with a seesaw or a teetertotter than with cricket in the elephant on a teeterboard item vinod acted the part of a crabby clown a spoilsport who wouldnt play with his fellow dwarfs on the seesaw whenever they balanced the teetertotter vinod jumped on one end and knocked them all off then he sat on the teeterboard with his back to them one by one they crept onto the other end of the board until vinod was up in the air whereupon he turned around and slid down the board into the other dwarfs knocking them all off again it was thus established for the audience that vinod was guilty of antisocial behavior his fellow dwarfs left him sitting on one end of the seesaw with his back to them while they fetched an elephant the only part of this act that is of possible interest to grownups is the demonstration that elephants can countat least as high as three the dwarfs tried to coax the elephant to stamp on the raised end of the teeterboard while vinod was sitting on the other end but the elephant was taught to delay stamping on the teeterboard until the third time the first two times that the elephant raised its huge foot above the teeterboard it didnt stamp on the board twice at the last second it flapped its ears and turned away the idea was planted with the audience that the elephant wouldnt really do it the third time when the elephant stamped down on the seesaw and vinod was propelled into the air the crowd was properly surprised vinod was supposed to be launched upward into the rolled nets that were lowered only for the trapeze performance he would cling to the underside of this netting like a bat screaming at his fellow dwarfs to get him down naturally they couldnt reach him without the help of the elephant of which vinod was demonstrably afraid typical circus slapstick yet it was important that the teeterboard was aimed exactly at the rolledup safety nets that fateful night his life changed vinod realized as he sat on the seesaw that the teeterboard was pointed into the audience this could be blamed on the kingfisher lager such big bottles of beer had an unsteadying effect on dwarfs dr daruwalla would never again bribe dwarfs with beer sadly the seesaw was pointed in the wrong direction and vinod had neglected to count the number of times that the elephant had raised its foot which the dwarf had previously managed to do without seeing the elephant vinod always counted the times the elephant raised its foot by the gasps of anticipation in the audience of course vinod could have turned his head and looked at the elephant to see where the beasts great foot was but vinod held himself accountable for certain standards if hed turned to look at the elephant it would have spoiled the act completely as it happened vinod was flung into the fourth row of seats he remembered hoping that he wouldnt land on any children but he neednt have worried the audience scattered before he arrived he struck the empty wooden bleachers and fell through the space between the planks created by spontaneous mutation an achondroplastic dwarf lives in pain his knees ache his elbows achenot to mention that they wont extend his ankles ache and his back aches toonot to mention the degenerative arthritis of course there are worse types of dwarfism pseudoachondroplastic dwarfs suffer socalled windswept deformitiesbowleg on one limb knockknee on the other dr daruwalla had seen dwarfs who couldnt walk at all even so given the pain that vinod was accustomed to the dwarf didnt mind that his backside was numb it was possibly the best that the dwarf had felt in yearsin spite of being catapulted feet by an elephant and landing on his coccyx on a wooden plank thus did the injured dwarf become dr daruwallas patient vinod had suffered a slight fracture in the apex of his coccyx and hed bruised the tendon of his external sphincter muscle which is attached to this apex in short hed quite literally busted his ass vinod had also torn some of the sacrosciatic ligaments which are attached to the narrow borders of the coccyx the numbness of his backside which soon abatedthence vinod would return to the world of his routine aches and painswas possibly the result of some pressure on one or more of the sacral nerves his recovery would be complete although slower than deepas yet vinod insisted hed been permanently disabled what he meant was hed lost his nerve future flight experiments with the clowns of the great blue nile would have to be conducted without vinods participationor so the dwarf claimed if shiva was the god of change and not merely the destroyer perhaps the change that lord shiva intended for vinod was actually a career move but the veteran clown would always be a dwarf and vinod struck farrokh as lacking the qualifications for a job outside the circus vinod and his wife were recovering from their respective surgeries when the great blue nile completed its term of engagement in bombay while both deepa and her dwarf husband were hospitalized dr daruwalla and his wife took care of shivaji after all someone had to look after the dwarf childand the doctor still held himself accountable for the kingfisher it had been some years since the daruwallas had struggled to manage a twoyearold and theyd never before tried to manage a dwarf twoyearold but this period of convalescence proved fruitful for vinod the dwarf was a compulsive list maker and he enjoyed showing his lists to dr daruwalla there was quite a long list of vinods acquired circus skills and a sadly shorter list of the dwarfs other accomplishments on the shorter list dr daruwalla saw it written that the dwarf could drive a car farrokh felt certain that vinod was lying after all hadnt vinod proposed that very lie which the doctor had used to bleed the dwarfs of the great blue nile what sort of car can you drive vinod the doctor asked the recuperating dwarf how can your feet reach the pedals it was to another word on the short list that vinod proudly pointed the word was mechanics farrokh had at first ignored ithed skipped straight to car driving dr daruwalla assumed that mechanics meant fixing unicycles or other toys of the circus but vinod had dabbled in auto mechanics and in unicycles the dwarf had actually designed and installed hand controls for a car naturally this was inspired by a dwarf item for the great blue nile ten clowns climb out of one small car but first a dwarf had to be able to drive the car that dwarf had been vinod the hand controls had been complicated vinod confessed lots of experiments are failing vinod said philosophically the driving the dwarf said had been relatively easy you can drive a car dr daruwalla said as if to himself both fast and slow vinod exclaimed the car must have an automatic transmission farrokh reasoned no clutchingjust braking and speeding the dwarf explained there are two hand controls the doctor inquired who is needing more than two the dwarf asked so when you slow down or speed up you must have just one hand on the steering wheel farrokh inferred who is needing both hands for steering vinod replied you can drive a car dr daruwalla repeated somehow this seemed harder to believe than the elephant on a teeterboard or the cricketplaying elephantsfor farrokh could imagine no other life for vinod the doctor believed that the dwarf was doomed to be a clown for the great blue nile forever i am teaching deepa to do car driving too vinod added but deepa doesnt need hand controls farrokh observed the dwarf shrugged at the blue nile we are naturally driving the same car he explained thus it was therein the dwarfs ward in the hospital for crippled childrenthat a future hero of car driving was first introduced to dr daruwalla farrokh simply couldnt imagine that years later a veritable limousine legend would have been born in bombay not that vinod would immediately escape the circus all legends take time not that deepa the dwarfs wife would in the end entirely escape the circus not that shivaji the dwarfs son would ever dream of escaping it but all this was truly happening because dr farrokh daruwalla wanted blood from dwarfs the real policeman mrs dogar reminds farrokh of someone else for years dr daruwalla would indulge himself with his memory of deepa in the safety net of course this is an exaggeration of that kind which caused the doctor to often reflect on his surprise at vinod becoming a veritable limousine legend in bombay in the heyday of the dwarfs success at car driving vinod could never be credited with chauffeuring a limo much less owning a limousine company at best vinod owned a halfdozen cars none of them was a mercedesincluding the two that the dwarf drove with hand controls what vinod would briefly manage to achieve was a modest profit in the privatetaxi business or luxury taxis as theyre called in bombay vinods cars were never luxuriousnor could the dwarf have managed private ownership of these thoroughly secondhand vehicles without accepting a loan from dr daruwalla if the dwarf was even fleetingly a legend neither the number nor the quality of vinods automobiles was the reasonthey were not limousines the dwarfs legendary status owed its existence to vinods famous client the aforementioned actor with the improbable name of inspector dhar at most dhar lived parttime in bombay and poor vinod could never completely sever his ties to the circus shivaji the dwarfs dwarf son was now a teenager as such he suffered from strong and contrary opinions had vinod continued to be an active clown in the great blue nile shivaji would doubtless have rejected the circus the contentious boy would probably have chosen to drive a taxi in bombaypurely out of hatred for the very idea of being a comic dwarf but since his father had made such an effort to establish a taxi business and since vinod had struggled to free himself from the dangerous daily grind of the great blue nile shivaji was determined to become a clown therefore deepa often traveled with her son and while the blue nile was performing throughout gujarat and maharashtra vinod devoted himself to the cardriving business in bombay for years the dwarf had been unable to teach his wife how to drive since her fall deepa had given up the trapeze but the blue nile paid her to train the child contortionists while shivaji developed his skills as a clown his mother put the plastic ladies through their boneless items when the dwarf succumbed to missing his wife and son hed go back to the blue nile there vinod eschewed the riskier acts in the dwarfclown repertoire contenting himself with instructing the younger dwarfs his own son among them but whether clowns are shot off seesaws by elephants or chased by chimps or butted by bears theres only so much for them to learn beyond the demanding drills which require practicehow to dismount the collapsing unicycle and so forthonly makeup timing and falling can be taught at the great blue nile it seemed to vinod that there was mainly falling in his absence from bombay vinods taxi enterprise would suffer and the dwarf would feel compelled to return to the city since dr daruwalla was only periodically in india the doctor couldnt always keep track of where vinod was as if trapped in a ceaseless clown item the dwarf was constantly moving what was also constant was farrokhs habit of letting his mind wander to that longago night when he had bashed his nose on deepas pubic bone not that this was the only circus image that the doctors mind would wander to those scratchy sequins on deepas tight singlet not to mention the conflicting scents of deepas earthy aromathese were understandably the most vivid circus images in farrokhs memory and at no time did dr daruwalla daydream so vividly about the circus as he did when anything unpleasant was pending currently farrokh found himself reflecting that for years vinod had steadfastly refused to give the doctor a single vacutainer of blood dr daruwalla had drawn the blood from almost every active dwarf clown in almost every active circus in gujarat and maharashtra but the doctor hadnt drawn a drop from vinod as angry as this fact made him farrokh preferred to reflect on it rather than to concern himself with the more pressing problem which was suddenly at hand dr daruwalla was a coward that mr lal had fallen on the golf course without a net was no reason not to tell inspector dhar the upsetting news quite simply the doctor didnt dare tell dhar it was characteristic of dr daruwalla to tell belabored jokes especially when hed made a disquieting selfdiscovery inspector dhar was characteristically silentcharacteristically depending on which rumors you believed dhar knew that farrokh had been fond of mr lal and that the doctors strident sense of humor was most often engaged when he sought to distract himself from any unhappiness at the duckworth club dhar spent most of lunch listening to dr daruwalla go on and on about this new offense to the parsis how the recent parsi dead had been overlooked by the vultures attending to mr lal on the golf course farrokh found a forced humor in imagining the more fervent zoroastrians whod be up in arms about the interference caused to the vulture community by the dead golfer dr daruwalla thought they should ask mr sethna if he was offended throughout lunch the old steward had managed to look most offended although the source of the particular offense appeared to be the second mrs dogar it was clear that mr sethna disapproved of her whatever her intentions shed deliberately positioned herself at her table so that she could stare at inspector dhar who never once returned her gaze dr daruwalla assumed it was just another case of an immodest woman seeking dhars attentionin vain the doctor knew he wished he could prepare the second mrs dogar for how rejected she would soon feel from the actors obliviousness to her for a while shed even pushed her chair away from the table so that her fetching navel was beautifully framed by the bold colors of her sari her navel was pointed at dhar like a single and very determined eye although mrs dogars advances appeared to go unnoticed by inspector dhar dr daruwalla found it most difficult not to look at her in the doctors view her behavior was shameless for a married middleaged ladydr daruwalla calculated that she was in her early fifties yet farrokh found the second mrs dogar attractive in a threatening kind of way he couldnt locate exactly what it was that attracted him to the woman whose arms were long and unflatteringly muscular and whose lean hard face was handsome and challenging in an almost masculine way to be sure her bosom was shapely if not full and her bottom was high and firmespecially for a woman her ageand there was no question that her long waist and aforementioned navel were enhancing contributions to the pleasurable impression she made in a sari but she was too tall her shoulders were too pronounced and her hands appeared absurdly large and restless she picked up her silverware and toyed with it as if she were a bored child furthermore farrokh had caught a glimpse of mrs dogars feetactually just one of her feet which was bare she must have kicked her shoes off under her table but all that dr daruwalla saw was a flash of her gnarled foot a thin gold chain hung loosely around her surprisingly thick ankle and a wide gold ring gripped one of her clawlike toes perhaps what attracted the doctor to mrs dogar was how she reminded him of someone else but he couldnt think of who it might be a longago movie star he suspected then as a doctor whose patients were children he realized that he might have known the new mrs dogar as a child why this would make the woman attractive to him was yet another exasperating unknown moreover the second mrs dogar seemed not more than six or seven years younger than dr daruwalla virtually theyd been children together dhar caught the doctor by surprise when he said if you could see yourself looking at that woman farrokh i think youd be embarrassed when he was embarrassed the doctor had an annoying habit of abruptly changing the subject and you you should have seen yourself dr daruwalla said to inspector dhar you looked like a bloody police inspectori mean you looked like the real bloody thing it irritated dhar when dr daruwalla spoke such absurdly unnatural english it wasnt even the english with a singsong hindi lilt which was also unnatural for dr daruwalla this was worse it was something wholly fakethe affected british flavor of that particularly indian english the inflections of which were common among young college graduates working as foodandbeverage consultants at the taj or as production managers for britannia biscuits dhar knew that this unsuitable accent was farrokhs selfconsciousness talkinghe was so out of it in bombay quietly but in accentless english inspector dhar spoke to his excited companion which rumor about me are we encouraging today should i shout at you in hindi or is this a good day for english as a second language dhars sardonic tone and expression hurt dr daruwalla notwithstanding that these mannerisms were trademarks of the fictional character dr daruwalla had created and that all of bombay had come to loathe although the secret screenwriter had grown morally uncertain of his creation this doubt was not discernible in the unreserved fondness that the doctor felt for the younger man in public or in private it was dr daruwallas love for dhar that showed the taunting quality of dhars remarks not to mention the sting of dhars delivery wounded dr daruwalla even so he regarded the slightly spoiled handsomeness of the actor with great tenderness dhar allowed his sneer to soften into a smile with an affection that alarmed the nearest and everobservant waiterthe same poor fellow whose daily course had coincided with the shitting crow and with the troublesome tureen and ladlethe doctor reached out and clasped the younger mans hand in plain english dr daruwalla whispered im really just so sorryi mean i feel so sorry for you my dear boy he said dont inspector dhar whispered back his smile faded and his sneer returned he freed his hand from the elder mans grip tell him now dr daruwalla told himself but he didnt darehe didnt know where to begin they were sitting quietly with their tea and some sweets when the real policeman approached their table theyd already been interrogated by the duty officer from the tardeo police station an inspector somebodynot very impressive the inspector had arrived with a team of subinspectors and constables in two jeepshardly necessary for a golfing death dr daruwalla had felt the tardeo inspector had been unctuous but condescending to inspector dhar and servile to farrokh i am hoping you are excusing me doctor the duty officer had begun his english was a strain i am being most sorry i am taking your time saar the inspector added to inspector dhar dhar responded in hindi you are not examining the body doctor the policeman asked he persisted with his english certainly not dr daruwalla replied you are never touching the body saar the duty officer asked the famous actor i are never touching it dhar answered in englishin a flawless imitation of the policemans hindi accent upon departing the duty officers heavy brogues had scraped a little too loudly on the stone floor of the duckworth clubs dining room thus had the policemans exit drawn mr sethnas predictable disapproval doubtless the old steward had also disapproved of the condition of the duty officers uniform his khaki shirt was soiled by the thali the inspector must have encountered for luncha generous portion of dhal was slopped on his breast pocket and a brightly colored stain the obvious orangeyellow of turmeric lit up the messy policemans drab collar but the second policeman who now approached their table in the ladies garden was no mere inspector this man was of a higher rankand of a noticeably elevated neatness at the very least he looked like a deputy commissioner from farrokhs researchfor the inspector dhar screenplays were scrupulously researched if not aesthetically pleasingthe screenwriter was certain that they were about to be confronted by a deputy commissioner from crime branch headquarters at crawford market all this for golf whispered inspector dhar but not so loudly that the approaching detective could hear him not a wise choice of people to offend as the most recent inspector dhar movie had pointed out the official salary of a bombay police inspector is only to rupees a monthroughly dollars in order to secure a more lucrative posting in an area of heavy crime an inspector would need to bribe an administrative officer for a payment in the vicinity of to rupees but generally for less than dollars an inspector might secure a posting that would earn him from to rupees a year usually not more than dollars one issue posed by the new inspector dhar movie concerned just how an inspector making only rupees a month could get his hands on the rupees that were necessary for the bribe in the movie an especially hypocritical and corrupt police inspector accomplishes this by doubling as a pimp and a landlord for a eunuchtransvestite brothel on falkland road in the pinched smile of the second policeman who approached dr daruwalla and inspector dhar at their table there could be discerned the unanimous outrage of the bombay police force the prostitute community was no less offended the prostitutes had greater cause for anger the most recent movie inspector dhar and the cagegirl killer seemed to be responsible for putting the lowliest of bombays prostitutesthe socalled cage girlsin particular peril because of the movie about a serial killer who murders cage girls and draws an inappropriately mirthful elephant on their naked bellies a real murderer appeared to have stolen the idea now real prostitutes were being killed and decorated in this cartoonish fashion the actual murders were unsolved in the redlight district on falkland road and grant roadand throughout the multitude of brothels in the many lanes of kamathipurathe hardworking whores had expressed a real desire to kill inspector dhar the feeling for vengeance toward dhar was especially strong among the eunuchtransvestite prostitutes in the movie a eunuchtransvestite prostitute turns out to be the serial cartoonist and killer this was offensive to eunuchtransvestites for by no means were all of them prostitutesnor were they ever known to be serial killers they are an accepted third gender in india they are called hijrasan urdu word of masculine gender meaning hermaphrodite but hijras are not born hermaphrodites they are emasculatedhence eunuch is the truer word for them they are also a cult devotees of the mother goddess bahuchara mata they achieve their powerseither to bless or to curseby being neither male nor female traditionally hijras earn their living by begging they also perform songs and dances at weddings and festivalsmost of all they give their blessings at births of male infants especially and hijras dress as womenhence the term eunuchtransvestite comes closest to what they are the mannerisms of hijras are ultrafeminine but coarse they flirt outrageously and they display themselves with sexually overt gesturesinappropriate for women in india beyond their castration and their female dress they do little to otherwise feminize themselves most hijras eschew the use of estrogens and some of them pluck their facial hair so indifferently its not uncommon to see them with several days growth of beard should hijras find themselves abused or harassed or should they encounter those indians whove been seduced by western values and who therefore dont believe in the hijras sacred powers to bless and curse hijras will be so bold as to lift their dresses and rudely expose their mutilated genitals dr daruwalla in creating his screenplay for inspector dhar and the cagegirl killer never intended to offend the hijrasthere are more than in bombay alone but as a surgeon farrokh found their method of emasculation truly barbarous both castration and sexchange operations are illegal in india but a hijras operationthey use the english wordis performed by other hijras the patient stares at a portrait of the mother goddess bahuchara mata he is advised to bite his own hair for theres no anesthetic although the patient is sedated with alcohol or opium the surgeon who is not a surgeon ties a string around the penis and the testicles in order to get a clean cutfor it is with one cut that both the testicles and the penis are removed the patient is allowed to bleed freely its believed that maleness is a kind of poison purged by bleeding no stitches are made the large raw area is cauterized with hot oil as the wound begins to heal the urethra is kept open by repeated probing the resultant puckered scar resembles a vagina hijras are no mere crossdressers their contempt for simple transvestites whose male parts are intact is profound these fake hijras are called zenanas every world has its hierarchy within the prostitute community hijras command a higher price than real women but it was unclear to dr daruwalla why this was so there was considerable debate as to whether hijra prostitutes were homosexuals although it was certain that many of their male customers used them in that way and among hijra teenagers even before their emasculation studies indicated frequent homosexual activity but farrokh suspected that many indian men favored the hijra prostitutes because the hijras were more like women than women they were certainly bolder than any indian womanand with their almostavagina who knew what they could imitate if hijras themselves were homosexually oriented why would they emasculate themselves it seemed probable to the doctor that although there were many customers in the hijra brothels who were homosexuals not every customer went there for anal intercourse whatever one thought or said about hijras they were a third genderthey were simply or not so simply another sex what was also true was that in bombay fewer and fewer hijras were able to support themselves by conferring blessings or by begging more and more of them were becoming prostitutes but why had farrokh chosen a hijra to be the serial killer and cartoonist in the most recent inspector dhar movie now that a real killer was imitating the behavior of the fictional characterthe police would say only that the real killers drawing was an obvious variation on the movie themedr daruwalla had really gotten inspector dhar in trouble this particular film had inspired something worse than hatred for the hijra prostitutes not only approved of killing dharthey wanted to maim him first they want to cut off your cock and balls dear boy farrokh had warned his favorite young man you must be careful how you get around town with a sarcasm that was consistent with his famous role dhar had replied in his most deadpan manner youre telling me it was something he said at least once in all his movies in contrast to the lurid agitation caused by the most recent inspector dhar movie the appearance of a real policeman among the proper duckworthians seemed dull surely the hijra prostitutes hadnt murdered mr lal thered been no indication that the body had been sexually mutilated nor was there a possibility that even a demented hijra could have mistaken the old man for inspector dhar dhar never played golf a real detective at work detective patel as dr daruwalla had guessed was a deputy commissioner of policedcp patel officially the detective was from crime branch headquarters at crawford marketnot from the nearby tardeo police station as farrokh had also correctly surmisedbecause certain evidence discovered during the examination of mr lals body had elevated the old golfers death to a category of interest that was special to the deputy commissioner what such a category of interest could be wasnt immediately clear to dr daruwalla or to inspector dhar nor was deputy commissioner patel inclined to clarify the matter promptly you must forgive me doctorplease do excuse me mr dhar the detective said he was in his forties a pleasantlooking man whose formerly delicate sharpboned face had slightly given way to his jowls his alert eyes and the deliberate cadence of the deputy commissioners speech indicated that he was a careful man which one of you was the very first to find the body the detective asked dr daruwalla could rarely resist making a joke i believe the very first to find the body was a vulture the doctor said oh quite so said the deputy commissioner smiling tolerantly then detective patel sat down uninvited at their tablein the chair nearer inspector dhar after the vultures the policeman said to the actor i believe you were the next to find the body i didnt move it or even touch it dhar said anticipating the question it was a question he usually askedin his movies oh very good thank you said dcp patel turning his attention to dr daruwalla and you most naturally examined the body doctor he asked i most naturally did not examine it dr daruwalla replied im an orthopedist not a pathologist i merely observed that mr lal was dead oh quite so patel said but did you give any thought to the cause of death golf said dr daruwalla hed never played the game but he detested it at a distance dhar smiled in mr lals case the doctor continued i suppose you might say he was killed by an excessive desire to improve he most probably had high blood pressure tooa man his age shouldnt repeatedly lose his temper in the hot sun but our weather is really quite cool the deputy commissioner said as if hed been thinking about it for an extended time inspector dhar said the body didnt smell the vultures stank but not the body detective patel appeared to be surprised and favorably impressed by this report but all he said was precisely dr daruwalla spoke with impatience my dear deputy commissioner why dont you begin by telling us what you know oh thats absolutely not our way the deputy commissioner cordially replied is it he asked inspector dhar no it isnt dhar agreed just when do you estimate the time of death he asked the detective oh what a very good question patel remarked we estimate this morningnot even two hours before you found the body dr daruwalla considered this while mr bannerjee had been searching the clubhouse for his opponent and old friend mr lal had strolled to the ninth green and the bougainvillea beyond once more to practice a good escape from his nemesis of the day before mr lal had not been late for his appointed game if anything poor mr lal had been a little too earlyat least too eager but there wouldnt have been vultures so soon dr daruwalla said there would have been no scent not unless there was quite a lot of blood or an open wound and in this sun inspector dhar said hed learned much from his movies even though they were very bad movies even dcp patel was beginning to appreciate that quite so the detective said there was quite a lot of blood there was a lot of blood by the time we found him said dr daruwalla who still didnt understand especially around his eyes and mouthi just assumed that the vultures had begun vultures start pecking where theres already blood and at the naturally wet places said detective patel his english was unusually good for a policeman even for a deputy commissioner dr daruwalla thought the doctor was sensitive about his hindi he was aware that dhar spoke the language more comfortably than he did this was a slight embarrassment for dr daruwalla who wrote all of dhars movie dialogue and his voiceover in english the translation into hindi was done by dhar those phrases that particularly appealed to himthere werent manythe actor left in english and here was a notsocommon policeman indulging in the oneupmanship of speaking english to the renowned canadian it was what dr daruwalla called the canadian treatmentwhen a bombayite wouldnt even try to speak hindi or marathi to him although almost everyone spoke english at the duckworth club farrokh was thinking of something witty to say to detective patel in hindi but dhar in his accentless english spoke first only then did the doctor realize that dhar had not once used his showbusiness hindi accent with the deputy commissioner there was quite a lot of blood by one ear the actor said as if hed never stopped wondering about it very goodthere absolutely was said the encouraging detective mr lal was struck behind one ear and also once in the templeprobably after he fell struck by what dr daruwalla asked by what we knowit was his putter said detective patel by whom we dont know in the year history of the duckworth sports clubthrough all the perils of independence and those many diverting occasions that could have led to violence for example those wild times when the inflammatory lady duckworth bared her breaststhere had never been a murder dr daruwalla thought of how he would phrase this news to the membership committee it was characteristic of farrokh not to consider his esteemed late father as the actual first murder victim in the year history of duckworthians in bombay the chief reason for this oversight was that farrokh tried very hard not to think about his fathers murder at all but a secondary reason was surely that the doctor didnt want his fathers violent death to cloud his otherwise sunny feelings for the duckworth club which has already been described as the only place other than the circus where dr daruwalla felt at home besides dr daruwallas father wasnt murdered at the duckworth club the car that he was driving exploded in tardeo not in mahalaxmi although these are neighboring districts but it was generally admitted even among duckworthians that the car bomb was probably installed while the senior daruwallas car was parked in the duckworth club parking lot duckworthians were quick to point out that the only other person who was killed had no relationship to the club the poor woman wasnt even an employee she was a construction worker and she was said to be carrying a straw basket full of rocks on her head when the flying rightfront fender of the senior daruwallas car decapitated her but this was old news the first duckworthian to be murdered on the actual property of the duckworth club was mr lal mr lal explained detective patel was engaged in swinging what i believe they call a mashie or is it a wedgiewhat do they call the club you hit a chip shot with neither dr daruwalla nor inspector dhar was a golfer a mashie or a wedgie sounded close enough to the real and stupid thing to them well it doesnt matter the detective said mr lal was holding one club when he was struck from behind with anotherhis own putter we found it and his golf bag in the bougainvillea inspector dhar had assumed a familiar film pose or else he was merely thinking he lifted his face as his fingers lightly stroked his chin which enhanced his sneer what he said was something that dr daruwalla and deputy commissioner patel had heard him say many times before he said it in every movie forgive me for sounding most theoretical dhar said this favorite bit of dialogue was of that kind which dhar preferred to deliver in english although hed delivered the line on more than one occasion in hindi too it seems dhar said that the killer didnt care especially who his victim was mr lal was not scheduled to meet anyone in the bougainvillea at the ninth green it was an accident that he was therethe killer couldnt have known very good said dcp patel please go on since the killer didnt seem to care who he killed inspector dhar said perhaps it was intended only that the victim be one of us do you mean one of the members cried dr daruwalla do you mean a duckworthian its just a theory said inspector dhar again this was an echo it was something he said in every movie there is some evidence to support your theory mr dhar detective patel said almost casually the deputy commissioner removed his sunglasses from the breast pocket of his crisp white shirt which showed not a trace of evidence of his latest meal he probed deeper into the pocket and extracted a folded square of plastic wrapping large enough to cover a wedge of tomato or a slice of onion from the plastic he unwrapped a tworupee note that had previously been rolled into a typewriter for typed on the serialnumber side of the bill in capital letters was this warning more members die if dhar remains a member forgive me mr dhar if i ask you the obvious said detective patel yes i have enemies dhar said without waiting for the question yes there are people whod like to kill me but everyone would like to kill him cried dr daruwalla then he touched the younger mans hand sorry he added deputy commissioner patel returned the tworupee note to his pocket as he put on his sunglasses the detectives pencilthin mustache suggested to dr daruwalla a punctiliousness in shaving that the doctor had abandoned in his twenties such a mustache etched both below the nose and above the lip requires a younger mans steady hand at his age the deputy commissioner must have had to prop his elbow fast against the mirror for shaving of this kind could only be accomplished by removing the razor blade from the razor and holding the blade just so a timeconsuming vanity for a man in his forties farrokh imagined or maybe someone else shaved the deputy commissionerpossibly a younger woman with an untrembling hand in summary the detective was saying to dhar i dont suppose you know who all your enemies are he didnt wait for an answer i suppose we could start with all the prostitutesnot just the hijrasand most policemen i would start with the hijras farrokh broke in he was thinking like a screenwriter again i wouldnt said detective patel what do the hijras care if dhar is or isnt a member of this club what they want is his penis and his testicles youre telling me said inspector dhar i very much doubt that the murderer is a member of this club said dr daruwalla dont rule that out dhar said i wont said detective patel he gave both dr daruwalla and inspector dhar his card if you call me he said to dhar you better call me at homei wouldnt leave any messages at crime branch headquarters you know all about how we policemen cant be trusted yes the actor said i know excuse me detective patel said dr daruwalla where did you find the tworupee note it was folded in mr lals mouth the detective said when the deputy commissioner had departed the two friends sat listening to the lateafternoon sounds they were so absorbed in their listening that they didnt notice the prolonged departure of the second mrs dogar she left her table then she stopped to look over her shoulder at the unresponsive inspector dhar then she walked only a little farther before she stopped and looked again then she looked again watching her mr sethna concluded that she was insane mr sethna observed every stage of the second mrs dogars most complicated exit from the ladies garden and the dining room but inspector dhar didnt appear to see the woman at all it interested the old steward that mrs dogar had stared so exclusively at dhar not once had her gaze shifted to dr daruwalla and never to the policemanbut then detective patel had kept his back to her mr sethna also watched the deputy commissioner make a phone call from the booth in the foyer the detective was momentarily distracted by mrs dogars agitated condition as the woman marched to the driveway and ordered the parkinglot attendant to fetch her car the policeman appeared to make note of her attractiveness her haste and her expression of something like rage perhaps the deputy commissioner was considering whether or not this woman looked like someone whod recently clubbed an old man to death in truth thought mr sethna the second mrs dogar looked as if she wanted to murder someone but detective patel paid only passing attention to mrs dogar he seemed more interested in his phone call the apparent topic of conversation was so domestic that it surpassed even the interest of mr sethna who eavesdropped only long enough to assure himself that dcp patel was not engaged in police business mr sethna was certain that the policeman was talking to his wife no sweetie said the detective who then listened patiently to the receiver before he said no i would have told you sweetie then he listened again yes of course i promise sweetie he finally said for a while the deputy commissioner shut his eyes while he listened to the receiver in observing him mr sethna felt extremely selfsatisfied that hed never married but i havent dismissed your theories detective patel suddenly said into the phone no of course im not angry he added with resignation im sorry if i sounded angry sweetie not even as veteran a snoop as mr sethna could stand another word he decided to permit the policeman to continue his conversation in privacy it was only a mild surprise to mr sethna that dcp patel spoke english to his own wife the old steward concluded that this was why the detectives english was above averagepractice but at what a demeaning cost mr sethna returned to that part of the dining room nearest the ladies garden and to his lengthy observation of dr daruwalla and inspector dhar they were still absorbed in the lateafternoon sounds they werent much fun to observe but at least they werent married to each other the tennis balls were back in action and someone was snoring in the reading room the busboys making their typical clatter had cleared every dining table but the table where the doctor and the actor sat with their cold tea detective patel had polished off all the sweets the sounds of the duckworth club spoke distinctly for themselves the sharp shuffling of a fresh deck of cards the crisp contact of the snooker balls the steady sweeping out of the dance hallit was swept at the same time every afternoon although there were rarely dances on weeknights there was also a ceaseless insanity to the patter and squeak of the shoes on the polished hardwood of the badminton court compared to the frenzy of this activity the dull whacking of the shuttlecock sounded like someone killing flies dr daruwalla believed that this wasnt a good moment to give inspector dhar more bad news the murder and the unusual death threat were quite enough for one afternoon perhaps you should come home for supper dr daruwalla said to his friend yes id like that farrokh dhar said normally he might have said something snide about dr daruwallas use of the word supper dhar disliked too loose a use of the word in the actors fussy opinion the word should be reserved for either a light meal in the early evening or for an afterthetheater repast in dhars opinion north americans tended to use the word as if it were interchangeable with dinner farrokh felt that supper was interchangeable with dinner there was something fatherly in his voice to dhar when dr daruwalla adopted a critical tone he said to the actor its quite out of character for you to sound off in such accentless english to a total stranger policemen arent exactly strangers to me dhar said they talk to each other but they never talk to the press oh i forgot you knew everything about police business farrokh said sarcastically but inspector dhar was back in character he was good at keeping quiet dr daruwalla regretted what hed said hed wanted to say oh dear boy you may not be the hero of this story now he wanted to say dear boy there are people who love youi love you you surely must know i do but instead dr daruwalla said as guest chairman of the membership committee i feel i must inform the committeemen of this threat to the other members well vote on it but i feel there will be strong opinion that the other members should know of course they should know said inspector dhar and i should not remain a member he said it was unthinkable to dr daruwalla that an extortionist and a murderer could so swiftly and concretely disrupt the most cherished aspect of the character of the duckworth club which in his view was a deep almost remote sense of privacy as if duckworthians were afforded the luxury of not actually living in bombay dear boy said the doctor what will you do dhars answer shouldnt have surprised dr daruwalla as forcefully as it did the doctor had heard the response many times in every inspector dhar movie after all farrokh had written the response what will i do dhar asked himself aloud find out who it is and get them dont speak to me in character dr daruwalla said sharply youre not in a movie now im always in a movie dhar snapped i was born in a movie then i was almost immediately put into another movie wasnt i since dr daruwalla and his wife thought they were the only people in bombay who knew exactly where the younger man had come from and everything about who he was it was the doctors turn to keep quiet in our hearts dr daruwalla thought there must abide some pity for those people who have always felt themselves to be separate from even their most familiar surroundings those people who either are foreigners or who suffer a singular point of view that makes them feel as if theyre foreignerseven in their native lands in our hearts farrokh knew there also abides a certain suspicion that such people need to feel set apart from their society but people who initiate their loneliness are no less lonely than those who are suddenly surprised by loneliness nor are they undeserving of our pitydr daruwalla felt certain of that however the doctor was unsure if hed been thinking of dhar or of himself then farrokh realized he was alone at the table dhar had departed as eerily as hed arrived the glint of mr sethnas silver serving tray caught dr daruwallas eye reminding him of that shiny something which the crow had held so briefly in its beak the old steward reacted to dr daruwallas recognition as if summoned ill have a kingfisher please the doctor said how the doctors mind will wander the lateafternoon light cast longer and longer shadows in the ladies garden and dr daruwalla gloomily observed that the bright pink of the bougainvillea had turned a darker shade it seemed to him that the flowers had a bloodred hue although this was an exaggerationquite characteristic of the creator of inspector dhar in reality the bougainvillea was as pink and as white as before later mr sethna grew alarmed that the doctor hadnt touched his favorite beer is there something wrong the old steward asked his long finger indicating the kingfisher lager no noits not the beer farrokh said he took a swallow that gave him little comfort the beer is fine he said old mr sethna nodded as if he knew everything that was troubling dr daruwalla mr sethna presumed to know such things routinely i know i know muttered the old parsi the old days are goneits not like the old days insipid truths were an area of mr sethnas expertise that dr daruwalla found most irritating the next thing you know farrokh thought the tedious old fool will tell me that im not my esteemed late father truly the steward seemed on the verge of making another observation when an unpleasant sound came from the dining room it reached mr sethna and dr daruwalla in the ladies garden with the crass attentiongetting quality of a man cracking his knuckles mr sethna went to investigate without moving from his chair farrokh already knew what was making the sound it was the ceiling fan the one the crow had landed on and used as a shitting platform perhaps the crow had bent the blade of the fan or else the bird had knocked a screw loose maybe the fan was operated by ball bearings running in a groove and one of these was out of position or if there was a ballandsocket joint it needed grease the ceiling fan appeared to catch on something it clicked as it turned it faltered it almost stopped but it kept turning with each revolution there was a snapping sound as if the mechanism were about to grind to a halt mr sethna stood under the fan staring stupidly up at it he probably doesnt remember the shitting crow dr daruwalla thought the doctor was readying himself to take charge of the situation when the unpleasant noise simply stopped the ceiling fan turned freely as before mr sethna looked all around as if he werent sure how hed arrived at this spot in the dining room then the stewards gaze fixed upon the ladies garden where farrokh was still sitting hes not the man his father was the old parsi thought the old days the bully dr lowji daruwalla took a personal interest in the crippling conditions affecting children as a child hed developed tuberculosis of the spine although he recovered sufficiently to become indias most famous pioneer in orthopedic surgery he always said it was his own experience with spinal deformitythe fatigue and the pain imposed on himthat made his commitment to the care of cripples so steadfast and longenduring a personal injustice is stronger motivation than any instinct for philanthropy lowji said he tended to speak in statements as an adult he would forever be recognized by the telltale gibbousness of potts disease all his life lowji was as humpbacked as a small upright camel is it any wonder that his son farrokh felt inferior to such a commitment he would enter his fathers field but only as a follower he would continue to pay his respects to india but hed always feel he was a mere visitor education and travel can be humbling the younger dr daruwalla took naturally to feelings of intellectual inferiority possibly farrokh too simplistically attributed his alienation to the one conviction in his life that was as paralyzing as his conversion to christianity that he was utterly without a sense of place that he was a man without a country that there was nowhere he could go where he felt he belongedexcept the circus and the duckworth club but what can be said about a man who keeps his needs and his obsessions largely to himself when a man expresses what hes afraid of his fears and longings undergo revision in the telling and retellingfriends and family have their own ways of altering the materialand soon the socalled fears and longings become almost comfortable with overuse but dr daruwalla held his feelings inside himself not even his wife knew how out of it the doctor felt in bombayand how could she if he wouldnt tell her since julia was viennese however little dr daruwalla knew about india he knew more than she did and at home in toronto farrokh allowed julia to be the authority she was the boss there this was an easy privilege for the doctor to extend to his wife because she believed that he was in charge in bombay for so many years now hed got away with this of course his wife knew about the screenplaysbut only that he wrote them not what he truly felt about them farrokh was careful to speak lightly of them to julia he was quite good at mocking them after all they were a joke to everyone elseit was easy for farrokh to convince his wife that the inspector dhar movies were just a joke to him more important julia knew how much dhar the dear boy meant to him so what if she had no idea how much the screenplays meant to farrokh too and so these things because they were so deeply concealed were more important to dr daruwalla than they should have been as for farrokhs not belonging surely the same could never be said of his father old lowji liked to complain about india and the nature of his complaints was often puerile his medical colleagues chided him for his intrepid criticism of india it was fortunate for his patients they said that his surgical procedures were more carefuland more accurate but if lowji was offthewall about his own country at least it was his own country farrokh thought a founder of the hospital for crippled children in bombay and the chairman of indias first infantile paralysis commission the senior daruwalla published monographs on polio and various bone diseases that were the best of his day a master surgeon he perfected procedures for the correction of deformities such as clubfoot spinal curvature and wryneck a superb linguist he read the work of little in english of stromeyer in german of guerin and bouvier in french an outspoken atheist lowji daruwalla nevertheless persuaded the jesuits to establish clinics both in bombay and in poona for the study and treatment of scoliosis paralysis due to birth injuries and poliomyelitis it was largely muslim money that he secured to pay for a visiting roentgenologist at the hospital for crippled children it was wealthy hindus he hit on for the research and treatment programs he initiated for arthritis lowji even wrote a sympathy letter to us president franklin d roosevelt an episcopalian mentioning the number of indians who suffered from the presidents condition he received a polite reply and a personal check lowji made a name for himself in the shortlived movement called disaster medicine especially during the demonstrations prior to independence and the bloody rioting before and after the partition to this day volunteer workers in disaster medicine attempt to revive the movement by quoting his muchadvertised advice in order of importance look for dramatic amputations and severe extremity injuries before treating fractures or lacerations best to leave all head injuries to the experts if there are any any experts he meantthere were always head injuries privately he referred to the failed movement as riot medicinesomething india will always be in need of old lowji said he was the first in india to respond to the revolutionary change in thinking about the origin of low back pain for which he said the credit belonged to harvards joseph seaton barr admittedly farrokhs esteemed father was better remembered at the duckworth sports club for his ice treatments of tennis elbow and his habit when drinking of denouncing the waiters for their deplorable posture look at me i have a hump and im still standing up straighter than you in reverence of the great dr lowji daruwalla rigidity of the spine was a habit ferociously maintained by the old parsi steward mr sethna why then did the younger dr daruwalla not revere his late father it wasnt because farrokh was the secondborn son and the youngest of lowjis three children hed never felt slighted farrokhs elder brother jamshed whod led farrokh to vienna and now practiced child psychiatry in zürich had also led farrokh to the idea of a european wife but old lowji never opposed mixed marriagesnot on principle surely and not in the case of jamsheds viennese bride whose younger sister married farrokh julia became old lowjis favorite inlaw he preferred her company even to the london otologist who married farrokhs sisterand lowji daruwalla was an unabashed anglophile after independence lowji admired and clung to whatever englishness endured in india but the source of farrokhs lack of reverence for his famous father wasnt old lowjis englishness either his many years in canada had made a moderate anglophile out of the younger dr daruwalla granted englishness in canada is quite different from in indianot politically tainted always socially acceptable many canadians like the british and that old lowji was outspoken in his loathing for mohandas k gandhi did not upset farrokh in the slightest at dinner parties especially with nonindians in toronto the younger daruwalla was quite pleased at the surprise he could instantly evoke by quoting his late father on the late mahatma he was a bloody charkaspinning loinclothed pandit the senior daruwalla had complained he dragged his religion into his political activismthen he turned his political activism into a religion and the old man was unafraid of expressing his views in indiaand not only in the safety of the duckworth club bloody hindus bloody sikhs bloody muslims he would say and bloody parsis too he would add if the more fervent of the zoroastrian faith pressed him for some display of parsi loyalty bloody catholics he would murmur on those rare occasions when he appeared at st ignatiusonly to attend those dreadful school plays in which his own sons took small parts old lowji declared that dharma was sheer complacencynothing but a justification for nondoing he said that caste and the upholding of untouchability was nothing but the perpetual worship of shitif you worship shit most naturally you must declare it the duty of certain people to take the shit away absurdly lowji presumed he was permitted to make such irreverent utterances because the evidence of his dedication to crippled children was unparalleled he railed that india was without an ideology religion and nationalism are our feeble substitutes for constructive ideas he pronounced meditation is as destructive to the individual as caste for what is it but a way of diminishing the self indians follow groups instead of their own ideas we subscribe to rituals and taboos instead of establishing goals for social changefor the improvement of our society move the bowels before breakfast not after who cares make the woman wear a veil why bother meanwhile we have no rules against filth against chaos in such a sensitive country brashness is frankly stupid in retrospect the younger dr daruwalla realized that his father was a car bomb waiting to happen no onenot even a doctor devoted to crippled childrencan go around saying that karma is the bullshit that keeps india a backward country the idea that ones present life however horrible is the acceptable payment for ones life in the past may fairly be said to be a rationale for doing nothing conducive to selfimprovement but its surely best not to call such a belief bullshit even as a parsi and as a convert to christianityand although farrokh was never a hinduthe younger dr daruwalla saw that his fathers overstatements were unwise but if old lowji was dead set against hindus he was equally offensive in speaking of muslimseveryone should send a muslim a roast pig for christmasand his prescriptions for the church of rome were dire indeed he said that every last catholic should be driven from goa or preferably publicly executed in remembrance of the persecutions and burnings at the stake that they themselves had performed he proposed that the disgusting cruelty depicted on the crucifix shouldnt be allowed in indiahe meant the mere sight of christ on the cross which he called a kind of western pornography furthermore he declared that all protestants were closet calvinistsand that calvin was a closet hindu lowji meant by this that he loathed anything resembling the acceptance of human wretchednessnot to mention a belief in divine predestination which lowji called christian dharma he was fond of quoting martin luther who had said what wrong can there be in telling a downright good lie for a good cause and for the advancement of the christian church by this lowji meant that he believed in free will and in socalled good works and in no damn god at all as for the car bomb there was an old rumor at the duckworth club that it had been the brainchild of a hindumuslimchristian conspiracyperhaps the first cooperative effort of its kindbut the younger dr daruwalla knew that even the parsis who were rarely violent couldnt be ruled out as contributing assassins although old lowji was a parsi he was as mocking of the true believers of the zoroastrian faith as he was of any true believers somehow only mr sethna had escaped his contempt and lowji stood alone in mr sethnas esteem he was the only atheist whod never suffered the zealous stewards undying scorn perhaps it was the hottea incident that bound them together and overcame even their religious differences to the end it was the concept of dharma that lowji could least leave alone if youre born in a latrine its better to die in the latrine than to aspire to a bettersmelling station in life now i ask you is that not nonsense but farrokh felt that his father was crazyor that outside the field of orthopedic surgery the old humpback simply didnt know what he was talking about even beggars aspired to improve didnt they one can imagine how the calm of the duckworth club was often shattered by old lowji declaring to everyoneeven the waiters with bad posturethat caste prejudice was the root of all evil in india although most duckworthians privately shared this view what farrokh most resented about his father was how the contentious old atheist had robbed him of a religion and a country more than intellectually spoiling the concept of a nation for his children because of his unrestrained hatred of nationalism dr lowji daruwalla had driven his children away from bombay for the sake of their education and refinement hed sent his only daughter to london and his two sons to vienna then he had the gall to be disappointed with all three of them for not choosing to live in india immigrants are immigrants all their lives lowji daruwalla had declared it was just another of his pronouncements but this one had a lasting sting austrian interlude farrokh had arrived in austria in july of to prepare for his undergraduate studies at the university of vienna hence he missed independence later he thought hed simply not been at home when it counted thereafter he supposed he was never at home what a time to be an indian in india instead young farrokh daruwalla was acquainting himself with his favorite dessert sachertorte mit schlag and making himself known to the other residents of the pension amerling on the prinz eugene strasse which was in the soviet sector of occupation in those days vienna was divided in four the americans and british grabbed the choicest residential districts and the french took the best shopping areas the russians were realistic they settled themselves in the outlying workingclass precincts where all the industry was and they crouched around the inner city near the embassies and government buildings as for the pension amerling its tall windows with the rustediron flower boxes and yellowing curtains overlooked the war rubble on the prinz eugene strasse and faced the chestnut trees of the belvedere gardens from his thirdstory bedroom window young farrokh could see that the stone wall between the upper and the lower belvedere palace was pockmarked from machinegun fire around the corner on the schwindgasse the russians had taken charge of the bulgarian embassy there was no explanation for the roundtheclock armed guard in the foyer of the polish reading room on the schwindgasse corner of the argentinierstrasse the café schnitzler was emptied periodically so that the soviets could conduct a bomb search sixteen out of districts had communist police chiefs the daruwalla brothers were certain that they were the only parsis in the occupied city if not the only indians to the viennese they didnt look especially indian they werent brown enough farrokh wasnt as fairskinned as jamshed but both brothers reflected their faraway persian ancestry to some austrians they might have looked like iranians or turks to most europeans the daruwalla brothers more closely resembled the immigrants from the middle east than those from india yet if farrokh and jamshed werent as brown as many indians they were browner than most middle easternersbrowner than israelis and egyptians browner than syrians and libyans and the lebanese and so on in vienna young farrokhs first racial mistreatment occurred when a butcher mistook him for a hungarian gypsy on more than one occasion austria being austria farrokh was jeered by drunks in a gasthof they called him a jew of course and before farrokhs arrival jamshed had discovered it was easier to find housing in the russian sector no one really wanted to live there and so the pensions were less discriminatory jamshed had earlier tried to rent an apartment on the mariahilferstrasse but the landlady had refused him on the grounds that he would create unwelcome cooking smells it wasnt until he was in his fifties that dr daruwalla appreciated the irony hed been sent away from home precisely at the time india became its own country he would spend the next eight years in a wardamaged city that was occupied by four foreign powers when he returned to india in september of he just missed the flag day festivities in vienna in october the city celebrated the official end of the occupationaustria was its own country too dr daruwalla wouldnt be on hand for the historic event once more hed moved just ahead of it as the smallest of footnotes the daruwalla brothers were nonetheless among the actual recorders of viennese history their youthful vigor for foreign languages made them useful transcribers of the minutes for the allied council meetings at which they scribbled profusely but were told to remain as silent as cobblestones the british representative had vetoed their promotion to the more soughtafter jobs of interpreters the stated reason being that they were only university students it was racially reassuring that at least the british knew they were indians if only as flies on the wall the daruwalla brothers were witnesses to the many grievances expressed against the methods of occupation conducted in the old city for example both farrokh and jamshed attended the investigations of the notorious benno blum ganga cigarettesmuggling ring and the alleged black marketeers of the muchdesired nylon stocking for the privilege of operating unmolested in the soviet sector the benno blum gang eliminated political undesirables naturally the russians denied this but farrokh and jamshed were never molested by the alleged cohorts of benno blum who himself was never apprehended or even identified and the soviets in whose sector the two brothers lived for years never once bothered them at the allied council meetings young farrokh daruwallas harshest treatment came from a british interpreter farrokh was transcribing the minutes for a reinvestigation of the anna hellein rape and murder case when he discovered an error in translation he quickly pointed it out to the interpreter anna hellein was a yearold viennese social worker who was dragged off her train by a russian guard at the steyregg bridge checkpoint on the united statessoviet demarcation line there she was raped and murdered and left on the rails later to be decapitated by a train a viennese witness to all this a local housewife was quoted as saying that she didnt report the incident because she was sure that fräulein hellein was a giraffe excuse me sir young farrokh said to the british interpreter youve made a slight error fräulein hellein was not mistaken for a giraffe thats what the witness said mate the interpreter replied he added i dont care to have my english corrected by a bloody wog it isnt your english that im correcting sir farrokh said its your german its the same word in german mate the british interpreter said the hausfrau called her a bloody giraffe nur umgangssprache farrokh daruwalla said its merely colloquial speech giraffe is berliner slangfor a prostitute the witness mistook fräulein hellein for a whore farrokh was almost relieved that his assailant was british and that the term wogat least the correct racial slurwas used doubtless it would have unnerved him to have been mistaken for a hungarian gypsy twice and by his bold interference young daruwalla had saved the allied council from committing an embarrassing error it was therefore never entered into the official minutes that a witness to fräulein helleins rape and murder and decapitation had mistaken the victim for a giraffe on top of everything else that the deceased had suffered she was spared this further outrage but when young farrokh daruwalla returned to india in the fall of this episode was as much a part of history as he felt himself to be he didnt come home a confident young man granted he had not spent the entire eight years outside of india but a brief visit in the middle of his undergraduate studies in the summer of hardly prepared him for the confusion he would encounter six years laterwhen he came home to an india that would forever make him feel like a foreigner he was used to feeling like a foreigner vienna had prepared him for that and his several pleasant visits to london to see his sister were marred by his one trip to london that coincided with his fathers invitation to address the royal college of surgeonsa great honor it was the obsession of indians and of former british colonies in general to become fellows of the royal college of surgeonsold lowji was extremely proud of his f as it was called the f would mean less to the younger dr daruwalla who would also become an frcsof canada but on the occasion of farrokh attending his fathers lecture in london old lowji chose to pay tribute to the american founder of the british orthopedic associationthe celebrated dr robert bayley osgood one of the few americans to captivate this british institutionand it was during lowjis speech which would go on to emphasize the problems of infantile paralysis in india that young farrokh overheard a most disparaging remark it would keep him from ever considering a life in london what monkeys they are said a florid orthopedist to a fellow brit they are the most presumptuous imitators they observe us for all of five minutes then they think they can do it too young farrokh sat paralyzed in a room of men fascinated by the diseases of bones and joints he couldnt move he couldnt speak this wasnt a simple matter of mistaking a prostitute for a giraffe his own medical studies had just begun he wasnt sure if he understood what the it referred to farrokh was so unsure of himself he first supposed that the it was something medicalsome actual knowledgebut before his fathers speech had ended farrokh understood it was only englishness it was merely being them even in a gathering of what his father boastfully called fellow professionals the it was all theyd noticedsimply what of their englishness had been successfully or unsuccessfully copied and for the remainder of old lowjis exploration of infantile paralysis young farrokh was ashamed that he saw his ambitious father as the british saw him a smug ape whod succeeded in imitating them it was the first time farrokh realized how it was possible to love englishness and yet loathe the british and so before he ruled out india as a country where he could live hed already ruled out england it was the summer of during an athome stay in bombay when young farrokh daruwalla suffered the experience that would for him rule out living in the united states too it was the same summer that another of his fathers more embarrassing weaknesses was revealed to him farrokh discounted the continuous discomfort of his fathers spinal deformity this was not in the category of a weakness of any kindon the contrary lowjis hump was a source of inspiration but now in addition to lowjis overstatements of a political and religious nature the senior daruwalla unveiled a taste for romantic movies farrokh was already familiar with his fathers unbridled passion for waterloo bridge tears sprang to his fathers eyes at the mere mention of vivien leigh and no concept in storytelling struck old lowji with such tragic force as those twists of fate that could cause a woman both good and pure to fall to the lowly rank of prostitute but in the summer of young farrokh was quite unprepared to find his father so infatuated with the commonplace hysteria of a filminprogress to make matters worse it was a hollywood filmof no special distinction beyond that endless capacity for compromise which was the principal gift of the films participants farrokh was appalled to witness his fathers slavishness before everyone who was even marginally involved one shouldnt be surprised that lowji was vulnerable to movie people or that the presumed glamour of postwar hollywood was magnified by its considerable distance from bombay these particular lowlifes whod invaded maharashtra for the purpose of moviemaking had sizably damaged reputationseven in hollywood where shame is seldom suffered for longbut how could the senior daruwalla have known this like many physicians the world over lowji imagined that he could have been a great writerif medicine hadnt attracted him firstand he further deluded himself that a second career opportunity lay ahead of him perhaps in his retirement he supposed that with more time on his hands it would take no great effort to write a noveland surely less to write a screenplay although the latter assumption is quite true even the effort of a screenplay would prove too great for old lowji it was never necessarily the power of his imagination that gave him great technique and foresight as a surgeon sadly a natural arrogance often attends the ability to heal and cure renowned in bombayeven recognized abroad for his accomplishments in indiadr lowji daruwalla nevertheless craved intimate contact with the socalled creative process in the summer of with his highly principled younger son as a witness the senior daruwalla got what he desired inexplicable hairlessness often when a man of vision and character falls among the unscrupulous cowards of mediocrity there is an intermediary a petty villain in the guise of a matchmakerone skilled in currying favor for small but gratifying gain in this instance she was a malabar hill lady of imposing wealth and only slightly less imposing presence although she wouldnt have categorized herself as a maiden aunt she played this role in the lives of her undeserving nephewsthe two scoundrel sons of her impoverished brother shed also suffered the tragic history of having been jilted by the same man on two different wedding days a condition that prompted dr lowji daruwalla to privately refer to her as the miss havisham of bombaytimes two her name was promila rai and prior to her insidious role of introducing lowji to the movie vermin her communications with the daruwalla family had been merely rude shed once sought the senior daruwallas advice regarding the inexplicable hairlessness of the younger of her loathsome two nephewsan odd boy named rahul rai at the time of the doctors examination which lowji had at first resisted conducting on the grounds that he was an orthopedist rahul was only or the doctor found nothing inexplicable about his hairlessness the absence of body hair wasnt that unusual the lad had bushy eyebrows and a thick head of hair yet miss promila rai found old lowjis analysis lacking well after all youre only a joint doctor she said dismissively to the orthopedists considerable irritation but now rahul rai was or and the hairlessness of his mahogany skin was more apparent farrokh daruwalla who was in the summer of had never liked the boy he was an oily brat of a disquieting sexual ambiguitypossibly influenced by his elder brother subodh a dancer and occasional actor in the emerging hindi film scene subodh was better known for his flamboyant homosexuality than for his theatrical talents for farrokh to return from vienna to find his father on friendly terms with promila rai and her sexually suspect nephewswell one can imagine in his undergraduate years young farrokh had developed intellectual and literary pretensions that were easily offended by the hollywood scum whod ingratiated themselves with his vulnerable albeit famous father quite simply promila rai had wanted her actornephew subodh to have a role in the movie she also had wanted the prepubescent rahul to be employed as a plaything of this court of creativity the hairless boys apparently unformed sexuality made him the little darling of the galifornians they found him an able interpreter and an eager errand boy and what had the hollywood types wanted from promila rai in exchange for making creative use of her nephews they wanted access to a private clubto the duckworth sports club which was highly recommended even in their lowlife circlesand they wanted a doctor someone to look after their ailments in truth it was their terror of all the possible ailments of india that needed looking after for in the beginning there was nothing in the slightest that was ailing them it was a shock to young farrokh to come home to this unlikely degradation of his father his mother was mortified by ms fathers choice of such crude companions and by what she considered to be his fathers shameless manipulation by promila rai by giving this american movie rabble unlimited access to the club old lowji who was chairman of the rules committee had bent a sacred law of the duckworthians previously guests of members were permitted in the club only if they arrived and remained with a member but the senior daruwalla was so infatuated with his newfound friends that hed extended special privileges to them moreover the screenwriter from whom lowji believed he had the most to learn was unwanted on the set this sensitive artist and outcast had become a virtual resident of the duckworth cluband a constant source of bickering between farrokhs parents its often embarrassing to discover the marital cuteness that exists among couples whose social importance is esteemed farrokhs mother meher was renowned for flirting with his father in public because there was nothing coarse in her overtures to her husband meher daruwalla was recognized among duckworthians as an exceptionally devoted wife therefore shed attracted all the more attention at the duckworth club when she stopped flirting with lowji it was plain to everyone that meher was feuding with lowji instead to young farrokhs shame the whole duckworth club was put on edge by this obvious tension in the venerable daruwalla marriage a sizable part of farrokhs summer agenda was to prepare his parents for the romance that was developing for their two sons with the fabulous zilk sistersthe vienna woods girls as jamshed called them it struck farrokh that the state of his parents marriage might make an unfavorable climate for a discussion of romance of any kindnot to mention his parents possible reluctance to accept the idea of their only sons marrying viennese roman catholics it was typical of jamsheds successful manipulation of his younger brother that farrokh had been selected to return home for the summer in order to broach this subject farrokh was less intellectually challenging to lowji he was also the baby of the family and therefore he appeared to be loved with the least reservation and farrokhs intentions to follow his father in orthopedics doubtless pleased the old man and made farrokh a more welcome bearer of conceivably unwelcome tidings than jamshed would have been the latters interest in psychiatry which old lowji spoke of as an inexact sciencehe meant in comparison with orthopedic surgeryhad already driven a wedge between the father and his elder son in any case farrokh saw that it would be poor timing for him to introduce the topic of the fräuleins josefine and julia zilk his praise of their loveliness and virtues would have to wait the story of their courageous widowed mother and her efforts to educate her daughters would have to wait too the dreadful american movie was consuming farrokhs helpless parents even the young mans intellectual pursuits failed to capture his fathers attention for example when farrokh admitted that he shared jamsheds passion for freud his father expressed alarm that farrokhs devotion to the more exact science of orthopedic surgery was waning it was certainly the wrong idea to attempt to reassure his father on this point by quoting at length from freuds general remarks on hysterical attacks the concept that the hysterical fit is an equivalent to coitus wasnt welcome information to old lowji furthermore farrokhs father absolutely rejected the notion of the hysterical symptom corresponding to a form of sexual gratification in regard to socalled multiple sexual identificationas in the case of the patient who attempted to rip off her dress with one hand this was said to be her mans hand while at the same time she desperately clutched her dress to her body with her womans handold lowji daruwalla was outraged by the concept is this the result of a european education he cried to attach any meaning whatsoever to what a woman is thinking when she takes off her clothesthis is true madness the senior daruwalla wouldnt listen to a sentence with freuds name in it that his father should reject freud was further evidence to farrokh of the tyrants intellectual rigidity and his oldfashioned beliefs as an intended putdown of freud lowji paraphrased an aphorism of the great canadian physician sir william osler a bedside clinician extraordinaire and a gifted essayist osler was a favorite of farrokhs too it was outrageous of lowji to use sir william to refute freud the old blunderbuss referred to the wellknown osler admonition that warns against studying medicine without textbooksfor this is akin to going to sea without a chart farrokh argued that this was a halfunderstanding of osler and less than half an understanding of freud for hadnt sir william also warned that to study medicine without studying patients was not to go to sea at all freud after all had studied patients but lowji was unbudgeable farrokh was disgusted with his father the young man had left home as a mere yearold at last he was a worldly and wellread far from being a paragon of brilliance and nobility old lowji now looked like a buffoon in a rash moment farrokh gave his father a book to read it was graham greenes the power and the glory a modern novelat least it was modern to lowji it was also a religious novel which was in lowjis case akin to holding the cape before the bull farrokh presented the novel to his father with the added temptation that the book had given considerable offense to the church of rome this was a clever bit of baiting and the old man was especially excited to learn that the book had been denounced by french bishops for reasons lowji never bothered to explain he didnt like the french for reasons he explained entirely too often lowji thought all religions were monsters it was surely idealistic of young farrokh to imagine that he could draw his fierce oldfashioned father into his recently acquired european sensibilitiesespecially by as simple a device as a favorite novel naively farrokh hoped that a shared appreciation of graham greene might lead to a discussion of the enlightened zilk sisters who although roman catholics did not share the consternation caused the church of rome by the power and the glory and this discussion might lead to the matter of who these liberalthinking zilk sisters might be and so on and so forth but old lowji despised the novel he denounced it as morally contradictoryin his own words a big confusion of good and evil in the first place lowji argued the lieutenant who puts the priest to death is portrayed as a man of integritya man of high ideals the priest on the other hand is utterly corrupteda lecher a drunk an absent father to his illegitimate daughter the man should have been put to death the senior daruwalla exclaimed only not necessarily because he was a priest farrokh was bitterly disappointed by this pigheaded reaction to a novel he so loved that hed already read it a halfdozen times he deliberately provoked his father by telling him that his denouncement of the book was remarkably similar to the line of attack taken by the church of rome and so the summer and the monsoon of began stuck in the past here come the characters who comprise the movie vermin the hollywood scum the film slimethe aforementioned unscrupulous cowards of mediocrity fortunately they are minor characters yet so distasteful that their introduction has been delayed as long as possible besides the past has already made an unwelcome intrusion into this narrative the younger dr daruwalla whos no stranger to unwanted and lengthy intrusions from the past has all this time been sitting in the ladies garden of the duckworth club the past has descended upon him with such lugubrious weight that he hasnt touched his kingfisher lager which has grown undrinkably warm the doctor knows he should at least get up from the table and call his wife julia should be told right away about poor mr lal and the threat to their beloved dhar more members die if dhar remains a member farrokh should also forewarn her that dhar is coming home for supper not to mention that the doctor owes his wife some explanation regarding his cowardice she will surely think him a coward for not telling dhar the upsetting newsfor dr daruwalla knows that any day now dhars twin is expected in bombay yet he cant even drink his beer or rise from his chair its as if he were the second bludgeoned victim of the putter that cracked the skull of poor mr lal and all this time mr sethna has been watching him mr sethna is worried about the doctorhes never seen him not finish a kingfisher before the busboys are whispering they must change the tablecloths in the ladies garden the tablecloths for dinner which are a saffron color are quite different from the luncheon tablecloths which are more of a vermillion hue but mr sethna wont allow them to disturb dr daruwalla hes not the man his father was mr sethna knows but mr sethnas loyalty to lowji is unquestionably extended beyond the gravenot only to lowjis children but even to that mysterious fairskinned boy whom mr sethna heard lowji call my grandchild on more than one occasion such is mr sethnas loyalty to the daruwalla name that he wont tolerate the gossip in the kitchen there is for example an elderly cook who swears that this socalled grandchild is the very same allwhite actor who parades before them as inspector dhar although mr sethna privately may believe this he violently maintains that this couldnt be true if the younger dr daruwalla claims that dhar is neither his nephew nor his sonwhich he has claimedthis is good enough for mr sethna he declares emphatically to the kitchen staff and to all the waiters and the busboys too that boy we saw with old lowji was someone else and now a halfdozen busboys glide into the failing light in the ladies garden mr sethna silently directing them with his piercing eyes and with hand signals there are only a few saucers and an ashtray together with the vase of flowers and the warm beer on dr daruwallas table each busboy knows his assignment one takes the ashtray and another removes the tablecloth precisely following the exact second when mr sethna plucks up the neglected beer there are three busboys who between them exchange the vermillion tablecloth for the saffron then the same flower vase and a different ashtray are returned to the table dr daruwalla doesnt notice at first that mr sethna has substituted a cold kingfisher for the warm one its only after theyve departed that dr daruwalla appears to appreciate how the dusk has softened the brightness of both the pink and the white bougainvillea in the ladies garden and how his brimming glass of kingfisher is freshly beaded with condensation the glass itself is so wet and cool it seems to draw his hand the beer is so cold and biting he takes a long grateful swallowand then another and another he drinks until the glass is empty but still he stays at the table in the ladies garden as if hes waiting for someoneeven though he knows his wife is expecting him at home for a while the doctor forgets to refill his glass then he refills it its a ounce bottleentirely too much beer for dwarfs farrokh remembers then a look crosses his face of the kind one hopes will pass quickly but the look remains fixed and distant and as bitter as the aftertaste of the beer mr sethna recognizes this look he knows at once that the past has reclaimed dr daruwalla and by the bitterness of the doctors expression mr sethna thinks he knows which past its those movie people mr sethna knows theyve come back again the vermin learning the movie business the director gordon hathaway would meet his end on the santa monica freeway but in the summer of he was riding the fading success of a privateinvestigator movie perversely it had inflamed his longdormant desire to make what movie people call a quality picture this picture wouldnt be it although the director would manage to shoot the film overcoming considerable adversity the movie would never be released having had his fling with quality hathaway would return with a modest vengeance and more modest success to the socalled pi genre in the s he would make the downward move to television where he awaited the unnoticed conclusion of his career few aspects of gordon hathaways personality were unique he called all actors and actresses by their first names including the ones hed never met which was the case with most of them and he wetly kissed on both cheeks both the men and women he was saying adieu to which included those hed met for only the first or second time he would marry four times in each marriage goatishly siring children who would revile him before they were teenagers in each account gordon would be unsurprisingly cast as the villain while the four respective mothers his exwives emerged as highly compromised yet sainted hathaway said hed had the misfortune to sire only daughters sons he claimed would have taken his sideto quote him at least one out of four fuckin times as for his dress he was a marginal eccentric as he agedand as he more peaceably embraced a directorial career of complete compromisehe grew more outlandish in his attire as if his clothes had become his foremost creative act sometimes he wore a womans blouse open to the waist and he arranged his hair in a long white ponytail which became his trademark in his many films and tv crime dramas there could be found no such identifying features and all the while he decried the suitswhich was his word for the producersthe fuckin threepiece mentalities who hathaway said had a fuckin stranglehold on all the talent in hollywood this was an odd accusation in that gordon hathaway had spent a long and modestly profitable career in close cahoots with these same suits producers in truth loved him but none of these details is original or even memorable in bombay however the first truly distinctive element of gordon hathaways character was brought to light namely he was so frightened of the food in indiaand so hysterically conscious of those diseases that he was certain would destroy his intestinal tractthat he ate nothing but roomservice food which he personally washed in his bathtub the taj mahal hotel was not unused to such habits among the foreign but by this extremely selective diet hathaway had severely constipated himself and suffered from hemorrhoids in addition the hot damp weather of bombay had excited his chronic proneness to fungal infections hathaway stuck cotton balls between his toeshe had the most persistent case of athletes foot that dr lowji daruwalla had ever seenand a fungus as unstoppable as bread mold had invaded his ears old lowji believed that the director was capable of producing his own mushrooms gordon hathaways ears itched to the point of madness and he was so deaf from both the fungus and the fungicidal ear dropsnot to mention the cotton balls that he stuck in his earsthat his communication on the film set was comedic with misunderstanding as for the ear drops they were a solution of gentian violet an indelible purple dye therefore the collars and shoulders of hathaways shirts were dotted with violet stains for the cotton balls frequently fell out of his earsor else hathaway in his frustration at being deaf plucked out the cotton balls himself the director was a born litterer everywhere he went the world was colorfully marked by his violet earcottons sometimes the purple solution streaked hathaways face giving him the appearance of someone whod been deliberately painted he looked like a member of a religious cult or of an unknown tribe gordon hathaways fingertips were similarly stained with gentian violet he was always poking his fingers in his ears but lowji was nevertheless impressed by the fabled artistic temperament of the first and only hollywood director hed ever met the senior daruwalla told meher she told farrokh that it was charming how hathaway had blamed his hemorrhoids and his fungus neither on his bathtub diet nor on the bombay climate instead the director faulted the fuckin stress of the compromising relationship he was compelled to conduct with the films philistine producer a much defamed suit who coincidentally was married to gordons ambitious sister that cunt of misery gordon would often exclaim failing originality in all his cinematic pursuits gordon hathaway was nevertheless rumored to be the first to coin this vulgar phrase fuckin ahead of my time was a way he often spoke of himself in this coarse instance he may have been correct it was a great source of frustration to meher and farrokh to hear lowji defend the grossness of gordon hathaway on grounds of the mans artistic temperament it was never clear if the philistine producers success in exerting certain pressures on gordon was because of gordons desire to please the suit himself or whether the true force of the exertion emanated from gordons sisterthe socalled c of m herself it was never clear who had whom by the balls as gordon put it it was unclear who jerked whose wire as he otherwise put it as an admitted newcomer to the creative process lowji was undeterred by such talk he sought to draw out of gordon hathaway the presumed aesthetic principles that guided the director through the frenzy with which this particular movie was being made even a novice could sense the hectic pace at which the film was being shot even lowjis untested artistic sensibilities could detect the aura of tension with which the screenplay underwent revision every evening in the dining room of the duckworth club i trust my fuckin instinct for storytellin pal gordon hathaway confided to the senior daruwalla who was in such earnest search of a retirement career thats the fuckin key how it shamed farrokh and his poor mother to observe throughout dinner that lowji was taking notes as for the screenwriter whose shared dream of a quality picture was nightly and disastrously changing before his eyes he was an alcoholic whose bar bill at the duckworth club threatened to exceed the daruwalla familys resources it was a tab that pinched even the seemingly bottomless purse of the wellheeled promila rai his name was danny mills and hed started out with a story about a married couple who come to india because the wife is dying of cancer theyd promised themselves that they would go to india one day it was originally titled with the utmost sincerity one day well go to india then gordon hathaway retitled it one day well go to india darling that small change initiated a major revision of the story and sank danny mills all the deeper into his alcoholic gloom it was actually a step up for danny millsto have begun this screenplay from scratch it was if only in the beginning his original story hed started out as the lowliest of studio contract writers his first job at universal was for dollars a week and all he did was tamper with existing scripts danny mills still had more screen credits for additional dialogue than for coscript and his solo screenplay credits there were only two were for flopsutter bombs at the moment he prided himself for being an independent which is to say he was under no studio contract however this was because the studios thought he was unreliable not only for his drinking but for his reputation as a loner danny wasnt content to be a team player and he became especially cantankerous in the cases of those screenplays that had already engaged the creative genius of a halfdozen or more writers although it clearly depressed danny to revise on demand which he was doing as a result of the nightly whims of gordon hathaway it was entirely rare for danny to be working on a story that had at least originated with him for this reason gordon hathaway thought that danny shouldnt complain it wasnt as if danny had contributed a word to the big sleep or even cobra woman and hed had nothing to do with woman of the year or even hot cargo hed written neither rope nor gaslighthe hadnt added so much as a comma to son of dracula or taken one away from frisco saland although for a while hed been identified as the uncredited screenwriter for when strangers marry this proved to be false in hollywood he simply hadnt been playing in the big leagues the general feeling was that additional dialogue was the very zenith of his ability and so he came to bombay with more experience in fixing other peoples messes than with creating his own doubtless it hurt danny that gordon hathaway didnt refer to him as the writer at all gordon called danny mills the fixer but in truth there was more that needed fixing in one day well go to india darling after hathaway started changing it danny had envisioned the movie as a love story with a twist the twist was the wife dying in the original screenplay the couplein her dying dayssuccumbs to the fakery of a snake guru they are rescued from this charlatan and his gang of demonic snakeworshipers by a true guru instead of pretending to cure the wife the true guru teaches her how to die with dignity according to the philistine producer or else to his wifegordon hathaways interfering c of m sisterthis last part was lacking in both action and suspense despite how happy the wife is she still fuckin dies doesnt she gordon said therefore against the slightly better instincts of danny mills gordon hathaway altered the story gordon believed that the snake guru wasnt villainous enough hence the snakeworshipers were revised the snake guru actually abducts the wife from the taj and keeps her a prisoner in his harem of drugged women while he instructs them in a method of meditation that concludes with having sexeither with the snakes or with him this is an ashram of evil surely the distraught husband in the company of a jesuit missionarya nonetoosubtle replacement for the true gurutracks the wife down and saves her from a fate presumed worse than her anticipated death by cancer it is christianity that the dying wife embraces at the end andno surpriseshe doesnt die after all gordon hathaway explained it to a surprised lowji daruwalla the cancer just sort of goes awayit just fuckin dries up and goes away that happens sometimes doesnt it well it doesnt exactly dry up but there are cases of remission the senior dr daruwalla answered uncertainly while farrokh and meher suffered enormous embarrassment for him whats that gordon hathaway asked he knew what a remission was he just hadnt heard the doctor because his ears were crammed full of fungus and gentian violet and cotton balls yes sometimes a cancer can just sort of go away old lowji shouted yeah thats what i thoughti knew that gordon hathaway said in his embarrassment for his father farrokh sought to turn the conversation toward india itself surely the gravity of the partition and independencewhen a million hindus and muslims were killed and million became refugeesinterested the foreigners a little listen kid gordon hathaway said when youre makin a fuckin movie nothin else interests you there was hearty consent to this at the dinner table farrokh felt that even the silence of his usually opinionated father served to rebuke him only danny mills appeared to be interested in the subject of local color danny also appeared to be drunk although danny mills considered religion and politics as tedious forms of local color danny was nevertheless disappointed that one day well go to india darling had very little to do with india danny had already suggested that the climate of religious violence in the days of the partition might at least make a brief appearance in the background of the story politics is just fuckin exposition gordon hathaway had said dismissing the idea id end up cutting the shit out of it later in response to the present debate between the director and farrokh danny mills once more expressed his desire that the movie reflect at least a hint of muslimhindu tensions but gordon hathaway bluntly challenged farrokh to tell him just one sore point between muslims and hindus that wouldnt be boring on film and since this was the year that hindus had snuck into the mosque of babar with idols of their godprince rama farrokh imagined that he knew a good story the hindus had claimed that the site of the mosque was the birthplace of rama but the placing of hindu idols in an historic mosque wasnt well received by muslimsthey hate idols of any kind muslims dont believe in representations of god not to mention lots of gods while hindus pray to idols and to lots of gods all the time to avoid more hindumuslim bloodshed the state had locked up the mosque of babar perhaps they should have removed the idols of rama first farrokh explained muslims were enraged that these hindu idols were occupying their mosque hindus not only wanted the idols to remainthey wanted to build a temple to rama at the site at this point gordon hathaway interrupted farrokhs story to express anew his dislike of exposition youll never write for the movies kid gordon said you wanna write for the movies you gotta get to the point quicker than this i dont think we can use it said danny mills thoughtfully but i thought it was a nice story thank you farrokh said poor meher the oftneglected mrs daruwalla was sufficiently provoked to change the subject she offered a comment on the pleasure of a sudden evening breeze she noted the rustling of a neem tree in the ladies garden meher would have elaborated on the merits of the neem tree but she saw that the foreigners interestwhich was never greathad already waned gordon hathaway was holding the violetcolored cotton balls hed taken from his ears shaking them in the closed palm of one hand like dice whats a fuckin neem tree he asked as if the tree itself had annoyed him theyre all around town said danny mills theyre a tropical kind of tree i think im sure youve seen them farrokh said to the director listen kid said gordon hathaway when youre makin a movie you dont have time to look at the fuckin trees it must have hurt meher to see by her husbands expression that lowji had found this remark most sage meanwhile gordon hathaway indicated that the conversation was over by turning his attention to a pretty underage girl at an adjacent table this left farrokh with a view of the directors arrogant profile and an especially alarming glimpse of the deep and permanent purple of hathaways inner ear the ear was actually a rainbow of colors from raw red to violet as unsuitably iridescent as the face of a mandrill baboon later after the colorful director had returned to the tajpresumably to wash more food in his bathtub before retiring to bedfarrokh was forced to observe his father fawning over the drunken danny mills it must be difficult to revise a screenplay under these conditions lowji ventured you mean at night over food after ive been drinking danny asked i mean so spurofthemoment lowji said it would seem more prudent to shoot the story youve already written yes it would poor danny agreed but they never do it that way they like the spontaneity i suppose lowji said they dont think the writing is very important said danny mills they dont lowji exclaimed they never do danny told him poor lowji had never considered the unimportance of the writer of a movie even farrokh looked with compassion on danny mills who was an affectionate sentimental man with a gentle manner and a face that women likeduntil they knew him better then they either disliked his central weakness or exploited it alcohol was certainly a problem for him but his drinking was more a symptom of his failure than a cause of it he was always out of money and as a consequence he rarely finished a piece of writing and sold it from any position of strength usually he would sell only an idea for a piece of writing or a piece of writing that was very much a fragmenta story barely in progressand as a result he lost all control of the outcome of whatever the piece of writing was hed never finished a novel although hed begun several when he needed money he would put the novel aside and write a screenplayselling the screenplay before he finished it that was always the pattern by the time he went back to the novel he had enough distance from it to see how bad it was but farrokh couldnt dislike danny the way he disliked gordon hathaway farrokh could see that danny liked lowji too danny also made an effort to protect farrokhs father from further embarrassing himself heres the way it is danny told lowji he swirled the melting ice in the bottom of his glass in the kilnlike heat before the monsoon the ice melted quicklybut never as quickly as danny drank the gin youre screwed if you sell something before you finish it danny mills told the senior daruwalla never even show anybody what youre writing until you finish it just do the work when you know its good show it to someone whos made a movie you like like a director you mean asked lowji who was still writing everything down definitely a director said danny mills i dont mean a studio and so you show it to someone you like a director and then you get paid asked the senior daruwalla no said danny mills you take no money until the whole deal is in place the minute you take any money youre screwed but when do you take the money lowji asked when theyve signed the actors you want when theyve signed the directorand given him the final cut of the picture when everyone likes the screenplay so much you know they wouldnt dare change a word of itand if you doubt this demand final script approval then be prepared to walk away this is what you do lowji asked not me danny said i take the money up front as much as i can get then they screw me but who does it the way you suggest lowji asked he was so confused hed stopped writing nobody i know said danny mills everyone i know gets screwed so you didnt go to gordon hathawayyou didnt choose him lowji asked only a studio would choose gordon danny said he had that uncommon smoothness of skin which appears so confounding on the faces of some alcoholics it was as if dannys babyfaced complexion were the direct result of the pickling processas if the growth of his beard were as arrested as his speech danny looked like he needed to shave only once a week although he was almost ill tell you about gordon danny said it was gordons idea to expand the role of the snake guru in the storygordons idea of the epitome of evil is an ashram with snakes ill tell you about gordon danny mills went on when neither lowji nor farrokh had interrupted him gordons never met a guru with or without snakes gordons never seen an ashram not even in california it would be easy to arrange a meeting with a guru lowji said it would be easy to visit an ashram im sure you know what gordon would say to that idea said danny mills but the drunken screenwriter was looking at farrokh farrokh attempted the best imitation of gordon hathaway that he could manage im makin a fuckin movie farrokh said do i got the time to meet a fuckin guru or go to a fuckin ashram when im in the middle of makin a fuckin movie smart boy said danny mills it was to old lowji that danny confided your son understands the movie business although danny mills appeared to be a destroyed man it was hard not to like him farrokh thought then he looked down in his beer and saw the two vivid violet cotton balls from gordon hathaways ears how did they end up in my beer farrokh wondered he needed to use a parfait spoon to extract them dripping from his beer glass he put gordon hathaways soggy earcottons on a tea saucer wondering how long theyd been soaking in his beerand how much beer hed drunk while gordon hathaways earcottons were sponging up the beer at the bottom of his glass danny mills was laughing so hard he couldnt speak lowji could see what his critical son was thinking dont be ridiculous farrokh his father told him surely it was an accident this made danny mills laugh harder and harder drawing mr sethna to their tablewhere the steward stared in disapproval at the tea saucer containing the beersoaked stillpurple cotton balls farrokhs remaining beer was purple too mr sethna was thinking that it was at least fortunate that mrs daruwalla had already gone home for the evening farrokh helped his father arrange danny mills in the back seat of the car danny would be sound asleep before theyd traveled the length of the driveway of the duckworth club or at least by the time theyd left mahalaxmi the screenwriter was always asleep by that time if he didnt go home earlier when they dropped him at the taj farrokhs father would tip one of the tall sikh doormen who would transport danny to his room on a luggage cart this nightfarrokh in the passenger seat his father driving and danny mills asleep in the back seatthey had just entered tardeo when his father said in your nearly constant expression you might be wise not to display such obvious distaste for these people i know you think youre very sophisticatedand that they are vermin beneath your contemptbut ill tell you what is most unsophisticated and that is to wear your feelings so frankly on your face farrokh would remember this for he took the sting of such a rebuke very much to heart while at the same time he sat silently seething in anger at his father who wasnt as entirely stupid as his young son had presumed him to be farrokh would remember this too because the car was exactly at that location in tardeo where years later his father would be blown to smithereens you should listen to these people farrokh his father was telling him it isnt necessary for them to be your moral equals in order for you to learn something from them farrokh would remember the irony too although this was his fathers idea farrokh would be the one who actually learned something from the wretched foreigners hed be the one who took dannys advice but had he learned anything worth knowing farrokh wasnt now he was it was already past dusk at the duckworth club but the doctor still sat slumped in his chair in the ladies garden the younger dr daruwalla wore an expression generally associated with failure although hed maintained absolute control of his inspector dhar screenplaysfarrokh was always granted final script approvalwhat did it matter everything hed written was crap the irony was hed been very successful writing movies that were no better than one day well go to india darling dr daruwalla wondered if other screenwriters whod written crap nevertheless dreamed as he did of writing a quality picture in farrokhs case his quality story always began in the same way he just couldnt get past the beginning there was an opening shot of victoria terminus the gothic station with its stainedglass windows its friezes its flying buttresses its ornate dome with the watchful gargoylesin farrokhs opinion it was the heart of bombay inside the echoing station were a halfmillion commuters and the everarriving migrants these latter travelers had brought everything with them from their children to their chickens outside the huge depot was the vast display of produce in crawford market not to mention the pet stalls where you could buy parrots or piranhas or monkeys and among the porters and the vendors the beggars and the newcomers and the pickpockets the camera somehow would single out his hero although he was just a child and crippled what other hero would an orthopedic surgeon imagine and with the magical simultaneity that movies can occasionally manage the boys face a closeup would let us know that his story had been chosenamong millionswhile at that exact moment the boys voiceover would tell us his name farrokh was overly fond of the oldfashioned technique of voiceover hed used it to excess in every inspector dhar movie theres one that begins with camera following a pretty young woman through crawford market shes anxious as if she knows shes being followed and this causes her to topple a heapedup pile of pineapples at a fruit stand which makes her run this causes her to slip on the rotting compost underfoot which makes her bump into a pet stall where a vicious cockatoo pecks her hand thats when we see inspector dhar as the young woman runs on dhar calmly follows her he pauses by the stand of exotic birds only long enough to give the cockatoo a cuff with the back of his hand his voiceover says it was the third time id tailed her but she was still crazy enough to think she could shake me dhar pauses again as the pretty girl in her haste collides with a heapedup pile of mangoes dhar is enough of a gentleman to wait for the vendor to clear a path through the fallen fruit but the next time he catches up with the woman shes dead a bullet hole is smack between her wideopen eyes which dhar politely closes for her his voiceover says its a pity i wasnt the only one tailing her she had trouble shaking someone else too from his view of the younger dr daruwalla in the ladies garden old mr sethna was sure he knew the source of the hatred he saw in the doctors eyes the steward thought he knew the particular longago vermin that the doctor was thinking of but mr sethna was unfamiliar with selfdoubt and selfloathing the old parsi would never have imagined that dr daruwalla was thinking about himself farrokh was taking himself to task for leaving that crippled boy at victoria terminus where hed arrived so many bombay stories began at victoria terminus but dr daruwalla had been unable to imagine any story for that abandoned child the doctor was still wondering what could happen to the boy after he came to bombay anything and everything could happen farrokh knew instead the screenwriter had settled for inspector dhar whose toughguy talk was as unoriginal as the rest of him dr daruwalla tried to save himself by thinking of a story with the innocence and purity of his favorite acts from the great royal circus but farrokh couldnt imagine a story as good as even the simplest of the socalled items that he loved he couldnt even think of a story as good as the daily routine of the circus there were no wasted efforts in the course of the long day which began with tea at in the morning the child performers and other acrobats did their strength and flexibility exercises and practiced their new items until or when they ate a light breakfast and cleaned their tents in the rising heat they sewed sequins on their costumes or they attended to other almost motionless chores there was no animal training from midmorning on it was too hot for the big cats and the horses and the elephants stirred up too much dust through the middle of the day the tigers and lions lolled in their cages with their tails and paws and even their ears sticking out between the bars as if they hoped that these extremities might attract a breeze only their tails moved among an orchestra of flies the horses remained standingit was cooler than lying downand two boys took turns dusting the elephants with a torn cloth sack that had once held onions or potatoes another boy watered the floor of the main tent with a hose in the midday heat this didnt dampen the dust for long the overall torpor affected even the chimpanzees who stopped swinging from their cages they still screamed occasionallyand they jumped up and down as always but if a dog so much as whined not to mention barked someone kicked it at noon the animal trainers and the acrobats ate a big lunch then they slept until midafternoontheir first performance always began after the heat was still stultifying and the motes of dust rose and sparkled like stars in the sunlight which slanted through the vents in the main tent in these harsh slashes of light the dust appeared to swarm as intensely as the flies in the breaks between their musical numbers the band members passed a wet rag with which they wiped their brass instruments and more often their heads there was usually a sparse audience in attendance at the performance they were an odd mix of people too old for a full days work and preschool children in both cases their alertness to the performances of the acrobats and the animals was below average as if their limited powers of concentration were further impaired by the lingering heat and dust over the years dr daruwalla had never sensed that the performance itself was ever a diminished effort the acrobats and the animal trainers and even the animals were as steady as they had to be it was the audience that was a little off for this reason farrokh preferred the earlyevening performance whole families cameyoung workingmen and women and children who were old enough to pay attentionand the scant dying sunlight seemed distant even gentle the dust motes werent visible it was the time of the evening when the flies appeared to have departed with the glare and it was still too early for the mosquitoes for the performance the place was always packed the first item was the plastic lady a boneless girl named laxmi the goddess of wealth she was a beautiful contortionistno sign of rickets laxmi was only but the sharp definition of the bones in her face made her seem older she wore a brightorange bikini with yellow and red sequins that glittered in the strobe light she looked like a fish with its scales reflecting a light that shone from underwater it was dark enough in the main tent so that the changing colors of the stroboscope were effective but enough of the late sunlight still illuminated the tent so that you could make out the faces of the children in the audience dr daruwalla thought that whoever said circuses were for children was only half right the circus was also for grownups who enjoyed seeing children so enthralled why cant i do that the doctor wondered thinking about the simple brilliance of the boneless girl named laxmithinking of the crippled boy abandoned in victoria terminus where dr daruwallas imagination had stalled as soon as it had begun instead of creating something as pure and riveting as the circus hed turned his mind to mayhem and murderpersonified by inspector dhar what old mr sethna mistook in dr daruwallas miserable expression was simply the doctors deep disappointment with himself with a sympathetic nod to the doctor who sat forlornly in the ladies garden the parsi steward allowed himself a rare moment of familiarity with a passing waiter im glad im not the rat hes thinking of mr sethna said not the curry of course there was more wrong with one day well go to india darling than danny millss alcoholism or his unsubtle plagiarism of dark victory much more was amiss than gordon hathaways crass alterations of dannys original screenplay or the directors attendant hemorrhoids and fungus to make matters worse the actress who was playing the dying but saved wife was that talentless beauty and denizen of the gossip columns veronica rose her friends and colleagues called her vera but she was born in brooklyn with the name hermione rosen and she was gordon hathaways niece the c of ms daughter small world farrokh would learn the producer harold rosen would one day find his daughter as tiresomely tasteless as the rest of the world judged her to be upon the merest introduction however harold was as easily bullied by his wife the c of m sister of gordon hathaway as gordon was harold was operating on his wifes assumption that hermione rosen by her transformation to veronica rose would one day be a star veras lack of talent and intelligence would prove too great an obstacle for such a goalthis in tandem with a compulsion to expose her breasts that even lady duckworth would have scorned but at the duckworth club in the summer of a rumor was in circulation that vera was soon to have a huge success concerning hollywood what did bombay know that vera had been cast in the role of the dying but saved wife was all that lowji daruwalla knew it would take a while for farrokh to find out that danny mills had objected to vera having the partuntil she seduced him and made him imagine that he was in love with her then he trotted at her heels like a dog danny believed it was the intense pressure of the role that had cooled veras brief ardor for himvera had her own room at the taj and shed refused to sleep with danny since the commencement of principal photographybut in truth she was having an obvious affair with her leading man it wasnt obvious to danny who usually drank himself to sleep and got up late as for the leading man he was a bisexual named neville eden neville was an uprooted englishman and a properly trained actor if not exactly brimming with natural ability but his move to los angeles had turned sour when a certain predictability in the parts he was offered grew clear to him hed become too easy to cast as any number of stereotypical brits there was the brittwit rolethe kind of instant brit whom more rowdy and less educated americans deploreand then there was the sophisticated english gentleman who becomes the love interest of an impressionable american girl before she realizes her mistake and chooses the more substantial if duller american male there was also the role of the visiting british cousinsometimes this was a war buddywho would comically display his inability to ride a horse or to drive a car on the righthand side of the road or to successfully engage in fisticuffs in low bars in all these roles neville felt he was supplying moronic reassurance to an audience that equated manliness with qualities only to be found in american men this discovery tended to irritate him doubtless it also fueled what he called his homosexual self about one day well go to india darling neville was philosophic at least it was a leading role and the part wasnt quite in the vein of the dimly perceived british types he was usually asked to portrayafter all in this story he was a happily married englishman with a dying american wife but even for neville eden the loser combination of danny mills gordon hathaway and veronica rose was a trifle daunting neville knew from past experience that contact with a compromised script a secondrate director and a floozy for a costar tended to make him churlish and neville cared nothing for vera who was beginning to imagine that she was in love with him yet he found fornicating with her altogether more inspiring and amusing than acting with herand he was mightily bored he was also married which vera knew it caused her great anguish or at least virulent insomnia of course she did not know that neville was bisexual this revelation was often the means by which neville broke off such passing affairs hed found it instantly effectiveto tell whichever floozy it was that she was the first woman to capture his heart and his attention to such a degree but that his homosexual self was simply stronger than both of them that usually worked that got rid of them in a hurry all but the wife as for gordon hathaway he had his hands full his hemorrhoids and his fungus were trifling in comparison to the certain catastrophe he was facing veronica rose wanted danny mills to go home so she could lavish even more obvious attention on neville eden gordon hathaway complied with veras request only to the degree that he forbade dannys presence on the set the writers presence gordon claimed fuckin confused the cast but gordon could hardly comply with his nieces request to send danny home he needed danny every night to revise the everchanging script understandably danny mills wanted to reinstate his original script which neville eden had agreed was better than the picture they were making danny thought neville was a good chap though it would have destroyed him to learn that neville was fornicating with vera vera above all dearly desired to sleep and dr lowji daruwalla was alarmed by the sleeping pills she requested yet he was such a fool for movieshe found her charming too his son farrokh wasnt exactly charmed by veronica rose neither was he altogether immune to her attractions soon a conflict of emotions engulfed the tender yearold vera was clearly a coarse young woman which is not without allure to yearolds especially when the woman in question is intriguingly oldervera was furthermore while he knew nothing of the random pleasure vera took in exposing her breasts farrokh found that the actress bore a remarkable resemblance to the old photographs he so relished of lady duckworth it had been an evening in the empty dance hall when not even that depth of stone and the constant stirring of the ceiling fans could cool the stifling and humid night air which had entered the duckworth club as heavily as a fog from the arabian sea even atheists like lowji were praying for the monsoon rains after dinner farrokh had escorted vera from the table to the dance hall not to dance with her but to show her lady duckworths photographs there is someone you resemble the young man told the actress please come and see then hed smiled at his mother meher who didnt appear to be very happily entertained by the surly arrogance of neville eden who sat to her left or by the drunken danny mills who sat to her right with his head upon his folded arms which rested in his plate yeah gordon hathaway said to his niece you oughta see the pictures of this broad vera she showed her tits to everybody too by this word too farrokh should have been forewarned but he supposed gordon meant only that lady duckworth exposed herself in addition to her other traits veronica rose wore a sleeveless muslin dress that clung to her back where shed sweated against her chair her bare upper arms caused excruciating offense to the duckworthians and especially to the recently acquired parsi steward mr sethna who thought that for a woman to bare her upper arms in public was a violation of scandalous proportionthe slut might as well show her breasts too when vera saw lady duckworths pictures she was flattered she lifted her damp blond hair off the back of her slender wet neck and she turned to young farrokh who felt an erotic flush at the sight of a rivulet of sweat that coursed from veras near armpit maybe i oughta wear my hair like hers vera said then she let her hair fall back in place as farrokh followed her to the dining room he couldnt help but noticethrough the drenched back of her dressthat she wore no bra so howd ya like the fuckin exhibitionist her uncle asked her upon her return to the table vera unbuttoned the front of her white muslin dress showing her breasts to them alldr lowji daruwalla and mrs daruwalla too and the lals dining with the bannerjees at a nearby table certainly saw veronica roses breasts very clearly and mr sethna so recently dismissed from the ripon club for attacking a crass member there with hot teamr sethna clutched his silver serving tray as if he thought of striking the hollywood wench dead with it well whatta ya think vera asked her audience i dont know if she was an exhibitionisti think she was just too fuckin hot she added that she wanted to return to the taj where at least there was a sea breeze in truth she looked forward to feeding the rats that gathered at the waters edge beneath the gateway of india the rats were unafraid of people and vera enjoyed teasing them with expensive table scrapsthe way some people enjoy feeding ducks or pigeons thereafter she would go to nevilles room and straddle him until his cock was sore but in the morning in addition to suffering the tribulation of her insomnia vera was sick she was sick every morning for a week before she consulted dr lowji daruwalla who even though he was an orthopedist had no trouble ascertaining that the actress was pregnant shit vera said i thought it was the fuckin curry but no it was just the fucking either danny mills or neville eden was the father vera hoped it was neville because he was betterlooking she also theorized that alcoholism like dannys was genetic christ it must be neville said vera rose dannys so pickled i think hes sterile dr lowji daruwalla was understandably taken aback by the crudeness of the lovely movie star who wasnt really a movie star and who was suddenly terrified that her uncle the director would discover that she was pregnant and fire her from the picture old lowji pointed out to miss rose that she had fewer than three weeks remaining on the shooting schedule she wouldnt begin to look pregnant for another three months or more miss rose then became obsessed with the question of whether or not neville eden would leave his wife and marry her dr lowji daruwalla thought not but he chose to soften the blow with an indirect remark i believe that mr danny mills would marry you the senior daruwalla offered tactfully but this truth only depressed veronica rose who commenced to weep as for weeping it wasnt as commonplace at the hospital for crippled children as one might suppose dr lowji daruwalla led the sobbing actress out of his office and through the waiting room which was full of injured and crippled and deformed children they all looked pityingly upon the crying fairhaired lady imagining that shed just received some awful news regarding a child of her own in a sense she had a slum is born at first the news that vera was pregnant didnt spread far lowji told meher and meher told farrokh no one else knew and a special effort was made to keep this news from lowjis south indian secretary a brilliant young man from madras his name was ranjit and he too had high hopes of becoming a screenwriter ranjit was only a few years older than farrokh his spoken english was impeccable but thus far his writing had been limited to the excellent case histories of the senior dr daruwallas patients that he composed and to his lengthy memos to lowji concerning what recent articles hed read in the doctors orthopedic journals these memos were written not to gain favor with old lowji but as a means of giving the busy doctor some shorthand information regarding what he might like to read himself although he came from a hindu family of strictly vegetarian brahmins ranjit had told lowjiin his job interviewthat he was wholly without religion and that he considered caste as largely a means to hold everyone down lowji had hired the young man in an instant but that had been five years ago although ranjit totally pleased the senior daruwalla as a secretary and lowji had made every effort to further brainwash the young man in an atheistic direction ranjit was finding it exceedingly difficult to attract a prospective brideor more important a prospective fatherinlawby the matrimonial advertisements he regularly submitted to the times of india he wouldnt advertise that he was a brahmin and a strict vegetarian and although these things might not have mattered to him they were of great concern to prospective fathersinlaw it was usually the fathersinlaw not the wouldbe brides who responded to the advertisementsif anyone responded and now there was bickering between old lowji and ranjit because ranjit had given in his most recent advertisement in the times of india had drawn over responses this was because hed presented himself as someone who cared about caste and followed a strict vegetarian diet after all he told lowji hed been made to observe these things as a child and they hadnt killed him if it helps me to get married ranjit said sporting a fresh puja mark so to speak will not kill me now lowji was crushed by this traitorousness hed considered ranjit like a third son and a cohort in atheism furthermore the interviews with over prospective fathersinlaw were having a deleterious influence on ranjits efficiency he was exhausted all the time and no wonderhis mind was reeling with comparisons among future wives but even in this state of mind ranjit was very attentive to the office visit of the hollywood film goddess veronica rose and since it was ranjits job to formally compose old lowjis scribbles into a proper orthopedic report the young man was surprisedafter veras teary departureto see that lowji had scrawled no more than joint problem in the sex symbols file it was highly unusual for the senior daruwalla to escort any of his patients home particularly following a mere office visitand especially when there were other patients waiting to see him furthermore old dr daruwalla had called his own home and told his wife that he was bringing miss rose there all this for a joint problem ranjit thought it was most irregular fortunately the rigorous interviews that were the result of his highly successful matrimonial ads didnt allow ranjit much time or energy for speculation on veras joint problem his interest was provoked no further than to ask the senior daruwalla what sort of joint problem the actress was suffering ranjit wasnt used to typing up an incomplete orthopedic report well actually lowji said i have referred her to another physician not a joint problem then ranjit inquired all he cared about was correctly typing the report possibly gynecological lowji answered warily what sort of joint problem did she think she had ranjit asked in surprise her knees lowji said vaguely with a dismissive wave of his hand but i judged this to be psychosomatic the gynecological problem is psychosomatic too ranjit inquired he foresaw difficult typing ahead possibly lowji said what sort of gynecological problem is it ranjit persisted at his age and with his ambition to be a screenwriter he was thinking that the problem was venereal itching said the senior daruwallaand to halt the inquisition at this juncture he wisely added vaginal itching no young man he knew cared to contemplate this the matter was closed ranjits orthopedic report on veronica rose was the closest he would ever come to writing a screenplay many years later the younger dr daruwalla would read this report with consistent pleasurewhenever he desired to make some contact with the old days the patient is confused by her knees she imagines that she has no vaginal itching which indeed she has while at the same time she feels some pain in her knees which in fact she does not have most naturally a gynecologist is recommended and what a gynecologist was selected for the task few patients would ever claim that their confidence soared when they placed themselves in the hands of the ancient accidentprone dr tata lowji chose him because he was so senile he was certain to be discreet his powers of memory were too depleted for gossip sadly the selection of dr tata was lacking in obstetrical merit at least lowji had the good sense to entrust his wife with the psychological care of veronica rose meher tucked the pregnant bombshell into a guest bed in the daruwalla family mansion on old ridge road meher treated vera like a little girl whod just suffered a tonsillectomy although doubtless soothing this mothering wouldnt solve veras problem nor was vera much comforted by mehers claim that in her own case she hadnt really remembered the agony and the gore of childbirth over time meher told the knockedup actress only the positive parts of the experience stood out in her mind to lowji meher was less optimistic here is a bizarre and thankless situation that you have gotten us into she informed her husband then the situation worsened the next day gordon hathaway called the senior dr daruwalla from the slum set with the bothersome news that veronica rose had collapsed between takes actually that was not what had happened veras socalled collapse had had nothing whatsoever to do with her unwanted pregnancy shed simply fainted because a cow had licked her and then sneezed on her not that this wasnt disturbing to vera but the incidentlike so many daytoday occurrences in an actual slumhad been poorly observed and fervently misinterpreted by the horde of onlookers who reported the confused event farrokh couldnt remember if the rudiments for a real slum existed in the area of sophia zuber road in the summer of he recalled only that there was both a muslim and a hindu population in that vicinity for it wasnt far from where hed attended schoolat st ignatius in mazagaon probably some kind of slum was already there and certainly today there is a slum of good size and modest respectability on sophia zuber road its fair to say that gordon hathaways movie set at least contributed to what now passes for acceptable housing in the slum on sophia zuber road for it was there that the slum set was hastily constructed naturally among those hired as extrasto act the part of the slum residentswere actual citizens of bombay who were looking for an actual slum to move into and once theyd moved in they objected to these movie people who were constantly invading their privacy rather quickly it had become their slum also there was the matter of the latrine an army of moviecrew cooliesthugs with entrenching toolshad dug the latrine but one cannot create a new place to shit without expecting people to shit there a universal code of defecation applies if some people are shitting somewhere others will shit there too this is only fair defecation in india is endlessly creative here was a new latrine quickly it wasnt new and one mustnt forget the intense heat before the monsoon breaks and the ensuing floods that attend the onset of the monsoon these factors in addition to the sudden plenitude of human excrement doubtless exacerbated veras morning sicknessnot to mention her proneness to fainting on that particular day when she was both licked and sneezed on by a cow gordon hathaway and the film crew were shooting the scene where the abductors of the dying wife vera are carrying her through the slum en route to the ashram of the snake guru this is the moment when the idealistic jesuit missionary who just happens to be performing various labors of selflessness in the slum sees the beautiful and unmistakably blond woman whisked along sophia zuber road by a band of raffians unsuitable for her company there later follows the distraught husband neville and a stereotypically stupid policeman who has clumsily lost the trail this is the first meeting between the husband and the jesuit but it was not the first meeting between neville and the arrogant indian actor subodh rai who played the missionary with inappropriately secular handsomeness and cunning meanwhile many of the new slums residents had been forced to move out of their slum in order for gordon hathaway to shoot this scene many more future residents of this new slum were crowding around desirous to move in had any of these onlookers not been so transfixed by veronica rose neville and subodh could have been observed flirting with each other offcamera they were playfully pinching and tickling each other when vera unaccountably found herself facetoface with the cow cows vera had heard were holyalthough not to the majority of beefeating bystanders who were muslimsbut vera was so shocked to see this cow first standing in her path and then approaching her that she took rather a long time to determine what course of action she should choose by then the cows moist breath was detectable in her cleavage since shed been abducted from the taj in the movie in her nightgown veras cleavage was quite considerable and exposed the cow was garlanded with flowers brightly colored beads were strung on thongs tied around its ears neither the cow nor vera seemed to know what to make of this confrontation although vera was certain that she didnt want to cause some religious offense by being in the least aggressive toward the cow oh what pretty flowers she remarked oh what a nice cow she said to it veronica roses repertoire of friendly inoffensive responses was exceedingly small she didnt think she should throw her arms around the cows neck and kiss its long sad face she wasnt sure if she should touch the cow at all but the cow made the first move it was simply on its way somewhere and suddenly a film crew in general and a silly woman in particular stood in its way therefore it stepped slowly forwardit trod on veras bare foot since shed just been abducted in the movie her foot was bare even in great pain vera had such a fear of religious zealotry that she didnt dare scream in the cows face the wet muzzle of which was now pressed against her chest not only because of the humid weather but also because of her fear and pain vera was soaked with sweat whether it was merely the salt on her fair skin or her inviting fragrancefor doubtless vera smelled vastly better than the other residents of sophia zuber roadthe cow at this moment licked her both the length and feel of the cows tongue was a new experience for vera who fainted when the cow violently sneezed in her face then the cow bent over her and licked her chest and shoulders thereafter no one saw clearly what happened there was demonstrable consternation for miss roses welfare and some rioting by those onlookers who were outraged by what theyd seen the rioters themselves were uncertain of what theyd seen only vera would later conclude that the rioters had rioted on behalf of a sacred cow neville eden and subodh rai vaguely wondered if vera had fainted in response to their observed sexual interest in each other by the time the daruwallas found their way to the van which served as miss roses makeup room and a firstaid station the muslim owner of a bidi shop had spread the word all along sophia zuber road that a blond american movie star naked to her waist had licked a cow and thereby caused widespread rioting among the sensitive hindu population such mischief was unnecessary riots didnt need reasons if there was a reason for this one it was probably that too many people wanted to move into the movieset slum and they were impatient that they had to wait for the movie they wanted to start living there immediately but vera of course would always imagine that everything had happened because of her and the cow it was into the midst of this bedlam that the daruwalla family arrived to rescue the indelicately pregnant miss rose her state of mind hadnt been improved by the cow but the senior dr daruwalla could conclude only that vera had a bruised and swollen right footand that she was still pregnant if neville wont have me ill put the baby up for adoption vera said but youve got to arrange it all here she told lowji and meher and farrokh she felt certain that her american audience wouldnt sympathize with her for a child born out of wedlock more to the point her uncle wouldnt use her in another picture if he knew worse danny mills out of a drunks special sentimentality would insist on adopting the baby himself if he knew this has gotta be strictly between us miss rose told the helpless daruwallas find me some fuckin rich people who want a white baby the interior of the van was a virtual sauna the daruwallas wondered if vera was suffering from dehydration admittedly lowji and meher felt unfamiliar with the moral logic of westerners they turned to their europeaneducated son for some guidance on this subject but even to farrokh it seemed an odd questionable giftto present india with another baby young farrokh politely suggested that a baby might be more welcome for adoption in europe or america but miss rose sought secrecy at all costas if morally whatever she did in india and whomever she left behind here would somehow remain unrecorded or at least never be counted against her you could have an abortion the senior dr daruwalla suggested dont you dare mention that word to me said veronica rose im not that kind of personi was brought up with certain moral values while the daruwallas puzzled over veras moral values the van was rocked violently from side to side by a rowdy mob of men and boys lipstick and eyeliner rolled off the shelves of the vanand powders and moisturizers and rouge a jar of sterile water crashed and one of alcohol farrokh caught a falling box of gauze pads and another of bandaids as his father made his way to the sliding panel door veronica rose screamed so loudly that she didnt hear what old lowji shouted to the men outside nor did she hear the sound of the several beatings as various thugs among the filmcrew coolies fell upon the mob with the entrenching tools theyd used to dig the notsonew latrine miss rose lay on her back clutching the sides of her trembling cot as small colorful jars of this and that dropped harmlessly on her oh i hate this country she yelled it is merely a passing riot meher assured her i hate it i hate it i hate it vera cried it is the most awful country in the worldi simply hate it it occurred to young farrokh to ask the actress why then she would ever want to leave her own baby here in bombay but he felt he was too ignorant of the cultural differences between miss rose and himself to be critical farrokh wished to remain forever ignorant of the differences between these movie people and himself at young men are given to moral generalizations of a sweeping kind to hold the rest of the united states responsible for the behavior of the former hermione rosen was a tad severe nevertheless farrokh felt himself edging away from a future residence in the united states in short veronica rose made farrokh feel physically ill surely the woman should take some responsibility for her own pregnancy and shed tarnished farrokhs sacred memory of lady duckworths exhibitionism in legend lady duckworths selfexposure had seemed elegant but not greatly tempting in farrokhs mind lady duckworths breasts were only a symbolic display but forever after farrokh was left with the more tangible memory of veras raw titsthey were such a sincerely carnal offering the camphor man with all this trash in his past its little wonder that farrokh was still sitting at his table in the darkening ladies garden of the duckworth club in the time it had taken the younger dr daruwalla to recall such a past mr sethna had provided him with another cold kingfisher farrokh hadnt touched his new beer the faraway look in dr daruwallas eyes was almost as distant as that gaze of death which the doctor had recently seen in the eyes of mr lal although its already been said the vultures had spoiled a clear impression at the great royal circus about an hour before the earlyevening performance a stooped man carrying a burning brazier would walk along the avenue of troupe tents live coals were glowing in the brazier and the aromatic camphor smoke drifted into the tents of the acrobats and the animal trainers the camphor man would pause by each tent to be sure that enough smoke wafted inside in addition to the medicinal properties attributed to camphorit was often used as a counterirritant for infections and in the treatment of itchingthe smoke was of superstitious importance to the circus performers they believed that inhaling camphor smoke protected them from the evil eye and the dangers of their professionanimal attacks falling when mr sethna saw dr daruwalla close his eyes and throw back his head and draw a deep breath of the flowery air in the ladies garden the old parsi steward mistook the reason mr sethna wrongly assumed that farrokh had felt an evening breeze and therefore was enjoying a sudden infusion of the scent from the surrounding bougainvillea but dr daruwalla was sniffing for the camphor man as if the doctors memories of the past were in need of both a disinfectant and a blessing the first one out separated at birth as for vera young farrokh wouldnt be a witness to the womans worst behavior he would be back in school in vienna when veronica rose gave birth to twins and elected to leave one of them in the city she hatedshe took the other one home with her this was a shocking decision but farrokh wasnt surprised vera was a spurofthemoment sort of woman and farrokh had observed the monsoon months of her pregnancyhe knew the kind of insensitivity that she was capable of in bombay the monsoon rains begin in midjune and last until september to most bombayites the rains are a relief from the heat despite the blocked drains it was only july when the shooting of the terrible film was finished and the movie rabble left bombayalas leaving poor vera behind for the remainder of the monsoon and beyond it was for soulsearching that she told them all she was staying neville eden didnt care whether she was staying or going hed taken subodh rai to italya pasta diet neville told young farrokh with relish improved ones stamina for the rigors of buggery gordon hathaway was attempting to edit one day well go to india darling in los angeles despite changing its title to the dying wife no amount or convolution of editing could save the picture every day gordon cursed his family for burdening him with a niece as willful and untalented as vera danny mills was drying out in a private sanitarium in laguna beach california the sanitarium was slightly ahead of its timeit favored vigorous calisthenics in tandem with a grapefruitandavocado diet danny was also being sued by a limousine company because harold rosen the producer was no longer paying for dannys socalled business trips when danny couldnt stand it another second in the sanitarium hed call a limo to drive him to la and wait for him while he consumed a hearty beeforiented dinner and two or three bottles of a good red wine then the limo would return him to laguna beach where danny would arrive sated but with his tongue the shape and color of a raw chicken liver whenever he was drying out it was red wine he craved above all else danny wrote to vera dailystaggeringly claustrophobic love letters some of them running typed pages the gist of these letters was always the same and quite simple to understand that danny would change if vera would marry him vera meanwhile had made her plans presuming the complete cooperation of the daruwallas she would move into hiding with dr lowji and his family until the child was born the prenatal care and delivery would be the responsibility of the senile friend of the senior dr daruwalla the ancient and accidentprone dr tata it was unusual for dr tata to make house calls but he agreed given his friendship with the daruwallas and his understanding of the extreme sensitivity ascribed to the hypochondriac movie star this was just as well meher said because veronica rose would not have responded confidently to the peculiar sign with large lettering that was posted outside dr tatas office building dr tatas best most famous clinic for gynecological maternity needs it was surely wise to spare vera the knowledge that dr tata found it necessary to advertise his services as best and most famous for vera would doubtless conclude that dr tata suffered from insecurity and so dr tata made frequent house calls to the esteemed daruwalla residence on ridge road because dr tata was far too old to drive a car safely his arrivals and departures were usually marked by the presence of taxis in the daruwallas drivewayexcept for one time when farrokh observed dr tata stumbling into the driveway from the back seat of a private car this wouldnt have been of special interest to the young man except that the car was driven by promila rai beside her in the passenger seat was her allegedly hairless nephew rahulthe very boy whose sexual ambiguity so discomforted farrokh this loomed as a violation of that secrecy which all the daruwallas sought for vera and her pending child but promila and her unnerving nephew drove off as soon as dr tata was deposited in the driveway and dr tata told lowji that he was sure hed thrown promila off the trail hed told her he was making a house call to see meher meher was offended that a woman as loathsome to her as promila rai would be presuming all sorts of female plumbing problems of an intimate nature it was long after dr tata had departed that mehers irritation subsided and she thought to ask lowji and farrokh what promila and rahul rai were doing with old dr tata in the first place lowji pondered the question as if for the first time i suppose she was concluding an office visit and he asked her for a ride farrokh informed his mother she is a woman past childbearing years meher delightedly pointed out if she was concluding an office visit it would have been for something gynecological for such a visit why would she take her nephew lowji said perhaps it was the nephews office visitprobably it has something to do with the hairlessness business i know promila rai meher said she wont believe for one minute that dr tata was housecalling to see me and then one evening following a function where thered been interminable speeches at the duckworth club promila rai approached dr lowji daruwalla and said to him i know all about the blond babyi will take it the senior dr daruwalla cautiously said what baby then he added theres no certainty it will be blond of course it will said promila rai i know these things at least it will be fairskinned lowji considered that the child might indeed be fairskinned however both danny mills and neville eden had very dark hair and the doctor sincerely doubted the baby would be as blond as veronica rose meher was opposed on principle to promila rai being an adoptive mother in the first place promila was in her fiftiesnot only a spinster but an evil spurned woman shes a bitter resentful witch meher said shed be an awful mother she must have a dozen servants lowji replied but meher accused him of forgetting how offended hed once been by promila rai as a malabar hill resident promila had led a protest campaign against the towers of silence shed offended the entire parsi community even old lowji promila had claimed that the vultures were certain to drop body parts in various residents gardens or on their terraces promila even alleged that shed spotted a bit of a finger floating in her balcony birdbath dr lowji daruwalla had written an angry letter explaining to promila that vultures didnt fly around with the fingers or toes of corpses in their beaks vultures consumed what they wanted on the groundanyone who knew anything about vultures knew that and now you want promila rai to be a mother meher exclaimed it isnt that i want her to be a mother the senior dr daruwalla said however there isnt exactly a lineup of wealthy matrons seeking to adopt an american movie stars unwanted child furthermore meher said promila rai is a manhater what if that poor baby is a boy lowji didnt dare tell meher what promila had already said to him promila was not only certain that the baby would be blond she was also quite sure it would be a girl i know these things promila had told him youre only a doctorand one for joints not babies the senior dr daruwalla didnt suggest that veronica rose and promila rai discuss their transaction with each other instead he did everything he could to keep them from such a discussionthey didnt seem to have much interest in each other anyway it mattered to vera only that promila was rich or so it appeared it mattered most of all to promila that vera was healthy promila had a sizable fear of drugs it was drugs she was certain that had poisoned her fiancés brain and caused him to change his mind about marrying hertwice after all had he been drugfree and clearheaded why wouldnt he have married herat least once lowji could assure promila that vera was drugfree now that neville and danny had left bombay and vera wasnt trying to be an actress every day she didnt need the sleeping pills in fact she slept most of the time almost anyone could see where this was going it was a pity that lowji couldnt his own wife thought him criminal even to consider putting a newborn baby into the hands of promila rai promila would doubtless reject the child if it was male or even slightly darkhaired and then lowji heard the worst news from old dr tatanamely that veronica rose wasnt a true blonde ive seen where you havent seen old dr tata told him she has black hair very blackmaybe the blackest hair ive ever seen even in india farrokh felt he could imagine the conclusion to this melodrama the child would be a boy with black hair promila rai wouldnt want him and meher wouldnt want promila to have him anyway therefore the daruwallas would end up adopting veras baby what farrokh failed to imagine was that veronica rose wasnt entirely as artless as shed appeared vera had already chosen the daruwallas as her babys adoptive parents upon the childs birth vera had planned to stage a breakdown the reason shed appeared so indifferent to discussions with promila was that vera had decided shed reject any wouldbe adoptive parentnot only promila shed guessed that the daruwallas were suckers when it came to children and shed not guessed wrong what no one had imagined was that there wouldnt be just one darkhaired baby boy there would be twoidentical twin boys with the most gorgeous almondshaped faces and jetblack hair promila rai wouldnt want them and not only because they were darkhaired boys she would claim that any woman who had twins was clearly taking drugs but the most unexpected turn of events would be engineered by the persistent love letters of danny mills to veronica rose and by the death of neville edenthe victim of a car crash in italy an accident that also ended the flamboyant life of subodh rai until the news of the car crash vera had been illogically hoping that neville might come back to her now she determined that the fatal accident was divine retribution for nevilles preferring subodh to her she would carry this thought still further in her elder years believing that aids was gods wellintentioned effort to restore a natural order to the universe like many morons vera would believe the scourge was a godsent plague in judgment of homosexuals this was remarkable thinking really for a woman who wasnt imaginative enough to believe in god it had been clear to vera that if neville ever would have wanted her he wouldnt have wanted her cluttered up with a baby but upon nevilles abrupt departure vera turned her thoughts to danny would danny still want to marry her if she brought him home a little surprise vera was sure he would darling vera wrote to danny ive not wanted to test how much you love me but all this while ive been carrying our child her months with lowji and meher had markedly improved veras english naturally when she first saw the twins vera immediately pronounced them to be nevilles in her view they were far too pretty to be dannys danny mills for his odd part hadnt considered having a child before he was descended from weary but pleasant parents whod had too many children before danny had been born and whod treated danny with cordial indifference bordering on neglect danny wrote cautiously to his beloved vera that he was thrilled she was carrying their child a child was a fine ideahe hoped only that she didnt desire to start a whole family twins are a whole family unto themselves as any fool knows and thus the dilemma would sort itself out in the predictable fashion vera would take one home and the daruwallas would keep the other simply put vera didnt want to overwhelm dannys limited enthusiasm for fatherhood among the host of surprises awaiting lowji not the least would be the advice given to him by his senile friend dr tata when it comes to twins put your money on the first one out the senior dr daruwalla was shocked but being an orthopedist not an obstetrician he sought to comply with dr tatas recommendation however such excitement and confusion attended the birth of the twins that none of the nurses kept track of which one came out first old dr tata himself couldnt remember in this respect was dr tata said to be accidentprone he blamed the unprofessionalism of the house calls for his failure to hear the two heartbeats whenever he put his stethoscope to veras big belly he said that in his office under appropriate conditions he would surely have heard the two hearts as it waswhether it was the music that meher played or the constant sounds of housecleaning by the several servantsold dr tata simply assumed that veras baby had an unusually strong and active heartbeat on more than one occasion he said your baby has just been exercising i think i could have told you that vera always replied and so it wasnt until she was in labor that the monitoring of the fetal heartbeats told the tale what a lucky lady dr tata told vera rose you have not one but two a knack for offending people in the summer of when the monsoon rains drenched bombay the aforementioned melodrama lay heavy and unseen in young farrokh daruwallas futurelike a fog so far out in the indian ocean it hadnt yet reached the arabian sea he would be back in vienna where he and jamshed were continuing their lengthy and proper courtship of the zilk sisters when he heard the news not one but two and vera took only one with her to farrokh and jamshed their parents were already elderly even lowji and meher might have agreed that the most vigorous of their childraising abilities were behind them theyd do their best with the little boy but after jamshed married josefine zilk it made sense for the younger couple to take over the responsibility theirs was a mixed marriage anyway and zürich where they would settle was an international citya darkhaired boy of strictly white parentage would easily fit in by then he knew hindi in addition to english in zürich he would learn german although jamshed and josefine would start him in an englishspeaking school after a time the senior daruwallas became like grandparents to the boy from the beginning lowji had legally adopted him and after jamshed and josefine had children of their ownand there came that inevitable passage through adolescence wherein the orphaned twin expressed a disgruntled alienation from them allit was only natural that farrokh would emerge as a kind of big brother to the boy the year difference between them made farrokh something of another father to the child too by then farrokh was married to the former julia zilk and theyd started a family of their own wherever he went the adopted boy appeared to belong but farrokh and julia were his favorites one shouldnt feel sorry for veras abandoned child he was always part of a large family even if there was something dislocating in the geographical upheavals in the young mans lifebetween toronto zürich and bombayand even if at an early age there could be detected in him a certain detachment and later there was in his languagein his german in his english in his hindisomething decidedly odd if not exactly a speech impediment he spoke very slowly as if he were composing a written sentence complete with punctuation in his minds eye if he had an accent it was nothing traceable it was more a matter of his enunciation which was so very deliberate as if he were in the habit of speaking to children or addressing crowds and the issue that naturally intrigued them all which was whether he was the offspring of neville eden or of danny mills would not be easily decided in the medical records of one day well go to india darlingwhich are to this day the only enduring records that the film was ever madeit was clearly noted that neville and danny were of the same common blood group and the very same type that the twins would share various daruwallas argued that their twin was too goodlooking and too disinclined toward strong drink to be a conceivable creation of dannys furthermore the boy showed little interest in reading much less in writinghe didnt even keep a diarywhereas he was quite a gifted and highly disciplined young actor even in grammar school this pointed the finger at the late neville but of course the daruwallas knew very little about the other twin if one is determined to feel sorry for either of these twins perhaps one should indulge such a feeling for the child vera kept as for the little boy who was abandoned in india his first days were marked by the necessity of giving him a name he would be a daruwalla but in concession to his allwhite appearance it was agreed he should have an english first name the family concurred that his name should be john which was the christian name of none other than lord duckworth himself even lowji conceded that the duckworth club was the source of the responsibility he bore for veronica roses castoff child needless to say no one would have been so stupid as to name a boy duckworth daruwalla john daruwalla on the other hand had a friendly angloindian ring everyone could more or less pronounce this name indians are familiar with the letter j even germanspeaking swiss dont badly maul the name john although they tend to frenchify the name as jean daruwalla is as phonetic as most names come although germanspeaking swiss pronounce the w as v hence the young man was known in zürich as jean daruvalla this was close enough his swiss passport was issued in the name of john daruwallaplain but distinctive not for years did there awaken in farrokh that first stirring of the creative process which old lowji would never experience now nearly years after the birth of veras twins farrokh found himself wishing that hed never experienced the creative process either for it was by the interference of farrokhs imagination that little john daruwalla had become inspector dhar the man bombay most loved to hateand bombay was a city of many passionate hatreds farrokh had conceived inspector dhar in the spirit of satireof quality satire why were there so many easily offended people why had they reacted to inspector dhar so humorlessly had they no appreciation for comedy only now when he was almost did it occur to farrokh that he was his fathers son in this respect hed uncovered a natural talent for pissing people off if lowji had long been perceived as an assassinationinprogress why had farrokh been blind to this possible result in the case of inspector dhar and hed thought he was being so careful hed written that first screenplay slowly and with great attention to detail this was the surgeon in him he hadnt learned such carefulness or authenticity from danny mills and certainly not from his attendance at those threehour spectacles in the shabby downtown cinema palaces of bombaythose artdeco ruins where the airconditioning was always undergoing repair and the urine frequently overflowed the lavatories more than the movies hed watched the audience eating their snacks in the s and s the masala recipe was workingnot only in bombay but throughout south and southeast asia and the middle east and even in the soviet union there was music mixed with murder sob stories intercut with slapstick mayhem in tandem with the most maudlin sentimentalityand above all the satisfying violence that occurs whenever the forces of good confront and punish the forces of evil there were gods too they helped the heroes but dr daruwalla didnt believe in the usual gods when he started writing hed just recently become a convert to christianity to that hindi hodgepodge which was the bombay cinema the doctor added his toughguy voiceover and dhars antiheroic sneer farrokh would wisely leave his newfound christianity out of the picture hed followed danny millss recommendations to the letter he selected a director he liked balraj gupta was a young man with a less heavy hand than mosthe had an almost selfmocking mannerand more important he was not such a wellknown director that dr daruwalla couldnt bully him a little the deal was as danny mills had said a deal should be including the doctors choice of the young unknown actor who would play inspector dhar john daruwalla was farrokhs first effort to pass off the young man as an angloindian wasnt at all convincing to balraj gupta he looks like some kind of european to me the director complained but his hindi is the real thing i guess and after the success of the first inspector dhar movie balraj gupta would never dream of interfering with the orthopedist from canada whod given bombay its most hated antihero the first movie was called inspector dhar and the hanging mali this was more than years after a real gardener had been found hanging from a neem tree on old ridge road in malabar hill a posh part of town for anyone to be hanged in the mali was a muslim whod just been dismissed from tending the gardens of several malabar hill residents hed been accused of stealing but the charge had never been proven and there were those who claimed that the reallife gardener had been fired because of his extremist views the mali was said to be furious about the closing of the mosque of babar although farrokh fictionalized the mails story years after the littleknown facts of the case inspector dhar and the hanging mali wasnt viewed as a period piece for one thing the thcentury babri mosque was still in dispute the hindus still wanted their idols to remain in the mosque in honor of the birthplace of rama the muslims still wanted the idols removed in the late s very much in keeping with the language of that time the muslims said they wanted to liberate the mosque of babarwhereas it was the birthplace of rama that the hindus said they wanted to liberate in the movie inspector dhar sought to keep the peace and of course this was impossible the essence of an inspector dhar movie was that violence could be relied upon to erupt around him among the earliest of the victims was inspector dhars wife yes he was married in the first movie albeit briefly the carbomb death of his wife apparently justified his sexual licentiousness for the rest of the movieand for all the other inspector dhar movies to come and everyone was supposed to believe that this allwhite dhar was a hindu hes seen lighting his wifes cremation fire hes seen wearing the traditional dhoti with his head traditionally shaved all during the course of the first movie his hair is growing back other women rub the stubble as if in the most profound respect for his late wife his status as a widower gains him great sympathy and lots of womena very western idea and very offensive to begin with both hindus and muslims were offended widowers were offended not to mention widows and gardeners and from the very first inspector dhar movie policemen were offended the misfortune of the reallife hanging mali had never been explained the crimethat is if it was a crime if the gardener hadnt hanged himselfwas never solved in the movie the audience is offered three versions of the hanging each one a perfect solution thus the unfortunate mali is hanged three times and each hanging offended some group muslims were angry that muslim fanatics were blamed for hanging the gardener hindus were outraged that hindu fundamentalists were blamed for hanging the gardener and sikhs were incensed that sikh extremists were blamed for hanging the gardener as a means of setting muslims and hindus against each other the sikhs were also offended because every time theres a taxi in the movie its driven wildly and aggressively by someone whos perceived to be a crazed sikh but the film was terribly funny dr daruwalla had thought in the darkness of the ladies garden farrokh reconsidered inspector dhar and the hanging mali might have been terribly funny to canadians he imaginedwith the notable exception of canadian gardeners but canadians had never seen the film except those former bombayites who lived in toronto theyd watched all the inspector dhar movies on videocassettes and even they were offended inspector dhar himself had never found his films especially funny and when dr daruwalla had questioned balraj gupta concerning the comic or at least satiric nature of the inspector dhar movies the director had responded in a most offhand manner they make lots of lakhs the director had said now thats funny but it was no longer funny to farrokh what if mrs dogar was a hijra in the first darkness of the evening the duckworthians with small children had begun to occupy the tables in the ladies garden the children enjoyed eating outdoors but not even their enthusiastic highpitched voices disturbed farrokhs journey into the past mr sethna disapproved of all small childrenhe especially disapproved of eating with thembut he nevertheless considered it his duty to oversee dr daruwallas state of mind in the ladies garden mr sethna had seen dhar leave with the dwarf but when vinod returned to the duckworth clubthe steward assumed that the nastylooking midget was simply making his taxi available to dr daruwalla toothe dwarf hadnt waddled in and out of the foyer as usual vinod had gone into the sports shop where the dwarf was on friendly terms with the ball boys and the racquet stringers vinod had become their favorite scavenger mr sethna disapproved of scavenging and of dwarfs the steward thought dwarfs were disgusting as for the ball boys and the racquet stringers they thought vinod was cute if the film press was at first being facetious when they referred to vinod as inspector dhars dwarf bodyguardthey also called the dwarf dhars thug chauffeurvinod took his reputation seriously the dwarf was always well armed and his weapons of choice were both legal and easily concealed in his taxi vinod collected squashracquet handles from the racquet stringers at the duckworth sports shop when a racquet head was broken a stringer sawed the head off and sanded down the stump until it was smooth the remaining squashracquet handle was of the right length and weight for a dwarf and the wood was very hard vinod wanted only wooden racquet handles which were becoming scarce but the dwarf hoarded them and the way he used them he rarely broke one he would jab or strike with only one racquet handlehe would go for the balls or the knees or bothwhile he held the other handle out of reach invariably the man under attack would grab hold of the offending racquet handle thereupon vinod would bring the other handle down on the mans wrist it had been an unbeatable tactic invite the man to grab one racquet handle then break his wrist with the other handle the hell with a mans headvinod often couldnt reach a mans head anyway a broken wrist usually stopped a fight if a fool wanted to keep fighting he would be fighting with one hand against two squashracquet handles if the film press had turned the dwarf into a bodyguard and a thug vinod didnt mind he was genuinely protective of inspector dhar mr sethna disapproved of such violence and of the sport shop racquet stringers who happily provided vinod with his arsenal of squashracquet handles the ball boys also gave the dwarf dozens of discarded tennis balls in the cardriving business as vinod described it there was a lot of just waiting in his car the former clown and acrobat liked to keep busy by squeezing the dead tennis balls vinod strengthened his hands the dwarf also claimed that this exercise relieved his arthritis although dr daruwalla believed that aspirin was probably a more reliable source of relief it had occurred to mr sethna that dr daruwallas longstanding relationship with vinod was probably the reason the doctor didnt drive a car it had been years since farrokh had even owned a car in bombay the dwarfs reputation as dhars driver tended to obscure for most observers the fact that vinod also drove for dr daruwalla it spooked mr sethna how the doctor and the dwarf seemed so aware of each othereven as the dwarf loaded up his car with squashracquet handles and old tennis balls even as the doctor went on sitting in the ladies garden it was as if farrokh always knew that vinod was availableas if the dwarf were waiting only for him well either for him or for dhar it now occurred to mr sethna that dr daruwalla was intending to occupy his luncheon table through the dinner hours perhaps the doctor was expecting dinner guests and had decided it was the simplest way to hold the table but when the old steward inquired of dr daruwalla about the number of place settings mr sethna was informed that the doctor was going home for supper promptly as if hed been awakened from a dream farrokh got up to leave mr sethna observed and overheard him calling his wife from the telephone in the foyer nein liebchen said dr daruwalla i have not told himthere wasnt a good moment to tell him then mr sethna listened to dr daruwalla on the subject of the murder of mr lal so it is a murder mr sethna thought bonked by his own putter and when he heard the part about the tworupee note in mr lals mouth and specifically the intriguing threat that was connected to inspector dharmore members die if dhar remains a membermr sethna felt that his eavesdropping efforts had been rewarded at least for this day then something mildly remarkable happened dr daruwalla hung up the phone and turned into the foyer without first lookingwhere he was going and who should he run smack into but the second mrs dogar the doctor bumped into her so hard mr sethna was excited by the possibility that the vulgar woman would be knocked down but instead it was farrokh who fell more astonishing upon the collision mrs dogar was shoved backward into mr dogarand he fell down too what a fool for marrying such a younger stronger woman mr sethna thought then there was the usual bowing and apologizing and everyone assured everyone else that he or she was absolutely fine sometimes the absurdities of good manners which were demonstrated in such profusion at the duckworth club gave mr sethna gas thus finally farrokh escaped from the old stewards overseeing eye but while he waited for vinod to fetch the car dr daruwallaunobserved by mr sethnatouched the sore spot in his ribs where there would surely be a bruise and he marveled at the hardness and sturdiness of the second mrs dogar it was like running into a stone wall it crossed the doctors mind that mrs dogar was sufficiently masculine to be a hijranot a hijra prostitute of course but just an ordinary eunuchtransvestite in which case mrs dogar might not have been eyeballing inspector dhar for the purpose of seducing him instead she might have had it in her mind to castrate him farrokh felt ashamed of himself for thinking like a screenwriter again how many kingfishers have i had he wondered it relieved him to hold the beer accountable for his farfetched fantasizing in truth he knew nothing about mrs dogarwhere shed come frombut hijras occupied such a marginal position in indian society the doctor was aware that most of them came from the lower classes whoever she was the second mrs dogar was an upperclass woman and mr dogaralthough he was a foolish old fart in farrokhs opinionwas a malabar hill man he came from old money and lots of it nor was mr dogar such a fool that he wouldnt know the difference between a vagina and a burn scar from the famous hijra hotoil treatment while he waited for vinod dr daruwalla watched the second mrs dogar help mr dogar into their car she towered over the poor parkinglot attendant who sheepishly opened the driversside door for her farrokh was unsurprised to see that mrs dogar was the driver in the family hed heard all about her fitness training which he knew included weight lifting and other unfeminine pursuits perhaps she takes testosterone too the doctor imagined for the second mrs dogar looked as if her sex hormones were ragingher male sex hormones dr daruwalla speculated hed heard that such women sometimes develop a clitoris as large as a finger as long as a young boys penis when either too much kingfisher or his runamuck imagination caused dr daruwalla to speculate in this fashion the doctor was grateful that he was merely an orthopedic surgeon he truly didnt want to know too much about these other things yet farrokh had to force himself from further contemplation for he found that he was wondering what would be worse that the second mrs dogar sought to emasculate inspector dhar or that she was in amorous pursuit of the handsome actorand that she possessed a clitoris of an altogether unseemly size dr daruwalla was in such a transfixed state of mind he didnt notice that vinod had onehandedly wheeled into the circular driveway of the duckworth club and was with his other hand belatedly applying the brakes the dwarf nearly ran the doctor down at least this served to take dr daruwallas mind off the second mrs dogar if only for the moment farrokh forgot her load cycle the better of the dwarfs two taxisof those two that were equipped with hand controlswas in the shop the carburetor is being revised vinod explained since dr daruwalla had no idea how one accomplished a carburetor revision he didnt press the dwarf for details they departed the duckworth club in vinods decaying ambassador which was the offwhite color of a pearllike graying teeth farrokh reflected also its hand control for acceleration was inclined to stick nevertheless dr daruwalla abruptly asked the dwarf to drive him past his fathers former house on old ridge road malabar hill this was doubtless because farrokh had his father and malabar hill on his mind farrokh and jamshed had sold the house shortly after their fathers murderwhen meher had decided to live out the rest of her life in the company of her children and her grandchildren all of whom had already chosen not to live in india dr daruwallas mother would die in toronto in the doctors guest bedroom mehers death in her sleepwhen it had snowed all nightwas as peaceful as the bombing of old lowji had been violent it wasnt the first time farrokh had asked vinod to drive by his old malabar hill home from the moving taxi the house was barely visible the former daruwalla family estate reminded the doctor of how tangential his contact with the country of his birthplace had become for farrokh was a foreigner on malabar hill dr daruwalla lived like a visitor in one of those ugly apartment buildings on marine drive he had the same view of the arabian sea as could be found from a dozen similar places hed paid lakhs about dollars for a flat of less than square feet and he hardly lived there at allhe visited india so rarely he was ashamed that the rest of the time he didnt rent it out but farrokh knew he would have been a fool to do so the tenancy laws in bombay favor the tenants if dr daruwalla had tenants hed never get them out besides from the inspector dhar movies the doctor had made so many lakhs that he supposed he should spend some of them in bombay through the marvels of a swiss bank account and the guile of a cunning moneydealer dhar had been successful in getting a sizable portion of their earnings out of india dr daruwalla also felt ashamed of that vinod seemed to sense when dr daruwalla was vulnerable to charity it was his own charitable enterprise that the dwarf was thinking of vinod was routinely shameless in seeking the doctors support of his most fervent cause vinod and deepa had taken it upon themselves to rescue various urchins from the slums of bombay in short they recruited street kids for the circus they sought the more acrobatic beggarsdemonstrably well coordinated childrenand vinod made every effort to steer these talented waifs toward circuses of more merit than the great blue nile deepa was particularly devoted to saving child prostitutes or wouldbe child prostitutes rarely were these girls suitable circus material to dr daruwallas knowledge the only circus that had stooped to adopt any of vinod and deepas discoveries was the lessthangreat blue nile to farrokhs considerable discomfort many of these girls were mr gargs discoveriesthat is long before vinod and deepa had found them mr garg was the owner and manager of the wetness cabaret where a kind of concealed grossness was the norm strip joints not to mention sex shows arent permitted in bombayat least not to the degree of explicitness that exists in europe and in north america in india theres no nudity whereas wetnessmeaning wet clinging almost transparent clothingis much in evidence and sexually suggestive gestures are the mainstay of socalled exotic dancers in such seedy entertainment spots as mr gargs among such spots even including the bombay eros palace the wetness cabaret was the worst yet the dwarf and his wife insisted to dr daruwalla that mr garg was the good samaritan of kamathipura in the many lanes of brothels that were there and throughout the redlight district on falkland road and on grant road the wetness cabaret was a haven it was only a haven compared to a brothel farrokh supposed whether one called gargs girls strippers or exotic dancers most of them werent whores but many of them were runaways from the kamathipura brothels or from the brothels on falkland road and on grant road in the brothels the virginity of these girls had been only briefly prizeduntil the madam supposed they were old enough or until there was a high enough offer but when many of these girls ran away to mr garg they were much too young for what the wetness cabaret offered ironically they were old enough for prostitution but far too young to be exotic dancers according to vinod most men who wanted to look at women wanted the women to look like women apparently these werent the same men who wanted to have sex with underage girlsand even those men vinod claimed didnt necessarily want to look at those young girls therefore mr garg couldnt use them at the wetness cabaret although farrokh fantasized that mr garg had used them in some private unmentionable way dr daruwallas dickensian theory was that mr garg was perverse because of his physical appearance the man gave farrokh the creeps mr garg had made an astonishingly vivid impression on dr daruwalla considering that they had met only once vinod had introduced them the enterprising dwarf was also gargs driver mr garg was tall and of military erectness but with the sort of sallow complexion that farrokh associated with a lack of exposure to daylight the skin on gargs face had an unhealthy waxy sheen and it was unusually taut like the skin of a corpse further enhancing mr gargs cadaverlike appearance was an unnatural slackness to his mouth his lips were always parted like the lips of someone whod fallen asleep in a seated position and his eye sockets were dark and bloated as if full of stagnant blood worse mr gargs eyes were as yellow and opaque as a lionsand as unreadable dr daruwalla thought worst of all was the burn scar acid had been flung in mr gargs face which hed managed to turn to the side the acid had shriveled one ear and burned a swath along his jawline and down the side of his throat where the raw pink smear disappeared under the collar of his shirt not even vinod knew whod thrown the acid or why all mr gargs girls needed from dr daruwalla was the trusted physicians assurance to the circuses that these girls were in the pink of health but what could farrokh say about the health of those girls from the brothels some of them were born in brothels certain indications of congenital syphilis were easy to spot and nowadays the doctor couldnt recommend them to a circus without having them tested for aids few circusesnot even the great blue nilewould take a girl if she was hivpositive most of them carried something venereal at the very least the girls always had to be dewormed so few of them were ever taken even by the great blue nile when the girls were rejected by the circus what became of them we are being good by trying vinod would answer did mr garg sell them back to a brothel or did he wait for them to grow old enough to be wetness cabaret material it appalled farrokh that by the standards of kamathipura mr garg was considered a benevolent presence yet dr daruwalla knew of no evidence against mr gargat least nothing beyond the common knowledge that he bribed the police who only occasionally raided the wetness cabaret the doctor had once imagined mr garg as a character in an inspector dhar movie in a first draft of inspector dhar and the cagegirl killer dr daruwalla had written a cameo role for mr garghe was a child molester named acid man then farrokh had thought better of it mr garg was too well known in bombay it might have become a legal matter and thered been the added risk of insulting vinod and deepa which dr daruwalla would never do if garg was no good samaritan the doctor nevertheless believed that the dwarf and his wife were the real thingthey were saints to these children or they tried to be they were as vinod had said being good by trying vinods offwhite ambassador was approaching marine drive when the doctor gave in to the dwarfs nagging all right all rightill examine her dr daruwalla told vinod who is she this time and whats her story she is being a virgin the dwarf explained deepa is saying that she is already an almost boneless girla future plastic lady who is saying shes a virgin the doctor asked she is saying so vinod said garg is telling deepa that the girl is running away from a brothel before anyone is touching her so garg is saying shes a virgin farrokh asked vinod maybe almost a virginmaybe close the dwarf replied i am thinking she used to be a dwarf too vinod added or maybe she is being partdwarf i am almost thinking so thats not possible vinod said dr daruwalla as the dwarf shrugged the ambassador surged into a rotary the roundabout turn caused several tennis balls to roll across farrokhs feet and the doctor heard the clunking of squashracquet handles from under vinods elevated seat the dwarf had explained to dr daruwalla that the handles of badminton racquets were too flimsythey brokeand the handles of tennis racquets were too heavy to swing with sufficient quickness the squashracquet handles were just right only because he already knew where it was farrokh could faintly make out the odd billboard that floated on the boat moored offshore in the arabian sea the hoarding bobbed on the water tiktok tissues were being advertised again tonight and tonight and every night the metal signs on the lampposts promised a good ride on apollo tyres the rushhour traffic along marine drive had long ago subsided and the doctor could tell by the lights from his own apartment that dhar had already arrived the balcony was lit up and julia never sat on the balcony alone theyd probably watched the sunset together the doctor thought he was aware too that the sun had set a long time ago theyll both be mad at me farrokh decided the doctor told vinod that hed examine the almost boneless girl in the morningthe almostavirgin dr daruwalla almost said the halfdwarf or former dwarf the doctor imagined mr gargs girl he thought grimly in the stark lobby of his apartment building farrokh felt for a moment that he could have been anywhere in the modern world but when the elevator door opened he was greeted by a familiar sign which he detested servants are not allowed to use the lift unless accompanied by children the sign assaulted him with a numbing sense of inadequacy it was a part of the pecking order of indian lifenot only the acceptance of discrimination which was worldwide but the deification of it which lowji daruwalla had believed was so infuriatingly indian even though much of it was inherited from the raj farrokh had tried to convince the residents society to remove the offensive sign but the rules about servants were inflexible dr daruwalla was the only resident of the building who wasnt in favor of forcing servants to use the stairs also the residents society discounted farrokhs opinion on the grounds that he was a nonresident indiannri was the doctors official government category if this dispute about the use of the lift was the kind of issue that old lowji would have got himself killed over the younger dr daruwalla selfdeprecatingly viewed his failure with the residents society as typical of his political ineffectualness and his general outofitness as he got off the elevator he said to himself im not a functioning indian the other day someone at the duckworth club had been outraged that a political candidate in new delhi was conducting a campaign strictly on the cow issue dr daruwalla had been unable to contribute an opinion because he was unsure what the cow issue was he was aware of the rise of groups to protect cows and he supposed they were a part of the hindurevivalist wave like those hinduchauvinist holy men proclaiming themselves to be reincarnations of the gods themselvesand demanding to be worshiped as gods too he knew that there was still hindumuslim rioting over the mosque of babarthe underlying subject of his first inspector dhar movie which hed found so funny at the time now thousands of bricks had been consecrated and stamped shri rama which means respected rama and the foundation for a temple to rama had been laid less than feet from the babri mosque not even dr daruwalla imagined that the outcome of the year feud over the mosque of babar would be funny here he was again with his pathetic sense of not belonging he knew that there were sikh extremists but he didnt know one personally at the duckworth club he was on the friendliest terms with mr bakshia sikh novelist and a great conversationalist on the subject of american movie classicsyet theyd never discussed sikh terrorists and farrokh knew about the shiv sena and the dalit panthers and the tamil tigers but he knew nothing personally there were more than million hindus in india there were million muslims and millions of sikhs and christians too there were probably not even parsis farrokh thought but in his own small part of indiain his ugly apartment building on marine driveall these contentious millions were reduced in the doctors mind to what he called the elevator issue concerning the stupid lift all these warring factions concurred they disagreed only with him make the servants climb the stairs farrokh had recently read about a man who was murdered because his mustache gave caste offense apparently the mustache was waxed to curl upit should have drooped down dr daruwalla decided inspector dhar should leave india and never come back and i should leave india and never come back too he thought for so what if he helped a few crippled children in bombay what business did he have even imagining funny movies about a country like this he wasnt a writer and what business did he have taking blood from dwarfs he wasnt a geneticist either thus with a characteristic loss of selfconfidence dr daruwalla entered his apartment to face the music he was certain he would hear hed been late in telling his beloved wife that hed invited his beloved john daruwalla for the evening meal and the doctor had kept them both waiting also hed lacked the courage to tell inspector dhar the upsetting news farrokh felt he was trapped in a circus act of his own creation an annoying pattern of procrastination that he couldnt break out of he was reminded of an item in the great royal circus at first hed found it a charming sort of madness but now he thought it might drive him crazy if he ever saw it again it conveyed such a meaningless but relentless insanity and the accompanying music was so repetitious in dr daruwallas mind the act stood for the lunatic monotony that weighed on everyones life from time to time the item was called load cycle and it was a case of simplicity carried to idiotic extremes there were two bicycles each one pedaled by a very solid stronglooking woman the pair followed each other around the ring they were joined by other plump darkskinned women who found a variety of means by which to mount the moving bicycles some of the women perched on little posts that extended from the hubs of the front and back wheels some mounted the handlebars and wobbled precariously thereothers teetered on the rear fenders and regardless of how many women mounted the bicycles the two stronglooking women kept pedaling then little girls appeared they climbed on the shoulders and stood on the heads of the other womenincluding the laboring sturdy pedalersuntil two struggling pyramids of women were clinging to these two bicycles which never stopped circling the ring the music was of a sustained madness equal to one fragment of the cancan repeated and repeated and all the darkskinned womenboth the fat older women and the little girlswore too much face powder which gave them a minstrellike aura of unreality they also wore palepurple tutus and they smiled and smiled and smiled as they tottered around and around and around the ring the last time the doctor had seen a performance of this item hed thought it would never end perhaps theres a load cycle in everyones life thought dr daruwalla as he paused at the door of his apartment farrokh felt hed been enduring a load cycle sort of day dr daruwalla could imagine the cancan music starting up again as if he were about to be greeted by a dozen darkskinned girls in palepurple tutusall of them whitefaced and moving to the insane incessant rhythm dr daruwalla hides in his bedroom now the elephants will be angry but the past is a labyrinth wheres the way out in the front hall of his apartment where there were no darkskinned whitefaced women in tutus the doctor was halted by the clear but distant sound of his wifes voice it reached him all the way from the balcony where julia was indulging inspector dhar with his favorite view of marine drive on occasion dhar slept on that balcony either when he stayed so late that he preferred to spend the night or else when hed just arrived in bombay and needed to reacquaint himself with the citys smell dhar swore this was the secret to his successful almost instant adjustment to india he could arrive from europe straight from switzerlands fresh airtainted in zürich with restaurant fumes and diesel exhaust with burning coal and hints of sewer gasbut after just two or three days in bombay dhar claimed he was unbothered by the smog or by the two or three million small fires for cooking food in the slums or by the sweet rot of garbage or even by the excremental horror of the four or five million who squatted at the curb or at the waters edge of the surrounding sea for in a city of nine million surely the shit of half of these was evident in the bombay air it took dr daruwalla two or three weeks to adjust to that permeating odor in the front hall where the prevailing smell was of mildew the doctor quietly removed his sandals he deposited his briefcase and his old darkbrown doctors bag he noted that the umbrellas in the umbrella stand were dusty with disuse it had been three months since the end of the monsoon rains even from the closed kitchen he could detect the mutton and the dhalso thats what were having again he thoughtbut the aroma of the evening meal couldnt distract dr daruwalla from the powerful nostalgia of his wife speaking german which she always spoke whenever she and dhar were alone farrokh stood and listened to the austrian rhythms of julias germanalways the ish sound never the ickand in his minds eye he could see her when she was or when hed courted her in her mothers old yellowwalled house in grinzing it was a house cluttered with biedermeier culture there was a bust of franz grillparzer by the coat tree in the foyer the work of a portraitist obsessively committed to childrens innocent expressions dominated the tea room which was crowded with more cutesiness in the form of porcelain birds and silver antelopes farrokh remembered the afternoon hed made a nervous sweeping gesture with the sugar bowlhe broke a paintedglass lamp shade there were two clocks in the room one of them played a fragment of a waltz by lanner on the half hour and a slightly longer fragment of a strauss waltz on the hour the second clock paid similar token acknowledgments to beethoven and schubertunderstandably it was set a full minute behind the other farrokh remembered that while julia and her mother cleaned up the mess hed made of the lamp shade first the strauss and then the schubert played whenever he recalled their many afternoon teas together he could visualize his wife as a teenager she was always dressed in a fashion lady duckworth would have admired julia wore a creamcolored blouse with flounced sleeves and a high ruffled collar they spoke german because her mothers english wasnt as good as theirs nowadays farrokh and julia spoke german only occasionally it was still their lovemaking language or what they spoke in the dark it was the language in which julia had told him i find you very attractive after two years of courting her hed nevertheless felt this was forward of her hed been speechless he was struggling with how to phrase the questionwhether or not she was troubled by his darker colorwhen shed added especially your skin the picture of your skin against my skin is very attractive das bildthe picture when people say that german or any other language is romantic dr daruwalla thought all they really mean is that theyve enjoyed a past in the language there was even a certain intimacy in listening to julia speak german to dhar whom she always called john d this was the servants name for him which julia had adopted much as she and dr daruwalla had adopted the servants they were a feeble old couple nalin and swaroopdr daruwallas children and john d had always called her roopabut theyd outlived lowji and meher whom theyd first served it was a form of semiretirement to work for farrokh and julia they were so infrequently in bombay the rest of the time nalin and roopa were caretakers for the flat if dr daruwalla sold the apartment where could the old couple go hed agreed with julia that they would try to sell the place but only after the old servants died even if farrokh kept returning to india he was rarely in bombay so long that he couldnt afford to stay in a decent hotel once when one of the doctors canadian colleagues had teased him for being so conservative about things julia had remarked farrokh isnt conservativehes absolutely extravagant he maintains an apartment in bombay so that his parents former servants will have a place to live just then the doctor overheard julia say something about the queens necklace which was the local name for the string of lights along marine drive this name originated when the lamplights were white the smog lights were yellow now julia was saying that yellow wasnt a proper color for the necklace of a queen what a european she is dr daruwalla thought he had the greatest affection for the way shed managed to adapt to their life in canada and to their sporadic visits to india without ever losing her oldworld sensibility which remained as distinctive in her voice as in her habit of dressing for dinnereven in bombay it wasnt the content of julias speech that dr daruwalla was listening tohe wasnt eavesdropping it was only to hear the sound of her german her soft accent in combination with such exact phrasing but he realized that if julia was talking about the queens necklace she couldnt possibly have told dhar the upsetting news the doctors heart sank because he realized how much hed been hoping that his wife would have told the dear boy then john d spoke if it soothed farrokh to hear julias german it disturbed him to hear german from inspector dhar in german the doctor could barely recognize the john d he knew and it disquieted dr daruwalla to hear how much more energetically dhar spoke in german than he spoke in english this emphasized to dr daruwalla the distance that had grown between them but dhars university education had been in zürich hed spent most of his life in switzerland and his serious if not widely recognized work as an actor in the theater at the schauspielhaus zürich was something that john daruwalla took more pride in than he appeared to take in the commercial success of his role as inspector dhar why wouldnt his german be perfect there was also not the slightest edge of sarcasm in dhars voice when he spoke to julia farrokh recognized a longstanding jealousy john d is more affectionate to julia than he is to me dr daruwalla thought and after all ive done for him there was a fatherly bitterness to this idea and it shamed him he slipped quietly into the kitchen where the racket of the apparently neverending preparation of the evening meal kept him from hearing the actors welltrained voice besides farrokh had at first and falsely assumed that dhar was merely contributing to the conversation about the queens necklace then dr daruwalla had heard the sudden mention of his own nameit was that old story about the time farrokh took me to watch the elephants in the sea the doctor hadnt wanted to hear more because he was afraid of the detectable tone of complaint he heard emerging in john ds memory the dear boy was recalling that time hed been frightened during the festival of ganesh chaturthi it seemed that half the city had flocked to chowpatty beach where theyd immersed their idols of the elephantheaded god ganesh farrokh hadnt prepared the child for the orgiastic frenzy of the crowdnot to mention the size of the elephant heads many of which were larger than the heads of real elephants farrokh remembered the outing as the first and only time hed seen john d become hysterical the dear boy was crying theyre drowning the elephants now the elephants will be angry and to think that farrokh had criticized old lowji for keeping the boy so sheltered if you take him only to the duckworth club farrokh had told his father whats he ever going to know about india what a hypocrite ive turned out to be dr daruwalla thought for he knew of no one in bombay whod hidden from india as successfully as hed concealed himself at the duckworth clubfor years hed taken an eightyearold to chowpatty beach to watch a mob there were hundreds of thousands dunking their idols of the elephantheaded god in the sea what had he thought the child would make of this it wasnt the time to explain the british ban on gathering their infuriating antiassembly strictures the hysterical eightyearold was too young to appreciate this symbolic demonstration for freedom of expression farrokh tried to carry the crying boy against the grain of the crowd but more and more the giant idols of lord ganesha were pressed against them they were herded back to the sea its just a celebration hed whispered in the childs ear its not a riot in his arms farrokh felt the little boy trembling thus had the doctor realized the full weight of his ignorance not only of india but of the fragility of children now he wondered if john d was telling julia this is my first memory of farrokh and im still getting the dear boy in trouble dr daruwalla thought the doctor distracted himself by poking his nose into the big pot of dhal roopa had long ago added the mutton and she reminded him that he was late by remarking how fortunate it was that mutton usually defied overcooking the rice has dried out she added sadly old nalin ever the optimist tried to make dr daruwalla feel better in his fragmentary english nalin said but plenty of beer dr daruwalla felt guilty that there was always so much beer around the doctors capacity for beer alarmed him and dhars fondness for the brew seemed limitless since nalin and roopa did the shopping the thought of the old couple struggling with those heavy bottles also made dr daruwalla feel guilty and there was the elevator issue because they were servants nalin and roopa werent permitted to ride in the lift even with all those beer bottles the elderly servants trudged up the stairs and plenty of messages nalin told the doctor the old man was very fond of the new answering machine julia had insisted on it because nalin and roopa were terrible at taking messages they couldnt transcribe a phone number or spell anyones name when the machine answered the old man was thrilled to listen to it because he was absolved of any responsibility for the messages farrokh took a beer with him the apartment seemed so small in toronto the daruwallas owned a huge house in bombay the doctor had to sneak through the living room which was also the dining room in order to get to the bedroom and the bathroom but dhar and julia were still talking on the balcony they didnt see him john d was reciting the most famous part of the story it always made julia laugh theyre drowning the elephants john d was crying now the elephants will be angry dr daruwalla never thought that this sounded quite right in german if i run a bath farrokh speculated theyll hear it and know im home ill have a quick wash in the sink instead the doctor thought he spread out a clean white shirt on the bed he chose an uncharacteristically loud necktie with a brightgreen parrot on it it was an old christmas present from john dnot a tie that the doctor would ever wear in public farrokh was unaware how the tie would at least enliven his navyblue suit these were absurd clothes for bombay especially when dining at home but julia was julia after hed washed the doctor took a quick look at his answering machine the message light was flickering he didnt bother to count the number of messages dont listen to them now he warned himself yet the spirit of procrastination was deeply ingrained in him to join in john d and julias conversation would lead to the inevitable confrontation concerning john ds twin as farrokh was deliberating he saw the bundle of mail on his writing desk dhar must have gone out to the film studio and collected the fan mail which was mostly hate mail it had long been their understanding that dr daruwalla deserved the task of opening and reading the mail although the letters were addressed to inspector dhar the content of these letters only rarely concerned dhars acting or lipsyncing skills instead the letters were invariably about the creation of dhars character or about a particular script because it was presumed that dhar was the author of the screenplays and thus the creator of his own character the author himself was the source of the letter writers principal outrage their attacks were leveled at the man whod made it all up before the death threats especially before the reallife murders of actual prostitutes dr daruwalla had been in no great hurry to read his mail but the serial killings of the cage girls had become so publicly acknowledged as imitations of the movie murders that inspector dhars mail had taken a turn for the worse and in the light of mr lals murder dr daruwalla felt compelled to search the mail for threats of any kind he looked at the sizable bundle of new letters and wondered if under these circumstances he should ask dhar and julia to help him read through them as if their evening together didnt promise to be difficult enough maybe later farrokh thoughtif the conversation comes around to it but as he dressed the doctor couldnt ignore the insistent flickering of the message light on his answering machine well he neednt take the time to call anyone back he thought as he knotted his tie surely it wouldnt hurt to hear what these messages were abouthe could just jot them down and return the calls later and so farrokh searched for a pad of paper and a pen which wasnt easy to do without being heard because the tiny bedroom was crammed full of the fragile tinkling victoriana hed inherited from lowjis mansion on ridge road although hed taken only what he couldnt bear to auction even his writing desk was crowded with the bricabrac of his childhood not to mention the photographs of his three daughters they were married and therefore dr daruwallas writing desk also exhibited their wedding picturesand the pictures of his several grandchildren then there were his favorite photographs of john ddownhillskiing at wengen and at klosters crosscountry skiing in pontresina and hiking in zermattand several framed playbills from the schauspielhaus zürich with john daruwalla in both supporting and leading roles he was jean in strindbergs fräulein julie he was christopher mahon in john millington synges ein wahrer held he was achilles in heinrich von kleists penthesilea he was fernando in goethes stella he was ivan in chekhovs onkel vanja he was antonio in shakespeares der kaufmann von venedigonce hed been bassanio shakespeare in german sounded so foreign to farrokh it depressed the doctor that hed lost touch with the language of his romantic years at last he found a pen then he spotted a pad of paper under the silver statuette of ganesh as a baby the little elephantheaded god was sitting on the lap of his human mother parvatia cute pose unfortunately the grotesque reaction to inspector dhar and the cagegirl killer had sickened farrokh with elephants this was unfair for ganesh was merely elephantheaded the god had four human arms with human hands and two human feet also lord ganesha sported only one whole tuskalthough sometimes the god held his broken tusk in one of his four hands ganesh truly bore no resemblance to the drawing of that inappropriately mirthful elephant which in the most recent inspector dhar film was the signature of a serial killerthat unsuitable cartoon which the movie murderer drew on the bellies of slain prostitutes that elephant was no god besides that elephant had both tusks intact even so dr daruwalla was off elephantsin any form the doctor wished hed asked deputy commissioner patel about those drawings that the real murderer was making for the police had said no more to the press than that the artwork of the reallife killer and serial cartoonist was an obvious variation on the movie theme what did that mean the question deeply disturbed dr daruwalla who shuddered to recall the origin of his idea for the cartoondrawing killer the source of the doctors inspiration had been nothing less than an actual drawing on the belly of an actual murder victim twenty years ago dr daruwalla had been the examining physician at the scene of a crime that was never solved now the police were claiming that a killercartoonist had stolen the mocking elephant from a movie but the screenwriter knew where the original idea had come from farrokh had stolen it from a murderermaybe from the same murderer wouldnt the killer know that the most recent inspector dhar movie was imitating him im over my head as usual dr daruwalla decided he also decided that he should give this information to detective patelin case somehow the deputy commissioner didnt already know it but how would patel already know it farrokh wondered secondguessing himself was the doctors second nature at the duckworth club dr daruwalla had been impressed by the composure of the deputy commissioner moreover the doctor couldnt rid himself of the impression that detective patel had been hiding something farrokh interrupted these unwelcome thoughts as quickly as theyd come to him sitting next to his answering machine he turned the volume down before he pushed the button still in hiding the secret screenwriter listened to the messages the firstfloor dogs upon hearing ranjits complaining voice dr daruwalla instantly regretted his decision to forsake even one minute of dhar and julias company for as much as one phone message a few years older than the doctor ranjit had nevertheless maintained both unsuitable expectations and youthful indignation the former involved his ongoing matrimonial advertisements which dr daruwalla found inappropriate for a medical secretary in his sixties ranjits youthful indignation was most apparent in his responses to those women who upon meeting him turned him down naturally ranjit hadnt all this time been conducting nonstop matrimonial advertisements dating back to his earliest employment as old lowjis secretary after exhaustive interviews ranjit had been successfully marriedand long enough before lowjis death so that the senior dr daruwalla had once more enjoyed the secretarys prematrimonial industriousness but ranjits wife had recently died and he was only a few years away from retirement he still worked for the surgical associates at the hospital for crippled children and he always served as farrokhs secretary whenever the canadian was an honorary consultant surgeon in bombay and ranjit had decided that the time for remarrying was ripe he thought he should do it without delay for it made him sound younger to describe himself as a working medical secretary than to confess he was retired just to be sure in his more recent matrimonial advertisements hed attempted to capitalize on both his position and his pending retirement citing that he was rewardingly employed and anticipating a v active early retirement it was things like v active that dr daruwalla found unseemly about ranjits present matrimonials and the fact that ranjit was a shameless liar because of a standard policy at the times of indiathe advertising brides and grooms eschewed revealing their names preferring the confidentiality of a numberit was possible for ranjit to publish a halfdozen ads in the same sundays matrimonial pages ranjit had discovered it was popular to claim that caste was no bar while it was also still popular to declare himself a hindu brahmincasteconscious and religionminded matching horoscopes a must therefore ranjit advertised several versions of himself simultaneously he told farrokh that he was seeking the very best wife with or without casteconsciousness or religion why not give himself the benefit of meeting everyone who was available dr daruwalla was embarrassed that hed been inexorably drawn into the world of ranjits matrimonials every sunday farrokh and julia read through the marriage advertisements in the times of india it was a contest to see which of them could identify all of ranjits ads but ranjits phone message was not of a matrimonial nature once again the aging secretary had called to complain about the dwarfs wife this was ranjits condemning reference to deepa for whom he harbored a forbidding disapprovalthe kind that only mr sethna might have shared dr daruwalla wondered if medical secretaries were universally cruel and dismissive to anyone seeking a doctors attention was such hostility engendered only by a heartfelt desire to protect all doctors from wasting their time to be fair to ranjit deepa was exceptionally aggressive in wasting dr daruwallas time shed called to make a morning appointment for the runaway child prostituteeven before vinod had persuaded the doctor to examine this new addition to mr gargs stable of street girls ranjit described the patient as someone allegedly without bones for deepa had doubtless used her circus terminology boneless with him ranjit was communicating his scorn for the vocabulary of the dwarfs wife from deepas description the child prostitute might have been made of pure plasticanother medical marvel and no doubt a virgin ranjit concluded his sardonic message the next message was an old one from vinod the dwarf must have called while farrokh was still sitting in the ladies garden at the duckworth club the message was really for inspector dhar our favorite inspector is telling me he is sleeping on your balcony tonight the dwarf began if he is changing his mind i am just cruisingjust killing time you know if the inspector is wanting me he is already knowing the doormen at the taj and at the oberoifor messageleaving i am meaning i am having a latenight pickingup at the wetness cabaret vinod admitted but this is being while you are sleeping in the morning i am picking up you as usual by the way i am reading a magazine with me in it the dwarf concluded the only magazines that vinod read were movie magazines where he could occasionally glimpse himself in the celebrity snapshots opening the door of one of his ambassadors for inspector dhar there on the door would be the red circle with the t in it for taxi and the name of the dwarfs company which was often partially obscured vinods blue nile ltd as opposed to great farrokh presumed dhar was the only movie star who rode in vinods cars and the dwarf relished his occasional appearances with his favorite inspector in the filmgossip magazines vinod was enduringly hopeful that other movie stars would follow dhars lead but dimple kapadia and jaya prada and pooja bedi and pooja bhattnot to mention chunky pandey and sunny deol or madhuri dixit and moon moon sen to name only a fewhad all declined to ride in the dwarfs luxury taxis possibly they thought it would damage their reputations to be seen with dhars thug as for the cruising back and forth between the oberoi and the taj these were vinods favorite territories for moonlighting the dwarf was recognized and well treated by the doormen because whenever dhar was in bombay the actor stayed at the oberoi and at the taj by maintaining a suite at both hotels dhar was assured of good service as long as the oberoi and the taj knew they were in competition with each other they outdid themselves to give dhar the utmost privacy the house detectives were harsh with autograph seekers or other celebrity hounds at the reception desk of either hotel if you didnt know the given code name which kept changing you were told that the movie star was not a guest by killing time vinod meant he was picking up extra money the dwarf was good at spotting hapless tourists in the lobbies of both hotels he would offer to drive the foreigners to a good restaurant or wherever they wanted to go vinod was also gifted at recognizing those tourists whod had harrowing taxi experiences and were therefore vulnerable to the temptations of his luxury service dr daruwalla understood that the dwarf could hardly have supported himself by driving only the doctor and dhar around mr garg was a more regular customer farrokh was also familiar with the dwarfs habit of messageleaving for vinod had taken advantage of inspector dhars celebrity status with the doormen at the oberoi and at the taj it may have been awkward but it was vinods only means of putting himself on call there were no cellular phones in bombay car phones were unknowna decided inconvenience in the privatetaxi business which vinod complained about periodically there were radio pagers or beepers but the dwarf wouldnt use them i am preferring to be holding out vinod maintained by which he meant he was waiting for the day when cellular phones would upgrade his cardriving enterprise therefore if farrokh or john d wanted the dwarf they left a message for him with the doormen at the taj and the oberoi but there was another reason for vinod to call vinod didnt like showing up at dr daruwallas apartment building unannounced there was no phone in the lobby and vinod refused to see himself as a servanthe refused to climb the stairs when it came to climbing stairs his dwarfism was a handicap dr daruwalla had protested on vinods behalf to the residents society at first farrokh had argued that the dwarf was a cripplecripples shouldnt be forced to use the stairs the residents society had argued that cripples shouldnt be servants dr daruwalla had countered that vinod was an independent businessman the dwarf was nobodys servant after all vinod owned a privatetaxi company a chauffeur was a servant the residents society said regardless of the absurd ruling farrokh had told vinod that if he ever had to come to the daruwallas sixthfloor flat he was to take the restricted residents elevator but whenever vinod stood in the lobby and waited for the elevatorregardless of the lateness of the hourhis presence would be detected by the firstfloor dogs the firstfloor flats harbored a disproportionate number of dogs and although the doctor was disinclined to believe vinods interpretationthat all dogs hated all dwarfshe could offer no scientifically acceptable reason why all the firstfloor dogs should suddenly awake and commence their frenzied barking whenever vinod was waiting for the forbidden lift and so it was tediously necessary for vinod to arrange an exact time for picking up farrokh or john d so that the dwarf could wait in the ambassador at the curbor in the nearby alleyand not enter the lobby of the apartment building at all besides it sorely tested the delicate ecosystem of the apartment building to have vinod attract the latenight furious attention of the firstfloor dogs and farrokh was already in hot water with the residents societyhis dissent to their opinion on the elevator issue had offended the buildings other residents since the doctor was the son of an acknowledged great manand a famously assassinated great man toothere was other fuel for resenting dr daruwalla that he lived abroad and could still afford to have his apartment occupied by his servantsoften for years without a single visithad certainly made him unpopular if not openly despised that the dogs appeared guilty of discrimination against dwarfs wasnt the sole reason that dr daruwalla disliked them their insane barking disturbed the doctor because of its total irrationality any irrationality reminded farrokh of everything he failed to comprehend about india only that morning hed stood on his balcony and overheard his fifthfloor neighbor dr malik abdul aziza model servant of the almightypraying on the balcony below him when dhar slept on the balcony he often commented to farrokh on how soothing it was to wake up to the prayers of dr aziz praise be to allah lord of creationthat much dr daruwalla had understood and later there was something about the straight path it was a very pure prayerfarrokh had liked it and hed long admired dr aziz for his unswerving faithbut dr daruwallas thoughts had veered sharply away from religion in the direction of politics because he was reminded of the aggressive billboards hed seen around the city the messages on such hoardings were essentially hostile they merely purported to be religious islam is the one path to humanity for all and that wasnt as bad as those shiv sena slogans which were all over bombay maharashtra for maharashtrians or say it with pride im a hindu something evil had corrupted the purity of prayer something as dignified and private as dr aziz with his prayer rug rolled out on his own balcony had been compromised by proselytizing had been distorted by politics and if this madness had a sound farrokh knew it would be the sound of irrationally barking dogs inoperable in the apartment building dr daruwalla and dr aziz were the most consistent early risers surgeries for bothdr aziz was a urologist if he prays every morning so should i farrokh thought politely that morning he had waited for the muslim to finish there followed the shuffling sound of dr azizs slippers as he rolled up his prayer rug while dr daruwalla leafed through his book of common prayer farrokh was looking for something appropriate or at least familiar he was ashamed that his ardor for christianity seemed to be receding into the past or had his faith entirely retreated after all it had been only a minor sort of miracle that had converted him perhaps farrokh needed another small miracle to inspire him now he realized that most christians were faithful without the incentive of any miracle and this realization instantly interfered with his search for a prayer as a christian too hed lately begun to wonder if he was a fake in toronto farrokh was an unassimilated canadianand an indian who avoided the indian community in bombay the doctor was constantly confronted with how little he knew indiaand how unlike an indian he thought himself to be in truth dr daruwalla was an orthopedist and a duckworthian andin both caseshe was merely a member of two private clubs even his conversion to christianity felt false he was merely a holiday churchgoer christmas and easterhe couldnt remember when hed last partaken of the innermost pleasure of prayer although it was quite a mouthfuland it was the whole story of what he was supposed to believe in a nutshelldr daruwalla had begun his experiment in prayer with the socalled apostles creed the standard confession of the faith i believe in god the father almighty maker of heaven and earth farrokh recited breathlessly but the capital letters were a distraction to him he stopped later as he had stepped into the elevator dr daruwalla reflected on how easily his mood for prayer had been lost he resolved that he would compliment dr aziz on his highly disciplined faith at the first opportunity but when dr aziz stepped into the elevator at the fifth floor farrokh was completely flustered he scarcely managed to say good morning doctoryoure looking well why thank youso are you doctor said dr aziz looking somewhat sly and conspiratorial when the elevator door closed and they were alone together dr aziz said have you heard about dr dev farrokh wondered which dr dev there was a dr dev who was a cardiologist there was another dev who was an anesthesiologistthere are a bunch of devs he thought even dr aziz was known in the medical community as urology aziz which was the only sensible way to distinguish him from a halfdozen other dr azizes dr dev dr daruwalla asked cautiously gastroenterology dev said urology aziz oh yes that dr dev farrokh said but have you heard asked dr aziz he has aidshe caught it from a patient and i dont mean from sexual contact from examining a patient dr daruwalla said from a colonoscopy i believe said dr aziz she was a prostitute from a colonoscopy but how dr daruwalla asked at least forty percent of the prostitutes must be infected with the virus dr aziz said among my patients the ones who see prostitutes test hivpositive twenty percent of the time but from a colonoscopy i dont understand how farrokh insisted but dr aziz was too excited to listen i have patients telling mea urologistthat they have cured themselves of aids by drinking their own urine dr aziz said ah yes urine therapy said dr daruwalla very popular but but here is the problem cried dr aziz he pulled a folded piece of paper from his pocket some words were scrawled on the paper in longhand do you know what the kama sutra says dr aziz asked farrokh here was a muslim asking a parsi and a convert to christianity about a hindu collection of aphorisms concerning sexual exploitssome would say love dr daruwalla thought it wise to be careful he said nothing as for urine therapy it was also wise to say nothing moraji desai the former prime minister was a practitioner of urine therapyand wasnt there something called the water of life foundation best to say nothing about that too farrokh concluded besides urology aziz wanted to read something from the kama sutra it would be best to listen among the many situations where adultery is allowed dr aziz said just listen to this when such clandestine relations are safe and a sure method of earning money dr aziz refolded the oftenfolded piece of paper and returned this evidence to his pocket well do you see he said what do you mean farrokh asked well thats the problemobviously dr aziz said farrokh was still trying to figure out how dr dev had caught aids while performing a colonoscopy meanwhile dr aziz had concluded that aids among prostitutes was caused directly by the bad advice given in the kama sutra farrokh doubted that most prostitutes could read this was another example of the firstfloor dogsthey were barking again dr daruwalla smiled nervously all the way to the entrance to the alley where urology aziz had parked his car thered been some brief confusion because vinods ambassador had momentarily blocked the alley but dr aziz was soon on his way farrokh had waited in the alley for the dwarf to turn his car around it was a close narrow alleybrinysmelling because of the proximity of the sea and as warm and steamy as a blocked drain the alley was a haven for the beggars who frequented the small seaside hotels along marine drive dr daruwalla supposed that these beggars were especially interested in the arab clientele they were reputed to give more money but the beggar who suddenly emerged from the alley wasnt one of these he was a badly limping boy who could occasionally be seen standing on his head at chowpatty beach the doctor knew that this wasnt a trick of sufficient promise for vinod and deepa to offer the urchin a home at the circus the boy had slept on the beachhis hair was caked with sandand the first sunlight had driven him into the alley for a few more hours sleep the two automobiles arriving and departing had probably attracted his attention when vinod backed the ambassador into the alley the beggar blocked the doctors way to the car the boy stood with both arms extended palms up there was a veil of mucous over his eyes and a whitish paste marked the corners of his mouth the eyes of the orthopedic surgeon were drawn to the boys limp the beggars right foot was rigidly locked in a rightangle position as if the foot and ankle were permanently fuseda deformity called ankylosis which was familiar to dr daruwalla from the common congenital condition of clubfoot yet both the foot and ankle were unusually flatteneda crush injury the doctor guessedand the boy bore his weight on his heel alone also the bad foot was considerably smaller than the good one this led the doctor to imagine that the injury had damaged the epiphyseal plates which is the region in bones where growth takes place it wasnt only that the boys foot had fused with his ankle his foot had also stopped growing farrokh felt certain that the boy was inoperable just then vinod opened the driversside door the beggar was wary of the dwarf but vinod wasnt brandishing his squashracquet handles the dwarf was nevertheless determined to open the rear door for dr daruwalla who observed that the beggar was taller but frailer than vinodvinod simply pushed the boy out of the way farrokh saw the beggar stumble his mashed foot was as stiff as a hammer once inside the ambassador the doctor lowered the window only enough so that the boy could hear him maaf karo dr daruwalla said gently it was what he always said to beggars forgive me the boy spoke english i dont forgive you he said also in english farrokh said what was on his mind what happened to your foot an elephant stepped on it the cripple replied that would explain it the doctor thought but he didnt believe the story beggars were liars was it being a circus elephant vinod inquired it was just an elephant stepping off a train the boy told the dwarf i was a baby and my father left me lying on the station platformhe was in a bidi shop you were stepped on by an elephant while your father was buying cigarettes farrokh asked this certainly sounded like a tall tale but the cripple listlessly nodded so i suppose your name is ganeshafter the elephant god dr daruwalla asked the boy without appearing to notice the doctors sarcasm the cripple nodded again it was the wrong name for me the boy replied apparently vinod believed the beggar he is being a doctor the dwarf said pointing to farrokh he is fixing you maybe vinod added pointing to the boy but the beggar was already limping away from the car you cant fix what elephants do ganesh said the doctor didnt believe he could fix what the elephant had done either maaf karo dr daruwalla repeated neither stopping nor bothering to look back the cripple made no further response to farrokhs favorite expression then the dwarf drove dr daruwalla to the hospital where one surgery for clubfoot and another for wryneck awaited him farrokh tried to distract himself by daydreaming about a back operationa laminectomy with fusion then dr daruwalla dreamed of something more ambitiousthe placement of harrington rods for a severe vertebral infection with vertebral collapse but even in prepping his surgeries for the clubfoot and the wryneck the doctor would keep thinking about how he might fix the beggars foot farrokh could cut through the fibrous tissue and the contracted shrunken tendonsthere were plastic procedures to elongate tendonsbut the problem with such a crush injury was the bony fusion dr daruwalla would have to saw through bone by damaging the vascular bundles around the foot he could compromise the blood supply the result might be gangrene of course there was always amputation and the fitting of a prosthesis but the boy would probably refuse such an operation in fact farrokh knew his own father would have refused to perform such an operation as a surgeon lowji had lived by the old adage primum non nocereabove all do no harm forget the boy farrokh had thought thus hed performed the clubfoot and the wryneck and thereafter hed faced the membership committee at the duckworth club where he had also lunched with inspector dhar a lunch much disturbed by the death of mr lal and the discomfort that dcp patel had caused them dr daruwalla had had a busy day and now as he listened to the phone messages on his answering machine farrokh was trying to imagine the precise moment in the bougainvillea by the ninth green when mr lal had been struck down perhaps when dr daruwalla was in surgery possibly before when hed encountered dr aziz on the elevator or one of the times when hed said maaf karo to the crippled beggar whose english was unbelievably good doubtless the boy was one of those enterprising beggars who sold himself as a guide to foreign tourists cripples were the best hustlers farrokh knew many of them had maimed themselves some of them had been purposefully injured by their parentsfor being crippled improved their opportunities as beggars these thoughts of mutilation especially of selfinflicted wounds led the doctor to thinking about the hijras again then his thoughts returned to the golfcourse murder in retrospect what astonished dr daruwalla was how anyone could have gotten close enough to mr lal to strike the old golfer with his own putter for how could you sneak up on a man who was flailing away in the flowers his body would have been twisting from side to side and bending over to fuss with the stupid ball and where would his golf bag have been not far away how could anyone approach mr lals golf bag take out the putter and then hit mr lalall when mr lal wasnt looking it wouldnt work in a movie farrokh knewnot even in an inspector dhar movie that was when the doctor realized that mr lals murderer had to have been someone mr lal knew and if the murderer had been another golferpresumably with his own bag of clubswhy would he have needed to use mr lals putter but what a nongolfer could have been doing in the vicinity of the ninth greenand still not have aroused mr lals suspicionswas at least for the moment quite beyond the imaginative powers of inspector dhars creator farrokh wondered what sort of dogs were barking in the killers head angry dogs dr daruwalla supposed for in the murderers mind there was such a terrifying irrationality the mind of dr aziz would appear reasonable in comparison but then farrokhs speculations on this subject were interrupted by the third phone message the doctors answering machine was truly relentless goodness cried the unidentified voice it was a voice of such lunatic exuberance dr daruwalla presumed it was no one he knew too many messages for once the jesuits dont know everything at first farrokh failed to recognize the hysterical enthusiasm that characterized the voice of the everoptimistic father cecil who was and therefore easily panicked by the challenge to speak clearly and calmly to an answering machine father cecil was the senior priest at st ignatius an indian jesuit of unrelenting good cheer as such he stood in startling juxtaposition to the father rectorfather julianwho was years old and english and one of those intellectual jesuits with a caustic disposition father julian was so sarcastic that he was an instant source of renewing dr daruwallas combined awe and suspicion of catholics but the message was from father ceciltherefore free of facetiousness goodness father cecil began as if offering a general description of the world he saw all around him what now thought dr daruwalla because he was among the distinguished alumni of st ignatius school farrokh was frequently asked to give inspirational speeches to the students in previous years hed also addressed the young womens christian association hed once been an active member of the catholic and anglican community for christian unity and the socalled hope alive committee but such activities failed to interest him anymore dr daruwalla sincerely hoped that father cecil wasnt calling him with a repeat request for the doctor to relate again the stirring experience of his conversion after all despite dr daruwallas past commitment to catholic and anglican unity he was an anglican he felt uncomfortable in the presence of a certain overzealous albeit small percentage of the faithful followers of st ignatius church farrokh had declined a recent invitation to speak at the catholic charismatic information centre the suggested topic had been the charismatic renewal in india the doctor had replied that his own small experiencethe entirely quiet little miracle of his conversiondidnt compare to ecstatic religious experiences speaking in tongues and spontaneous healing and so forth but a miracle is a miracle father cecil had said to farrokhs surprise father julian had taken the doctors side i quite agree with dr daruwalla father julian had said his experience hardly qualifies as a miracle at all dr daruwalla had been miffed he was quite willing to portray his conversion experience as a lowkey kind of miracle he was always humble when relating the story there were no marks on his body that even remotely resembled the wounds on the crucified body of christ his was no stigmata story he wasnt one of those nonstop bleeders but for the father rector to dismiss his experience as hardly qualifying as a miracle at all well this sorely vexed dr daruwalla the insult fueled farrokhs insecurities and prejudices in regard to the superior education of the jesuits they were not only holier than thou they were more knowing than thou but the message was about dhars twin not about the doctors conversion of course dhars twin was the first american missionary in the highly esteemed year history of st ignatius neither the church nor the school had been blessed with an american missionary before dhars twin was what the jesuits call a scholastic which dr daruwalla already understood to mean that hed endured much religious and philosophic study and that hed taken his simple vows however the doctor knew dhars twin was still a few years away from being ordained as a priest this was a period of soulsearching dr daruwalla supposedthe final test of those simple vows the vows themselves gave farrokh the shivers poverty chastity obediencethey werent so simple it was hard to imagine the progeny of a hollywood screenwriter like danny mills opting for poverty it was harder still to conceive of the offspring of veronica rose choosing chastity and regarding the tricky jesuitical ramifications of obedience dr daruwalla knew that he himself didnt know nearly enough what he also suspected was that should one of those crafty jesuits try to explain obedience to him the explanation itself would be a marvel of equivocationof oversubtle reasoningand in the end farrokh would have no clearer understanding of a vow of obedience than hed had before in dr daruwallas estimation the jesuits were intellectually crafty and sly and this was hardest of all for the doctor to imagine that a child of danny mills and veronica rose could be intellectually crafty and sly even dhar whod had a decent european education was no intellectual but then dr daruwalla reminded himself that dhar and his twin could also be the genetic creation of neville eden neville had always struck farrokh as crafty and sly what a puzzle just what was a man who was almost doing by becomingor trying to becomea priest what failures had led him to this farrokh assumed that only blunders or disillusionments could lead a man to vows of such a radically repressive nature now here was father cecil saying that young martin had mentioned in a letter that dr daruwalla was an old friend of the family so his name was martirimartin mills farrokh remembered that in her letter to him vera had already told him this and young martin wasnt so young dr daruwalla knewexcept to father cecil who was but the gist of father cecils phone message caught dr daruwalla by surprise do you know exactly when hes coming father cecil asked what does he meando i know farrokh thought why doesnt he know but neither father julian nor father cecil could remember exactly when martin mills was arriving they blamed brother gabriel for losing the americans letter brother gabriel had come to bombay and st ignatius after the spanish civil war hed been on the communist side and his first contribution to st ignatius had been to collect the russian and byzantine icons for which the mission chapel and its iconcollection room were famous brother gabriel was also in charge of the mail when farrokh was or and a student at st ignatius brother gabriel would have been or dr daruwalla remembered that brother gabriel was at that time still struggling to learn hindi and marathi and that his english was melodious with a spanish accent the doctor recalled a short sturdy man in a black cassock exhorting an army of sweepers to raise more and more clouds of dust from the stone floors farrokh also remembered that brother gabriel was in charge of the other servants and the garden and the kitchen and the linen roomin addition to the mail but the icons were his passion he was a friendly vigorous man neither an intellectual nor a priest and dr daruwalla calculated that today brother gabriel would be around no wonder hes losing letters farrokh thought so no one knew exactly when dhars twin would arrive father cecil added that the americans teaching duties would commence almost immediately st ignatius didnt recognize the week between christmas and new years as a holiday only christmas day and new years day were school vacations an annoyance that farrokh remembered from his own school days the doctor guessed that the school was still sensitive to the charge made by many nonchristian parents that christmas was overemphasized it was possible father cecil opined that young martin would make contact with dr daruwalla before he contacted anyone at st ignatius or perhaps the doctor had already heard from the american already heard thought dr daruwalla in a panic here was dhars twindue to arrive any day nowand dhar still didnt know and the naïve american would arrive at sahar airport at or in the morning that was when all the flights from europe and north america arrived dr daruwalla presumed that all americans coming to india were naïve at that dreadfully early hour st ignatius would quite literally be closedlike a castle like an army barracks like the compound or the cloister that it was if the priests and brothers didnt know exactly when martin mills was arriving no one would leave any lights on or any doors open for himno one would meet his plane and so the bewildered missionary might come directly to dr daruwalla he might simply show up on the doctors doorstep at or in the morning dr daruwalla presumed that all missionaries coming to india were bewildered farrokh couldnt remember what hed written to vera had he given the horrid woman his home address or the address of the hospital for crippled children fittingly shed written to him in care of the duckworth club of bombay of all of india it was possibly only the duckworth club that vera remembered doubtless shed repressed the cow damn other peoples messes dr daruwalla was muttering aloud he was a surgeon as such he was an extremely neat and tidy man the sheer sloppiness of human relationships appalled him especially those relationships to which he felt hed brought a special responsibility and care brothersister brotherbrother childparent parentchild what was the matter with human beings that they made such a shambles out of these basic relationships dr daruwalla didnt want to hide dhar from his twin he didnt want to hurt dannywith the cruel evidence of what his wife had done and how shed liedbut he felt he was largely protecting vera by helping her to keep her lie intact as for dhar he was so disgusted by everything hed heard about his mother hed stopped being curious about her when he was in his twenties hed never expressed a desire to know hernot even to meet her admittedly his curiosity about his father had persisted into his thirties but dhar had lately seemed resigned to the fact that he would never know him perhaps the proper word was hardened not resigned at john d had simply grown accustomed to not knowing his mother and father but who wouldnt want to know or at least meet his own twin why not simply introduce the fool missionary to his twin the doctor asked himself martin this is your brotheryoud better get used to the idea dr daruwalla presumed that all missionaries were in one way or another fools telling the truth to dhars twin would serve vera right farrokh thought it might even prevent martin mills from doing anything as confining as becoming a priest it was most definitely the anglican in dr daruwalla that stopped short of the very idea of chastity which seemed utterly confining to him farrokh remembered what his contentious father had had to say about chastity lowji had considered the subject in the light of gandhis experience the mahatma had been married at he was when he took a vow of sexual abstinence by my calculations lowji had said this amounts to twentyfour years of sex many people dont have that many years of sex in their entire lifetime so the mahatma chose sexual abstinence after twentyfour years of sexual activity he was a bloody womanizer flanked by a bunch of mary magdalenes as with all his fathers pronouncements that voice of steadfast authority rang down through the years for old lowji proclaimed everything in the same strident inflammatory tones he mocked he defamed he provoked he advised whether he was giving good advice usually of a medical nature or speaking out of the most dire prejudiceor expressing the most eccentric simplistic opinionlowji had the tone of voice of a selfdeclared expert to everyone and in consideration of all subjects he used the same famous tone of voice with which hed made a name for himself in the days of independence and during the partition when hed so authoritatively addressed the issue of disaster medicine in order of importance look for dramatic amputations and severe extremity injuries before treating fractures or lacerations best to leave all head injuries to the experts if there are any it was a pity that such sensible advice was wasted on a movement that didnt last although the present volunteers in the field still spoke of disaster medicine as a worthy cause upon that memory dr farrokh daruwalla attempted to extricate himself from the past he forced himself to view the melodrama of dhars twin as the particular crisis at hand with refreshing and unusual clarity the doctor decided that it should be dhars decision whether or not poor martin mills should know that he had a twin brother martin mills wasnt the twin the doctor knew and loved it should be a matter of what the doctors beloved john d wanted to know his brother or not to know him and to hell with danny and vera and whatever mess they might have made of their livesespecially to hell with vera she would be farrokh realized and danny was almost years older they were both old enough to face the music like grownups but dr daruwallas reasoning was entirely swept away by the next phone message alongside which everything to do with dhar and his twin assumed the lesser stature of gossip of mere trivia patel here said the voice which instantly impressed farrokh with a moral detachment hed never known anesthesiology patel radiology patel it was a gujarati namethere werent all that many patels in bombay and then with a sensation of sudden coldnessalmost as cold as the voice on his answering machinefarrokh knew who it was it was deputy commissioner patel the real policeman he must be the only gujarati on the bombay police force farrokh thought for surely the local police were mostly maharashtrians doctor the detective said there is quite a different subject we must discussnot in dhars presence please i want to speak with you alone the hanging up of the phone was as abrupt as the message had he not been so agitated by the call dr daruwalla might have prided himself for his insight as a screenwriter for hed always given inspector dhar a similar succinctness when speaking on the telephoneespecially to answering machines but the screenwriter took no pride in the accuracy of his characterization instead farrokh was overcome with curiosity regarding what the different subject that detective patel wished to discuss was not to mention why this subject couldnt be discussed in front of dhar at the same time dr daruwalla absolutely dreaded the deputy commissioners presumed knowledge of crime was there another clue to mr lals murder or another threat to dhar or was this different subject the cagegirl killingsthe reallife murders of those prostitutes not the movie version but the doctor had no time to contemplate the mystery with the next phone message dr daruwalla was once more ensnared by the past the same old scare a brandnew threat it was an old message one hed been hearing for years hed received these calls in toronto and in bombay both at his home and at his office hed tried having the calls traced but without success they were made from public phonesfrom post offices hotel lobbies airports hospitals and regardless of how familiar farrokh was with the content of these calls the hatred that inspired them never failed to engage his complete attention the voice full of cruel mockery began by quoting old lowjis advice to the disaster medicine volunteers look for dramatic amputations and severe extremity injuries the voice began and then interrupting itself the voice said when it comes to dramatic amputationsyour fathers head was off completely off i saw it sitting on the passenger seat before the flames engulfed the car and when it comes to severe extremity injurieshis hands couldnt let go of the steering wheel even though his fingers were on fire i saw the burned hairs on the backs of his hands before the crowd formed and i had to slip away and your father said it was best to leave all head injuries to the expertswhen it comes to head injuries im the expert i did it i blew his head off i watched him burn and im telling you he deserved it your whole family deserves it it was the same old scarehed been hearing it for yearsbut it never affected dr daruwalla any less he sat shivering in his bedroom as hed sat shivering about a hundred times before his sister in london had never received these calls farrokh assumed that she was spared only because the caller didnt know her married name his brother jamshed had received these calls in zürich the calls to both brothers had been recorded on various answering machines and on several tapes made by the police once in zürich the daruwalla brothers and their wives had listened to one of these recordings over and over again no one recognized the voice of the caller but to farrokhs and jamsheds surprise their wives were convinced that the caller was a woman the brothers had always thought the voice was unmistakably a mans as sisters julia and josefine were adamant in regard to the mystical correctness of anything they agreed about the caller was a womanthey were sure the dispute was still raging when john d arrived at jamshed and josefines apartment for dinner everyone insisted that inspector dhar should settle the argument after all an actor has a trained voice and acute powers for studying and imitating the voices of others john d listened to the recording only once its a man trying to sound like a woman he said dr daruwalla was outragednot so much by the opinion which the doctor found simply outlandish but by the infuriating authority with which john d had spoken it was the actor speaking the doctor was certainthe actor in his role as detective that was where the arrogant selfassured manner came fromfrom fiction everyone had objected to dhars conclusion and so the actor had rewound the tape hed listened to it againactually two more times then suddenly the mannerisms that dr daruwalla associated with inspector dhar vanished it was a serious apologetic john d who spoke to them im sorryi was wrong john d said its a woman trying to sound like a man because this assessment was spoken with a different kind of confidence and not at all as inspector dhar would have delivered the line dr daruwalla said rewind it play it again this time theyd all agreed with john d it was a woman and she was trying to sound like a man it was no one whose voice theyd ever heard beforetheyd all agreed to that too her english was almost perfectvery british she had only a trace of a hindi accent i did it i blew his head off i watched him burn and im telling you he deserved it your whole family deserves it the woman had said for years probably more than times but who was she where did her hatred come from and had she really done it her hatred might be even stronger if shed not done it but then why take credit for doing it the doctor wondered how could anyone have hated lowji that much farrokh knew that his father had said much to offend everybody but to farrokhs knowledge his father hadnt personally wronged anyone it was easy in india to assume that the source of any violence was either political outrage or religious offense when someone as prominent and outspoken as lowji was blown up by a car bomb it was automatic to label the killing an assassination but farrokh had to wonder if his father might have inspired a more personal anger and if his killing hadnt been just a plain old murder it was hard for farrokh to imagine anyone especially a woman with a private grievance against his father then he thought of the deeply personal loathing that mr lals murderer must feel for inspector dhar more members die if dhar remains a member and it occurred to dr daruwalla that perhaps they were all being hasty to assume it was dhars movie persona that had inspired such a venomous anger had dr daruwallas dear boyhis beloved john dgot himself into some private trouble was this a case of a personal relationship that had soured into a murderous hatred dr daruwalla felt ashamed of himself that hed inquired so little about dhars personal life he feared hed given john d the impression that he was indifferent to the younger mans private affairs certainly john d was chaste when he was in bombay at least he said he was there were the public appearances with starletsthe everavailable cinema bimbosbut such couplings were choreographed to create the desired scandal which both parties would later deny these werent relationshipsthey were publicity the inspector dhar movies thrived on giving offensein india a risky enterprise yet the senselessness of murdering mr lal indicated a hatred more vicious than anything dr daruwalla could detect in the usual reactions to dhar as if on cue as if prompted by the mere thought of giving or taking offense the next phone message was from the director of all the inspector dhar movies balraj gupta had been pestering dr daruwalla about the extremely touchy subject of when to release the new inspector dhar movie because of the prostitute killings and the general disfavor incurred by inspector dhar and the cagegirl killer gupta had delayed its opening and he was increasingly impatient dr daruwalla had privately decided that he never wanted the new inspector dhar film to be seen but he knew that the movie would be released he couldnt stop it nor could he appeal to balraj guptas deficient instincts for social responsibility much longer such maladroit feelings as gupta might have had for the reallife murdered prostitutes were shortlived gupta here the director said look at it this way the new one will cause new offense whoever is killing the cage girls might give it up and kill someone else we give the public something new to make them wild and crazywell be doing the prostitutes a favor balraj gupta possessed the logic of a politician the doctor had no doubt that the new inspector dhar movie would make a different group of moviegoers wild and crazy it was called inspector dhar and the towers of silence the title alone would be offensive to the entire parsi community because the towers of silence were the burial wells for the parsi dead there were always naked corpses of parsis in the towers of silence which was why dr daruwalla had first supposed that they were the attraction to the first vulture hed seen above the golf course at the duckworth club the parsis were understandably protective of their towers of silence as a parsi dr daruwalla knew this very well yet in the new inspector dhar movie someone is murdering western hippies and depositing their bodies in the towers of silence many indians readily took offense at european and american hippies when they were alive doongarwadi is an accepted part of bombay culture at the very least the parsis would be disgusted and all bombayites would reject the premise of the film as absurd no one can get near the towers of silencenot even other parsis not unless theyre dead but of course dr daruwalla thought proudly that was what was neat and tricky about the filmhow the bodies are deposited there and how the intrepid inspector dhar figures this out with resignation dr daruwalla knew that he couldnt stall the release of inspector dhar and the towers of silence much longer he could however fastforward through balraj guptas remaining arguments for releasing the film immediately besides the doctor enjoyed the highspeed distortion of balraj guptas voice far more than he appreciated the real thing while the doctor was being playful he came to the last message on his answering machine the caller was a woman at first farrokh supposed it was no one he knew is that the doctor she asked it was a voice long past exhaustion of someone who was terminally depressed she spoke as if her mouth were too wide open as if her lower jaw were permanently dropped there was a deadpan dontgiveadamn quality to her voice and her accent was plain and flatnorth american surely but dr daruwalla who was good at accents guessed more specifically that she was from the american midwest or the canadian prairies omaha or sioux city regina or saskatoon is that the doctor she asked i know who you really are i know what you really do the woman went on tell the deputy commissionerthe real policeman tell him who you are tell him what you do the hangup was a little out of control as if shed meant to slam the phone into its cradle but in her restrained anger had missed the mark farrokh sat trembling in his bedroom from the dining room of his apartment he could now hear roopa laying out their supper on the glasstopped table she would any minute announce to dhar and julia that the doctor was home and that their extraordinarily late meal was finally served julia would wonder why hed snuck into the bedroom like a thief in truth farrokh felt like a thiefbut one unsure of what hed stolen and from whom dr daruwalla rewound the tape and replayed the last message this was a brandnew threat and because he was concentrating so hard upon the meaning of the call the doctor almost missed the most important clue which was the caller farrokh had always known that someone would discover him as inspector dhars creator that part of the message was not unexpected but why was this any business of the real policeman why did someone think that deputy commissioner patel should know i know who you really are i know what you really do but so what the screenwriter thought tell him who you are tell him what you do but why farrokh wondered then by accident the doctor found himself listening repeatedly to the womans opening line the part hed almost missed is that the doctor he played it again and again until his hands were shaking so badly that he rewound the tape all the way into balraj guptas list of reasons for releasing the new inspector dhar film now is that the doctor dr daruwallas heart had never seemed to stand so still before it cant be her he thought but it was herfarrokh was sure of it after all these yearsit couldnt be but of course he realized if it was her she would know with an intelligent guess she could have figured it out that was when his wife burst into the bedroom farrokh julia said i never knew you were home but im not home the doctor thought im in a very very foreign country liebchen he said softly to his wife whenever he used the german endearment julia knew he was feeling tenderor else he was in trouble what is it liebchen she asked him he held out his hand and she went to him she sat close enough beside him to feel that he was shivering she put her arms around him please listen to this farrokh said to her bitte the first time julia listened farrokh could see by her face that she was making his mistake she was concentrating too hard on the content of the message never mind what she says said dr daruwalla think about who she is it was the third time before farrokh saw julias expression change its her isnt it he asked his wife but this is a much older woman julia said quickly its been twenty years julia dr daruwalla said she would be a much older woman now she is a much older woman they listened together a few more times at last julia said yes i think it is her but whats her connection with whats happening now in the cold bedroomin his funereal navyblue suit which was comically offset by the brightgreen parrot on his necktiedr daruwalla was afraid that he knew what the connection was the skywalk the past surrounded him like faces in a crowd among them there was one he knew but whose face was it as always something from the great royal circus offered itself as a beacon the ringmaster pratap singh was married to a lovely woman named sumitraeveryone called her sumi she was in her thirties possibly her forties and she not only played the role of mother to many of the child performers she was also a gifted acrobat sumi performed in the item called doublewheel cycle a bicycle act with her sisterinlaw suman suman was prataps unmarried adopted sister she must have been in her late twenties possibly her thirties when dr daruwalla last saw hera petite and muscular beauty and the best acrobat in prataps troupe her name meant rose floweror was it scent of the rose flower or merely the scent of flowers in general farrokh had never actually known no more than he knew the story concerning when suman had been adopted or by whom it didnt matter suman and sumis bicycle duet was much loved they could ride their bicycles backward or lie down on them and pedal them with their hands they could ride them on one wheel like unicycles or pedal them while sitting on the handlebars perhaps it was a special softness in farrokh that he took such pleasure from seeing two pretty women do something so graceful together but suman was the star and her skywalk item was the best act in the great royal circus pratap singh had taught suman how to skywalk after hed seen it performed on television farrokh supposed that the act had originated with one of the european circuses the ringmaster couldnt resist training everyone not just the lions hed installed a ladderlike device on the roof of the family troupe tent the rungs of the ladder were loops of rope and the ladder was bracketed to extend horizontally across the tent roof suman hung upside down with her feet in the loops she swung herself back and forth the loops chafing the tops of her feet which she kept rigidat right angles to her ankles when shed gathered the necessary momentum she walked upside downfrom one end of the ladder to the othersimply by stepping her feet in and out of the loops as she swung when she practiced this across the roof of the family troupe tent her head was only inches above the dirt floor pratap singh stood next to her to catch her if she fell but when suman performed the skywalk from the top of the main tent she was feet from the dirt floor and she refused to use a net if pratap singh had tried to catch herif suman fellthey both would have been killed if the ringmaster threw his body under her trying to guess where shed land pratap might break sumans fall then only he would be killed there were loops in the ladder the audience silently counted sumans steps but suman never counted her steps it was better she said to just walk pratap told her it wasnt a good idea to look down between the top of the tent and the faraway floor there were only the upsidedown faces of the audience staring back at herwaiting for her to fall that was what the past was like thought dr daruwallaall those swaying upsidedown faces it wasnt a good idea to look at them he knew second honeymoon before his conversion farrokh mocks the faithful twenty years ago when he was drawn to goa by his epicurean nostalgia for porkscarce in the rest of india but a staple of goan cuisinedr daruwalla was converted to christianity by the big toe of his right foot he spoke of his religious conversion with the sincerest humility that the doctor had recently visited the miraculously preserved mummy of st francis xavier was not the cause of his conversion previous to his personal experience with divine intervention dr daruwalla had even mocked the saints relics which were kept under glass in the basilica de bom jesus in old goa farrokh supposed that hed made fun of the missionarys remains because he enjoyed teasing his wife about her religion although julia was never a practicing catholic and she often expressed how it pleased her to have left the roman trappings of her childhood in vienna nevertheless prior to their marriage farrokh had submitted to some tedious religious instruction from a viennese priest the doctor had understood that he was demonstrating a kind of theological passivity only to satisfy julias mother butagain to tease juliafarrokh insisted on referring to the ringblessing ceremony as the ringwashing ritual and he pretended to be more offended by this catholic charade than he was in truth hed enjoyed telling the priest that although he was unbaptized and had never been a practicing zoroastrian he nonetheless had always believed in something at the time hed believed in nothing at all and hed calmly lied to both the priest and julias motherthat he had no objections to his children being baptized and raised as roman catholics he and julia had privately agreed that this was a worthwhile if not entirely innocent deceptionagain to put julias mother at ease it hadnt hurt his daughters to have them baptized farrokh supposed when julias mother was still alive and only when shed visited the daruwallas and their children in toronto or when the daruwallas had visited her in vienna it had never been too painful to attend mass farrokh and julia had told their little girls that they were making their grandmother happy this was an acceptable even an honorable tradition in the history of christian churchgoing to go through the motions of worship as a favor to a family member who appeared to be that most intractable personage a true believer no one had objected to this occasional enactment of a faith that was frankly quite foreign to them all maybe even to julias mother farrokh sometimes wondered if she had been going through the motions of worship only to please them it was exactly as the daruwallas had anticipated when julias mother died the familys intermittent catholicism more than lapsedtheir churchgoing virtually stopped in retrospect dr daruwalla concluded that his daughters had been preconditioned to accept that all religion was nothing more than going through the motions of worship to make someone else happy it had been to please the doctor after his conversion that his daughters were administered the sacrament of marriage and other rites and ceremonies according to the anglican church of canada maybe this was why father julian was so dismissive of the miracle by which farrokh had been converted to christianity in the father rectors opinion it must have been only a minor miracle if the experience managed merely to make dr daruwalla an anglican in other words it hadnt been enough of a miracle to make the doctor a roman catholic it was a good time to go to goa farrokh had thought the trip is a kind of second honeymoon for julia hed told his father what kind of honeymoon is it when you take the children lowji had asked he and meher resented that their three granddaughters werent being left with them farrokh knew that the girls who were and would not have stood for being left behind the reputation of the goa beaches was far more exciting to them than the prospect of staying with their grandparents and the girls were determinedly committed to this vacation because john d was going to be there no other babysitter could command such authority over them they were decidedly in love with their adopted elder brother in june of john d was andespecially to dr daruwallas daughtersan extremely handsome european julia and farrokh certainly admired the beautiful boy but less for his good looks than for his tolerant disposition toward their children not every yearold boy could stomach so much giddy affection from three underage girls but john d was patient even charming with them and having been schooled in switzerland john d would probably be undaunted by the freaks who overran goaor so farrokh had thought in the european and american hippies were called freaksespecially in india this is some second honeymoon my dear old lowji had said to julia he is taking you and the children to the dirty beaches where the freaks debauch themselves and it is all because of his love of pork with this blessing did the younger daruwallas depart for the former portuguese enclave farrokh told julia and john d and his indifferent daughters that the churches and cathedrals of goa were among the gaudier landmarks of indian christendom dr daruwalla was a connoisseur of goan architecture monumentality and massiveness he enjoyed excessiveness which was also reflected in the doctors diet he found thrilling he preferred the cathedral of st catherine da se and the façade of the franciscan church to the unimpressive church of the miraculous cross but his overall preference for the basilica de bom jesus wasnt rooted in his architectural snobbery rather he was wildly amused by the silliness of the pilgrimseven hinduswho flocked to the basilica to view the mummified remains of st francis it is suspected especially among nonchristians in india that st francis xavier contributed more to the christianization of goa after his death than the jesuit had managedin his short stay of only a few monthswhile he was alive he died and was buried on an island off the cantonese coast but when he suffered the further indignity of disinterment it was discovered that hed hardly decomposed at all the miracle of his intact body was shipped back to goa where his remarkable remains drew crowds of frenzied pilgrims farrokhs favorite part of the story concerned a woman who with the worshipful intensity of the most devout bit off a toe of the splendid corpse xavier would lose more of himself too the vatican required that his right arm be shipped to rome without which evidence st franciss canonization might never have occurred how dr daruwalla loved this story how hungrily he viewed the shriveled relic which was richly swaddled in vestments and brandished a staff of gold the staff itself was encrusted with emeralds the doctor assumed that the saint was kept under glass and elevated on a gabled monument in order to discourage other pilgrims from demonstrating their devotion with more zealous biting chuckling to himself while remaining outwardly most respectful dr daruwalla had surveyed the mausoleum with restrained glee all around him even on the casket were numerous depictions of xaviers missionary heroics but none of the saints adventuresnot to mention the surrounding silver or the crystal or the alabaster or the jasper or even the purple marblewas as impressive to farrokh as st franciss gobbled toe now thats what i call a miracle the doctor would say to have seen that might even have made a christian out of me when he was in a less playful temper farrokh harangued julia with tales of the holy inquisition in goa for the missionary zeal that followed the portuguese was marked by conversions under threat of death confiscation of hindu property and the burning of hindu templesnot to mention the burning of heretics and grandly staged acts of faith how it would have pleased old lowji to hear his son carrying on in this irreverent fashion as for julia she found it irritating that farrokh so resembled his father in this respect when it came to baiting anyone who was even remotely religious julia was superstitious and opposed i dont mock your lack of belief the doctors wife told him dont blame me for the inquisition or laugh about st franciss poor toe the doctor is turned on farrokh and julia rarely argued with any venom but they enjoyed teasing each other an exaggerated dramatic banter which they werent inclined to suppress in public places made the couple appear quarrelsome to the usual eavesdroppershotel staff waiters or the sad couple with nothing to say to each other at an adjacent table in those days in the s when the daruwallas traveled en famille the girlish hysteria of their daughters added to the general rumpus therefore when they undertook their outing in june of the daruwallas declined several invitations to lodge themselves in some of the better villas in old goa because they were such a loud mob and because dr daruwalla enjoyed eating at all times of the day and night they thought it wiser and more diplomaticat least until the children were oldernot to stay in another familys mansion with all the breakable portuguese pottery and the polished rosewood furniture instead the daruwallas occupied one of those beach hotels that even then had seen better days but could neither be destroyed by the children nor offended by dr daruwallas unceasing appetite the spirited teasing between farrokh and julia was entirely overlooked by the ragged staff and the worldweary clientele of the hotel bardez where the food was plentiful and fresh if not altogether appetizing and where the rooms were almost clean after all it was the beach that mattered the bardez had been recommended to dr daruwalla by one of the younger members of the duckworth club the doctor wished he could remember exactly who had praised the hotel and why but only snippets of the recommendation had remained in his memory the guests were mostly europeans and farrokh had thought that this would appeal to julia and put young john d at ease julia had teased her husband regarding the concept of putting john d at ease it was absurd she pointed out to imagine that the young man could be more at ease than he already was as for the european clientele they werent the sort of people julia would ever want to know they were trashy even by john ds standards in his university days in zürich john d was probably as morally relaxed as other young menor so dr daruwalla supposed as for the daruwalla contingent john d certainly stood out among them he was as serenely composed as ethereally calm as the daruwalla daughters were frenetic the daughters were fascinated by the more unlikable european guests at the hotel bardez although they clung to john d he was their protector whenever the young women or the young men both in their string bikinis would come too close in truth it appeared that these young women and young men approached the daruwalla family solely to have a better view of john d whose sublime beauty surpassed that of other young men in general and other yearolds in particular even farrokh tended to gape at john d although he knew from jamshed and josefine that only the dramatic arts interested the young man and that especially for these thespian pursuits he seemed inappropriately shy but to see the boy farrokh thought belied all the worries hed heard expressed by his brother and sisterinlaw it was julia who first said that john d looked like a movie star she said she meant by this that you were drawn to watch him even when he appeared to be doing nothing or thinking of nothing in addition his wife pointed out to dr daruwalla john d projected an indeterminate age when he was closely shaven his skin was so perfectly smooth that he seemed much younger than almost prepubescent but when he allowed his beard to grow even only as much as one days stubble he became a grown manat least in his late twentiesand he looked savvy and cocksure and dangerous this is what you mean by a movie star farrokh asked his wife this is whats attractive to women julia said frankly that boy is a man and a boy but for the first few days of his vacation dr daruwalla was too distracted to think about john ds potential as a movie star julia had made farrokh nervous about the duckworthian source of the recommendation for the hotel bardez it was amusing to observe the european trash and the interesting goans but what if other duckworthians were guests of the hotel bardez it would be as if theyd never left bombay julia said and so the doctor nervously examined the hotel bardez for stray duckworthians fearing that the sorabjees would mysteriously materialize in the caférestaurant or the bannerjees would float ashore from out of the arabian sea or the lals would leap out and surprise him from behind the areca palms meanwhile all farrokh wanted was the peace of mind to reflect on his growing impulse to be more creative dr daruwalla was disappointed that he was no longer the reader hed once been watching movies was easier he felt hed been seduced by the sheer laziness of absorbing images on film he was proud that hed at least held himself above the masala moviesthose junk films of the bombay cinema those hindi hodgepodges of song and violence but farrokh was enthralled by any sleazy offering from europe or america in the hardboileddetective genre it was allwhite toughguy trash that attracted him the doctors taste in films was in sharp contrast to what his wife liked to read for this particular holiday julia had brought along the autobiography of anthony trollope which farrokh was not looking forward to hearing julia enjoyed reading aloud to him from passages of a book she found especially well written or amusing or moving but farrokhs prejudice against dickens extended to trollope whose novels hed never finished and whose autobiography he couldnt imagine even beginning julia generally preferred to read fiction but farrokh supposed that the autobiography of a novelist almost qualified as fictionsurely novelists wouldnt resist the impulse to make up their autobiographies and this led the doctor to daydreaming further on the matter of his underdeveloped creativity since hed virtually stopped being a reader he wondered if he shouldnt try his hand at writing an autobiography however was the domain of the already famousunless farrokh mused the subject had led a thrilling life since the doctor was neither famous nor had he in his opinion led a life of much excitement he believed that an autobiography was not for him nevertheless he thought he would glance at the trollopewhen julia wasnt looking and only to see if it might provide him with any inspiration he doubted that it would unfortunately his wifes only other reading material was a novel that had caused farrokh some alarm when julia wasnt looking hed already glanced at it and the subject seemed to be relentlessly obsessively sexual in addition the author was totally unknown to dr daruwalla which intimidated him as profoundly as the novels explicit erotica it was one of those very skillful novels exquisitely written in limpid prosefarrokh knew that muchand this intimidated him too dr daruwalla began all novels irritably and with impatience julia read slowly as if she were tasting the words but farrokh plunged restlessly ahead gathering a list of petty grievances against the author until he happened on something that persuaded him the novel was worthwhileor until he encountered some perceived blunder or an entrenched boredom either of which would cause him to read not one more word whenever farrokh had decided against a novel he would then berate julia for the apparent pleasure she was taking from the book his wife was a reader of broad interests and she finished almost everything she started her voraciousness intimidated dr daruwalla too so here he was on his second honeymoona term hed used much too loosely because hed not so much as flirted with his wife since theyd arrived in goaand he was fearfully on the lookout for duckworthians whose dreaded appearance threatened to ruin his holiday altogether to make matters worse hed found himself greatly upsetbut also sexually arousedby the novel his wife was reading at least he thought she was reading it maybe she hadnt begun if she was reading it shed not read any of it aloud to him and given the calm but intense depiction of act after sexual act surely julia would be too embarrassed to read such passages aloud to him or would it be me whod be embarrassed he wondered the novel was so compelling that his covert glances at it were insufficient satisfaction hed begun concealing it in a newspaper or a magazine and sneaking off to a hammock with it julia didnt appear to miss it perhaps she was reading the trollope the first image that captured farrokhs attention was only a couple of pages into the first chapter the narrator was riding on a train in france across from me the girl has fallen asleep she has a narrow mouth cast down at the corners weighted there by the sourness of knowledge immediately dr daruwalla felt that this was good stuff but he also surmised that the story would end unhappily it had never occurred to the doctor that a stumbling block between himself and most serious literature was that he disliked unhappy endings farrokh had forgotten that as a younger reader hed once preferred unhappy endings it wasnt until the fifth chapter that dr daruwalla became disturbed by the firstperson narrators frankly voyeuristic qualities for these same qualities strongly brought out the doctors own troubling voyeurism when she walks she leaves me weak a hobbled feminine step full hips small waist faithfully as always farrokh thought of julia theres a glint of white slip where her sweater parts slightly at the bosom my eyes keep going there in quick helpless glances does julia like this kind of thing farrokh wondered and then in the eighth chapter the novel took a turn that made dr daruwalla miserable with envy and desire some second honeymoon he thought her back is towards him in a single move she pulls off her sweater and then reaching behind herself in that elbowawkward way unfastens her brassiere slowly he turns her around dr daruwalla was suspicious of the narrator this first person who is obsessed with every detail of the sexual explorations of a young american abroad and a french girl from the countryan yearold annemarie farrokh didnt understand that without the narrators discomforting presence the reader couldnt experience the envy and desire of the perpetual onlooker which was precisely what haunted farrokh and impelled him to read on and on the next morning they do it again grey light its very early her breath is bad that was when dr daruwalla knew that one of the lovers was going to die her bad breath was an unpleasant hint of mortality he wanted to stop reading but he couldnt he decided that he disliked the young americanhe was supported by his father he didnt even have a jobbut his heart ached for the french girl whose innocence was being lost the doctor didnt know that he was supposed to feel these things the book was beyond him because his medical practice was an exercise of almost pure goodness he was ill prepared for the real world mostly he saw malformations and deformities and injuries to children he tried to restore their little joints to their intended perfection the real world had no purpose as clear as that ill read just one more chapter dr daruwalla thought hed already read nine at the inland edge of the beach he lay in the midday heat in a hammock under the deadstill fronds of the areca and coconut palms the smell of coconut and fish and salt was occasionally laced with the smell of hashish drifting along the beach where the beach touched the tropicalgreen mass of tangled vegetation a sugarcane stall competed for a small triangle of shade with a wagon selling mango milkshakes the melting ice had wet the sand the daruwallas had commandeered a fleet of roomsan entire floor of the hotel bardezand there was a generous outdoor balcony although the balcony was outfitted with only one sleeping hammock and young john d had claimed it dr daruwalla felt so comfortable in the beach hammock that he resolved he would persuade john d to allow him to sleep in the balcony hammock for at least one night after all john d had a bed in his own room and farrokh and julia could stand to be separated overnightby which the doctor meant that he and his wife werent inclined to make love as often as every night or even as often as twice a week some second honeymoon farrokh thought again he sighed he should have left the tenth chapter for another time but suddenly he was reading again like any good novel it kept lulling him into an almost tranquil state of awareness before it jolted himit caught him completely by surprise then hurriedly as an afterthought he takes off his clothes and slips in beside her an act which threatens us all the town is silent around them on the milkwhite faces of the clock the hands in unison jerk to new positions the trains are running on time along the empty streets yellow headlights of a car occasionally pass and bells mark the hours the quarters the halves with a touch like flowers she is gently tracing the base of his cock driven by now all the way into her touching his balls and beginning to writhe slowly beneath him in a sort of obedient rebellion while in his own dream he rises a little and defines the moist rim of her cunt with his finger and as he does he comes like a bull they remain close for a long time still without talking it is these exchanges which cement them that is the terrible thing these atrocities induce them towards love it wasnt even the end of the chapter but dr daruwalla had to stop reading he was shocked and he had an erection which he concealed with the book allowing it to cover his crotch like a tent all of a sudden in the midst of such lucid prose of such terse elegance there were a cock and balls and even a cunt with a moist rimand these acts that the lovers performed were atrocities farrokh shut his eyes had julia read this part he was usually indifferent to his wifes pleasure in the passages she read aloud to him she enjoyed discussing how certain passages affected herthey rarely had any effect on farrokh dr daruwalla felt a surprising need to discuss the effect of this passage with his wife and the thought of discussing such a thing with julia inspired the doctors erection he felt his hardon touching the astonishing book the doctor encounters a sexchangeinprogress when he opened his eyes the doctor wondered if hed died and had awakened in what the christians call hell for standing beside his hammock and peering down at him were two duckworthians who were no favorites of his are you reading that book or are you just using it to put you to sleep asked promila rai beside her was her sole surviving nephew that loathsome and formerly hairless boy rahul rai but something was wrong with rahul the doctor noticed rahul appeared to be a woman now at least he had a womans breasts certainly he wasnt a boy understandably dr daruwalla was speechless are you still asleep promila rai asked him she tilted her head so that she could read the novels title and the authors name while farrokh tightly held the book in its tentlike position above his erection which he naturally preferred not to reveal to promilaor to her terrifying nephewwithbreasts aggressively promila read the title aloud a sport and a pastime ive never heard of it she said its very good farrokh assured her suspiciously promila read the authors name aloud james salter who is he she asked someone wonderful farrokh replied well whats it about promila asked him impatiently france the doctor said the real france it was an expression he remembered from the novel already promila was bored with him dr daruwalla realized it had been some years since hed last seen her farrokhs mother meher had reported on the frequency of promilas trips abroad and the incomplete results of her cosmetic surgery looking up at promila from his hammock the doctor could recognize under her eyes the unnatural tightness of her latest face lift yet she needed more tightening elsewhere she was strikingly ugly like a rare kind of poultry with an excess of wattles at her throat it wasnt astonishing to farrokh that the same man had left her at the altar twice what astonished him was that the same man would have dared to come as close to promila a second timefor she seemed as old lowji put it a miss havisham times two in more than one way not only had she been jilted twice but she seemed twice as vindictive and twice as dangerous andto judge by her ominous nephewwithbreaststwice as covert you remember rahul promila said to farrokh and to be certain that she commanded the doctors full attention she tapped her long veiny fingers on the spine of the book which still concealed farrokhs cowering erection when he looked up at rahul dr daruwalla felt his hardon wither yes of courserahul the doctor said farrokh had heard the rumors but hed imagined nothing more outrageous than that rahul had embraced his late brothers flamboyant homosexuality possibly in homage to subodhs memory it had been that terrible monsoon of when neville eden had deliberately shocked farrokh by telling him that he was taking subodh rai to italy because a pasta diet improved ones stamina for the rigors of buggery then theyd both died in that car crash dr daruwalla supposed that young rahul had taken it rather hard but not this hard rahul has undergone a little sex change said promila rai with a vulgarity that was generally accepted as the utmost in sophistication by the out of it and the insecure rahul corrected his aunt in a voice that reflected conflicting hormonal surges im still undergoing it auntie he remarked im not quite complete he said pointedly to dr daruwalla i see the doctor replied but he didnt seehe couldnt conceive of the changes rahul had undergone not to mention what was required to make rahul complete the breasts were fairly small but firm and very nicely shaped the lips were fuller and softer than farrokh remembered them and the makeup around the eyes was enhancing without tending to excess if rahul had been or in and no more than or when lowji had examined him for what his aunt had called his inexplicable hairlessnessrahul was now or farrokh figured from his back in the hammock the doctors view of rahul was cut off just below the waist which was as slender and pliant as a young girls it was clear to the doctor that estrogens were in use and to judge these by rahuls breasts and flawless skin the estrogens had been a noteworthy success the effects on rahuls voice were at best still in progress because the voice had both male and female resonances in rich confusion had rahul been castrated did one dare ask he looked more womanly than most hijras and why would he have had his penis removed if he intended to be complete for didnt that mean a fully fashioned vagina and wasnt this vagina surgically constructed from the penis turned inside out im just an orthopedist dr daruwalla thought gratefully all the doctor asked rahul was are you changing your name too boldly even flirtatiously rahul smiled down at farrokh once again the male and the female were at war within rahuls voice not until im the real thing rahul answered i see the doctor replied he made an effort to return rahuls smile or at least to imply tolerance once more promila startled farrokh by drumming her fingers on the spine of his tightly held book is the whole family here promila asked she made the whole family sound like a grotesque element like an entire population that was out of control yes dr daruwalla answered and that beautiful boy is here too i hopei want rahul to see him promila said he must be eighteenno nineteen rahul said dreamily yes nineteen the doctor said stiffly dont anyone point him out to me rahul said i want to see if i can pick him out of the crowd upon this remark rahul turned from the hammock and moved away across the beach dr daruwalla thought that the angle of rahuls departure was deliberateto give the doctor from his hammock the best possible view of rahuls womanly hips rahuls buttocks were also shown to good advantage in a snug sarong and the tightfitting halter top was similarly enhancing to rahuls breasts still farrokh critically observed the hands were too large the shoulders too broad the upper arms too muscular the feet were too long the ankles too sturdy rahul was neither perfect nor complete isnt she delicious promila whispered in the doctors ear she leaned over him in the hammock and farrokh felt the heavy silver pendant the main piece of her necklace thump against his chest so rahul was already a fullfledged she in promilas mind she seems so womanly dr daruwalla said to the proud aunt she is womanly replied promila rai well yes the doctor said he felt trapped in the hammock with promila suspended above him like some bird of preysome poultry of prey promilas scent was permeatinga blend of sandalwood and embalming fluid something oniony but also like moss dr daruwalla made an effort not to gag he felt promila pulling the novel by james salter away from him but he grasped the book in both hands if this is such a wonderful book she said doubtingly i hope youll lend it to me i think mehers reading it next he said but he didnt mean meher his mother hed meant to say julia his wife is meher here too promila asked quickly noi meant julia farrokh said sheepishly by promilas sneer he could tell she was judging him as if his sexual life were so dull that hed confused his mother with his wifeand before he was farrokh felt ashamed but he was also angry what had initially upset him about a sport and a pastime was now enthralling to him he felt highly stimulated but not in that guilty way of pornography this was something so refined and erotic he wanted to share it with julia quite simply and wonderfully the novel had made him feel young again dr daruwalla saw rahul and promila as sexually aberrant beings theyd ruined his mood theyd overshadowed something that was sexy and sincerely written because they were so unnaturalso perverse farrokh supposed he should go warn julia that promila rai and her nephewwithbreasts were on the prowl the daruwallas might have to give their underage daughters some explanation about what wasnt quite right with rahul farrokh decided he would tell john d in any case the doctor hadnt liked how rahul had been so eager to pick john d out of the crowd promila had doubtless impressed her nephewwithbreasts with her own opinionthat john d was entirely too beautiful to be the child of danny mills dr daruwalla thought that rahul had gone looking for john d because the wouldbe transsexual hoped to glimpse something of neville eden in the doctors dear boy promila had turned away from his hammock as if she were scanning the beach for the delicious rahul dr daruwalla took this occasion to stare at the back of her neck he regretted it for staring back at him among the discolored wrinkles was a tumorous growth with melanoid characteristics the doctor couldnt bring himself to advise promila that she should have a doctor look at this it wasnt a job for an orthopedist anyway and farrokh remembered how unkindly promila had responded to lowjis dismissal of rahuls hairlessness thinking of rahul dr daruwalla wondered if his fathers diagnosis might have been hasty possibly the hairlessness had been an early signal that something sexual needed rectifying in rahul he struggled to recall the unanswered question concerning dr tata he remembered that day when promila and rahul had delivered the old fool to the daruwalla estate thered been some speculation regarding what either promila or rahul would have been seeing dr tata for it was unlikely that dr tatas best most famous clinic for gynecological maternity needs could have been treating promila who would never have risked her precious parts to a physician reputed to be worse than ordinary it was lowji whod suggested that it might have been rahul who was dr tatas patient something to do with the hairlessness business the senior daruwalla had said hadnt he now old dr tata was dead in keeping with the more lowkey times his son who was also an obstetrician and gynecologist had deleted the best most famous from the clinics namealthough as a physician the son was reputed to be as far below ordinary as his father within the bombay medical community he was consistently referred to as tata two nevertheless maybe tata two had kept his fathers records farrokh thought it might be interesting to know more about rahuls hairlessness it amused dr daruwalla to imagine that promila and rahul had been so singleminded about getting rahul a sex change that they might have assumed a gynecological surgeon was the correct doctor to ask you dont ask the physician whos familiar with the parts you want but rather the doctor who knows and understands the parts you have a urological surgeon would be required dr daruwalla presumed there would have to be a psychiatric evaluation too surely no responsible physician would perform a complete sexchange operation on demand then farrokh remembered that sexchange operations were illegal in india although this hardly prevented the hijras from castrating themselves emasculation appeared to be the caste duty of the hijras apparently rahul suffered from no such burden of duty rahuls choice seemed to be motivated by something elsenot to be the isolated third gender of a eunuchtransvestite but to be complete an actual womanthis was what rahul wanted to be dr daruwalla imagined i suppose it was young sidhwa who recommended the hotel bardez to you promila coolly said to the doctor which forced dr daruwalla to remember the unlikely source of his information sidhwa was a young man whose tastes struck farrokh as entirely too trendy but in the case of the hotel bardez sidhwa had spoken with unbridled enthusiasmand at length yes it was sidhwa the doctor replied i suppose he told you too promila rai peered down at dr daruwalla in his hammock there was in her expression a condescension of a cold reptilian nature there wasnt even a flicker of pity in her gaze but only that which passes for eagerness in a lizards eyes as it singles out a fly i told him promila told farrokh the bardez is my hotel ive been coming here for years oh what a choice ive made thought dr daruwalla but promila was through with him at least for the moment she simply wandered away not standing on a single ceremony that could even faintly be associated with common politeness although shed certainly been exposed to good manners and she could apply such etiquette in excess whenever she chose so that was the bad news that he had for julia farrokh thought two detestable duckworthians had arrived at the hotel bardez which turned out to be one of their personal favorites but the good news was a sport and a pastime by james salter for farrokh was and it had been a long time since a book had so possessed his mind and body dr daruwalla desired his wifeas suddenly as disturbingly as unashamedly as hed ever desired herand he marveled at the power of mr salters prose to do that both to be aesthetically pleasing and to give him far more than a simple hardon the novel seemed like a heroic act of seduction it had enlivened all of the doctors senses he felt how the beach sand was cooling at midday it had so burned underfoot that he could cross it only with his sandals on but now he comfortably walked barefoot in the sandit seemed an ideal temperature he vowed to get up very early one morning so that he could also experience the sand at its coldest but he would forget his vow nevertheless these were the stirrings within him of a second honeymoon for sure i shall write a letter to mr james salter he resolved the rest of his life dr daruwalla would regret his neglecting to write that letter but on this day in junein on baga beach in goathe doctor briefly felt like a new man farrokh was only one day away from meeting the stranger whose voice on his answering machine years later still commanded the authority to fill him with dread is that him is that the doctor she would ask when farrokh had first heard those questions he had no idea of the world he was about to enter crossed paths testing for syphilis at the hotel bardez the frontdesk staff told dr daruwalla that the young woman had limped down the beach all the way from a hippie enclave at anjuna she was checking the hotels for a doctor any doctor shed asked they were proud of themselves for sending her away but they warned the doctor that they were sure shed be back she wouldnt find anyone to care for her foot at calangute beach and if she made it as far as aguada shed be turned away because of how she looked someone might call the police farrokh desired to uphold the parsi reputation for fairness and social justice certainly he sought to help the crippled and the maimeda girl with a limp was at least in a category of patients the orthopedist felt familiar with it wasnt as if his services were sought for the purpose of making rahul rai complete yet farrokh couldnt be angry with the staff at the hotel bardez it was out of respect for dr daruwallas privacy that theyd sent the limping woman away theyd meant only to protect him although doubtless they took a degree of pleasure in abusing an apparent freak among the goans especially as the s were ending there was a felt resentment of the european and american hippies who roamed the beaches the hippies werent big spenderssome of them even stoleand they were perceived as an undesirable element by the wealthier western and indian tourists whom the goans wished to attract and so without condemning their behavior dr daruwalla politely informed the staff at the hotel bardez that he wished to examine the lame hippie should she return the doctors decision seemed especially disappointing to the aged teaserver who shuffled back and forth between the hotel bardez and the various encampments of thatchroofed shelters these fourpoled structures stuck in the sand and roofed with the dried fronds of coconut palms dotted the beach the teaserver had several times approached dr daruwalla in his hammock under the palms and it was largely out of diagnostic interest that farrokh had observed the old man so closely his name was ali ahmed he said he was only years old although he looked and he exhibited a few of the more easily recognizable and colorful physical signs of congenital syphilis upon his first tea service the doctor had spotted ali ahmeds hutchinsons teeththe unmistakable pegshaped incisors the teaservers deafness in addition to the characteristic clouding of the cornea had confirmed dr daruwallas diagnosis farrokh was chiefly interested in positioning ali ahmed in such a way that the teaserver faced the morning sun dr daruwalla was trying to spot a fourth symptom a rarity in congenital syphilisthe argyll robertson pupil is much more common in syphilis acquired later in lifeand the doctor had cleverly thought of a way to examine the old man without his knowledge from his hammock where he received his tea farrokh faced the arabian sea inland at his back the morning sun was a hazy glare above the village from that direction wafting over the beach there emanated an aroma of fermented coconuts looking into the cloudy eyes of ali ahmed farrokh asked with feigned innocence whats that smell ali and wheres it coming from to be sure hed be heard farrokh had to raise his voice the teaserver was at the time focused on handing the doctor a glass of tea his pupils were constricted to accommodate the object nearbynamely the tea glass but when the doctor asked him from whence the powerful odor came ali ahmed looked in the direction of the village his pupils dilated to accommodate the distant tops of the coconut and areca palms but even as his face was lifted to the harsh sunlight his pupils did not constrict in reaction to the glare it was the classic argyll robertson pupil dr daruwalla decided farrokh recalled his favorite professor of infectious diseases herr doktor fritz meitner dr meitner was fond of telling his medical students that the best way to remember the behavior of the argyll robertson pupil was to think of a prostitute she accommodates but doesnt react it was an allmale class they all had laughed but farrokh had felt uncertain of his laughter hed never been with a prostitute although they were popular in both vienna and bombay feni the teaserver said to explain the smell but dr daruwalla already knew the answer just as he knew that the pupils of some syphilitics dont respond to light a literary seduction scene in the villageor perhaps the source of the smell was as far away as panjimthey were distilling coconuts for the local brew called feni the heavy sicklysweet fumes of the liquor drifted over the few tourists and families on holiday at baga beach dr daruwalla and his family were already favorites with the staff of the small hotel and they were passionately welcomed in the little lean to restaurant and taverna that the daruwallas frequented on the beachfront the doctor was a big tipper his wife was a classical beauty of a european tradition as opposed to the seedy hippie trash his daughters were vibrantly bright and prettythey were still of the innocent schooland the striking john d was mesmerizing to indians and foreigners alike it was only to those rare families as likable as the daruwallas that the staff of the hotel bardez apologized for the smell of the feni in those days in the premonsoon months of may and june both knowledgeable foreigners and indians avoided the goa beaches it was too hot it was however when the goans who lived away from goa came home to visit their families and friends the children were through with school the shrimp and lobster and fish were plentiful and the mangoes were at their peak dr daruwalla was enamored of mangoes in keeping with the holiday spirit and in order to placate all the christians the catholic church provided an abundance of feast days although he wasnt yet religious the doctor had nothing against a banquet or two the catholics were no longer the majority in goathe migrant iron miners whod arrived early in this century were hindusbut farrokh like his father persisted in the belief that the romans still overran the place the portuguese influence endured in the monumental architecture that dr daruwalla adored it could distinctly be tasted in the cuisine that the doctor relished and among the names of the boats of the christian fisherman christ the king was quite common bumper stickers of both the comic and proselytizing variety were a new if not widespread fad in bombay the doctor joked that the names of the boats of the christian fishermen were goan bumper stickers julia was no more amused by this than by farrokhs constant ridicule of st franciss violated remains i dont know how anyone can justify canonization dr daruwalla reflected to john d largely because julia wouldnt listen to her husband but also because the young man had studied some theology in university in zürich it would have been protestant theology farrokh assumed just imagine it farrokh lectured to the young man a violent woman swallows xaviers toe and they cut off his arm and send it to rome john d smiled silently over his breakfast the daruwalla daughters smiled helplessly at john d when he looked at his wife farrokh was surprised that she was looking straight back at himshe was smiling too clearly shed not been listening to a word he was saying the doctor blushed julias smile wasnt in the least cynical on the contrary his wifes expression was so sincerely amorous farrokh felt certain that she was determined to remind him of their pleasure the night beforeeven in front of john d and the children and judging from their night together and the visible randiness of his wifes thoughts on the morning after their holiday had become a second honeymoon after all reading in bed would never seem innocent again the doctor thought although everything had begun quite innocently his wife had been reading the trollope and farrokh hadnt been reading at all hed been trying to get up the nerve to read a sport and a pastime in front of julia instead he lay on his back with his fingers intertwined upon his rumbling bellyan excess of pork or else the dinner conversation had upset him over dinner hed tried to explain to his family his need to be more creative his desire to write something but his daughters had paid no attention to him and julia had misunderstood him shed suggested a medicaladvice columnif not for the times of india then for the globe and mail john d had advised farrokh to keep a diary the young man said hed kept one once and hed enjoyed itthen a girlfriend had stolen it and hed gotten out of the habit at that point the conversation entirely deteriorated because the daruwalla daughters had pestered john d about the number of girlfriends the young man had had after all it was the tail end of the s even innocent young girls talked as if they were sexually knowledgeable it disturbed farrokh that his daughters were clearly asking john d to tell them the number of young women hed slept with typical of john d and to dr daruwallas great relief the young man had skillfully and charmingly ducked the question but the matter of the doctors unfulfilled creativity had been dismissed or ignored the subject however hadnt eluded julia in bed after dinner propped up with a stack of pillowswhile farrokh lay flat upon his backhis wife had assaulted him with the trollope listen to this liebchen julia said early in life at the age of fifteen i commenced the dangerous habit of keeping a journal and this i maintained for ten years the volumes remained in my possession unregardednever looked attill when i examined them and with many blushes destroyed them they convicted me of folly ignorance indiscretion idleness extravagance and conceit but they had habituated me to the rapid use of pen and ink and taught me how to express myself with facility i dont want or need to keep a journal farrokh said abruptly and i already know how to express myself with facility theres no need to be defensive julia told him i just thought youd be interested in the subject i want to create something dr daruwalla announced im not interested in recording the mundane details of my life i wasnt aware that our life was altogether mundane julia said the doctor realizing his error said certainly its not i meant only that i prefer to try my hand at something imaginativei want to imagine something do you mean fiction his wife asked yes farrokh said ideally i should like to write a novel but i dont suppose i could write a very good one well there are all kinds of novels julia said helpfully thus emboldened dr daruwalla withdrew james salters a sport and a pastime from its hiding place which was under the newspaper on the floor beside the bed he brought forth the novel carefully as if it were a potentially dangerous weapon which it was for example farrokh said i dont suppose i could ever write a novel as good as this one julia glanced at the salter quickly before returning her eyes to the trollope no i wouldnt think so she said aha the doctor thought so she has read it but he asked with forced indifference have you read the salter oh yes his wife said not taking her eyes off the trollope i brought it along to reread it actually it was hard for farrokh to remain casual but he tried so you liked it i presume he inquired oh yesvery much julia answered after a weighty pause she asked him and you i find it rather good the doctor confessed i suppose he added some readers might be shocked or offended by certain parts oh yes julia agreed then she closed the trollope and looked at him which parts are you thinking of it hadnt happened quite as hed imagined it but this was what he wanted since julia had most of the pillows he rolled over on his stomach and propped himself up on his elbows he began with a somewhat cautious passage he pauses at last farrokh read aloud he leans over to admire her she does not see him hair covers her cheek her skin seems very white he kisses her side and then without force as one stirs a favorite mare begins again she comes to life with a soft exhausted sound like someone saved from drowning julia also rolled over on her stomach gathering the pillows to her breasts its hard to imagine anyone being shocked or offended by that part she said dr daruwalla cleared his throat the ceiling fan was stirring the down on the back of julias neck her thick hair had fallen forward hiding her eyes from his view when he held his breath he could hear her breathing she cannot be satisfied he read on while julia buried her face in her arms she will not let him alone she removes her clothes and calls to him once that night and twice the next morning he complies and in the darkness between lies awake the lights of dijon faint on the ceiling the boulevards still its a bitter night flats of rain are passing heavy drops ring in the gutter outside their window but they are in a dovecote they are pigeons beneath the eaves the rain is falling all around them deep in feathers breathing softly they lie his sperm swims slowly inside her oozing out between her legs yes thats better julia said when he looked at her he saw shed turned her face to look at him the yellow unsteady light from the kerosene lamps wasnt as ghostly pale as the moonlight hed seen on her face on their first honeymoon but even this tarnished light conveyed her willingness to trust him their wedding night in the austrian winter was in one of those snowy alpine towns and their train from vienna had arrived almost too late forthem to be admitted to the gasthof despite their reservation it must have been in the morning by the time theyd undressed and bathed and got into the feather bed which was as white as the mountains of snow that reflected the moonlightit was a timeless glowingin their window but on their second honeymoon dr daruwalla came dangerously close to ruining the mood when he offered a faint criticism of the salter im not sure how accurate it is to suggest that sperm swim slowly he said and technically i suppose its semen not sperm that would be oozing out between her legs for gods sake farrokh his wife said give me the book she had no difficulty locating the passage she was looking for although the book was unmarked farrokh lay on his side and watched her while she read aloud to him she is so wet by the time he has the pillows under her gleaming stomach that he goes right into her in one long delicious move they begin slowly when he is close to coming he pulls his prick out and lets it cool then he starts again guiding it with one hand feeding it in like a line she begins to roll her hips to cry out its like ministering to a lunatic finally he takes it out again as he waits tranquil deliberate his eye keeps falling on lubricantsher face cream bottles in the armoire they distract him their presence seems frightening like evidence they begin once more and this time do not stop until she cries out and he feels himself come in long trembling runs the head of his prick touching bone it seems julia handed the book back to him your turn she said then she also lay on her side watching him but as he began to read to her she shut her eyes he saw her face on the pillow almost exactly as hed seen it that morning in the alps st antonthat was the placeand hed awakened to the sound of the skiers boots tramping on the hardpacked snow it seemed that an army of skiers was marching through the town to the ski lift only julia and he were not there to ski they were there to fuck farrokh thought watching his wifes sleeping face and that was how theyd spent the week making brief forays into the snowy paths of the town and then hurrying back to their feather bed in the evenings theyd had no less appetite for the hearty food than the skiers had watching julia as he read to her farrokh remembered every day and night in st anton he is thinking of the waiters in the casino the audience at the cinema the dark hotels as she lies on her stomach and with the ease of sitting down at a welllaid table but no more than that he introduces himself they he on their sides he tries not to move there are only the little invisible twitches like a nibbling of fish julia opened her eyes as farrokh searched for another passage dont stop she told him then dr daruwalla found what he was looking fora rather short and simple part her breasts are hard he read to his wife her cunt is sopping the doctor paused i suppose thered be some readers whod be shocked or offended by that he added not me his wife told him he closed the book and returned it to the newspaper on the floor when he rolled back to julia shed arranged the pillows under her hips and lay waiting for him he touched her breasts first your breasts are hard he said to her they are not she told him my breasts are old and soft i like soft better he said after she kissed him she said my cunt is sopping it isnt he said instinctively but when she took his hand and made him touch her he realized she wasnt lying in the morning the sunlight passed through the narrow slats of the blinds and stood out in horizontal bars across the bare coffeecolored wall the newspaper on the floor was stirred by a small lizard a geckoonly its snout protruded from between the pagesand when dr daruwalla reached to pick up a sport and a pastime the gecko darted under the bed sopping the doctor thought to himself he opened the book quietly thinking his wife was still asleep keep readingaloud julia murmured lunch is followed by depression it was with a renewed sexual confidence that farrokh faced the situation of the morning rahul rai had struck up a conversation with john d and althougheven by the doctors standardsrahul looked fetching in her bikini the small lump of evidence in the bikinis bottom half provided dr daruwalla with sufficient reason to rescue john d from a potential confrontation while julia sat on the beach with the daruwalla daughters the doctor and john d strolled in a manly and confiding fashion along the waters edge theres something you should know about rahul farrokh began whats her name john d asked his name is rahul farrokh explained if you were to look under his panties im almost certain you would find a penis and a pair of ballsrather small in both cases they continued walking along the shoreline with john d appearing to pay obsessive attention to the smooth sandrubbed stones and the rounded broken bits of shells finally john d said the breasts look real definitely inducedhormonally induced dr daruwalla said the doctor described how estrogens worked the development of breasts of hips how the penis shrank to the size of a little boys the testes were so reduced they resembled vulva the penis was so shrunken it resembled an enlarged clitoris the doctor explained as much as he knew about a complete sexchange operation too far out john d remarked they discussed whether rahul would be more interested in men or women since he wanted to be a woman dr daruwalla deduced that rahul was sexually interested in men its hard to tell john d suggested indeed when they returned to where the daruwalla daughters were encamped under a thatchroofed shelter there was rahul rai in conversation with julia julia said later i think its young men who interest him although i suppose a young woman would do would do dr daruwalla thought promila had confided to farrokh that this was a bad time for poor rahul apparently theyd not traveled from bombay together but promila had met her nephew at the bardez hed been alone in the area for more than a week he had hippie friends promila saidsomewhere near anjunabut things hadnt worked out as rahul had hoped farrokh didnt desire to know more but promila offered her speculations anyway i presume that sexually confusing things must have happened she told dr daruwalla yes i suppose the doctor said normally all of this would have upset farrokh greatly but something from his sexual triumphs with julia had carried over into the following day despite everything that was sexually confusing about rahul which was sexually disturbing to dr daruwalla not even the doctors appetite was affected although the heat was fierce it was unmercifully hot at midday and there was no perceptible breeze along the shoreline the fronds of the areca and coconut palms were as motionless as the grand old cashew and mango trees farther inland in the deadstill villages and towns not even the passing of a threewheeled rickshaw with a damaged muffler could rouse a single dog to bark were it not for the heavy presence of the distilling feni dr daruwalla would have guessed that the air wasnt moving at all but the heat didnt dampen the doctors enthusiasm for his lunch he started with an oyster guisado and steamed prawns in a yogurtmustard sauce then he tried the vindaloo fish the gravy for which was so piquant that his upper lip felt numb and he instantly perspired he drank an icecold ginger feni with his mealactually he had twoand for dessert he ordered the bebinca his wife was easily satisfied with a xacuti which she shared with the girls it was a fiery curry made almost soothing with coconut milk cloves and nutmeg the daughters also tried a frozen mango dessert dr daruwalla had a taste but nothing could abate the burning sensation in his mouth as a remedy he ordered a cold beer then he criticized julia for allowing the girls to drink so much sugarcane juice in this heat too much sugar will make them sick farrokh told his wife listen to whos talking julia said farrokh sulked the beer was an unfamiliar brand which he would never remember he would recall however the part of the label that said liquor ruins country family and life but as much as dr daruwalla was a man of unstoppable appetites his plumpness had never beennor would it becomedispleasing to the eye he was a fairly small manhis smallness was most apparent in the delicacy of his hands and in the neat wellformed features of his face which was round boyish and friendlyand his arms and legs were thin and wiry his bum was small too even his little pot belly merely served to emphasize his smallness his neatness his tidiness he liked a small welltrimmed beard for he also liked to shave his throat and the sides of his face were usually cleanshaven when he wore a mustache it too was neat and small his skin wasnt much browner than an almond shell his hair was blackit would soon turn gray he would never be bald his hair was thick with a slight wave and he left it long on top although he kept it cut short on the back of his neck and above his ears which were also small and lay perfectly flat against his head his eyes were such a darkbrown color that they looked almost black and because his face was so small his eyes seemed largemaybe they were large if so only his eyes reflected his appetites and only in comparison to john d would someone not have thought of dr daruwalla as handsomesmall but handsome he was not a fat man but a plump onea little potbellied man while the doctor struggled to digest his meal it might have crossed his mind that the others had behaved more sensibly john d as if demonstrating the selfdiscipline and dietary restraint that future movie stars would be wise to imitate eschewed eating in the midday heat he chose this time of day to take long walks on the beach he swam intermittently and lazilyonly to cool off from his languid attitude it was hard to tell if he walked the beach in order to look at the assembled young women or to afford them the luxury of looking at him in the torpid aftermath of his lunch dr daruwalla barely noticed that rahul rai was nowhere to be seen farrokh was frankly relieved that the wouldbe transsexual wasnt pursuing john d and promila rai had accompanied john d for only a short distance along the waters edge as if the young man had immediately discouraged her by declaring his intentions to walk to the next village or to the village after that wearing an absurdly widebrimmed hatas if it werent already too late to protect her cancerous skinpromila had returned alone to the spot of shade allotted by her thatchroofed shelter and there she appeared to embalm herself with a variety of oils and chemicals under their own array of thatchroofed shelters the daruwalla daughters applied different oils and chemicals to their vastly younger and superior bodies then they ventured among the intrepid sunbathersmostly europeans and relatively few of them at this time of year the daruwalla girls were forbidden to follow john d on his midday hikes both julia and farrokh felt that the young man deserved this period of time to be free of them but the most sensibly behaved person at midday was always the doctors wife julia retired to the relative cool of their secondfloor rooms there was a shaded balcony with john ds sleeping hammock and a cot the balcony was a good place to read or nap it was clearly nap time for dr daruwalla who doubted he could manage the climb to the second floor of the hotel from the taverna he could see the balcony attached to his rooms and he looked longingly in that direction he thought the hammock would be nice and he considered that he would try sleeping there tonight if the mosquito netting was good hed be very comfortable and all night hed hear the arabian sea the longer he allowed john d to sleep there the more firmly the young man would presume it was his place to sleep but farrokhs renewed sexual interest in julia gave him pause in regard to his sleepinghammock plan there were passages of a sport and a pastime hed not yet discussed with his wife dr daruwalla wished he knew what else mr james salter had written however as exhilarating as this unexpected stimulation to his marriage had been farrokh felt slightly depressed mr salters writing was so far above anything dr daruwalla could hope to imaginemuch less hope to achieveand the doctor had guessed right one of the lovers dies strongly implying that a love of such overpowering passion never lasts moreover the novel concluded in a tone of voice that was almost physically painful to dr daruwalla in the end farrokh felt that the very life he led with juliathe life he cherishedwas being mocked or was it of the french girlannemarie the surviving loverthere is only this final offering she is married i suppose there are children they walk together on sundays the sunlight falling upon them they visit friends talk go home in the evening deep in the life we all agree is so greatly to be desired wasnt there an underlying cruelty to this because such a life is greatly to be desired isnt it dr daruwalla thought and how could anyone expect the married life to compete with the burning intensity of a love affair what disturbed the doctor was that the end of the novel made him feel ignorant or at least inexperienced and what was more humiliating farrokh felt certain was that julia could probably explain the ending to him in such a way that hed understand it it was all a matter of tone of voice perhaps the author had intended irony but not sarcasm mr salters use of language was crystalline if something was unclear the fuzzyheadedness surely should be attributed to the reader but more than technical virtuosity separated dr daruwalla from mr james salter or from any other accomplished novelist mr salter and his peers wrote from a vision they were convinced about something and it was at least partly the passion of these writers convictions that gave their novels such value dr daruwalla was convinced only that he would like to be more creative that he would like to make something up there were a lot of novelists like that and farrokh didnt care to embarrass himself by being one of them he concluded that a more shameless form of entertainment suited him if he couldnt write novels maybe he could write screenplays after all movies werent as serious as novels certainly they werent as long dr daruwalla presumed that his lack of a vision wouldnt hamper his success in the screenplay form but his conclusion depressed him in the search for something to occupy his untapped creativity the doctor had already accepted a compromisebefore hed even begun this thought moved him to consider consoling himself with his wifes affections but gazing again to the distant balcony didnt bring the doctor any closer to julia and dr daruwalla doubted that imbibing feni and beer was a wise prelude to an amorous adventureespecially in such abiding heat something mr salter had written appeared to shimmer over dr daruwalla in the midday inferno the more clearly one sees this world the more one is obliged to pretend it does not exist there is a growing list of things i dont know the doctor thought he didnt know for example the name of the thick vine that had crawled upward from the ground to embrace both the second and the thirdfloor balconies of the hotel bardez the vine was put to active use by the small striped squirrels that scurried over it at night the geckos raced up and down the vine with far greater speed and agility than any squirrel when the sun shone against this wall of the hotel the smallest palestpink flowers opened up along the vine but dr daruwalla didnt know that these flowers were not what attracted the finches to the vine finches are seed eaters but dr daruwalla didnt know this nor did the doctor know that the green parrot perching on the vine had feet with two toes pointing forward and two backward these were the details he missed and they contributed to the growing list of things he didnt know this was the kind of everyman he wasa little lost a little misinformed or uninformed almost everywhere he ever was yet even overfed the doctor was undeniably attractive not every everyman is attractive a dirty hippie dr daruwalla grew so drowsy at the littered table one of the bardez servant boys suggested he move into a new hammock that was strung in the shade of the areca and coconut palms complaining to the boy that he feared the hammock was too near the main beach and hed be bothered by sand fleas the doctor nevertheless tested the hammock farrokh wasnt sure it would support his weight but the hammock held for the moment the doctor detected no sand fleas therefore he was obliged to give the boy a tip this boy punkaj seemed employed solely for the purpose of tipping for the messages that he delivered to the hotel bardez and the adjacent lean to restaurant and taverna were usually of his own invention and wholly unnecessary for example punkaj asked dr daruwalla if he should run to the hotel and tell the mrs doctor that the doctor was napping in a hammock near the beach dr daruwalla said no but in a short while punkaj was back beside the hammock he reported the mrs doctor is reading what i think is a book go away punkaj said dr daruwalla but he tipped the worthless boy nonetheless then the doctor lay wondering if his wife was reading the trollope or rereading the salter considering the size of his lunch farrokh was fortunate that he was able to sleep at all the strenuousness of his digestive system made a sound sleep impossible but throughout the grumbling and rumbling of his stomachand the occasional hiccup or belchthe doctor fitfully dozed and dreamed and woke up all of a sudden to wonder if his daughters were drowned or suffering from sunstroke or sexual attack then he dozed off again as farrokh fell in and out of sleep the imagined details of rahul rais complete sex change appeared and disappeared in his minds eye drifting in and out of consciousness like the fumes from the distilling feni this exotic aberration clashed with farrokhs fairly ordinary ideals his belief in the purity of his daughters his fidelity to his wife only slightly less common was dr daruwallas vision of john d which was simply the doctors desire to see the young man rise above the sordid circumstances of his birth and abandonment and if i could only play a part in that dr daruwalla dreamed i might one day be as creative as mr james salter but john ds only visible qualities were of a fleeting and superficial nature he was arrestingly handsome and he was so steadfastly selfconfident that his poise concealed his lack of other qualitiessadly the doctor presumed that john d lacked other qualities in this belief farrokh was aware that he relied too heavily on his brothers estimation and his sisterinlaws confirmation for both jamshed and josefine were chronically worried that the boy had no future he was uninvolved with his studies they said but couldnt this be an early indication of thespian detachment yes why not john d could be a movie star dr daruwalla decided forgetting that this notion had originated with his wife it suddenly seemed to the doctor that john d was destined to be a movie star or else he would be nothing it was farrokhs first realization that a hint of despair can start the creative juices flowing and it must have been these juices in combination with the more scientifically supported juices of digestion that got the doctors imagination going but just then a belch so alarming he failed to recognize it as his own awakened dr daruwalla from these imaginings he shifted in his hammock in order to confirm that his daughters had not been violated by either the forces of nature or the hand of man then he fell asleep with his mouth open the splayed fingers of one hand lolling in the sand dreamlessly the noonday passed the beach began to cool a slight breeze rose it softly gave sway to the hammock where dr daruwalla lay digesting something had left a sour taste in his mouththe doctor suspected the vindaloo fish or the beerand he felt flatulent farrokh opened his eyes slightly to see if anyone was near his hammockin which case it would be impolite for him to fartand there was that pest punkaj the worthless servant boy she come back punkaj said go away punkaj said dr daruwalla she looking for youthat hippie with her bad foot the boy said he pronounced the word heepee so that dr daruwalla in his digestive daze still didnt understand go away punkaj the doctor repeated then he saw the young woman limping toward him is that him is that the doctor she asked punkaj you wait there i ask doctor first the boy said to her at a glance she could have been or but she was a bigboned young woman broadshouldered and heavybreasted and thick through her hips she also had thick ankles and very stronglooking hands and she lifted the boy off the groundholding him by the front of his shirtand threw him on his back in the sand go fuck yourself she told him punkaj picked himself up and ran toward the hotel farrokh swung his legs unsteadily out of the hammock and faced her when he stood up he was surprised at how much the lateafternoon breeze had cooled the sand he was also surprised that the young woman was so much taller than he was he quickly bent down to put on his sandals that was when he saw she was barefootand that one foot was nearly twice the size of the other while the doctor was still down on one knee the young woman rotated her swollen foot and showed him the filthy inflamed sole i stepped on some glass she said slowly i thought i picked it all out but i guess not he took her foot in his hand and felt her lean heavily on his shoulder for balance there were several small lacerations all closed and red and puckered with infection and on the ball of her foot was a fiery swelling the size of an egg in its center was an inchlong oozing gash that was scabbed over dr daruwalla looked up at her but she wasnt looking down at him she was gazing off somewhere and the doctor was shocked not only by her stature but by her solidity as well she had a full womanly figure and a peasant muscularity her dirty unshaven legs were ragged with golden hair and her cutoff blue jeans were slightly torn at the crotch seam through which poked an outrageous tuft of her golden pubic hair she wore a black sleeveless tshirt with a silver skullandcrossbones insignia and her loose lowslung breasts hung over farrokh like a warning when he stood up and looked into her face he saw she couldnt have been older than she had full round freckled cheeks and her lips were badly sunblistered she had a childs little nose also sunburned and almostwhite blond hair which was matted and tangled and discolored by the suntan oil shed used to try to protect her face her eyes were startling to dr daruwalla not only for their pale iceblue color but because they reminded him of the eyes of an animal that wasnt quite awakenot fully alert as soon as she noticed he was looking at her her pupils constricted and fixed hard upon himalso like an animals now she was wary all her instincts were suddenly engaged the doctor couldnt return the intensity of her gaze he looked away from her i think i need some antibiotics the young woman said yes you have an infection dr daruwalla said i have to lance that swelling theres something in thereit has to come out she had a pretty good infection going the doctor had also noticed the lymphangitic streaking the young woman shrugged and when she moved her shoulders only that slightly farrokh caught the scent of her it wasnt just an acrid armpit odor there was also something like the tang of urine in the way she smelled and there was a heavy ripe smellfaintly rotten or decayed it is essential for you to be clean before i cut into you dr daruwalla said he was staring at the young womans hands there appeared to be dried blood caked under her nails once more the young woman shrugged and dr daruwalla took a step back from her so where do you want to do it she asked looking around at the taverna the bartender was watching them in the lean to restaurant only one of the tables was occupied there were three men drinking feni even these impaired feni drinkers were watching the girl theres a bathtub in our hotel the doctor said my wife will help you i know how to take a bath the young woman told him farrokh was thinking that she couldnt have walked very far on that foot as she hobbled between the taverna and the hotel her limp was pronounced she leaned hard on the rail as they climbed the stairs to the rooms you didnt walk all the way from anjuna did you he asked her im from iowa she answered for a moment dr daruwalla didnt understandhe was trying to think of an iowa in goa then he laughed but she didnt i meant where are you staying in goa he asked her im not staying she told him im taking the ferry to bombayas soon as i can walk but where did you cut your foot he asked on some glass she said it was sort of near anjuna this conversation and watching her climb the stairs exhausted dr daruwalla he preceded the girl into his rooms he wanted to alert julia that hed found a patient on the beach or that shed found him farrokh and julia waited on the balcony while the young woman took a bath they waited quite a long time staringwith little commentat the girls battered canvas rucksack which shed left with them on the balcony apparently she wasnt considering a change of clothes or else the clothes in the rucksack were dirtier than the clothes she wore although this was hard to imagine odd cloth badges were sewn to the rucksackthe insignia of the times dr daruwalla supposed he recognized the peace symbol the pastel flowers bugs bunny a us flag with the face of a pig superimposed on it and another silver skull and crossbones he didnt recognize the blackandyellow cartoon bird with the menacing expression he doubted it was a version of the american eagle there was no way the doctor could have been familiar with herky the hawk the wrathful symbol of athletic teams from the university of iowa looking more closely farrokh read the words under the blackandyellow bird go hawkeyes she must belong to some sort of strange club the doctor said to his wife in response julia sighed it was the way she feigned indifference julia was still somewhat in shock at the sight of the huge young woman not to mention the great clumps of blond hair the girl had grown in her armpits in the bathroom the girl filled and emptied the tub twice the first time was to shave her legs but not her underarmsshe valued the hair in her armpits as an indication of her rebellion she thought of it and her pubic hair as her fur she used dr daruwallas razor she thought about stealing it but then she remembered shed left her rucksack out on the balcony the memory distracted her she shrugged and put the razor back where shed found it as she settled into the second tub of water she fell instantly asleepshe was so exhaustedbut she woke up as soon as her mouth dipped below the water she soaped herself she shampooed her hair she rinsed then she emptied the tub and drew a third bath letting the water rise around her what puzzled her about the murders was that she couldnt locate in herself the slightest feeling of remorse the murders werent her faultwhether or not they might be judged her unwitting responsibility she refused to feel guilty because there was absolutely nothing she could have done to save the victims she thought only vaguely about the fact that she hadnt tried to prevent the murders after all she decided she was also a victim and as such a kind of eternal absolution appeared to hover over her as detectable as the steam ascending from her bathwater she groaned the water was as hot as she could stand it she was amazed at the scum on the surface of the water it was her third bath but the dirt was still coming out of her the dildo behind every journey is a reason it was her parents fault she decided her name was nancy she came from an iowa pigfarming family of german descent and shed been a good girl all through high school in a small iowa town then shed gone to the university in iowa city because she was so blond and bosomy shed been a popular candidate for the cheerleading squad although she lacked the requisite personality and wasnt chosen still it was her contact with the cheerleaders that led her to meet so many football players there was a lot of partying which nancy was unfamiliar with and shed not only slept with a boy for the first time shed slept with her first black person her first hawaiian person and the first person shed ever known who came from new englandhe was from somewhere in maine or maybe it was massachusetts she flunked out of the university of iowa at the end of her first semester when she went home to the small town shed grown up in she was pregnant she thought she was still a good girl to the degree that she submitted to her parents recommendation without questioning it she would have the baby put it up for adoption and get a job she went to work at the local hardware store in feedandgrain supply while she was still carrying the child soon she began to doubt the wisdom of her parents recommendationmen her fathers age began propositioning her while she was pregnant she delivered the child in texas where the orphanage physician never let her see itthe nurses never even let her know which sex it wasand when she came home her parents sat her down and told her that they hoped shed learned her lesson they hoped she would behave her mother said she prayed that some decent man in the town would be forgiving enough to marry her one day her father said that god had been lenient with her he implied that god was disinclined toward leniency twice for a while nancy tried to comply but so many men of the town attempted to seduce herthey assumed shed be easyand so many women were worse they assumed she was already sleeping with everyone this punitive experience had a strange effect on her it didnt make her revile the football players whod contributed to her downfalloddly what she loathed most was her own innocence she refused to believe she was immoral what degraded her was to feel stupid and with this feeling came an anger she was unfamiliar withit felt foreign yet this anger was as much a part of her as the fetus shed carried for so long but had never seen she applied for a passport when it came she robbed the hardware storefeedandgrain especiallyof every cent she could steal she knew that her family originally came from germany she thought she should go there the cheapest flight from chicago was to frankfurt but if iowa city had been too sophisticated for her nancy was unprepared for the enterprising young germans who frequented the area of the hauptbahnhof and the kaiserstrasse where almost immediately she met a tall dark drug dealer named dieter he was enduringly smalltime the first thrilling albeit petty crime he introduced her to involved her posing as a prostitute on those nasty side streets off the kaiserstrassethe ones named after the german rivers shed ask for so much money that only the wealthiest stupidest tourist or businessman would follow her to a shabby room on the elbestrasse or the moselstrasse dieter would be waiting there nancy made the man pay her before she unlocked the door of the room once they were inside dieter would pretend to surprise hergrabbing her roughly and throwing her on the bed abusing her for her faithlessness and her dishonesty threatening to kill her while the man whod paid for her services invariably fled not one of the men ever tried to help her nancy enjoyed taking advantage of their lust and there was something gratifying about their uniform cowardice in her mind she was repaying those men whod made her feel so miserable in feedandgrain supply it was dieters theory that all germans were sexually ashamed of themselves that was why he preferred india it was both a spiritual and a sensual country what he meant was that for very little you could buy anything there he meant women and young girls in addition to the bhang and the ganja but he told her only about the quality of the hashishwhat he would pay for it there and what he would get for it back in germany he didnt tell her the whole planspecifically that her american passport and her farmgirl looks were the means by which he would get the stuff through german customs nancy was also the means by which hed planned to get the deutsche marks through indian customs it was marks he took to india it was hashish he brought back dieter had made the trip with american girls before hed also used canadian girlstheir passports aroused even less suspicion with both nationalities dieter followed a simple procedure he never flew on the same plane with them he made sure theyd arrived and passed through customs before he boarded a plane for bombay he always told them he wanted them to recover from the jet lag in a comfortable room at the taj because when he got there theyd be doing some serious business he meant theyd be staying in less conspicuous lodgings and he knew that the bus ride from bombay to goa could be disagreeable dieter could buy what he wanted in bombay but inevitably hed be persuadedusually by the friend of a friendto do his buying in goa the hash was more expensive there because the european and american hippies bought up the stuff like bottled water but the quality was more reliable it was the quality that fetched a good price in frankfurt as for the trip back to germany dieter would precede the designated young woman by a day if she were ever delayed in german customs dieter would take this as a sign that he shouldnt meet her but dieter had a system and not one of his young women had ever been caughtat either end dieters women were outfitted with the kind of wellworn travel guides and paperback novels that suggested earnestness in the extreme the travel guides were dogeared and scribbled in to draw the attention of customs officials to those areas of cultural or historical importance so keenly boring that they attracted only graduate students in the field as for the paperback novels by hermann hesse or lawrence durrell they were fairly standard indications of their readers proclivities for the mystical and poetic these latter tendencies were dismissed by customs officials as the habitual concerns of young women whod never been motivated by money without a profit motive surely drug trafficking could be of no interest to them however these young women were not above suspicion as occasional drug users their personal effects were thoroughly searched for a modest stash not once had a shred of evidence been found dieter was undeniably clever a large amount of the stuff was always successfully secreted in a dogproof container of unflinchingly crass but basic ingenuity in retrospect poor nancy would agree that the enslavement of sexual corruption empowered all of dieters other abilities in the relative safety of the daruwallas bathtub at the hotel bardez nancy supposed that shed gone along with dieter strictly because of the sex her football players had been friendly oafs and most of the time shed been drunk on beer with dieter she smoked just the right amount of hashish or marijuanadieter was no oaf he had the gaunt good looks of a young man whod recently recovered from a lifethreatening illness had he not been murdered he doubtless would have become one of those men who progress through a number of increasingly young and naïve women his sexual appetite growing confused with his desire to introduce the innocent to a series of successively degrading experiences for as soon as he gave nancy some courage in her sexual potential he undermined what slight selfesteem she had he made her doubt herself and hate herself in ways shed never thought possible in the beginning dieter had simply asked her what is the first sexual experience that you had some confidence in and when she didnt answer himbecause she was thinking to herself that masturbation was the only sexual experience that she had any confidence inhe suddenly said masturbation right yes nancy said quietly he was very gentle with her at first theyd just talked about it everyone is different dieter said philosophically you just have to learn what your own best way is then he told her some stories to relax her one time as an adolescent hed actually stolen a pair of panties from the lingerie drawer of his best friends mother when they lost whatever scent they had i put them back in her drawer and stole a fresh pair he told nancy the thing about masturbation was that i was always afraid id be caught i knew a girl who could make it work only when she was standing up nancy told him i have to be lying down this conversation itself was more intimate than anything shed known it seemed so natural how hed led her to show him how she masturbated she would lie rigidly on her back with her left hand clenching her left buttock she wouldnt actually touch the spot it never worked when she did instead shed rub herself just above the spot with three fingers of her right handher thumb and pinky finger spread like wings she turned her face to the side and dieter would lie beside her kissing her until she needed to turn away from him to breathe when she finished he entered her at that point she was always aroused one time when shed finished he said roll over on your stomach just wait right there i have a surprise for you when he came back to their bed he snuggled beside her kissing her again and againdeep kisses with his tonguewhile he moved one hand underneath her until he could touch her with his fingers exactly as shed touched herself the first time she never saw the dildo slowly with the other hand he began to work the device into her at first she pressed herself down into his fingers as if to get away from it but later she lifted herself up to meet the dildo it was very big but he never hurt her with it and when she was so excited that she had to stop kissing himshe had to screamhe took the dildo out of her and entered her himself from behind and with the fingers of his hand still touching her and touching her compared to the dildo dieter was a little disappointing her parents had once warned nancy that experimenting with sex could make her crazy but the madness that dieter had incited didnt seem to be a dangerous madness still it wasnt the best reason to go to india a memorable arrival thered been some trouble with her visa and she was worried if shed had the right shots because the names were in german she hadnt understood all the inoculations she was sure she was taking too many antimalarial pills but dieter couldnt tell her how many to take he seemed indifferent to disease he was more concerned that an indian customs official would confiscate the dildobut only if nancy took pains to conceal it he said dieter insisted that she carry it casuallywith her toilet articles in her carryon bag but the thing was enormous worse it was of a frightening pink mockflesh color and the tip which was modeled on a circumcised penis had a bluish tingelike a cock left out in the cold nancy thought and where the fake foreskin was rolled there seemed to linger a residue of the lubricating jelly which could never quite be wiped away nancy put the thing in an old white athletic sockthe long kind meant to be worn above the calf she prayed that the indian customs officials would ascribe to the dildo some unmentionable medicinal purposeanything other than that most obvious purpose for which it was intended understandably she wanted dieter to take it with him on his plane but he pointed out to her that the customs officials would then conclude he was a homosexual homosexuals she should know were routinely abused at every countrys port of entry dieter also told nancy that the excessive illegal deutsche marks were traveling with him on his plane and that the reason he didnt want her flying with him was that he didnt want her to be incriminated if he was caught soaking herself in the bathtub at the hotel bardez nancy wondered why shed believed him with hindsight such errors of judgment are plain to see nancy reflected that it hadnt been difficult for dieter to convince her to bring the dildo to bombay it hadnt been the first time that a dildo gained such easy access to india but what a lot of trouble this particular instrument inspired nancy had never been to the east she was introduced to it at the bombay airport at about in the morning shed not seen men so diminished so damaged and so transformed by turmoil by din and by wasteful energy their ceaseless motion and their aggressive curiosity reminded her of scurrying rats and so many of them were barefoot she tried to concentrate on the customs inspector who was attended by two policemen they werent barefoot but the policemena couple of constables in blue shirts and wide blue shortswere wearing the most absurd leg warmers shed ever seen especially in such hot weather and shed never seen nehru caps on cops before in frankfurt dieter had arranged for nancy to be examinedin regard to the proper size for a diaphragmbut when the doctor had discovered shed had a baby hed outfitted her with an intrauterine device instead she hadnt wanted one when the customs inspector was examining her toiletries and one of the overseeing policemen opened a jar of her moisturizer and scooped out a gob of the cream with his finger which the other policeman then sniffed nancy was grateful that there was no diaphragm or spermicidal ointment for them to play with the constables couldnt see or touch or smell her iud but of course there was the dildo which lay untouched in the long athletic sock while the policemen and the customs inspector pawed through the clothes in her rucksack and emptied her carryon bag which was really just an oversized imitationleather purse one of the policemen picked up the battered paperback copy of lawrence durrells clea the fourth novel of the alexandria quartet of which dieter had read only the first justine nancy hadnt read any of them but the novel was dogeared where the last reader had presumably stopped reading and it was at this marked page that the constable opened the book his eyes quickly finding that passage which dieter had underlined in pencil for just such an occasion in truth this copy of clea had made the trip to india and the return trip to germany with two of dieters other women neither of whom had read the novel or even the passage dieter had marked hed chosen the particular passage because it would doubtless identify the reader to any international customs authority as a harmless fool the policeman was so stymied by the passage that he handed the book to his fellow constable who looked stricken as if hed been asked to crack an indecipherable code he too passed the book on it was the customs inspector who finally read the passage nancy watched the clumsy involuntary movement of the mans lips as if he were isolating olive pits gradually the words or something like the words emerged aloud they frankly seemed incomprehensible to nancy she couldnt imagine what the customs inspector and the constables made of them the whole quarter lay drowsing in the umbrageous violet of approaching nightfall the customs inspector read a sky of palpitating velours which was cut into by the stark flare of a thousand electric light bulbs it lay over tatwig street that night like a velvet rind the customs inspector stopped reading looking like a man whod just eaten something odd one of the policemen stared angrily at the book as if he felt compelled to confiscate it or destroy it on the spot but the other constable was as distracted as a bored child he picked up the dildo in the athletic sock and unsheathed the giant penis as one would unsheathe a sword the sock drooped limply in the policemans left hand while his right hand grasped the great cock at its root at the rockhard pair of makeshift balls suddenly seeing what he held the policeman quickly extended the dildo to his fellow constable who took hold of the instrument by the rolled foreskin before he recognized the exaggerated male member which he instantly handed to the customs inspector still holding clea in his left hand the customs inspector seized the dildo at the scrotum then he dropped the novel and snatched the sock from the first gaping policeman but the impressive penis was more difficult to sheathe than to unsheathe and in his haste the customs inspector inserted the instrument the wrong way thus were the balls jammed into the heel of the sock where they made an awkward lumpthey didnt fitand the bluish tip of the thing the circumcised head protruded loosely from the open end of the sock the hole at the end of the enormous cock appeared to stare out at the constables and the customs inspector like the proverbial evil eye where you stay one of the policemen asked nancy he was furiously wiping his hand on his leg warmersa trace of the lubricating jelly perhaps always carry your own bag the other constable advised her agree to a price with the taxiwalla before you get in the car the first policeman said the customs inspector wouldnt look at her shed expected something worse surely the dildo would provoke leeringat least rude or suggestive laughter shed thought but she was in the land of the lingamor so she imagined wasnt the phallic symbol worshiped here nancy thought shed read that the penis was a symbol of lord shiva maybe what nancy carried in her purse was as realistic albeit exaggerated a lingam as these men had ever seen maybe shed made an unholy use of such a symbolwas that why these men wanted nothing to do with her but the constables and the customs inspector werent thinking of lingams or lord shiva they were simply appalled at the portable penis poor nancy was left to find her own way out of the airport and into the shrill cries of the taxiwallas an unending lineup of taxis extended into the infernal blackness of this outlying district of bombay except for the oasis which was the airport there were no lights in santa cruzthere was no sahar in it was then about in the morning nancy had to haggle with her taxiwalla over the fare into bombay after she arranged the prepaid trip she still encountered some difficulty with her driver he was a tamil apparently new to bombay he claimed to not understand hindi or marami it was in uncertain english that nancy heard him asking the other taxiwallas for directions to the taj lady you dont want to go with him one of the taxiwallas told her but shed already paid and was sitting in the back seat of the taxi as they drove toward the city the tamil continued a lengthy debate with another tamil driver who drove his taxi perilously close to theirs for several miles they drove like thispast the unlit slums in the predawn immeasurable darkness wherein the slum dwellers were distinguishable only by the smell of their excrement and their dead or dying fires what were they burning rubbish when the sidewalks on the outskirts of bombay first appeared still without electric light the two tamils raced side by sideeven through the traffic circles those wild roundaboutstheir discourse progressing from an argument to a shouting match to threats which sounded even in tamil quite dire to nancy the seemingly unconcerned passengers in the other tamils taxi were a welldressed british couple in their forties nancy guessed they were also headed to the taj and that this coincidence lay at the heart of the dispute between the two tamils dieter had warned her of this common practice two drivers with two separate fares headed for the same place naturally one of the drivers was attempting to persuade the other to carry both fares at a traffic light the two stopped taxis were suddenly surrounded by barking dogsstarving curs all snapping at one anotherand nancy imagined that if one jumped through the open window at her she could club it with the dildo this passing idea perhaps prepared her for what happened at the next intersection where again the light was against them while they waited this time they were slowly approached by beggars instead of dogs the shouting tamils had attracted some of the sidewalk sleepers whose mounded bodies under their lightcolored clothing could be dimly seen to contrast with the darkened streets and buildings first a man in a ragged filthy dhoti stuck his arm in nancys window nancy noticed that the prim british couplenot in fear but out of sheer obstinacyhad closed their windows despite the moist heat nancy thought she would suffocate if she closed hers instead she spoke sharply to her driverto go after all the light had changed but her tamil and the other tamil were too engrossed in their confrontation to obey the traffic signal her tamil ignored her and to nancys further irritation the other tamil now coerced his british passengers into the street he was beckoning to them that they must join nancy in her cab exactly as dieter had foretold nancy shouted at her driver who turned to her and shrugged she shouted out the window to the other tamil who shouted back at her nancy shouted to the british couple that they shouldnt allow themselves to be so taken advantage of they should demand of their driver that he bring them to their prearranged prepaid destination dont let the bastards screw you nancy shouted then she realized that she was waving the dildo at them to be sure it was still in the sock and they didnt know it was a dildo they could only suppose she was an hysterical young woman threatening them with a sock nancy slid over in her seat please get in she said to the british couple but when they opened the door nancys driver protested he even jerked the car a little forward nancy tapped him on his shoulder with the dildostill in the sock her driver looked indifferent his counterpart was already stuffing the british couples luggage into the trunk as the twosome squeezed into the seat beside her nancy was pressed against the window when a beggar woman pushed a baby in the window and held it in front of her face the child was foulsmelling unmoving expressionlessit looked half dead nancy raised the dildo but what could she do whom should she hit instead she screamed at the woman who indignantly withdrew the baby from the taxi maybe it wasnt even her baby nancy considered possibly it was just a baby that people used for begging perhaps it wasnt even a real baby ahead of them two young men were supporting a drunken or a drugged companion they paused in crossing the road as if they werent sure that the taxi had stopped but the taxi was stopped and nancy was incensed that her driver and the other tamil were still arguing she leaned forward and brought the dildo down across the back of her drivers neck that was when the sock flew off the driver turned to face her she struck him squarely on his nose with the huge cock in her hand drive on she shouted at the tamil suitably impressed with the giant penis he lurched the taxi forwardthrough the traffic light which had turned red again fortunately no other traffic was on the street unfortunately the two young men and their slumped companion were directly in the taxis path at first it seemed to nancy that all three of them were hit later she distinctly remembered that two of them had run away although she couldnt say that shed actually seen the impact she must have closed her eyes while the englishman helped the driver put the body in the front seat of the taxi nancy realized that the young man whod been hit was the one whod appeared to be drunk or drugged it never occurred to her that the young man might already have been dead when the car hit him but this was the subject of the englishmans conversation with the tamil driver had the boy or young man been pushed into the path of the taxi deliberately and was he even conscious before the taxi struck him he looked dead the englishman kept saying yes he is dying before the tamil shouted i am not killing him is he dead now nancy asked quietly oh definitely the englishman replied like the customs inspector he wouldnt look at her but the englishmans wife was staring at nancy who still clutched the fierce dildo in her fist still not looking at her the englishman handed her the sock she covered the weapon and returned it to her big purse is this your first visit to india the englishwoman asked her while the crazed tamil drove them faster and faster through the streets now more and more blessed with electric light the colorful mounds of the sidewalk sleepers were visible all around them in bombay half the population sleeps on the streetsbut its really quite safe here the englishwoman said nancys pinched expression implied to the british couple that she was a newcomer to the city and its smells actually it was the lingering smell of the baby that pinched nancys facehow something so small could reek with such force the body in the front seat made its deadness known the young mans head lolled lifelessly his shoulders impossibly slack whenever the tamil braked or cornered the body responded as heavily as a bag of sand nancy was grateful that she couldnt see the young mans face which was making a dull sound against the windshieldhis face rested flush against the glassuntil the tamil cornered again and then accelerated still not looking at nancy the englishman said dont mind the body dear it seemed unclear whether hed spoken to nancy or to his wife it doesnt bother me his wife answered over marine drive a thick smog hung suspended as warm as a woolen shroud the arabian sea was veiled but the englishwoman pointed to where the sea should have been out there is the ocean she told nancy who began to gag overhead on the lampposts not even the advertisements were visible in the smog the lights strung along marine drive werent smog lights then they were white not yellow in the careening taxi the englishman pointed out the window into the veil of smog this is the queens necklace he told nancy as the taxi raced on he addedmore to assure himself and his wife than to comfort nancywell were almost there im going to throw up nancy said if you dont think about being sick dear you wont be sick the englishwoman said the taxi departed marine drive for the narrower winding streets the three living passengers leaned in to the corners and the dead boy in the front seat appeared to come alive his head walloped the side window he slid forward and his face glanced off the windshield skidding him into the tamil driver who elbowed the body away the young mans hands flew up to his face as if hed just remembered something important then once again the boys body appeared to forget everything there were whistles piercing sharp and loud these were the sounds of the tall sikh doormen who directed the traffic at the taj but nancy was searching for some evidence of the police nearby at the looming gateway of india nancy thought shed seen some sort of police activity there were lights the sound of hysterics a sort of disturbance at first some beggar urchins were reputed to be the cause the story was theyd failed to beg a single rupee from a young swedish couple whod been photographing the gateway of india with an ostentatious and professional use of brightwhite lights and reflectors hence the urchins had urinated on the gateway of india in an effort to spoil the picture and when theyd failed to gain suitable attention from the foreignersthe swedes allegedly found this demonstration symbolically interestingthe urchins then attempted to urinate on the photographic equipment and that was the cause of the ruckus but further investigation would reveal that the swedes had paid the beggars to pee on the gateway of india which had little effectthe gateway of india was already soiled the urchins had never attempted to pee on the swedes photographic equipment that would have been far too bold for themtheyd merely complained that they werent paid enough for pissing on the gateway of india that was the true cause of the ruckus meanwhile the dead boy in the taxi had to wait in the driveway of the taj the tamil driver became hysterical a dead man had been thrown into the path of his carapparently there was a dent the british couple confided to a policeman that the tamil had run a red light upon being struck by a dildo the policeman was the bewildered constable whod finally freed himself from the crime of urination at the gateway of india it wasnt clear to nancy if the british couple was blaming her for the accident if it even had been an accident after all the tamil and the englishman agreed that the boy had looked dead before the taxi hit him what was clear to nancy was that the policeman didnt know what a dildo was a penisa rather large one the englishman explained to the constable she the policeman asked pointing to nancy she is hitting the taxiwalla with a what youll have to show him dear the englishwoman told nancy im not showing him anything nancy said our friend the real policeman it took an hour before nancy was free to register in the hotel a half hour latershed just finished soaking in a hot batha second policeman came to her room this one wasnt a constableno blue shorts a yard wide no silly leg warmers this one wasnt another nerd in a nehru cap he wore an officers cap with the maharashtrian police insignia and a khaki shirt long khaki pants black shoes a revolver it was the duty officer from the colaba police station which has jurisdiction over the taj without his jowls but even then sporting that pencilthin mustacheand years before he would have occasion to question dr daruwalla and inspector dhar at the duckworth clubthe young inspector patel gave a good first impression of himself a future deputy commissioner could be discerned in the young policemans composure inspector patel was aggressive but courteous and even in his twenties he was an intimidating detective in the way that he invited a certain misunderstanding of his questions his manner persuaded you to believe that he already knew the answers to many of the questions he asked although he usually didnt thus he encouraged you to tell the truth by implying that he already knew it and his method of questioning carried the added implication that within your answers inspector patel could discern your moral character in her current state nancy was vulnerable to such an uncommonly proper and pleasantlooking young man to sympathize with nancys situation inspector patel did not present himself as a person whom even a brazen or a supremely selfconfident young woman would choose to show a dildo to also it was about in the morning there may have been some eager early risers who were heralding the sunrise thatwhen viewed across the water and perfectly framed in the arch of the gateway of indiacould still summon the vainglorious days of the british raj but poor nancy wasnt among them besides her only windows and the small balcony didnt afford her a view of the sea dieter had arranged for one of the cheaper rooms below her in the graybrown light was the usual gathering of beggarschild performers for the most part those international travelers who were still staggered by jet lag would find these earlymorning urchins their first contact with india in the light of day nancy sat at the foot of her bed in her bathrobe the inspector sat in the only chair not strewn with her clothes or her bags they could both hear the emptying of nancys bath highly visible as dieter had advised were the usedlooking but unused guidebook and the unread novel by lawrence durrell it was not uncommon the inspector told her for someone to be murdered and then shoved in front of a moving car in this case what was unusual was that the hoax had been so obvious not to me nancy told him she explained that shed not seen the moment of impact shed thought all three of them were hitprobably because shed shut her eyes the englishwoman hadnt observed the moment of impact either inspector patel informed nancy she was looking at you instead the policeman explained oh i see nancy said the englishman was quite sure that a bodyat least an unconscious body if not a dead onehad been pushed into the path of the oncoming car but the taxiwalla doesnt know what he saw said inspector patel the tamil keeps changing his story when nancy continued to stare blankly at him the policeman added the driver says he was distracted by what nancy asked although she knew by what by what you hit him with inspector patel replied there was an uncomfortable pause while the policeman looked from chair to chair surveying her emptied bags the two books her clothes nancy thought he must be at least five years older than she was although he looked younger his selfassurance made him seem disarmingly grownup yet he didnt exhibit the cocksure arrogance of cops inspector patel didnt swagger there was something in his controlled mannerisms that came from an absolute correctness of purpose what struck nancy as his pure goodness was riveting and she thought he was a wonderful coffeeandcream color he had the blackest hairand such a thin perfectly edged mustache that nancy wanted to touch it the overall nattiness of the young man stood in obvious contrast to that absence of vanity which is commonly associated with a happily married man here in the taj in the presence of such a buxom blonde in her bathrobe inspector patel was obviously unmarried he was as alert to the details of his appearance as he was to every inch of nancy and to the particular revelations of nancys room she didnt realize he was looking for the dildo may i see the thing you hit the taxiwalla with the inspector asked finally god knows how the idiot tamil had described it nancy went to get it from the bathroom having decided to keep it with her toilet articles god knows what the british couple had told the inspector if the inspector had talked to them theyd doubtless described her as a rude young woman brandishing an enormous cock nancy gave the dildo to inspector patel and again sat down at the foot of her bed the young policeman politely handed the instrument back without looking at her im sorryit was necessary for me to see it inspector patel said i was having some difficulty imagining it he explained both drivers were paid their fares at the airport nancy told him i dont like to be cheated she said its not the easiest country for a woman traveling alone the inspector said by the quick way he glanced at her she understood this was a question friends are meeting me nancy told him im just waiting for them to call dieter had advised her to say this anyone assessing her student clothing and her cheap bags would know that she couldnt afford many nights at the taj so will you be traveling with your friends or staying in bombay the inspector asked her nancy recognized her advantage as long as she held the dildo the young policeman would find it awkward to look in her eyes ill do what they do she said indifferently she held the penis in her lap with the slightest movement of her wrist she discovered she could tap the circumcised head against her bare knee but it was her bare feet that appeared to transfix inspector patel perhaps it was their impossible whiteness or else their improbable sizeeven bare nancys feet were bigger than the inspectors little shoes nancy stared at him without mercy she enjoyed the prominent bones in his sharply featured face it would have been impossible for her to look at his face and imagine iteven in yearswith jowls she thought he had the blackest eyes and the longest eyelashes still staring at nancys feet inspector patel spoke forlornly i suppose theres no known phone number or an address where i could reach you nancy felt she understood everything that attracted her to him shed certainly tried hard to lose her innocence in iowa but the football players hadnt touched it shed spoiled her real innocence in germany with dieter and now it was lost for good but here was a man who was still innocent she probably both frightened and attracted himif he even knew it nancy thought do you want to see me again she asked him she thought the question was ambiguous enough but he stared at her feetwith both longing and horror she imagined but you couldnt identify the two other men even if we found them said inspector patel i could identify the other taxi driver nancy said weve already got him the inspector told her nancy stood up from the bed and carried the dildo to the bathroom when she came back inspector patel was at the window watching the beggars she didnt want to have any advantage over him anymore maybe she was imagining that the inspector had fallen hopelessly in love with her and that if she shoved him on the bed and fell on top of him he would worship her and be her slave forever maybe it wasnt even him she wanted possibly it was only his obvious propriety and only because she felt shed given away her essential goodness and would never get it back then it struck her that he was no longer interested in her feet he kept glancing at her hands even though shed put away the dildo he wouldnt look in her eyes do you want to see me again nancy repeated there was no ambiguity to her question now she stood closer to him than was necessary but he ignored the question by pointing to the child performers far below them always the same stuntsthey never change inspector patel remarked nancy refused to look at the beggars she continued to stare at inspector patel you could give me your phone number she said then i could call you but why would you the inspector asked her he kept watching the beggars nancy turned away from him and stretched out on the bed she lay on her stomach with the robe gathered tightly around her she thought about her blond hair she thought it must look nice spread out on the pillows but she didnt know if inspector patel was looking at her she just knew that her voice would be muffled by the pillows and that hed have to come closer to the bed in order to hear her what if i need you she asked him what if i get in some trouble and need the police that young man was strangled inspector patel told her by the sound of his voice she knew he was near her nancy kept her face buried in the pillows but she reached out to the sides of the bed with her hands shed been thinking that shed never learn anything about the dead boynot even if the act of killing him had been wicked and full of hatred or merely inadvertent now she knewthe young man couldnt have been inadvertently strangled i didnt strangle him nancy said i know that said inspector patel when he touched her hand she lay absolutely motionless then his touch was gone in a second she heard him in the bathroom it sounded as if he was running a bath you have big hands he called to her she didnt move the boy was strangled by someone with small hands probably another boy but maybe a woman you suspected me nancy said she couldnt tell if hed heard her over the running bathwater i said you suspected meuntil you saw my hands nancy called to him he shut the water off the tub couldnt be very full nancy thought i suspect everybody inspector patel said but i didnt really suspect you of strangling the boy nancy was simply too curious she got up from the bed and went to the bathroom inspector patel was sitting on the edge of the tub watching the dildo float around and around like a toy boat just as i thoughtit floats he said then he submerged it he held it under the water for almost a full minute never taking his eyes off it no bubbles he said it floats because its hollow he told her but if it came apartif you could open itthere would be bubbles i thought it would come apart he let the water out of the tub and wiped the dildo dry with a towel one of your friends called while you were registering inspector patel told nancy he didnt want to speak with youhe just wanted to know if youd checked in nancy was blocking the bathroom door the inspector paused for her to get out of his way usually this means that someone is interested to know if youve passed safely through customs therefore i thought you were bringing something in but you werent were you no nancy managed to say well then as i leave ill tell the hotel to give you your messages directly the inspector said thank you nancy replied hed already opened the door to the hall before he handed her his card do call me if you get into any trouble he told her she chose to stare at the card it was better than watching him leave there were several printed phone numbers one circled with a ballpoint pen and his printed name and title vijay patel police inspector colaba station nancy didnt know how far from home vijay patel was when his whole family had left gujarat for kenya vijay had come to bombay for a gujarati to make any headway on a maharashtrian police force was no small accomplishment but the gujarati patels in vijays family were merchantsthey wouldnt have been impressed vijay was as cut off from themthey were in business in nairobias nancy was from iowa after shed read and reread the policemans card nancy went out to the balcony and watched the beggars for a while the children were enterprising performers and there was a monotony to their stunts that was soothing like most foreigners she was easily impressed by the contortionists occasionally one of the guests would throw an orange to the child performers or a banana some threw coins nancy thought it was cruel the way a crippled boy with one leg and a padded crutch was always beaten by the other children when he attempted to hop and stagger ahead of them to the money or the fruit she didnt realize that the cripples role was choreographed he was central to the dramatic action he was also older than the other children and he was their leader in reality he could beat up the other childrenand on occasion had but the pathos was unfamiliar to nancy and she looked for something to throw to him all she could find was a rupee note this was too much money to give to a beggar but she didnt know any better she weighted the bill down with two bobby pins and stood on the balcony with the money held above her head until she caught the crippled boys attention hey lady he called some of the child performers paused in their handstands and their contortions and nancy sailed the rupee note into the air it rose briefly in an updraft before it floated down the children ran back and forth trying to be in the right place to catch it the crippled boy appeared content to let one of the other children grab the money no its for youfor you nancy cried to him but he ignored her a tall girl one of the contortionists caught the rupee note she was so surprised at the amount she didnt hand it over to the crippled boy quite quickly enough and so he struck her in the small of her back with his crutcha blow with sufficient force to knock her to her hands and knees then the cripple snatched up the money and hopped away from the girl who had begun crying nancy realized that shed disrupted the usual drama somehow she was at fault as the beggars scattered one of the tall sikh doormen from the taj approached the crying girl he carried a long wooden pole with a gleaming brass hook on one endit was a transom pole for opening and closing the transom windows above the tall doorsand the doorman used this pole to lift the ragged skirt of the girls torn and filthy dress he deftly exposed her before she could snatch the skirt of her dress between her legs and cover herself then he poked the girl in the chest with the brass end of the pole and when she tried to stand he whacked her hard in the small of her back exactly where the cripple had hit her with his crutch the girl cried out then she scurried away from the sikh on all fours he was skillful in pursuing herat herding her with sharp jabs and thrusts with the pole finally she got to her feet and outran him the sikh had a dark spadeshaped beard flecked with silver and he wore a darkred turban he shouldered the transom pole like a rifle and he cast a cursory glance to nancy on her balcony she retreated into her room she was sure he could see under her bathrobe and straight up her crotchhe was directly below her but the balcony itself prevented such a view nancy imagined things obviously there were rules she thought the beggars could beg but they couldnt cry it was too early in the morning and crying would wake the guests who were managing to sleep nancy instantly ordered the most american thing she could find on the roomservice menuscrambled eggs and toastand when they brought her tray she saw two sealed envelopes propped between the orange juice and the tea her heart jumped because she hoped they were declarations of undying love from inspector patel but one was the message from dieter that the inspector had intercepted it said simply that dieter had called he was glad shed arrived safelyhed see her soon and the other was a printed request from the hotel management asking her to kindly refrain from throwing things out her window she was ravenous and as soon as shed finished eating she was sleepy she closed the curtains against the light of day and turned up the ceiling fan as fast as it would go for a while she lay awake thinking of inspector patel she even toyed with the idea of dieter being caught with the money as he tried to pass through customs nancy was still naïve enough to imagine that the deutsche marks were coming into the country with dieter it hadnt even crossed her mind that shed already brought the money in the unwitting courier it seemed to her that she slept for days it was dark when she woke she would never know if it was the predawn darkness of the next day or the predawn of the day after that she awoke to some sort of commotion in the hall outside her room someone was trying to get in but shed doublelocked the door and there was a safety chain too she got out of bed there in the hall was dieter he was surly to the porter whom he sent away without a tip once inside the room but only after hed doublelocked the door and hooked the safety chain in place he turned to her and asked her where the dildo was this wasnt exactly gallant of him nancy thought but in her sleepiness she supposed it was merely his aggressive way of being amorous she pointed to it in the bathroom then she opened her robe and let it slip off her shoulders and fall at her feet she stood in the bathroom doorway expecting him to kiss her or at least look at her dieter held the dildo over the sink he appeared to be heating the unnatural head of the penis with his cigarette lighter nancy woke up in a hurry she picked up her bathrobe and put it back on she stepped away from the bathroom door but she could still observe dieter he was careful not to let the flame blacken the dildo and he concentrated the heat not at the tip but at the place where the fake foreskin was rolled it then appeared to nancy that he was slowly melting the dildo she realized that there was a substance like wax dripping into the sink where the fake foreskin was rolled there emerged a thin line circumscribing the head when dieter had melted the wax seal he ran the tip of the big penis under cold water and then grasped the circumcised head with a towel he needed quite a lot of force to unscrew the dildo which was as hollow as inspector patel had observed the wax seal had prevented any air from escaping thered been no bubbles underwater inspector patel had been half right hed looked in the right place but not in the right waya young policemans error inside the dildo rolled very tightly were thousands of deutsche marks for the return trip to germany quite a lot of highquality hashish could be packed very tightly in such a big dildo the wax seal would prevent the dogs at german customs from smelling the indian hemp inside nancy sat at the foot of the bed while dieter removed a roll of marks from the dildo and spread the bills out flat in his hand then he zipped the marks into a money belt which was around his waist under his shirt he left several sizable rolls of marks in the dildo which he reassembled he screwed the tip on tight but he didnt bother resealing it with wax the line where the thing unscrewed was barely visible anyway it was partially hidden by the fake foreskin when dieter had finished with this his chief concern he undressed and filled the bathtub it wasnt until he settled into the tub that nancy spoke to him what would have happened to me if id been caught she asked him but they wouldnt have caught you babe dieter told her hed picked up the babe from watching american movies he said couldnt you have told me nancy asked him then you would have been nervous dieter said then they would have caught you after his bath he rolled a joint which they smoked together although nancy thought she was being cautious she got higher than she wanted to and just a little disoriented it was strong stuff dieter assured her that it was by no means the best stuffit was just something hed bought en route from the airport i made a little detour he told her she was too stoned to ask him where he could have gone at or in the morning and he didnt bother to tell her that hed gone to a brothel in kamathipura hed bought the stuff from the madam and while he was at it hed fucked a yearold prostitute for only five rupees he was told she was the only girl not with a customer at the time and dieter had fucked her standing up in a kind of hall because all the cots in all the cubicles were occupiedor so the madam had said after dieter and nancy smoked the joint dieter was able to encourage nancy to masturbate it seemed to her that it took a long time and she couldnt remember him leaving the bed to get the dildo later when he was asleep she lay awake and thought for a while about the thousands of deutsche marks that were inside the thing that had been inside her she decided not to tell dieter about the murdered boy or inspector patel she got out of bed and made sure the card the inspector had given her was well concealed among her clothes she didnt go back to bed she was standing on the balcony at dawn when the first of the beggars arrived after a while the same child performers were perfectly in place like figures painted by the daylight itselfeven the crippled boy with his padded crutch he waved to her it was so early he was careful not to call too loudly but nancy could hear him distinctly hey lady he made her cry she went back inside the room and watched dieter while he was sleeping she thought again about the thousands of deutsche marks she wanted to throw them out the window to the child performers but it frightened her to imagine what a terrible scene she might cause she went into the bathroom and tried to unscrew the dildo to count how many marks were inside but dieter had screwed the thing too tightly together this was probably deliberate she realized at last she was learning she went through his clothes looking for the money beltshe thought she could count how many marks were therebut she couldnt find it she lifted the bedsheet and saw that dieter was naked except for the money belt it worried her that she couldnt remember falling asleep nor could she remember dieter getting out of bed to put the money belt on she would have to be more careful she thought nancy was beginning to appreciate the extent to which dieter might be willing to use her she worried that shed developed a morbid curiosity about how far he would go nancy found it calming to speculate about inspector patel she indulged herself with the comforting notion that she could turn to the inspector if she needed him if she was really in trouble although the morning was intensely bright nancy didnt close the curtains in the light of day it was easier for her to imagine that leaving dieter was merely a matter of picking the right time and if things get too bad nancy thought to herself i can just pick up the phone and ask for vijay patelpolice inspector colaba station but nancy had never been to the east she didnt know where she was she had no idea the rats four baths in bombay in his bedroom where dr daruwalla sat shivering in julias embrace the unresolved nature of the majority of the doctors phone messages depressed him ranjits peevish complaints about the dwarfs wife deepas expectations regarding the potential bonelessness of a child prostitute vinods fear of the firstfloor dogs father cecils consternation that none of the jesuits at st ignatius knew exactly when dhars twin was arriving and director balraj guptas greedy desire to release the new inspector dhar movie in the midst of the murders inspired by the last inspector dhar movie to be sure there was the familiar voice of the woman who tried to sound like a man and who repeatedly relished the details of old lowjis car bombing this message wasnt lacking in resolution but it was muted by excessive repetition and detective patels cool delivery of the news that he had a private matter to discuss didnt sound unresolved to the doctor although dr daruwalla may not have known what the message meant the deputy commissioner seemed to have made up his mind about the matter but all these things were only mildly depressing in comparison to farrokhs memory of the big blonde with her bad foot liebchen julia whispered to her husband we shouldnt leave john d alone think about the hippie another time both to break him from his trance and as a physical reminder of her affection for him julia squeezed farrokh she simply hugged him more or less in the area of his lower chest or just above his little beer belly it surprised her how her husband winced in pain the sharp tweak in his sideit must have been a ribinstantly reminded dr daruwalla of his collision with the second mrs dogar in the foyer of the duckworth club farrokh then told julia the story how the vulgar womans body was as hard as a stone wall but you said you fell down julia told him i would guess it was your contact with the stone floor that caused your injury no it was that damn woman herselfher body is a rock dr daruwalla said mr dogar was knocked down too only that crude woman was left standing well shes supposed to be a fitness freak julia replied shes a weight lifter farrokh said then he remembered that the second mrs dogar had reminded him of someonedefinitely a longago movie star he decided he imagined that one night he would discover who it was on the videocassette recorder both in bombay and in toronto he had so many tapes of old movies that it was hard for him to remember how hed lived before the vcr farrokh sighed and his sore rib responded with a little twinge of pain let me rub some liniment on you liebchen julia said liniment is for musclesit was my rib she hurt the doctor complained although julia still favored the theory that the stone floor was the source of her husbands pain she humored him was it mrs dogars shoulder or her elbow that hit you she asked youre going to think its funny farrokh admitted to julia but i swear i ran right into her bosom then its no wonder she hurt you liebchen julia replied it was julias opinion that the second mrs dogar had no bosom to speak of dr daruwalla could sense his wifes impatience on john ds behalf but less for the fact that inspector dhar had been left alone than that the dear boy hadnt been forewarned of the pending arrival of his twin yet even this dilemma struck the doctor as trivialas insubstantial as the second mrs dogars bosomin comparison to the big blonde in the bathtub at the hotel bardez twenty years couldnt lessen the impact of what had happened to dr daruwalla there for it had changed him more than anything in his whole life had changed him and the longago memory of it endured unfaded although hed never returned to goa all other beach resorts had been ruined for him by the unpleasant association julia recognized her husbands expression she could see how far away he was she knew exactly where he was although she wanted to reassure john d that the doctor would join them soon it would have been heartless of her to leave her husband dutifully she remained seated beside him sometimes she thought she ought to tell him that it was his own curiosity that had got him into trouble but this wasnt entirely a fair accusation dutifully she remained silent her own memory although it didnt torture her with the same details that made the doctor miserable was surprisingly vivid she could still see farrokh on the balcony of the hotel bardez where hed been as restless and bored as a little boy what a long bath the hippie is taking the doctor had said to his wife she looked like she needed a long bath liebchen julia had told him that was when farrokh pulled the hippies rucksack closer to him and peered into the top of it the top wouldnt quite close dont look at her things julia told him its just a book farrokh said he pulled the copy of clea from the top of the rucksack i was just curious to know what she was reading put it back julia said i will the doctor said but he was reading the marked passage the same bit about the umbrageous violet and the velvet rind that one customs official and two policemen had already found so spellbinding she has a poetic sensibility dr daruwalla said i find that hard to believe julia told him put it back but putting the book back presented the doctor with a new difficulty something was in the way stop groping through her things julia said the damn book doesnt fit farrokh said im not groping through her things an overpowering mustiness embraced him from the depths of the rucksack a stale exhalation the hippies clothing felt damp as a married man with daughters dr daruwalla was particularly sensitive to an abundance of dirty underpants in any womans laundry a mangled bra clung to his wrist as he tried to extract his hand and still the copy of clea wouldnt lie flat at the top of the rucksack something poked against the book what the hell is this thing the doctor wondered then julia heard him gasp she saw him spring away from the rucksack as if an animal had bitten his hand what is it she cried i dont know the doctor moaned he staggered to the rail of the balcony where he gripped the tangled branches of the clinging vine several brightyellow finches with seeds falling from their beaks exploded from among the flowers and a gecko sprang from the branch nearest the doctors right hand it wriggled into the open end of a drainpipe just as dr daruwalla leaned over the balcony and vomited onto the patio below fortunately no one was having afternoon tea there there was only one of the hotels sweepers whod fallen asleep in a curled position in the shade of a large potted plant the doctors falling vomit left the sweeper undisturbed liebchen julia cried im all right farrokh said its nothing reallyits just lunch julia was staring at the hippies rucksack as if she expected something to crawl out from under the copy of clea what was itwhat did you see she asked farrokh im not sure he said but julia was thoroughly exasperated with him you dont know youre not sure its nothing reallyit just made you throw up she said she reached for the rucksack well if you dont tell me ill just see for myself no dont the doctor cried then tell me julia said i saw a penis farrokh said not even julia could think of anything to say i mean it cant be a real penis he continued i dont mean that its someones severed penis or anything ghastly like that what do you mean julia asked him i mean its a very lifelike very graphic very large male memberits an enormous cock with balls dr daruwalla said do you mean a dildo julia asked him farrokh was shocked that she knew the word he barely knew it himself a colleague in toronto a fellow surgeon kept a collection of pornographic magazines in his hospital locker and it was only in one of these that dr daruwalla had ever seen a dildo the advertisement hadnt been nearly as realistic as the terrifying thing in the hippies rucksack i think it is a dildo yes farrokh said let me see julia said she attempted to dodge past her husband to the rucksack no julia please farrokh cried well you saw iti want to see it julia said i dont think you do the doctor said for gods sake farrokh julia said he sheepishly stood aside then he glanced nervously at the bathroom door behind which the huge hippie was still bathing hurry up julia and dont mess up her things dr daruwalla said its not as if everything has been neatly foldedoh my goodness julia said well there it isyouve seen it now get away said dr daruwalla who was a little surprised that his wife had not recoiled in horror does it use batteries julia asked she was still looking at it batteries farrokh cried for gods sake juliaplease get away the concept of such a thing being batterypowered would haunt the doctors dreams for years the idea certainly worsened the agony of waiting for the hippie to finish her bath fearing that the freakish girl had drowned dr daruwalla timidly approached the bathroom door through which he heard neither singing nor splashing there wasnt a sign of bathtub life but before he could knock on the door the doctor was surprised by the uncanny powers of the bathing hippie she seemed to sense that someone was near hello out there the girl said laconically would you bring me my rucksack i forgot it dr daruwalla fetched the rucksack for its size it was uncommonly heavy full of batteries farrokh supposed he opened the bathroom door cautiously and only partiallyjust enough to reach his hand with the rucksack inside the door steam with a thousand conflicting scents engulfed him the girl said thanks just drop it the doctor withdrew his hand and closed the door wondering at the sound of metal as the rucksack struck the floor either a machete or a machine gun farrokh imagined he didnt want to know julia had arranged a sturdy table on the balcony and covered it with a clean white sheet even late in the day there was better light for surgery outside than in the rooms dr daruwalla assembled his instruments and prepared the anesthetic in the bathroom nancy managed to reach her rucksack without getting out of the bathtub she began a search for anything marginally cleaner than what shed been wearing it was a matter of exchanging one kind of dirt for another but she wanted to wear a longsleeved cotton blouse and a bra and long pants she also wanted to wash the dildo andif she was strong enoughshe wanted to unscrew the thing and count how much money was left it was repellent to her to touch the cock but she managed to withdraw it from the rucksack by pinching one of the balls between the thumb and index finger of her right hand then she dropped the dildo into the bath where of course it floated the balls slightly submerged the circumcised head raisedalmost in the manner of a perplexed solitary swimmer its single evil eye was on her as for dr daruwalla and his wife their growing anxiety was in no way lessened by the unmistakable sounds of the bathtub being emptied and refilled it was the hippies fourth bath one can sympathize with farrokh and julia for their misunderstanding of the grunts and groans that nancy made while she was struggling to unscrew the preposterous penis and determine the amount of deutsche marks that it contained after all despite their rekindling of the sexual flame the pleasure of which was partially owed to mr james salter the daruwallas were sexually tame souls given the size of the intimidating instrument that theyd seen in the hippies rucksack and the sounds of physical exertion that passed from behind the bathroom door its forgivable that farrokh and julia allowed their imaginations to run away with them how could the daruwallas have known that nancys cries and curses of frustration were simply the result of her being unable to unscrew the dildo and despite how far the daruwallas allowed their imaginations to run they never could have imagined what truly had happened to nancy four baths wouldnt wash away what had happened to her with dieter from the moment dieter had moved them out of the taj everything for nancy had gone from bad to worse their new lodgings were in a small place on marine drive the sea green guest house which nancy noticed was an offwhite coloror maybe in the smog a kind of bluegray dieter said he favored the place because it was popular with an arab clientele and arabs were safe nancy didnt notice many arabs but she might not have spotted all of them she supposed she also didnt know what dieter meant by safehe meant only that the arabs were indifferent to drug trafficking on such a small scale as his at the sea green guest house nancy was introduced to one of the featured activities involved in buying highquality narcoticsnamely waiting dieter made some phone calls then they waited according to dieter the best deals came to you indirectly no matter how hard you tried to make a direct deal and to make it in bombay you always ended up in goa doing your business with the friend of a friend and you always had to wait this time the friend of a friend was known to frequent the brothel area of bombay although the word on the street was that the guy had already gone to goa dieter would have to find him there the way you found him was you rented a cottage on a certain beach then you waited you could ask for him but even so youd never find him he always found you this time his name was rahul it was always a common name and you never knew the last namejust rahul in the redlight district they called him pretty thats a funny thing to call a guy nancy observed hes probably one of those chicks with dicks dieter said this expression was new to nancy she doubted that dieter had picked it up from watching american movies dieter attempted to explain the transvestite scene to nancy but hed never understood that the hijras were eunuchsthat theyd truly been emasculated hed confused the hijras with the zenanasthe unaltered transvestites a hijra had once exposed himself to dieter but dieter had mistaken the scar for a vaginahed thought the hijra was a real woman as for the zenanas the socalled chicks with dicks dieter also called them little boys with breasts dieter said that they were all fags who took estrogens to make their tits bigger but the estrogens also made their pricks get smaller and smaller until they looked like little boys dieter tended to dwell on sexual things and he used the halfhearted hope of finding rahul in bombay as an excuse to take nancy to the redlight district she didnt want to go but dieter seemed destined to act out the old dictum that there is at least a kind of certainty in degradation debasement is specific there is something exact about sexual corruption that dieter probably found comforting in comparison to the vagueness of looking for rahul for nancy the wet heat and ripe smell of bombay were only enhanced by close proximity to the cage girls on falkland road arent they amazing dieter asked her but why they were amazing eluded nancy on the ground floor of the old wooden buildings there were cagelike rooms with beckoning girls inside them above these cages the buildings rose not more than four or five stories with more girls on the windowsillsor else a curtain was drawn across a window to indicate that a prostitute was with a customer nancy and dieter drank tea at the olympia on falkland road it was an old mirrorlined café frequented by the street prostitutes and their pimps several of whom dieter seemed to know but these contacts either couldnt or wouldnt shed any light on the whereabouts of rahul they wouldnt even speak of rahulexcept to say that he belonged to the transvestite scene which they wanted no part of i told you he was one of those chicks with dicks dieter told nancy it was growing dark when they left the café and the cage girls demonstrated a more aggressive interest in her as she and dieter passed some of them lifted their skirts and made obscene gestures some of them threw garbage at her and sudden groups of men surrounded her on the street dieter almost casually drove them away from her he seemed to find the attention amusing the more vulgar the attention was the more it amused dieter nancy had been too overwhelmed to question him which she realized as she sank deeper into dr daruwallas bathtub was a pattern she had finally broken she submerged the dildo holding it against her stomach because the dildo had not been reseated with wax there were bubbles afraid that the deutsche marks might get wet nancy stopped toying with the instrument instead she thought of the entrenching tool in her rucksack the doctor had surely heard it clank against the floor dieter had bought it at an armysurplus shop in bombay the tool was an olivedrab color fully extended it was a spade with a short twofoot handle which could be folded by means of an iron hinge and the blade of the spade could be turned at a right angle to the handle until it resembled a footlong hoe if dieter were alive he would be the first to agree that it could also be successfully employed as a tomahawk hed told nancy that the entrenching tool might be useful in goa both for defense against the dacoitsbandits occasionally preyed upon the hippies thereand for digging the spontaneous latrine nancy now smiled ruefully as she reflected on the expanded features of the tool certainly shed found it adequate for digging dieters grave when she shut her eyes and sank deeper into the tub she could still taste the sweet smoky tea that they served at the olympia she could remember its dry bitter aftertaste too with her eyes shut and the warm water holding her she could remember her changing expression in the pitted mirrors of the café the tea had made her feel lightheaded she was unfamiliar with the red spittle from the betel chewing that was expectorated everywhere around them and not even the hindi film songs and the qawwali on the jukebox in the olympia had prepared her for the assault of noise along falkland road a drunken man followed her and pulled her hair until dieter knocked him down and kicked him the better brothels are in the rooms above the cages dieter told her knowingly a boy with a goatskin full of water collided with her she was sure hed meant to step on her foot someone pinched her breast but she didnt see who it wasman woman or child dieter pulled her into a bidi shop where they also sold stationery and silver trinkets and the small pipes for smoking ganja hey ganjamanmistah bhangwalla the proprietor greeted dieter he smiled happily at nancy as he pointed to dieter he mistah bhangmasterthe very best ganjawalla the proprietor said appreciatively nancy was fingering an unusual ballpoint pen it was real silver and made in india was written in script lengthwise along the pen the bottom part said made in the top part said india the pen wouldnt close securely if the script wasnt perfectly aligned she thought this was a stupid flaw also when you wrote with the pen the words were all wrong in made india the pen saidand in made was upside down very best quality the proprietor told her made in england it says its made in india nancy said yesthey make it in india too the proprietor agreed youre a shitty liar dieter told him but he bought nancy the pen nancy was thinking shed like to go somewhere cool and write postcards in iowa wouldnt they be surprised to hear where she was but at the same time she was thinking theyll never hear from me again bombay both terrified and exhilarated her it was so foreign and seemingly lawless that nancy felt she could be anybody she wanted to be it was the clean slate she was looking for and in the back of her mind with the persistence of something permanent was that impossible goal of purity to which shed been drawn in the person of inspector patel in the overly dramatic manner of many fallen young women nancy believed that only two roads remained open to her she could keep on falling until she was indifferent to her own defilement or else she could aspire to acts of social conscience so great and selfsacrificing that she could reclaim her innocence and redeem everything in the world shed descended to there were only these choices stay with dieter or go to inspector patel but what had she to give to vijay patel nancy feared it was nothing that the good policeman wanted later in the doorway of a transvestite brothel a hijra exposed himself so boldly and suddenly that nancy hadnt time to look away even dieter was forced to admit that there was no evidence of a penisnot even a little one as to what was there nancy wasnt sure dieter concluded that rahul might be one of thesea kind of radical eunuch he said dieters questions about rahul were greeted with sullenness if not hostility the only hijra who permitted them to come inside his cage was a fussy middleaged transvestite who sat before a mirror in growing disappointment with his wig in the same tiny room a younger hijra was feeding a watery gray milk to a newborn goat by means of a babys bottle on the subject of rahul all the younger one would say was he is not being one of us the older one said only that rahul was in goa neither of the hijras could be drawn into a discussion of rahuls nickname at the mere mention of pretty the one who was feeding the goat abruptly pulled the baby bottle out of the goats mouth it made a pop and the goat bleated in surprise the younger hijra pointed the baby bottle at nancy and made a disparaging gesture nancy interpreted the bottlepointing as an indication that she wasnt as pretty as rahul she was relieved that dieter seemed disinclined to fight although she could sense he was angry he wasnt exactly gallant on her behalf but at least he was angry back on the street to assure him she was philosophic about the insult of being ill compared to rahul nancy said something that she hoped sounded tolerant in a liveandletlive sort of way well they werent very nice she observed but it was nice how they were taking care of the goat dont be a fool dieter told her some people fuck girls some people fuck eunuchs in dragothers fuck goats this terrible thought made her anxious again she knew shed deceived herself if shed believed shed stopped falling in kamathipura there were other brothels outside a warren of small rooms a fat woman in a magenta sari sat crosslegged on a rope bed supported by orange crates either the woman or the bed swayed slightly she was the madam for a higher class of prostitutes than one could find on falkland road or grant road naturally dieter didnt tell nancy that this was the same brothel where hed fucked the yearold girl for only five rupees because they had to do it standing up it seemed to nancy that dieter knew the enormous madam but she couldnt understand their conversation two of the bolder prostitutes had come out of the brothel to stare at her close up a third girl who was perhaps or was especially curious she remembered dieter from the night before nancy saw the blue tattoo on her upper arm which dieter later said was just the prostitutes name it was impossible for nancy to know if her bodys other ornaments were of any religious significance or if they were merely decorative her bindithe cosmetic dot on her foreheadwas a saffron color edged with gold and she wore a gold ring in her left nostril the girls curiosity was a little too extreme for nancy who turned awaydieter was still talking to the madam their conversation had grown heated vagueness made dieter angry and everyone was vague about rahul you go to goa the fat madam had advised you say you looking for him then he find you but nancy could tell that dieter preferred to be in more control of the situation she also knew what would happen next back at the sea green guest house dieter was very desirous anger frequently had this effect on him first he made nancy masturbate then he used the dildo rather roughly on her she was surprised she was even remotely excited afterward dieter was still angry while they waited for an overnight bus to goa nancy was beginning to imagine how she would leave him the country was so intimidating it was hard to see herself leaving him if there was no one else on the bus they saw a small american girl she was being bothered by some indian men nancy spoke up are you a coward dieter why dont you tell those guys to leave that girl alone why dont you ask that girl to sit with us nancy gets sick remembering when her relationship with dieter took such a heralded turn nancy felt a renewal of selfconfidence in the bathroom of the hotel bardez so what if she couldnt unscrew the dildo she would find someone with stronger hands if not a pair of pliers with that relaxing thought she threw the dildo across the bathroom it struck the bluetiled wall and bounced back toward the bathtub thereupon nancy pulled the plug the drain gurgled loudly and dr daruwalla scurried away from his side of the bathroom door on the balcony he told his wife i think shes finally finished i believe she threw the cock against the wallshe threw something anyway its a dildo julia said i wish you wouldnt call it a cock whatever it is i believe she threw it farrokh said they listened to the tub it went on gurgling below them on the patio the sweeper had awakened from his nap beneath the shade of the potted plant they could hear him discussing the doctors vomit with punkaj the servant boy punkajs opinion was that the culprit was a dog it wasnt until nancy stood in the tub to dry herself that the pain in her foot reminded her of why shed come to where she was she welcomed whatever small surgery was required to remove the glass she was a young woman in a position to find a certain anticipated pain almost purifying are you a coward dieter nancy whispered to herself just to hear herself say it again it had been so briefly gratifying the small girl on the bus who was originally from seattle turned out to be an ashram groupie whod traveled through the subcontinent constantly changing her religion she said shed been thrown out of the punjab for doing something insulting to the sikhs although she hadnt understood what it was shed done she wore a closefitting lowcut tank top it was evident that she didnt wear a bra shed also acquired some silver bangles which she wore on her wrists shed been told that the bangles had been part of someones dowry they werent the usual dowry material her name was beth shed lost her fondness for buddhism when a highplaced bodhisattva had tried to seduce her with chang nancy assumed this was something you smoked but dieter told her it was tibetan rice beer which reputedly made westerners ill in maharashtra beth said shed been to poona but only to express her contempt for her fellow americans who were meditating at the rajneesh ashram shed lost her fondness for what she called california meditating too no lousy export guru was going to win her over beth was taking a scholarly approach to hinduism she wasnt ready to study the vedasthe ancient spiritual texts the orthodox hindu scripturesunder any kind of supervision beth would begin with her own interpretations of the upanishads which she was currently reading she showed the small book of spiritual treatises to nancy and dieter it was one of those thin volumes in which the introduction and the note on the translations amounted to more pages than the text beth didnt think it odd to pursue her study of hinduism by journeying to goa which attracted more christian pilgrims than any other kind she admitted she was going for the beaches and for the companionship of people like herself besides soon the monsoon would be everywhere and by then shed be in rajasthan the lakes were lovely during the monsoonshed heard about an ashram on a lake meanwhile she was grateful for the company it was no fun being a woman on your own in india beth assured them around her neck was a rawhide thong from which dangled a polished vulvashaped stone beth explained that this was her yoni an object of veneration in shiva temples the phallic lingam representing the penis of lord shiva is placed in the vulvate yoni representing the vagina of shivas wife parvati priests pour a libation over the two symbols worshipers partake of a kind of communion in the runoff after this puzzling account of her unusual necklace beth was exhausted and curled up on the seat beside nancy she fell asleep with her head in nancys lap dieter also fell asleep in the seat across the aisle but not before saying to nancy that he thought it would be great fun to show beth the dildo let her put that lingam in her stupid yoni he said crudely nancy sat awake hating him as the bus moved through maharashtra in the darkness the most constant sound was the bus drivers tape recorder which played only qawwali the recorder was turned to a low volume and nancy found the religious verses soothing of course she didnt know that they were muslim verses nor would she have cared beths breathing was soft and regular against her thigh nancy thought about how long it had been since shed had a friendjust a friend the dawn light in goa was the color of sand nancy marveled at how childlike beth appeared in her sleep in both her small hands the waif clutched the stone vagina as if this yoni were powerful enough to protect her from every evil on the subcontinenteven from dieter and nancy in mapusa they changed buses because their bus from bombay went on to panjim they spent a long day in calangute while dieter did his business which amounted to repeatedly harassing the patrons of the bus stop for any information related to rahul along baga road they also stopped at the bars the hotels and the stalls for cold drinks in all these places dieter spoke privately with someone while beth and nancy waited everyone claimed to have heard of rahul but no one had ever seen him dieter had arranged for a cottage near the beach there was only one bathroom and the toilet and tub needed to be flushed and filled by hand with buckets from an outdoor well but there were two big beds that looked pretty clean and a standing partition of wooden latticeworkit was almost a wall almost private they had a propane hot plate for boiling water a motionless ceiling fan had been installed in the optimistic faith that one day there would also be electricity and although there were no screens there were mosquito nets in fair repair on both beds outside there was a cistern of fresh if not clean water the water in the well with which they flushed the toilet and in which they bathed was slightly salty by the cistern was a hut of palm leaves if they kept the leaves wet this hut was an adequate cooler for soda and juice and fresh fruit beth was disappointed that they were some distance from the beach although they could hear the arabian sea especially at night they had to tramp across an area of dead and rotting palm fronds before they could walk on the sand or even see the water both these luxuries and inconveniences were wasted on nancy upon arrival she was immediately sick she vomited she was so weak from diarrhea that beth had to fetch the water to flush the toilet for her beth also filled the tub for nancys baths nancy had a fever with chills so violent and sweating so profuse that she stayed in bed all day and night except when beth stripped the sheets and gave them to the dhobi who came for the laundry dieter was disgusted with her he went on about his business of looking for rahul beth fixed her tea and brought her fresh bananas when nancy was stronger beth cooked her some rice because of the fever nancy tossed and turned all night and dieter wouldnt sleep in the same bed with her beth slept in a small corner of the bed beside her dieter slept behind the latticework partition alone nancy told herself that when she was healthy she would go to rajasthan with beth she hoped beth hadnt been revolted by her illness then one evening nancy woke up and felt a little better she thought her fever was gone because she was so clearheaded she thought she was past the vomiting and the diarrhea because she was ravenous dieter and beth were out of the cottage theyd gone to the disco in calangute there was a place called something stupid like coco banana where dieter asked a lot of questions about rahul dieter said it was cooler to go there with a girl than to look like a loser which was apparently what you looked like when you went there alone there was nothing to eat in the cottage but bananas and nancy ate three then she made herself some tea after that she went in and out drawing water for a bath she was surprised how tired she was after shed carried the water and with her fever gone the bath felt chilly after her bath she went outside to the palmhut cooler and drank some bottled sugarcane juice which she hoped wouldnt bring back her diarrhea there was nothing to do but wait for dieter and beth to come back she tried reading the upanishads but it had made more sense to her when she had a fever and beth read it aloud besides she had lit an oil lamp to read and there were suddenly a million mosquitoes also she encountered an exasperating passage in katha upanishad it repeated as a refrain an irritating sentence this in truth is that she thought the phrase would drive her crazy if she read it one more time she blew out the oil lamp and retreated under the mosquito net she brought the entrenching tool into the bed beside her because she was frightened to be alone in the cottage at night there was not only the threat of bandits of dacoit gangs there was a gecko that lived behind the bathroom mirrorit often raced across the bathroom walls and ceiling while nancy took her bath she hadnt seen the gecko tonight she wished she knew where it was when shed been feverish shed wondered at the shadows cast by the strange gargoyles along the top of the latticework partition then one night the gargoyles werent there and another night thered been only one now that her fever was gone she realized the gargoyles were in nearly constant motionthey were rats they favored the vantage point that the partition gave them to look down upon both beds nancy watched them until she fell asleep she was beginning to understand that she was a long way from bombay which was a long way from anywhere else not even young vijay patelpolice inspector colaba stationcould help her here not a dream a beautiful stranger when nancys fever came back the sweating didnt wake her but the chills did she knew she was delirious because it was impossible that a beautiful woman in a sari could be sitting on the bed beside her holding her hand at or the woman was at the very peak of her beauty and her subtle jasmine scent should have told nancy that the beautiful woman was not the result of delirium a woman with such a wonderful smell could never be dreamed when the woman spoke even nancy had reason to doubt that she was any kind of hallucination at all youre the one whos sick arent you the woman asked nancy and theyve left you all alone havent they yes nancy whispered she was shivering so hard her teeth were chattering although she clutched the entrenching tool she doubted she could summon the strength to lift it then as so often happens in dreams there was no transition no logic to the order of events because the beautiful woman unwound her sarishe completely undressed even in the ghostly pallor of the moonlight she was the color of tea her limbs looked as smooth and hard as fine wood like cherry her breasts were only slightly bigger than beths but much more upright and when she slipped past the mosquito net and into bed beside nancy nancy relinquished her grip on the entrenching tool and allowed the beautiful woman to hold her they shouldnt leave you all alone should they the woman asked nancy no nancy whispered her teeth had stopped chattering and her shivers subsided in the beautiful womans strong arms at first they lay facetoface the womans firm breasts against nancys softer bosom their legs entwined then nancy rolled onto her other side and the woman pressed herself against nancys back in this position the womans breasts touched nancys shoulder bladesthe womans breath stirred nancys hair nancy was impressed by the suppleness of the womans long slender waisthow it curved to accommodate nancys broad hips and her round bottom and to nancys surprise the womans hands which gently held nancys heavy breasts were even bigger than nancys hands this is better isnt it the woman asked her yes nancy whispered but her own voice sounded uncharacteristically hoarse and far away an unshakable drowsiness attended the womans embrace or else this was a new stage in nancys fever which signaled the beginning of a sleep deeper than dreams nancy had never slept with a womans breasts pressed against her back she marveled at how soothing it was and she wondered if this was what men felt when they fell asleep this way previously nancy had fallen asleep with that odd sensation of a mans inert and usually small penis brushing against her buttocks it was upon this awareness and on the edge of sleep that nancy was suddenly aware of an unusual situation which was surely in the area of dream or delirium or both because she feltat the same timea womans breasts pressed against her back and a mans sleepy penis curled against her buttocks another fever dream nancy decided wont they be surprised when they get here the beautiful woman asked her but nancys mind had drifted too far away for her to answer nancy is a witness when nancy woke up she lay alone in the moonlight smelling the ganja and listening to dieter and beth they were whispering on the other side of the partition the rats on the latticework were so still that they appeared to be listening tooor else the rats were stoned because dieter and beth were smoking up a storm nancy heard dieter ask beth what is the first sexual experience that you had some confidence in nancy counted to herself in the silence of course she knew what beth was thinking then dieter said masturbation right nancy heard beth whisper yes everyone is different dieter told beth philosophically you just have to learn what your own best way is nancy lay watching the rats while she listened to dieter he was successful in getting beth to relax although beth did possess the decency to ask if only once what about nancy nancy is asleep dieter said nancy wont object i have to be lying on my tummy beth told dieter whose grasp of english vernacular wasnt sound enough for him to understand tummy nancy heard beth roll over there was no sound for a while and then there came a change in beths breathing to which dieter whispered some encouragement there was the sound of messy kissing and beth panting and then beth uttered that special sound which made the rats run along the top of the latticework partition and caused nancy to reach for the entrenching tool with her big hands while beth was still moaning dieter said to her just wait right there i have a surprise for you the surprise for nancy was that the entrenching tool was gone she was sure shed brought it to bed with her she wanted to crack dieter in the shins with it just to drop him to his knees so that she could tell him what she thought of him shed give beth one more chance as she groped under the mosquito net and along the floor beside the bed looking for the entrenching tool nancy still hoped that she and beth could go to rajasthan together that was when her hand found the jasminescented sari that the beautiful woman in the dream had worn nancy pulled the sari into bed with her and breathed it in the scent of it brought the beautiful woman back to her mindthe womans unusually large strong hands the womans unusually upright firm breasts last came the memory of the womans unusual penis which had curled like a snail against nancys buttocks as nancy drifted into sleep dieter nancy tried to whisper but her voice made no sound it was exactly as theyd told dieter in bombay you go to goa not to find rahul but to let rahul find you dieter had been right about one thing there were chicks with dicks rahul wasnt a hijrahe was a zenana after all nancy could hear dieter in the bathroom looking for the dildo in the semidarkness she heard a bottle break against the stone floor dieter must have placed the bottle precariously on the edge of the tub not much moonlight penetrated the bathroom and he probably needed to search for the dildo with both hands briefly dieter cursed he must have cursed in german because nancy didnt catch the word beth called out to dietershed obviously forgotten that nancy was supposed to be sleeping did you break your coke dieter beth called her own question dissolved her into mindless gigglesdieter was addicted to cocacola ssshhh dieter said from the bathroom ssshhh beth repeated she made a failed effort to stifle her laughter the next sound that nancy heard was one shed been fearing but shed been unable to find her voiceto warn dieter that someone else was here she heard what she was sure was the entrenching tool the spade end as it made fullforce contact with what sounded like the base of dieters skull a metallic afterring followed the blow but surprisingly little noise attended dieter falling then there was the second sound of violent contact almost as if a spade or a heavy shovel had been swung against the trunk of a tree nancy realized that beth hadnt heard this because beth was sucking on the ganja pipe as if the fire had died in the bowl and she was trying to revive it nancy lay very still holding the jasminescented sari in her arms the spectral figure with the small upright breasts and the little boys penis passed close to nancys bed without a sound it was no wonder that rahul was called pretty nancy thought beth nancy tried to say but once again her voice had abandoned her from the other side of the partition a sudden light came through the latticework in patches the shadows of the startled rats were cast upon the ceiling nancy could see through the latticing beth had completely opened the mosquito net in order to light an oil lamp she was looking for more ganja for the pipe when the naked teacolored body appeared beside her bed rahuls big hands held the entrenching tool with the handle nestled in the delicate curve of the small of his back the spade end concealed between his shoulder blades hi rahul said to beth hi who are you beth said then beth managed a gasp which caused nancy to stop looking through the space between the latticework nancy lay on her back with the jasminescented sari covering her face she didnt want to look at the ceiling either because she knew that the shadows of the rats would be twitching there hey like what are you she heard beth say are you a boy or a girl im pretty arent i rahul said you sure are different beth replied from the responding sound of the entrenching tool nancy guessed that rahul was displeased to be called different rahuls preferred nickname was pretty nancy pushed the jasminescented sari entirely off the bed and outside the mosquito net she hoped it fell to the floor very close to where rahul had left it then she lay with her eyes open staring at the ceiling where the shadows of the rats scurried back and forth it was almost as if the second and third blows from the entrenching tool were a kind of starting signal for the rats later nancy quietly rolled on her side so that she could peek through the latticing and watch what rahul was doing he appeared to be performing a kind of surgery on beths stomach but nancy soon realized that rahul was drawing a picture on beths belly nancy shut her eyes and wished that her fever would come back even though she wasnt feverish she was so frightened that she began to shiver it was the shivers that saved her when rahul came to her nancys teeth were chattering as uncontrollably as before instantly she felt his lack of sexual interest he was mocking her or merely curious is that bad old fever back again rahul asked her i keep dreaming nancy told him yes of course you do dear rahul said i keep trying to sleep but i keep dreaming nancy said are they bad dreams rahul asked her pretty bad nancy said do you want to tell me about them dear rahul asked her i just want to sleep nancy told him to her surprise he let her he parted the mosquito net and sat on the bed beside her he rubbed her between her shoulder blades until the shivers went away and she could imitate the regular breathing of a deep sleepshe even parted her lips and tried to imagine that she was already dead he kissed her once on the temple and once on the tip of her nose at last she felt rahuls weight leave the bed she also felt the entrenching tool when rahul gently returned it to her hands although she never heard a door open or close she knew rahul was gone when she heard the rats racing recklessly through the cottage they even scampered under the mosquito net and across her bed as if they were secure in their belief that there were three dead people in the cottage instead of two that was when nancy knew it was safe to get up if rahul had still been there the rats would have known in the predawn light nancy saw that rahul had used the dhobi penand indelible dhobi inkto decorate beths belly the laundrymarking pen was a crude wooden handle with a simple broad nib the ink was black rahul had left the ink bottle and the dhobi pen on nancys pillow nancy recalled that shed picked up the ink bottle and the dhobi pen before putting them both back on her bed her fingerprints were also all over the handle of the entrenching tool shed become ill so soon upon her arrival yet it was nancys strong impression that this was a rustic sort of place she doubted shed have much success convincing the local police that a beautiful woman with a little boys penis had murdered dieter and beth and rahul had been smart enough not to empty dieters money belt hed taken the money belt with him there was no evidence of robbery beths jewelry was untouched and there was even some money in dieters wallet their passports werent stolen nancy knew that most of the money was in the dildo which she didnt even try to open because dieter had bled on it and it was sticky to touch she wiped it with a wet towel then she packed it in the rucksack with her things she thought inspector patel would believe her provided she could get back to bombay without the local police finding her first on the surface nancy thought it would be judged a crime of passionone of those triangular relationships that had turned a little twisted and the drawing on beths belly gave the murders a hint of diabolism or at least a flair for sarcasm the elephant was surprisingly small and unadorneda frontal view the head was wider than it was long the eyes were unmatched and one was squintingactually one eye seemed puckered nancy thought the trunk hung slack pointing straight down from the end of the trunk the artist had drawn several broad lines in the shape of a fana childish indication that water sprayed from the elephants trunk as from a showerhead or from the nozzle of a hose these lines extended into beths pubic hair the entire drawing was the size of a small hand then nancy realized why the drawing was slightly off center and why one eye seemed puckered one of the eyes was beths navel outlined in dhobi ink the other eye was an imperfect imitation of the navel because the navel had real depth the eyes werent the same one eye appeared to be winking beths navel was the winking eye what further contributed to the elephants mirthful or mocking expression was that one of its tusks drooped in the normal position the opposing tusk was raised almost as if an elephant could lift a tusk in the manner that a human being can cock an eyebrow this was a small ironical elephantan elephant with an inappropriate sense of humor to be sure the getaway nancy dressed beths body in the tank top that beth had been wearing when nancy first met her at least it covered the drawing she left beths sacred yoni in place at her throat as if it might prove itself to be a more successful talisman in the next world than it had demonstrated itself to be in this the sun rose inland and a tan light filtered through the areca and coconut palms leaving most of the beach in shade which was a blessing for nancy who labored for over an hour with the entrenching tool yet she managed to dig no better than a shallow pit near the tidemark for high tide the pit was already half full of water when she dragged dieters body along the beach and rolled him into the hole by the time shed arranged beths body next to his nancy was aware of the blue crabs that shed uncovered with her digging they were scurrying to bury themselves again shed chosen an especially soft stretch of sand the part of the beach that was nearest the cottage now nancy realized why the sand was soft a tidal inlet cut through the beach and drained into the matted jungle shed dug too close to this inlet nancy knew the bodies wouldnt stay buried for long worse in her haste to clean up the broken glass in the bathroom shed stepped on the jagged heel of the cocacola bottle several pieces of glass had broken off in her foot she was wrong to think shed picked all the pieces out but she was in a hurry shed bled so heavily on the bathroom mat she was forced to roll it up and put it with the broken glass in the grave she buried it together with the rest of dieters and beths things including beths silver bangles which were much too small for nancy and beths beloved copy of the upanishads which nancy had no interest in reading herself it had surprised nancy that digging the grave was harder work than dragging dieters body to the beach dieter was tall but he weighed less than shed ever imagined it crossed her mind that she could have left him anytime shed wanted to she could have picked him up and thrown him against a wall she felt incredibly strong but as soon as shed filled the grave she was exhausted a moment of panic nearly overcame nancy when she discovered that she couldnt find the top half of the silver ballpoint pen that dieter had given herthe pen with made in india written lengthwise on it in script the bottom part said made in the missing part said india nancy had already discovered the flaw in the pens design the pen wouldnt snap securely together if the script wasnt perfectly aligned the top and the bottom were always getting separated nancy looked through the cottage for the missing top she thought it unlikely that rahul had taken itit wasnt the part of the pen that you could write with nancy had the part that wrote and so she kept it because it was small it would make its way to the bottom of her rucksack at least it was real silver nancy knew her fever had finally gone because she was smart enough to take dieters and beths passports she also reminded herself that their bodies would be found soon whoever rented the cottage to dieter had known there were three of them she suspected that the police would assume shed leave by bus from calangute or by ferry from panjim nancys plan was remarkably clearheaded she would place dieters and beths passports in a conspicuous place at the bus stand in calangute but she would take the ferry from panjim to bombay that way with any luckand while she was on the ferrythe police would be looking for her in bus stations but nancy would be the beneficiary of better luck than this when the bodies were discovered the landlord who rented the cottage to dieter admitted that hed seen beth and nancy only at a distance since dieter was german the landlord assumed the other two were germans also he mistook nancy for a man after all she was so bigespecially beside beth the landlord would tell the police that they were looking for a german hippie male when the passports were found in calangute the police realized that beth had been an american yet they persisted in their belief that the murderer was a german man traveling by bus the grave wouldnt be discovered right away the tide eroded the sand near the inlet only a little bit at a time it would be unclear whether the carrion birds or the pyedogs were the first to catch wind of something by then nancy was gone she waited only for the sun to top the palm trees and flood the beach in white light it took just a few minutes for the sun to dry the wet sand of the grave with a palm frond nancy wiped smooth the stretch of beach leading to the jungle and the cottage then she limped on her way it was still early morning when she left anjuna she deemed shed discovered an isolated pocket of eccentrics when she saw the nude sunbathers and swimmers who were almost a tradition in the area shed been sickshe didnt know the first day her foot wasnt too bad but she had to walk all over calangute after she placed the passports there was no doctor staying at meenas or varmas someone told her that an englishspeaking doctor was staying at the concha hotel when she got there the doctor had checked out at the concha they told her there was an englishspeaking doctor in baga at the hotel bardez the next day when she went there they turned her away by then her foot was infected as she emerged from her endless baths in dr daruwallas tub nancy couldnt remember if the murders were two or three days old she did however remember a glaring error in her judgment shed already told dr daruwalla that she was taking the ferry to bombay that was decidedly unwise when the doctor and his wife helped her onto the table on the balcony they mistook her silence for anxiety regarding the small surgery but nancy was thinking of how to rectify her mistake she hardly flinched at the anesthetic and while dr daruwalla probed for the broken glass nancy calmly said you know ive changed my mind about bombay im going south instead ill take the bus from calangute to panjim then ill take the bus to margao i want to go to mysore where they make the incenseyou know then i want to go to kerala what do you think of that she asked the doctor she wanted him to remember her false itinerary i think you must be a very ambitious traveler said dr daruwalla he extracted a surprisingly big halfmoonshaped piece of glass from her foot it was probably a piece from the thick heel of a coke bottle the doctor told her he disinfected the smaller cuts once they were free of glass fragments he packed the larger wound with iodophor gauze dr daruwalla also gave nancy an antibiotic that hed brought with him to goa for his children shed have to see a doctor in a few dayssooner if there was any redness around the wound or if she had a fever nancy wasnt listening she was worrying how she would pay him she didnt think it would be proper to ask the doctor to unscrew the dildo she also didnt think he looked strong enough farrokh in his own way was also distracted by his thoughts about the dildo i cant pay you very much nancy told the doctor i dont want you to pay me at all dr daruwalla said he gave her his card it was just his habit nancy read the card and said but i told youim not going to bombay i know but if you feel feverish or the infection worsens you should call mefrom wherever you are or if you see a doctor who cant understand you have the doctor call me farrokh said thank you nancy told him and dont walk on it any more than you have to the doctor told her ill be on the bus nancy insisted as she was limping to the stairs the doctor introduced her to john d she was in no mood to meet such a handsome young man and although he was very polite to herhe even offered to help her down the stairsnancy felt extremely vulnerable to his kind of european superiority he showed not the slightest spark of sexual interest in her and this hurt her more than her foot did but she said goodbye to dr daruwalla and allowed john d to carry her downstairs she knew she was heavy but he looked strong the desire to shock him grew overwhelming besides she knew he was strong enough to unscrew the dildo if its not too much trouble she said to him in the lobby of the hotel you could do me a big favor she showed him the dildo without removing it from her rucksack the tip unscrews she told him watching his eyes but im just not strong enough she continued to regard his face while he gripped the big cock in both hands she would remember him because of how poised he was as soon as he loosened the tip she stopped him thats enough she told him she didnt want him to see the money it disappointed her that he seemed unshockable but she kept trying she resolved she would look into his eyes until he had to look away im going to spare you she said softly you dont want to know whats inside the thing she would remember him for his instinctive sneer for john d was an actor long before he was inspector dhar she would remember that sneer the same sneer with which inspector dhar would later incense all of bombay it was nancy who had to look away from him she would remember that too she avoided the bus stand in calangute she would try to hitchhike to panjim even if it meant she had to walkor defend herself with the entrenching tool she hoped she still had a day or two before the bodies were found but before she located the road to panjim she remembered the big piece of glass the doctor had removed from her foot after showing it to her hed put it in an ashtray on a small table near the hammock probably he would throw it away she thought but what if he heard about the broken glass in the hippie graveit would soon be called the hippie graveand what if he wondered if the piece of glass from her foot would match it was late at night when nancy returned to the hotel bardez the door to the lobby was locked and the boy who slept on a rush mat in the lobby all night was still engaged in talking to the dog that spent every night with him that was why the dog never heard nancy when she climbed the vine to the daruwallas secondfloor balcony her procaine injection had worn off and her foot throbbed but nancy could have screamed in pain and knocked over the furniture and still she would never have awakened dr daruwalla the doctors lunch has been described it would be superfluous to provide similar detail regarding the doctors dinner suffice it to say that he substituted the vindaloostyle pork for the fish and he further indulged in a pork stew called sorpotel which features pigs liver and is abundantly flavored with vinegar yet it was the dried duckling with tamarind that dominated the aroma of his heavy breathing and his snores were scented with sharp blasts of a raw red wine which he would deeply regret in the morning he should have stuck to beer julia was grateful that dr daruwalla had elected to sleep in the hammock on the balcony where only the arabian seaand the lizards and insects that in the night were legionwould be disturbed by the doctors windy noises julia also desired a rest from the passions inspired by mr james salters artistry for the moment her private speculations concerning the departed hippies dildo had cooled julias sexual ardor as for the insect and lizard life that clung to the mosquito net enclosing the cherubic doctor in his hammock the gecko and mosquito world appeared to be charmed by both the doctors music and his vapors the doctor had bathed just before retiring and his plump palebrown body was everywhere dusted with cuticura powderfrom his neck to between his toes his closely shaven throat and cheeks were refreshed with a powerful astringent redolent of lemons hed even shaved his mustache off leaving only a little clump of a beard on his chin he was almost as smoothfaced as a baby dr daruwalla was so clean and he smelled so wonderful that nancy had the impression that only the mosquito net prevented the geckos and mosquitoes from devouring him at a level of sleep so deep it seemed to farrokh that he had died and lay buried somewhere in china the doctor dreamed that his most ardent admirers were digging up his bodyto prove a point the doctor wished they would leave him undisturbed for he felt he was at peace in truth hed passed out in the hammock in a stupor of overeatingnot to mention the effect of the wine to dream that he was prey to gravediggers was surely an indication of his overindulgence so what if my body is a miracle he was dreamingplease just leave it alone meanwhile nancy found what she was looking for in the ashtray where it had left only a spot of dried blood lay the halfmoonshaped piece of glass as she took it she heard dr daruwalla cry out leave me in china the doctor thrashed his legs and nancy saw that one of his beautiful eggshellbrown feet had escaped the mosquito net and was protruding from the hammockexposed to the terrors of the night this disturbance sent the geckos darting in all directions and caused the mosquitoes to swarm well nancy thought the doctor had done her a favor hadnt he she stood stockstill until she was sure dr daruwalla was sound asleep she didnt want to wake him up but it was hard for her to leave him when his gorgeous foot was prey to the elements nancy contemplated how she might safely return farrokhs foot to the mosquito net but her newfound good sense persuaded her not to risk it she descended the vine from the balcony to the patio this required the use of both her hands and so she delicately held the piece of broken glass in her teethcareful that it not cut her tongue or her lips she was limping along the dark road to calangute when she threw the glass away it was lost in a dense grove of palms where it disappeared without a soundas unseen by any living eye as nancys lost innocence the wrong toe nancy had been fortunate to leave the hotel bardez when she had she never knew that rahul was a guest there nor did rahul know that nancy had been dr daruwallas patient this was extremely lucky because rahul also climbed the vine to the daruwallas secondfloor balconyon the very same night nancy had come and gone but when rahul arrived on the balcony dr daruwallas poor foot was still vulnerable to the nighttime predators rahul himself had come as a predator hed learned from dr daruwallas innocent daughters that john d usually slept in the hammock on the balcony rahul had come to the balcony to seduce john d the sexually curious may find it interesting to speculate whether or not rahul would have met with success in his attempted seduction of the beautiful young man but john d was spared this test because dr daruwalla was sleeping in the hammock on this busy night in the darknessnot to mention that he was blinded by his overeagernessrahul was confused the body asleep under the mosquito net was certainly of a desirable fragrance maybe it was the moonlight that played tricks with skin color possibly it was only the moonlight which gave rahul the impression that john d had grown a little clump of a beard as for the toes of the doctors exposed foot they were tiny and hairless and the foot itself was as small as a young girls rahul found that the ball of the foot was endearingly fleshy and soft and he thought that the sole of dr daruwallas foot was almost indecently pinkin contrast to the doctors sleek brown ankle rahul knelt by the doctors small foot he stroked it with his large hand he brushed his cheek against the doctors freshly scented toes naturally it would have startled him if dr daruwalla had cried out but i dont want to be a miracle the doctor was dreaming that he was francis xavier dug up from his grave and taken against his will to the basilica de bom jesus in goa more accurately he was dreaming that he was francis xaviers miraculously preserved body and things were about to be done to his bodyalso against his will but despite the terror of what was happening to him in his dream farrokh couldnt give utterance to his fears he was so heavily sedated with food and wine that he was forced to suffer in silenceeven though he anticipated that a crazed pilgrim was about to eat his toe after all he knew the story rahul ran his tongue along the sole of the doctors fragrant foot which tasted strongly of cuticura powder and vaguely of garlic because dr daruwallas foot was the single part of him that was unprotected by the mosquito net rahul could manifest his powerful attraction to the delicious john d only by enclosing what he presumed to be the big toe of john ds right foot in his warm mouth rahul then sucked on this toe with such force that dr daruwalla moaned rahul at first fought against the desire to bite him but he gave in to this urge and slowly sank his teeth into the squirming toe then he once more resisted the compelling impulse to bitethen he weakened and bit down harder it was torture for rahul to stop himself from going too farfrom swallowing dr daruwalla either whole or in pieces when he at last released the doctors foot both rahul and dr daruwalla were gasping in his dream the doctor was certain that the obsessed woman had already done her damage shed bitten off the sacred relic of his toe and now there was tragically less of his miraculous body than they had buried as rahul undressed himself dr daruwalla withdrew his maimed foot from the dangerous world he curled himself tightly into his hammock under the mosquito net for in his dream he was fearing that the emissaries from the vatican were approachingto take his arm to rome as farrokh struggled to give voice to his terror of amputation rahul attempted to penetrate the mysteries of the mosquito net rahul thought it would be best if john d awoke to find his face firmly between rahuls breasts for these latter creations were surely to be counted among rahuls best features but then since rahul thought that the young man appeared to have been aroused by the oddity of having his big toe sucked and bitten perhaps a bolder approach would succeed it was frustrating to rahul that he could proceed with no approach until he solved the puzzle of entrance to the mosquito net which was vexing and it was at this complicated juncture in rahuls attempted seduction that farrokh finally found the voice to express his fears rahul who recognized the doctors voice distinctly heard dr daruwalla shout i dont want to be a saint i need that armits a very good arm at this the boys dog in the lobby barked briefly the boy once more began to talk to the animal rahul hated dr daruwalla as fervently as he desired john d therefore rahul was appalled that hed caressed the doctors foot and he was nauseated that hed sucked and bitten the doctors big toe as he hurriedly dressed himself rahul was also embarrassed the taste of cuticura powder was bitter on his tongue as he climbed down the vine to the patio where the dog in the lobby heard him spit the dog barked again and this time the boy unlocked the door to the lobby and peered anxiously at the misty beach the boy heard dr daruwalla cry out from the balcony cannibals catholic maniacs even to an inexperienced hindu boy this seemed a fearful combination then the dogs barking exploded at the door to the lobby where both the boy and the dog were surprised by the sudden appearance of rahul dont lock me out rahul said the boy let him in and gave him his room key rahul wore a loosefitting skirt of a kind thats easy to put on and take off and a brightyellow halter top of a kind that drew the boys awkward attention to rahuls wellshaped breasts there was a time when rahul would have grabbed the boys face in both hands and pulled him into his bosom then he might have played with the boys little prick or else he might have kissed him in which case rahul would have stuck his tongue so far down the boys throat that the boy would have gagged but not now rahul wasnt in the mood he went upstairs to his room he brushed his teeth until the taste of dr daruwallas cuticura powder was gone then he undressed and lay down on his bed where he could look at himself in the mirror he wasnt in the mood to masturbate he made some drawings but nothing worked rahul was furious at dr daruwalla for being in john ds hammock it made him so angry that he couldnt even arouse himself in the adjacent room aunt promila was snoring down in the lobby the boy tried to calm the dog down he thought it was peculiar that the dog was so agitated usually women had no effect on the dog it was only men who made the dogs fur stand up or made the dog walk around stiffleggedsniffing everywhere the men had been it puzzled the boy that the dog had reacted in this fashion to rahul the boy also needed to calm himself down hed reacted to rahuls breasts in his own fashion he was so aroused that he had a sizable erectionfor a boy and he knew perfectly well that the lobby of the hotel bardez was no place for him to indulge his fantasies there was nothing the boy could do he lay down on the rush mat where he at last coaxed the dog to join him and there he went on speaking to the dog as before farrokh is converted at dawn on the road to panjim nancy had the good fortune to arouse the sympathy of a motorcyclist who noticed her limp it wasnt much of a motorcycle but it would do it was a cc yezdi with red plastic tassels hanging from the handlebars a black dot painted on the headlight and a sariguard mounted on the leftside rear wheel nancy was wearing jeans and she simply straddled the seat behind the skinny teenaged driver she locked her hands around the boys waist without a word she knew he couldnt drive fast enough to scare her the yezdi was equipped with crash bars that protruded from the motorcycle in a manner of a full fairing in dr daruwallas profession these socalled crash bars were known as tibialfracture bars they were renowned for breaking the tibias of motorcyclistsall for the sake of not denting the gas tank nancys weight was at first disconcerting to the young driver she had a dangerously wide effect on his corneringhe held his speed down cant this thing go any faster she asked him he halfunderstood her or else her voice in his ear was thrilling possibly it hadnt been her limp hed noticed but the tightness of her jeans or her blond hairor even the swaying of her breasts which the teenager felt pressing against his back thats better nancy told him after he dared to speed up streaming from the handlebars the red plastic tassels were whipped by the rushing wind they appeared to beckon nancy toward the steamer jetty and her chosen destiny in bombay shed embraced evil shed found it lacking she was the sinner in search of the impossible salvation she thought that only the uncorrupted and incorruptible policeman could restore her essential goodness she had spotted something conflicted about inspector patel she believed that he was virtuous and honorable but also that she could seduce him her logic was such that she thought of his virtue and his honor as transferable to her nancys illusion was not uncommonnor is it an illusion limited to women it is an old belief that several sexually wrong decisions can be remediedeven utterly erasedby one decision that is sexually right no one should blame nancy for trying as nancy rode the yezdi to the ferry and to her fate a dull but persistent pain in the big toe of his right foot awakened dr daruwalla from a night of bedlam dreams and indigestion he freed himself from the mosquito net and swung his legs from the hammock but when he put only the slightest weight on his right foot his big toe stabbed him with a sharp pain for a second he imagined he was still dreaming he was st franciss body in the early light which was a muted brownnot unlike the color of dr daruwallas skinthe doctor inspected his toe the skin was unbroken but deep bruises of a crimson and purple hue clearly indicated the bite marks dr daruwalla screamed julia ive been bitten by a ghost the doctor cried his wife came running what is it liebchen she asked him look at my big toe the doctor demanded have you been biting yourself julia asked him with unconcealed distaste its a miracle shouted dr daruwalla it was the ghost of that crazy woman who bit st francis farrokh shouted dont be a blasphemer julia cautioned him i am being a believernot a blasphemer the doctor cried he ventured a step on his right foot but the pain in his big toe was so wilting that he fell screaming to his knees hush or youll wake up the childrenyoull wake up everybody julia scolded him praise the lord farrokh whispered crawling back to his hammock i believe godplease dont torture me further he collapsed into the hammock hugging both his arms around his chest what if they come for my arm he asked his wife julia was disgusted with him i think it must be something you ate she said or else youve been dreaming about the dildo i suppose youve been dreaming about it farrokh said sullenly here ive suffered some sort of conversion and youre thinking about a big cock im thinking about how youre behaving in a peculiar fashion julia told him but ive had some sort of religious experience farrokh insisted i dont see whats religious about it julia said look at my toe the doctor cried maybe you bit it in your sleep his wife suggested julia dr daruwalla said i thought you were already a christian well i dont go around yelling and moaning about it julia said john d appeared on the balcony never realizing that dr daruwallas religious experience was very nearly his own experienceof another kind whats going on the young man asked its apparently unsafe to sleep on the balcony julia told him something bit farrokhsome kind of animal those are human teeth marks the doctor declared john d examined the bitten toe with his usual detachment maybe it was a monkey he said dr daruwalla curled himself into a ball in the hammock deciding to give his wife and his favorite young man the silent treatment julia and john d took their breakfast with the daruwalla daughters on the patio below the balcony at times they would raise their eyes and look up the vine in the direction where they presumed farrokh lay sulking they were wrong he wasnt sulkinghe was praying since the doctor was inexperienced at prayer his praying resembled an interior monologue of a fairly standard confessional kindespecially that kind which is brought on by a bad hangover o god prayed dr daruwalla it isnt necessary to take my armthe toe convinced me i dont need any more convincing you got me the first time god the doctor paused please leave the arm alone he added later from the lobby of the hotel bardez the syphilitic teaserver thought he heard voices from the daruwallas secondfloor balcony since ali ahmed was known to be almost entirely deaf it was assumed that he probably always heard voices but ali ahmed had actually heard dr daruwalla praying for by midmorning the doctor was murmuring aloud and the pitch of his prayers was precisely in a register that the syphilitic teaserver could hear i am heartily sorry if i have offended thee god dr daruwalla murmured intensely heartily sorryvery sorry really i never meant to mock anybodyi was only kidding he confessed st francisyou tooplease forgive me an unusual number of dogs were barking as if the pitch of the doctors prayers were precisely in a register that the dogs could hear too i am a surgeon god the doctor moaned i need my armboth my arms thus did dr daruwalla refuse to leave the hammock of his miraculous conversion while julia and john d spent the morning plotting how to prevent the doctor from spending another night on the balcony later in the day as his hangover abated farrokh regained a little of his selfconfidence he said to julia that he thought it would be enough for him to become a christian he meant that perhaps it wasnt necessary for him to become a catholic did julia think that becoming a protestant would be good enough maybe an anglican would do by now julia was quite frightened by the depth and color of the bite marks on her husbands toe even though the skin was unbroken she was afraid of rabies julia farrokh complained here i am worrying about my mortal soul and youre worried about rabies lots of monkeys have rabies john d offered what monkeys dr daruwalla shouted i dont see any monkeys here have you seen any monkeys while they were arguing they failed to notice promila rai and her nephewwithbreasts checking out of the hotel they were going back to bombay but not tonight nancy was again fortunaterahul wouldnt be on her ferry promila knew that rahuls holiday had been disappointing to him and so shed accepted an invitation for them both to spend the night at someones villa in old goa there would be a costume party which rahul might find amusing it hadnt been an entirely disappointing holiday for rahul his aunt was generous with her money but she expected him to make his own contribution toward a muchdiscussed trip to london promila would help rahul financially but she wanted him to come up with some money of his own there were several thousand deutsche marks in dieters money belt but rahul had been expecting moregiven the quality and the amount of hashish that dieter had told everyone he wanted to buy of course there was more much morein the dildo promila thought that her nephew was interested in art school in london she also knew he was seeking a complete sex change and she knew such operations were expensive given her loathing for men promila was delighted with her nephews choiceto become her niecebut she was deluding herself if she thought that the strongest motivating factor behind rahuls proposed move to london was art school if the maid who cleaned rahuls room had looked more carefully at the discarded drawings in the wastebasket she could have told promila that rahuls talent with a pen was of a pornographic persuasion that most art schools would discourage the selfportraits would have especially disturbed the maid but all the discarded drawings were nothing but balledup pieces of paper to her she didnt trouble herself to examine them they were en route to the villa in old goa when promila peered into rahuls purse and saw rahuls new curious money clip at least he was using it as a money clipit was really nothing but the top half of a silver pen my dear you are eccentric promila said why dont you get a real money clip if you like those things well auntie rahul patiently explained i find that real money clips are too loose unless you carry a great wad of money in them what i like is to carry just a few small notes outside my walletsomething handy to pay for a taxi or for tipping he demonstrated that the top half of the silver pen possessed a very strong tight clipwhere it was meant to attach itself to a jacket pocket or a shirt pocketand that this clip was perfect for holding just a few rupees besides its real silver rahul added promila held it in her veinous hand why so it is dear she remarked she read aloud the one word in script that was engraved on the top half of the pen indiaisnt that quaint i certainly thought so rahul remarked returning the eccentric item to his purse meanwhile as dr daruwalla grew hungrier he also grew more relaxed about his praying he cautiously rekindled his sense of humor after hed eaten farrokh could almost joke about his conversion i wonder what next the almighty will ask of me he said to julia who once more cautioned her husband about blasphemy what was next in store for dr daruwalla would test his newfound faith in ways the doctor would find most disturbing by the same means that nancy had discovered the doctors whereabouts the police also discovered him theyd found what everyone now called the hippie grave and they needed a doctor to hazard a guess concerning the cause of death of the graves ghastly occupants theyd gone looking for a doctor on holiday a local doctor would talk too much about the crime at least this was what the local police told dr daruwalla but i dont do autopsies dr daruwalla protested yet he went to anjuna to view the remains it was generally supposed that the blue crabs were the reason the bodies were spoiled for viewing and if the salt water proved itself to be a modest preservative it did little to veil the stench farrokh easily concluded that several blows to the head had done them both in but the females body was messier her forearms and the backs of her hands were battered which suggested that shed tried to defend herself the male clearly had never known what hit him it was the elephant drawing that farrokh would remember the murdered girls navel had been transformed to a winking eye the opposing tusk had been flippantly raised like the tipping of an imaginary hat short childish lines indicated that the elephants trunk was sprayingthe water fanning over the dead girls pubic hair such intended mockery would remain with dr daruwalla for years the doctor would remember the little drawing too well when farrokh saw the broken glass he suffered only the slightest discomfort and the feeling quickly passed back at the hotel bardez he was unable to find the piece of glass hed removed from the young womans foot and so what if the glass from the grave had matched he thought there were soda bottles everywhere besides the police had already told him that the suspected murderer was a german male farrokh thought that this theory suited the prejudices of the local policenamely that only a hippie from europe or north america could possibly perform a double slaying and then trivialize the murders with a cartoonish drawing ironically these killings and that drawing stimulated dr daruwallas need to be more creative he found himself fantasizing that he was a detective the doctors success in the orthopedic field had given him certain commercial expectations these considerations doubtless returned the doctors imagination to that notion of himself as a screenwriter no one movie could have satisfied farrokhs suddenly insatiable creativity nothing less than a series of movies featuring the same detective would do finally that was how it happened at the end of his holiday on the ferry back to bombay dr daruwalla invented inspector dhar farrokh was watching how the young women on board the ferry couldnt take their eyes off the beautiful john d suddenly the doctor could envision the hero that these young women imagined when they looked at a young man like that the excitement that mr james salters example had inspired was already becoming a moment of the sexual past it was becoming a part of the second honeymoon that dr daruwalla was leaving behind to the doctor murder and corruption spoke louder than art and besides what a career john d might have it would never have occurred to farrokh that the young woman with the big dildo had seen the same murder victims he had seen but years later even the movie version of that drawing on beths belly would ring a bell with nancy how could it be a coincidence that the victims navel was the elephants winking eye or that the opposing tusk was raised in the movie no pubic hair was shown but those childish lines indicated to nancy that the elephants trunk was still sprayinglike a showerhead or like the nozzle of a hose nancy would also remember the beautiful unshockable young man shed been introduced to by dr daruwalla when she saw her first inspector dhar movie nancy would recall the first time shed seen that knowing sneer the future actor had been strong enough to carry her downstairs without apparent effort the future movie star had been poised enough to unscrew the troublesome dildo without appearing to be appalled and all of this was what she meant when she left her uncompromising message on dr daruwallas answering machine i know who you really are i know what you really do nancy had informed the doctor tell the deputy commissionerthe real policeman tell him who you are tell him what you do nancy had instructed the secret screenwriter for shed figured out who inspector dhars creator was nancy knew that no one could have imagined the movie version of that drawing on beths belly inspector dhars creator had to have seen what she had seen and the handsome john d who now passed himself off as inspector dharthat young man would never have been invited to view the murder victims that would have been the doctors job therefore nancy knew that dhar hadnt created himself inspector dhar had also been the doctors job dr daruwalla was confused he remembered introducing nancy to john d and how gallantly john d had carried the heavy young woman downstairs had nancy seen an inspector dhar movie or all of them had she recognized the more mature john d fine but how had she made the imaginative leap that the doctor was dhars creator and how could she know the real policeman as she called him dr daruwalla could only assume that she meant deputy commissioner patel of course the doctor didnt realize that nancy had known detective patel for yearsnot to mention that she was married to him the doctor and his patient are reunited one might recall that dr daruwalla had all this time been sitting in his bedroom in bombay where the doctor was alone again julia had at last left him sitting there shed gone to apologize to john dand to be sure that their supper was still warm enough to eat dr daruwalla knew it was an unprecedented rudeness to have kept his favorite young man waiting but in the light of nancys phone message the doctor felt compelled to speak to dcp patel the subject that the deputy commissioner wished to discuss in private with dr daruwalla was only a part of what prompted the doctor to make the call of more interest to farrokh was where nancy was now and why she knew the real policeman given the hour dr daruwalla phoned detective patel at home farrokh was thinking that there were patels all over gujarat there were many patels in africa too he knew both a hotelchain patel and a departmentstore patel in nairobi he was thinking he knew only one patel who was a policeman whenas luck would have itnancy answered the phone all she said was hello but the one word was sufficient for farrokh to recognize her voice dr daruwalla was too confused to speak but his silence was all the identification that nancy needed is that the doctor she asked in her familiar fashion dr daruwalla supposed it would be stupid of him to hang up but for a moment he couldnt imagine what else to do he knew from the surprising experience of his long and happy marriage to julia that there was no understanding what drew or held people together if the doctor had known that the relationship between nancy and detective patel was deeply connected to the dildo he would have admitted that his understanding of sexual attraction and compatibility was even less than he supposed the doctor suspected some elements of interracial interest on the part of both partiesfarrokh and julia had surely felt this and in the curious case of nancy and deputy commissioner patel dr daruwalla also guessed that nancys badgirl appearance possibly concealed a goodgirl heart the doctor could easily imagine that nancy had wanted a cop as for what had attracted the deputy commissioner to nancy farrokh tended to overestimate the value of a light complexion after all he adored the fairness of julias skin and julia wasnt even a blonde what the doctors research for the inspector dhar movies had failed to uncover was a characteristic common to many policemena love of confession poor vijay patel was prone to enjoy the confessing of crimes and nancy had held nothing back shed begun by handing him the dildo you were right shed told him it unscrews only it was sealed with wax i didnt know it came apart i didnt know what was in it but look what i brought into the country she said as inspector patel counted the deutsche marks nancy kept talking there was more she said but dieter spent some and some of it was stolen after a short pause she added there were two murders but just one drawing then she told him absolutely everything beginning with the football players people have fallen in love for stranger reasons meanwhile still waiting for the doctors answer on the telephone nancy grew impatient hello she said is anyone there is that the doctor she repeated a born procrastinator dr daruwalla nevertheless knew that nancy wouldnt be denied still he didnt like to be bullied countless stupid remarks came to the closet screenwriters mind they were smartass toughguy wisecracksthe usual voiceover from old inspector dhar movies bad things had happenedworse things were happening the woman was worth itafter all she might know something it was time to put all the cards on the table after a career of such glibness it was hard for dr daruwalla to know what to say to nancy after years it was difficult to sound casual but the doctor lamely tried soits you he said on her end of the phone nancy just waited it was as if she expected nothing less than a full confession farrokh felt he was being treated unfairly why should nancy want to make him feel guilty he should have known that nancys sense of humor wasnt easy to locate but dr daruwalla foolishly kept trying to find it sohows the foot he asked her all better twenty years a complete woman but one who hates women the hollowness of the doctors dumb joke contributed to an empty sound that the receiver made against his ear for nancy wasnt talking her silence echoed as if the phone call were transnational then dr daruwalla heard nancy say to someone else its him her voice was indistinct although her effort to cover the mouthpiece with her hand had been halfhearted farrokh couldnt have known how years had stolen the enthusiasm from many of nancys efforts and yet years ago shed reintroduced herself to young inspector patel with admirable resolve not only presenting the policeman with the dildo and the sordid particulars of dieters crimes but strengthening her confession with her intention to change nancy said she sought a life of righting wrongs and she declared the extent of her attraction to young patel in such graphic terms that she gave the proper policeman pause also as nancy had anticipated she managed to give the inspector pangs of the severest desire which he wouldnt act upon for he was both a highly professional detective and a gentlemanneither an oafish football player nor a jaded european if the physical attraction that drew nancy and inspector patel together was ever to be acted upon nancy knew that she would need to initiate the contact although she trusted that in the end she would marry the idealistic detective certain conditions beyond her control contributed to nancys delay of the matter for example there was the distress caused by the disappearance of rahul as a most recent and eager convert to the pursuit of justice nancy was deeply disappointed that rahul could not be found the allegedly murderous zenana whod only briefly achieved a legendary status in the brothel area of bombay had vanished from falkland road and grant road and kamathipura also inspector patel discovered that the transvestite known as pretty had always been an outsider the hijras hated himthe few who knew himand his fellow zenanas hated him too rahul had sold his services for an uncommonly high price but what he sold was merely his appearance his good looks which were the result of his outstanding femininity in juxtaposition to his dominating physical size and strength made him an attractive showpiece for any transvestite brothel once a customer was lured into the brothel by rahuls presence the other zenanasor the hijraswere the only transvestites who made themselves available for sexual contact hence there was to his nickname pretty both an honest appraisal of his powers to attract and a disparagement of his character for by his refusal to do more than display himself rahul brandished a highmindedness that insulted the transvestite prostitutes they could see he was indifferent to the offense he caused he was also too big and strong and confident for them to threaten the hijras hated him because he was a zenana his fellow zenanas hated him because hed told them he intended to make himself complete but all the transvestite prostitutes hated rahul because he wasnt a prostitute there prevailed some nasty rumors about rahul although any evidence of these allegations eluded inspector patel some transvestite prostitutes claimed that rahul frequented a female brothel in kamathipura it further outraged the transvestites to imagine that when rahul chose to advertise himself in their brothels on falkland road and grant road he was in reality merely slumming also there were ugly stories concerning how rahul made use of the female prostitutes in kamathipura it was claimed that he never had sex with the girls but that he beat them there was mention of a flexible rubber billy stick if these rumors were true the beaten girls would have nothing but raised red welts to show for their pain such marks faded quickly and were thought to be insubstantial in comparison to broken bones or the deeper darker discolorations of those bruises inflicted by a harder weapon there was no legal recourse for the girls who might have suffered such beatings whoever rahul was he was smart shortly after murdering dieter and beth he was also out of the country inspector patel suspected that rahul had left india this was no consolation to nancy having chosen goodness over evil she anticipated resolution it was a pity that nancy would wait years for a simple but informative conversation with dr daruwalla which would reveal to them both that theyd made acquaintance with the same rahul however not even a detective as dogged as dcp patel could have been expected to guess that a sexually altered killer might have been found at the duckworth club moreover for years rahul would not have been found thereat least not very often he was more frequently in london where after the lengthy and painful completion of his sexchange operation he was able to give more of his energy and concentration to what he called his art alas no excess of energy or concentration would much expand his talent or his range the cartoon quality of his belly drawings persisted his tendency toward sexually explicit caricature endured it was thematic with rahulan inappropriately mirthful elephant with one tusk raised one eye winking and water spraying from the end of its downwardpointing trunk the size and shape of the victims navels afforded the artist a considerable variety of winking eyes the amount and color of the victims pubic hair also varied the water from the elephants trunk was constant the elephant sprayed with seeming indifference over all many of the murdered prostitutes had shaved their pubic hair the elephant appeared not to notice or not to care but it wasnt only that his imagination was sexually perverse for within rahul a veritable war was being waged over the true identity of his sexual self which to his astonishment was not appreciably clarified by the successful completion of his longawaited sex change now rahul was to all appearances a woman if he couldnt bear children it had never been the desire to bear children that had compelled him to become a her however it was rahuls illusion that a new sexual identity could provide a lasting peace of mind rahul had loathed being a man in the company of homosexuals hed never felt he was one of them either but hed experienced little closeness with his fellow transvestites in the company of hijras or zenanas rahul had felt both different and superior it didnt occur to him that they were content to be what they wererahul had never been content theres more than one way to be a third gender but rahuls uniqueness was inseparable from his viciousness which extended even toward his fellow transvestites he detested the alltoowomanly gestures of most hijras and zenanas he thought the mischief with which they dressed indicated an alltoowomanly frivolity as for the traditional powers of the hijras to bless or to curse rahul had no belief that they possessed such powers he believed they tended to parade themselves either for the smug amusement of boring heterosexuals or for the titillation of more conventional homosexuals in the homosexual community at least there were those fewlike subodh rahuls late brotherwho defiantly stood out they advertised their sexual orientation not for the entertainment of the timid but in order to discomfort the intolerant yet rahul imagined that even those homosexuals who were as bold as subodh were vulnerable to how slavishly they sought the affections of other homosexuals rahul had hated how girlishly subodh had allowed himself to be dominated by neville eden rahul had imagined that it was only as a woman that she could dominate both women and men hed also imagined that being a woman would make him envy other women less or not at all hed even thought that his desire to hurt and humiliate women would somehow evanesce he was unprepared for how he would continue to hate them and desire to do them harm prostitutesand other women of what he presumed to be loose behaviorespecially offended him in part because of how lightly they regarded their sexual favors and how they took for granted their sexual parts which rahul had been forced to acquire through such perseverance and pain rahul had put himself through the rigors of what he believed was necessary to make him happy yet he still raged like some but fortunately few real women rahul was contemptuous of those men who sought his attention while at the same time he strongly desired those men who remained indifferent to his obvious beauty and this was only half his problem the other half was that his need to kill certain women was surprisingly to him unchanged and after hed strangled or bludgeoned themhe favored the latter form of executionhe couldnt resist creating his signature work of art upon their flaccid bellies the soft stomach of a dead woman was rahuls preferred medium his canvas of choice beth had been the first killing dieter was unmemorable to rahul but the spontaneity with which hed struck down beth and the utter unresponsiveness of her abdomen to the dhobi pen were stimulations so extreme that rahul continued to yield to them in this sense was his tragedy compounded for his sex change had not enabled him to view other women as companionable human beings and because rahul still hated women he knew hed failed to become a woman at all further isolating him in london was the fact that rahul also loathed his fellow transsexuals before his operation hed suffered countless psychological interviews obviously they were superficial for rahul had managed to convey an utter lack of sexual anger hed observed that friendliness which he interpreted as an impulse toward a cloying kind of sympathy impressed the evaluating psychiatrist and the sex therapists there were meetings with other wouldbe transsexuals both those applying for the operation and those in the more advanced phase of training for the postoperative women they would soon become complete transsexuals also attended these agonizing meetings it was supposed to be encouraging to socialize with complete transsexuals just to see what real women they were this was nauseating to rahul who hated it when anyone dared to suggest that he or she was like him rahul knew that he wasnt like anyone it appalled him that these complete transsexuals even shared the names and phone numbers of former boyfriends these were men they said who werent at all repulsed by women like uspossibly these interesting men were even attracted by them what a concept rahul thought he wasnt becoming a woman in order to become a member of some transsexual club if the operation was complete no one would ever know that rahul had not been born a woman but there was one who knew aunt promila shed been such a supporter gradually rahul resented how she sought to control him she would continue her most generous financial assistance to his life in london but only if he promised not to forget heronly if he would come pay some attention to her from time to time rahul wasnt opposed to these periodic visits to bombay he was merely annoyed that his aunt manipulated how often and when he traveled to see her and as she grew older she grew more needy shamelessly and frequently she referred to rahuls elevated status in her will even with promilas considerable influence it took rahul longer to legalize his change of name than it had taken him to change his sexin spite of the bribes and although there were many other womens names that he preferred it was politic of him to choose promila which greatly pleased his aunt and assured him an indeed favorable position in her muchmentioned will nevertheless the new name on the new passport left rahul feeling incomplete perhaps he felt that he could never be promila rai as long as his aunt promila was alive since promila was the only person on earth whom rahul loved it made him feel guilty that he grew impatient with how long he had to wait for her to die remembering aunt promila he was five or six or maybe only four rahul could never remember what he did recall was that he thought he was old enough to be going to the mens room by himself aunt promila took him to the ladies roomshe took him with her into the toilet stall too hed told her that there were urinals in the mens room and that the men stood up to pee i know a better way to pee shed told him at the duckworth club the ladies room suffered from an elephant motif in the mens room the tigerhunt decor was far less obtrusive for example in the ladies room toilet stalls there was a pulldown platform on the inside of the stall door it was simply a shelf that folded flat against the door when not in use by means of a handle the shelf could be pulled down on this platform a lady could put her handbagor whatever else she took with her into the toilet stall the handle was a ring that passed like an earring through the base of an elephants trunk promila would lift her skirt and pull down her panties then she sat on the toilet seat and rahulwhod also pulled down his pants and his underpantswould sit on her lap pull down the elephant dear aunt promila would tell him and rahul would lean forward until he could reach the ring through the elephants trunk the elephant had no tusks rahul found the elephant generally lacking in realismfor example there was no opening at the end of the elephants trunk first promila peed then rahul he sat on his aunts lap listening to her when she wiped herself he could feel the back of her hand against his bare bum then she would reach into his lap and point his little penis down into the toilet it was difficult for him to pee from her lap dont miss shed whisper in his ear are you being careful rahul tried to be careful when he was finished aunt promila wiped his penis with some toilet paper then she felt his penis with her bare hand lets be sure youre dry dear promila would say to him she always held him until his penis was stiff what a big boy you are shed whisper when they were finished they washed their hands together the hot water is too hotit will burn you aunt promila would warn him together they stood at the wildly ornate sink there was a single faucet in the form of an elephants head the water flowed through the elephants trunk emerging in a broad spray you lifted one tusk for the hot water the other tusk for the cold just the cold water dear aunt promila told him she let rahul operate the faucet for both of them he would raise and lower the tusk for cold waterjust one tusk always wash your hands dear aunt promila would say yes auntie rahul answered hed supposed his aunts preference for cold water was a sign of her age she must have remembered a time before there was hot water when he was older maybe or he could have been promila sent him to see dr lowji daruwalla she was concerned with what she called rahuls inexplicable hairlessnessor so she told the doctor in retrospect rahul realized that hed disappointed his auntand on more than one occasion promilas disappointment rahul also realized was sexual his socalled hairlessness had little to do with it but there was no way for promila rai to complain about the size or the shortlived stiffness of her nephews peniscertainly not to dr lowji daruwalla the question of whether or not rahul was impotent would have to wait until rahul was or at that time the examining physician would be old dr tata in retrospect rahul would realize that his aunt was chiefly interested in knowing whether he was impotent or merely impotent with her naturally shed not told tata that she was having a repeatedly disappointing sexual experience with rahul shed implied that rahul himself was concerned because hed failed to maintain an erection with a prostitute dr tatas response had been disappointing to aunt promila too perhaps it was the prostitute old dr tata had replied years later when he thought of his aunt promila rahul would remember that perhaps it was the prostitute he would think to himself possibly hed not been impotent after all all things considered now that rahul was a woman what did it really matter he sincerely loved his aunt promila as for washing his hands the memory of the elephant with one tusk raised would never be lost on rahul but he preferred to wash his hands in hot water a childless couple searches for rahul with hindsight it is impressive how deputy commissioner patel fathomed rahuls attachment to family moneyin india the detective thought that a welltodo relative might explain the killers few but periodic visits to bombay for years the victims who were decorated with the winking elephant were prostitutes from the kamathipura brothels or from the brothels on grant road and falkland road their murders occurred in groups of two or three within two or three weeks time and then not again for nearly nine months or a year there were no murders recorded in the hottest months just before the monsoon or during the monsoon itself the murderer struck at a more comfortable time of the year only the first two murders in goa were hotweather murders detective patel could find no evidence of the murders with elephant drawings in any other indian city this was why he had concluded that the killer lived abroad it wasnt hard to uncover the relatively few murders of this nature in london although these werent restricted to the indian community the victims were always prostitutes or studentsthe latter usually of an artistic inclination were reputed to have lived in a bohemian or otherwise unconventional way the more he studied the murderer and the more deeply he loved nancy the more the deputy commissioner realized that nancy was lucky to be alive but with the passage of time nancy less and less wore the countenance of a woman who felt herself to be lucky the deutsche marks in the dildosuch an excessive amount that at first both nancy and young inspector patel had felt quite liberatedwere the beginning of nancy and patels feeling that they had been compromised it made only the smallest dent in the sum for nancy to send what shed stolen from the hardware store to her parents it was she thought the best way to erase the past but her newfound crusade for justice interfered with the purity of her intention the money was to repay the hardware store but in sending it to her parents she couldnt resist naming those men in feedandgrain supply whod made her feel like dirt if her parents wanted to repay the store after knowing what had happened to their daughter there that would be their decision thus she created a moral dilemma for her parents which had quite the opposite effect from what nancy desired she had not erased the past shed brought it to life in her parents eyes and for almost years until they died her parents faithfully described their ongoing torment in iowa to herall the while begging her to come home but refusing to come visit her it was never clear to nancy what they finally did with the money as for young inspector patel it made a similarly small dent in the sum of dieters deutsche marks for the previously uncorrupted policeman to engage in his first and last bribe it was simply the usual and necessary sum required for promotion for a more lucrative postingand one must remember that vijay patel was not a maharashtrian for a gujarati to make the move from an inspector at the colaba station to a deputy commissioner in crime branch headquarters at crawford market required what is called greasing the wheel butover the years and in combination with his failure to find rahulthe bribe had etched itself into a part of the deputy commissioners vulnerable selfesteem it had been a reasonable expense certainly not a lavish amount of money and contrary to the infuriating fiction represented by the inspector dhar movies there was no significant advancement within the bombay police force without a little bribery and although nancy and the detective were a love story they were unhappy it wasnt only that the sheer grimness of serving justice had grown to be a task nor was it simply that rahul had escaped unpunished both mr and mrs patel assumed that a higher judgment had been made against them for nancy was infertile and theyd spent nearly a decade learning the reasonand then another decade first trying to adopt a child and finally deciding against adoption in the first decade of their efforts to conceive a child both nancy and young patelshe called him vijaybelieved that they were being punished for dipping into the deutsche marks nancy had entirely forgotten a brief period of physical discomfort upon her return to bombay with the dildo a slight burning in her urethra and the appearance in her underwear of an insignificant vaginal discharge had contributed to nancys delay in initiating a sexual relationship with vijay patel the symptoms were mild and they overlapped to some degree with cystitis inflammation of the bladder and urinary tract infection she didnt want to imagine that dieter had given her something venereal although her memory of that brothel in kamathipura and how familiarly dieter had spoken with the madam gave nancy good reason to be worried moreover at the time she could plainly see that she and young patel were falling in love with each other she wasnt about to ask him to recommend a suitable physician instead in that wellworn travel guide which she still faithfully carried was an ontheroad recipe for a douche but she misread the proper proportion of vinegar and gave herself much worse burning than she began with for a week there was an even yellower stain in her underwear which she ascribed to the unwise remedy of her homemade douche as for the abdominal pain it closely attended the onset of her period which was unusually heavy she had much cramping and even a little chill she wondered if her body was trying to reject the iud and then she completely recovered she only remembered this episode years later she was sitting with her husband in the office of a fancy private venereologist andwith vijays helpshe was filling out a detailed questionnaire it was part of the infertility work what had happened was that dieter had given her a dose of gonorrhea which hed caught from the yearold prostitute hed fucked standing up in the hall of that brothel in kamathipura it hadnt been true as the madam had told him that there were no available cubicles with mattresses or cots instead it was the young prostitutes request to have sex standing up for her case of gonorrhea had advanced to the more uncomfortable symptoms of pelvic inflammatory disease she was suffering from the socalled chandelier sign where moving the cervix up and down elicits pain in the tubes and ovaries in short it hurt her to have a mans weight pounding on her belly it was better for her when she stood up as for dieter he was a fastidious young german who gave himself a shot of penicillin before he left the brothel a medical student among his friends had told him that this worked well to prevent incubating syphilis the injection however did nothing to abort the penicillinaseproducing neisseria gonorrhea no one had told him that these strains were endemic in the tropics besides less than a week after his contact with the infected prostitute dieter was murdered hed begun to notice only the slightest symptoms and what relatively mild symptoms nancy had experienced before her spontaneous healing and the scarring were the result of the inflammation spreading from her cervix to the lining of her uterus and her tubes when the venereologist explained to mr and mrs patel that this was the cause of nancys infertility the distraught couple firmly believed that dieters nasty diseaseeven from the hippie gravewas final proof of the judgment against them they should never have taken a pfennig of those dirty deutsche marks in the dildo in their ensuing efforts to adopt a child their experience was not uncommon the better adoption agencies which kept prenatal records as well as a history of the natural mothers health were uncharitable on the issue of their mixed marriage this wouldnt have deterred the patels in the end but it prolonged the process of humiliating interviews and the swamp of petty paperwork in the interim while they awaited approval first nancy and then vijay expressed whatever slight doubts they both felt about the disappointment of adopting a child when theyd hoped to have one of their own if theyd been able to adopt a child quickly they would have begun to love it before their doubts could have mounted but in the extended period of waiting they lost their nerve it wasnt that they believed they would have loved an adopted child insufficiently it was that they believed the judgment against them would condemn the child to some unbearable fate theyd done something wrong they were paying for it they wouldnt ask a child to pay for it too and so the patels accepted childlessness after almost years of expecting a child this acceptance came to them at considerable cost in the way they walked in the detectable lethargy with which they raised their many cups and glasses of tea they reflected their own consciousness of this resignation to their fate about that time nancy went to workfirst in one of the adoption agencies that had so rigorously interviewed her then as a volunteer in an orphanage it wasnt the sort of work she could sustain for very longit made her think of the child shed given up in texas and after years or so dcp patel began to believe that rahul had come back to bombay this time to stay the murders were now evenly spaced over the calendar year in london the killings had altogether stopped what had happened was that rahuls aunt promila had finally died and her estate on old ridge roadnot to mention the considerable allowance shed bestowed upon her only niecehad passed into the hands of her namesake the former rahul he had become promilas heir orto be more anatomically correctshe had become promilas heiress and the new promila had not long to wait for her acceptance at the duckworth club where her aunt had faithfully made application for her nieces membershipeven before she technically had a niece this niece was slow and deliberate about her entry into that society which the duckworth club would offer her she was in no hurry to be seen some duckworthians upon meeting her found her a touch crudeand almost all duckworthians agreed that although she must have been a great beauty in her prime she was rather well advanced into that phase called middle age especially for someone whod never been married that struck nearly everyone as odd but before there was time for much talk about it the new promila raiwith surprising swiftness considering that hardly anyone really knew herwas engaged to be married and to another duckworthian an elderly gentleman of such sizable wealth that his estate on old ridge road was rumored to put the late promilas place to shame it was no surprise that the wedding was held at the duckworth club but it was too bad that the wedding took place at a time when dr daruwalla was in toronto for heor certainly juliamight have recognized this new promila whod so successfully passed herself off as the old promilas niece by the time the daruwallas and inspector dhar were back in bombay the new promila rai was identified by her married nameactually by two names one of which was never used to her face rahul whod become promila had lately become the beautiful mrs dogar as old mr sethna usually addressed her yes of coursethe former rahul was none other than the second mrs dogar and each time dr daruwalla felt the stab of pain in his ribs where shed collided with him in the foyer of the duckworth club he mistakenly searched his forgetful mind for those nowfaded film stars he saw over and over again on so many of his favorite videos farrokh would never find her there rahul wasnt hiding in the old movies the police know the movie is innocent just when deputy commissioner patel had decided that he would never find rahul there was released in bombay another predictably dreadful inspector dhar film the real policeman had no desire to be further insulted but when he learned what inspector dhar and the cagegirl killer was about the deputy commissioner not only went to see the filmhe took nancy to see it with him the second time there could be no doubt regarding the source of that elephant drawing nancy was sure she knew where that jaunty little elephant had come from no two minds could imagine a dead womans navel as a winking eye even in the movie version the elephant raised just one tuskit was always the same tusk too and the water spraying from the elephants trunkwho would think of such a thing nancy had wondered for years a child might think of such a thing the deputy commissioner had told her the police had never given out such details to the press the police preferred to keep their business to themselvestheyd not even informed the public about the existence of such an artistic serial killer people often killed prostitutes why invite the press to sensationalize the presence of a single fiend so in truth the policemost especially detective patelknew that these murders had long predated the release of such a fantasy as inspector dhar and the cagegirl killer the movie merely drew the publics attention to the real murders the media assumed wrongly that the movie was to blame it had been deputy commissioner patels idea to allow the misunderstanding to pass the deputy commissioner wanted to see if the movie might inspire some jealousy on the part of rahul for the detective was of the opinion that if his wife recognized the source of the inspiration of inspector dhars creator so would the real murderer the killing of mr lalespecially the interesting tworupee note in his mouthindicated that the deputy commissioner had been right rahul must have seen the movieassuming that rahul wasnt the screenwriter what puzzled the detective was that the note said more members die if dhar remains a member since nancy had been smart enough to figure out that only a doctor would have been shown beths decorated body surely rahul would know as well that it wasnt dhar himself whod seen one of rahuls works of art it could only be the doctor who was so frequently in dhars company the matter that detective patel wished to speak of with dr daruwalla in private was simply this the detective wanted the doctor to confirm nancys theoriesthat he was dhars true creator and had seen the drawing on beths belly but the deputy commissioner also wanted to warn dr daruwalla more members die this could mean that the doctor might be rahuls future target detective patel and nancy believed that farrokh was a more likely target than dhar himself on the telephone such complicated news took time for the policeman to deliver and for the doctor to comprehend and since nancy had passed the telephone to her husband that element of the real murderer being a transvestite or even a thoroughly convincing woman wasnt a part of detective patels conversation with farrokh unfortunately the name rahul was never mentioned it was simply agreed that dr daruwalla would come to crime branch headquarters where the deputy commissioner would show him photographs of the elephants drawn on the murdered womenthis for the sake of mere confirmationand that both dhar and the doctor should exercise extreme caution the real murderer had seemingly been provoked by inspector dhar and the cagegirl killerif not exactly in the way that the public and many angry prostitutes believed a view of two marriages at a vulnerable hour as soon as dr daruwalla hung up the phone he carried his agitation to the dinner table where roopa apologized for the utter deterioration of the mutton which was her way of saying that this mushy meat in her beloved dhal was all the doctors fault which of course it was dhar then asked the doctor if hed read the new hate mailfarrokh had not a pity john d said because it might well be the last of the mail from those infuriated prostitutes balraj gupta the director had informed john d that the new inspector dhar movie inspector dhar and the towers of silence was being released tomorrow after that john d said ironically the hate mail would most likely be from all the offended parsis tomorrow cried dr daruwalla well actually after midnight tonight dhar said dr daruwalla should have known whenever balraj gupta called him and asked to discuss with him something that the director wanted to do it invariably meant that the director had already done it but no more of this trivia farrokh said to his wife and john d the doctor took a deep breath then he informed them of everything that deputy commissioner patel had told him all julia asked was how many murders has this killer managedhow many victims are there sixtynine said dr daruwalla julias gasp was less surprising than john ds inappropriate calm does that count mr lal dhar asked mr lal makes seventyif mr lal is truly connected farrokh replied of course hes connected said inspector dhar which irritated dr daruwalla in the usual way here was his fictional creation once again sounding like an authority but what farrokh failed to acknowledge was that dhar was a good and welltrained actor dhar had faithfully studied the role and taken many components of the part into himself instinctually hed become quite a good detectivedr daruwalla had only made up the character dhars character was an utter fiction to farrokh who could scarcely remember his research on various aspects of police work from screenplay to screenplay dhar on the other hand rarely forgot either these finer points or his lessthanoriginal lines as a screenwriter dr daruwalla was at best a gifted amateur but inspector dhar was closer to the real thing than either dhar or his creator knew may i go with you to see the photographs dhar asked his creator i believe that the deputy commissioner wished me to see them privately the doctor replied id like to see them farrokh john d said he should see them if he wants to julia snapped im not sure the police would agree dr daruwalla began to say but inspector dhar gave a most familiar and dismissive wave of his hand a perfect gesture of contempt farrokh felt his exhaustion draw close to himlike old friends and family gathering around his imagined sickbed when john d retired to the balcony to sleep julia was quick to change the subjecteven before farrokh had managed to undress for bed you didnt tell him she cried oh please stop it about the damnable twin business he said to her what makes you think thats such a priority especially now i think that the arrival of his twin might be more of a priority to john d julia remarked decisively she left her husband alone in the bedroom while she used the bathroom then after farrokh had had his turn in the bathroom he noted that julia had already fallen asleepor else she was pretending to be asleep at first he tried to sleep on his side which was his usual preference but in that position he was conscious of the soreness in his ribs on his stomach the pain was more evident flat on his backwhere he struggled in vain to fall asleep and where he was inclined to snorehe wracked his overexcited brain for the precise image of the movie actress he was sure he was reminded of when hed shamelessly stared at the second mrs dogar despite himself he grew sleepy the names of actresses came to and left his lips he saw neelams full mouth and rekhas nice mouth too he thought of sridevis mischievous smileand almost everything there was to think about sonu walia too then he halfwaked himself and thought no no its no one contemporary and shes probably not even indian jennifer jones he wondered ida lupino rita moreno dorothy lamour no no what was he thinking it was someone whose beauty was much more cruel than the beauty of any of these this insight nearly woke him had he awakened simultaneously with the reminder caused by the pain in his ribs he might have got it but although the hour was now late it was still too soon for him to know there was more communication in the marriage bed of mr and mrs patel at this very same late hour nancy was crying her tears as they often were were a mix of misery and frustration deputy commissioner patel was trying as he often did to be comforting nancy had suddenly remembered what had happened to hermaybe two weeks after the last symptoms of gonorrhea had disappeared shed broken out in a terrible rash red and sore and with unbearable itching and shed assumed that this was a new phase of something venereal shed caught from dieter furthermore there was no hiding this phase from her beloved policeman young inspector patel had straightaway brought her to a doctor who informed her that shed been taking too many antimalarial pillsshe was simply suffering from an allergic reaction but how this had frightened her and she only now remembered the goats for all these years shed thought about the goats in the brothels but shed not remembered how shed first feared that it was something from the goats that had given her such a hideous rash and such uncontrollable itching that had been her worst fear for years when shed thought about those brothels and the women whod been murdered there shed forgotten the men dieter had told her aboutthe terrible men who fucked goats maybe dieter had fucked goats too no wonder shed at least tried to forget this but nobody is fucking those goats vijay just now informed her what nancy said well i dont presume to know about the united statesor even about certain rural areas of indiabut no one in bombay is fucking goats her husband assured her what nancy said dieter told me that they fucked the goats well its not at all true the detective said those goats are pets of course some of them give milk this is a bonusfor the children i suppose but theyre pets just pets oh vijay nancy cried he had to hold her oh dieter lied to me she cried oh how he lied to me all those years i believed it oh that fucker the word was so sharply spoken it caused a dog in the alley below them to stop rooting through the garbage and bark over their heads the ceiling fan barely stirred the close air which seemed always to smell of the perpetually blocked drains and of the sea which in their neighborhood was not especially clean or freshsmelling oh it was another lie nancy screamed vijay went on holding her although to do so for long would make them both sweat the air was unmoving where they lived the goats were just pets yet for years what dieter had told her had hurt her so badly at times it had made her physically sick and the heat and the sewer smell and the fact that whoever rahul was he was still getting away with itall this nancy had accepted but in the fashion that shed accepted her childlessness which shed accepted so slowly and only after what had felt to her like a lingering and merciless defeat what the dwarf sees it was late while nancy cried herself to sleep and dr daruwalla failed to realize that the second and beautiful mrs dogar had reminded him of rahul vinod was driving one of mr gargs exotic dancers home from the wetness cabaret she was a middleaged maharashtrian with the english name of murielnot her real name but her exoticdancing nameand she was upset because one of the patrons of the wetness cabaret had thrown an orange at her while she was dancing the clientele of the wetness cabaret was vile muriel had decided even so she rationalized mr garg was a gentleman garg had recognized that muriel was upset by the episode with the orange hed personally engaged vinods luxury taxi to drive muriel home although vinod had praised mr gargs humanitarian efforts on behalf of runaway child prostitutes the dwarf wouldnt have gone so far as to call mr garg a gentleman possibly garg was more of a gentleman with middleaged women with younger girls vinod wasnt sure the dwarf didnt entirely share dr daruwallas suspicions of mr garg but vinod and deepa had occasionally encountered a child prostitute who seemed in need of rescuing from garg save this poor child mr garg seemed to be saying save her from me garg might have meant it wouldnt have helped vinod and deepas childrescue operations to have dr daruwalla treating garg like a criminal the new runaway the boneless onea potential plastic ladywas a case in point although shed appeared to be more personally involved with mr garg than she should have been such implications wouldnt help her cause with dr daruwalla the doctor had to pronounce her healthy or the great blue nile wouldnt take her vinod now noted that the middleaged woman with the exoticdancing name of muriel had fallen asleep she slept with a somewhat sour expression her mouth disagreeably open and her hands resting on her fat breasts the dwarf thought that it made more sense to throw an orange at her than it did to watch her dance but vinods humanitarian instincts extended even to middleaged strippers he slowed down because the streets were bumpy seeing no reason to wake the poor woman before she was home in her sleep muriel suddenly cringed she was ducking oranges the dwarf imagined after vinod dropped off muriel it was too late for him to go anywhere but back to the brothel area the redlight district was the only part of bombay where people needed a taxi at in the morning soon the international travelers would be arriving at the oberoi and the taj but no one whod just flown in from europe or north america would have the slightest inclination to cruise around the city vinod thought hed wait for the end of the last show at the wetness cabaret one of mr gargs other exotic dancers might want a safe ride home it amazed vinod that the wetness cabaret the building itself was home to mr garg the dwarf couldnt imagine sleeping there he supposed there were rooms upstairs above the slick bar and the sticky tables and the sloping stage vinod shivered to think of the dimly lit bar the brightly lit stage the darkened tables where the men satsome of them masturbating although the dominant odor of the wetness cabaret was one of urine how could garg sleep in such a place even if he slept above it but as distasteful as it was to vinodto cruise the brothel area as if he carried a potential customer in the ambassadors back seatthe dwarf had decided that he might as well stay awake vinod was fascinated by that hour when most of the brothels switched over in kamathipura on falkland road and grant road there came an hour of the early morning when most of the brothels would accept only allnight customers in the dwarfs opinion these were different and desperate men who else would want to spend all night with a prostitute vinod grew alert and edgy at this hour as ifparticularly in those little lanes in kamathipurahe might spot a man who wasnt entirely human when he got tired the dwarf dozed in his car his car was more home to him than home at least when deepa was away at the circus and when he was bored vinod would cruise past the transvestite brothels on falkland road and grant road vinod liked the hijras they were so bold and so outrageousthey also seemed to like dwarfs possibly the hijras thought that dwarfs were outrageous vinod was aware that some of the hijras didnt like him they were the ones who knew that the dwarf was inspector dhars driverthe ones who hated inspector dhar and the cagegirl killer lately vinod had to be a little careful in the brothel area the prostitute murders had made dhar and dhars dwarf more than a little unpopular thus that hour when most of the brothels switched over made vinod more alert and edgy than usual while he cruised the dwarf was among the first to notice what had changed about bombay the change was being enacted before vinods very eyes gone was the movie poster of his most famous client that largerthanlife image of inspector dhar which vinod and all of bombay had grown so used tothe huge hoardings the overhead billboards that advertised inspector dhar and the cagegirl killer dhars handsome face albeit bleeding slightly the torn white shirt open to expose dhars muscular chest the pretty ravaged young woman slung over dhars strong shoulder and always the bluegray semiautomatic pistol held in dhars hard right hand in its place everywhere in bombay was a brandnew poster vinod thought that only the semiautomatic was the same although inspector dhars sneer was remarkably familiar inspector dhar and the towers of silence this time the young woman slung over dhars shoulder was noticeably deadmore noticeably she was a western hippie it was the only safe time to put the posters up if people had been awake they would doubtless have attacked the posterwallas the old posters in the brothel area had long ago been destroyed tonight perhaps the prostitutes left the posterwallas unharmed because the prostitutes were happy to see that inspector dhar and the cagegirl killer was being replaced with a new offensethis time to somebody else but upon closer inspection vinod noted that not so much was different about the new poster as hed first observed the posture of the young woman over dhars shoulder was quite the same alive or dead and again albeit from a slightly different spot inspector dhars cruel handsome face was bleeding the longer vinod looked at the new poster the more he found it to resemble the previous poster it seemed to the dwarf that dhar even wore the same torn shirt this possibly explained why the dwarf had driven around bombay for more than two hours before hed noticed that a new inspector dhar film had been born into the world vinod couldnt wait to see it the unspeakable life of the redlight district teemed all around himthe bartering and the betrayals and the frightening unseen beatingsor so the excited dwarf imagined about the most hopeful thing that could be said is that throughout the brothel area of bombay no onetruly no onewas fucking a goat dhars twin three old missionaries fall asleep that week between christmas and new years when the first american missionary was due to arrive at st ignatius in mazagaon the jesuit mission prepared a celebration in honor of st ignatius was a bombay landmark it would soon be years oldin all these years it had faithfully managed its holy and secular tasks without the assistance of an american the management of st ignatius was a threesome of responsibility and these three had been almost as successful as the blessed trinity the father rector father julian who was years old and english the senior priest father cecil who was and indian and brother gabriel who was around and had fled spain after the civil war were a triumvirate of authority that was seldom questioned and never overruled they were also unanimous in their opinion that st ignatius could continue to serve mankind and the heavenly kingdom without the aid of any americanyet one had been offered to be sure they would have preferred another indian or at least a european but since these three wise men were of an average age of years and eight months they were attracted to one aspect of the young scholastic as they called him at martin mills was no kid only dr daruwalla would have judged young martin to be unsuitably old for a man who was still in training to be a priest that the socalled scholastic was almost was at least mildly comforting to father julian and father cecil and brother gabriel although they shared the conviction that the missions th jubilee was diminished by their obligation to welcome the former californian who was allegedly fond of hawaiian shirts they knew of this laughable eccentricity from the otherwise impressive dossier of martin mills whose letters of recommendation were glowing however the father rector said that when it came to americans one must read between the lines for example father julian pointed out martin mills had evidently eschewed his native california although nowhere in his dossier did it say so hed been schooled elsewhere in the united states and had taken a teaching job in boston which was about as far away from california as one could get clearly said father julian this indicated that martin mills had come from a troubled family perhaps it was his own mother or father whom hed eschewed and along with young martins unexplained attraction to the garish which father julian concluded was the root cause of the scholastics reported fondness for hawaiian shirts there was mention in the dossier of martin millss success with apostolic workeven as a novice and especially with young people bombays st ignatius was a good school and martin mills was expected to be a good teacher most of the students werent catholicsmany werent even christians it wont do to have a crazed american proselytehunting among our pupils the father rector warned although there was no mention in the dossier of martin mills being either crazed or a proselytehunter the dossier did say that hed undertaken a sixweek pilgrimage as part of his novitiate and that during this pilgrimage hed spent no moneynot a penny hed managed to find places to live and work in return for humanitarian services these included soup kitchens for the homeless hospitals for handicapped children homes for the elderly shelters for aids patients and a clinic for babies suffering from fetal alcohol syndromethis was on a native american reservation brother gabriel and father cecil were inclined to view martin millss dossier in a positive light father julian on the other hand quoted from thomas à kempiss imitation of christ be rarely with young people and strangers the father rector had read through martin millss dossier as if it were a code to be deciphered the task of teaching at st ignatius and otherwise serving the mission was a part of the typical threeyear service in preparation for the priesthood it was called regency and it was followed by another three years of theological study ordination followed theology martin mills would complete a fourth year of theological study after his ordination hed completed the twoyear jesuit novitiate at st aloysius in massachusetts which father julian said was an extremists choice because of the reputed harshness of its winters this suggested a proneness to selfflagellation and other chastisements of the flesheven an inclination to fasting which the jesuits discouraged they encouraged fasting only in moderation but once again the father rector seemed to be searching through martin millss dossier for some hidden evidence of the scholastics flawed character brother gabriel and father cecil pointed out to father julian that martin had joined the new england province of the society of jesus while he was teaching in boston the provinces novitiate was in massachusetts it was only natural for martin mills to have been a novice at st aloysiusit hadnt really been a choice but why had he taught years in a dismal parochial school in boston his dossier didnt say that the school was dismal however it was admitted that the school was not accredited actually it was a kind of reform school where young criminals were encouraged to give up their delinquent behavior as far as the father rector could tell the means by which this was accomplished was theatrical martin mills had directed plays wherein all the roles were acted by former felons and miscreants and thugs in such an environment martin mills had first felt his vocationnamely hed felt christs presence and had been drawn to the priesthood but why did it take years father julian questioned after completing his novitiate martin mills was sent to boston college to study philosophy that met with the father rectors approval but then in the midst of his regency young martin had requested a threemonth experiment in india did this mean that the scholastic had suffered doubts about his vocation father julian asked well well soon see father cecil said he seems perfectly all right to me father cecil had almost said that martin mills seemed perfectly loyolalike but hed thought better of it because he knew how the father rector distrusted those jesuits who too consciously patterned their behavior on the life of st ignatius loyolathe founder of the jesuit order the society of jesus even a pilgrimage could be a fools errand when undertaken by a fool the spiritual exercises of st ignatius loyola is a handbook for the retreat master not for the retreatant it was never intended to be published much less memorized by wouldbe priestsnot that martin millss dossier suggested that the missionary had followed the spiritual exercises to such an excess once again the father rectors suspicion of martin millss extreme piety was intuitive father julian suspected all americans of an unflagging fanaticism which the father rector believed was emboldened by a frightening reliance on selfeducationor reading on a deserted island as father julian called an american education father cecil on the other hand was a kindly manof that school which said martin mills should be given a chance to prove himself the senior priest chided the father rector for his cynicism you dont know for a fact that our martin wanted to be a novice at st aloysius because he sought the harshness of a new england winter father cecil further implied that father julian was only guessing that martin mills had hoped to attend st aloysius as a form of penitential practice to chastise his flesh indeed father julian was wrong had he known the real reason why martin mills wanted st aloysius for his novitiate the father rector really would have been worried for martin mills had desired to be a novice at st aloysius solely because of his identification with st aloysius gonzaga that avid italian whose chastity was so fervent that he refused to look upon his own mother after taking his permanent vows this was martin millss favorite example of that custody of the senses which every jesuit sought to attain to martins thinking there was much to admire in the very notion of never again seeing ones own mother his mother after all was veronica rose and to deny himself even a farewell glimpse of her would certainly be enhancing to his jesuitical goal of keeping his voice his body and his curiosity in check martin mills was very much held in check and both his pious intentions and the life that had fueled them were more fanatically shot through and through with zeal than father julian could have guessed and now brother gabrielthat yearold icon collectorhad lost the scholastics letter if they didnt know when the new missionary was arriving how could they meet his plane after all father julian said it seems that our martin likes challenges father cecil thought that this was cruel of the father rector for martin mills to arrive in bombay at that deadofnight hour when the international flights landed in sahar and then to have to find his own way to the mission which would be locked up and virtually impenetrable until earlymorning mass this was worse than any pilgrimage the missionary had previously undertaken after all father julian said with characteristic sarcasm st ignatius loyola managed to find his way to jerusalem no one met his plane it was unfair father cecil thought and so hed called dr daruwalla to ask the doctor if he knew when martin mills was arriving but the senior priest had reached only the doctors answering machine and dr daruwalla hadnt returned his call and so father cecil prayed for martin mills in general in particular father cecil prayed that the missionary would not have too traumatic a first encounter upon his arrival in bombay brother gabriel also prayed for martin mills in general in particular brother gabriel prayed that he might yet find the scholastics lost letter but the letter was never found long before dr daruwalla drifted into sleep in the midst of his efforts to locate a movie star who resembled the second mrs dogar brother gabriel gave up looking for the letter and went to bed where he also fell asleep when vinod drove muriel homeit was while the dwarf and the exotic dancer were considering the vileness of the clientele at the wetness cabaretfather cecil stopped praying and then fell asleep too and shortly after vinod noticed that inspector dhar and the towers of silence was about to be launched upon the sleeping city father julian locked the cloister gate and the schoolbus gate and the gate that admitted entrance to st ignatius church and shortly after that the father rector was sound asleep as well early indications of mistaken identity at approximately in the morningthat very same hour when the posterwallas were plastering the advertisements for the new inspector dhar movie all over bombay and when vinod was cruising by the brothels in kamathipurathe airplane carrying dhars twin landed safely in sahar dhar himself was at that moment sleeping on dr daruwallas balcony however the customs official who looked back and forth from the intense expression of the new missionary to the utterly bland passport photograph of martin mills was convinced that he stood facetoface with inspector dhar the hawaiian shirt was a mild surprise for the customs official couldnt imagine why dhar would attempt to conceal himself as a tourist similarly shaving off the identifying dhar mustache was a lame disguisewith the upper lip exposed something of the inimitable dhar sneer was even more pronounced it was a us passportthat was clever thought the customs officialbut the passport admitted that this socalled martin mills had been born in bombay the customs official pointed to this evidence in the passport then he winked at the missionary as a way of indicating to inspector dhar that this customs official was nobodys fool martin mills was very tired it had been a long flight which hed spent studying hindi and otherwise informing himself of the particulars of native behavior he knew all about the salaam for example but the customs official had distinctly winked at himhe had not salaamedand martin mills hadnt encountered any information regarding the wink in his reading about native behavior the missionary didnt wish to be impolite therefore he winked back and he salaamed a little too just to be sure the customs official was very pleased with himself hed seen the wink in a recent charles bronson movie but he was uncertain if it would be a cool thing to do to inspector dhar above all in dealing with dhar the customs official wanted to be perceived as cool unlike most bombayites and all policemen the customs official loved inspector dhar movies so far no customs officials had been portrayed in the films therefore none had been offended and prior to his service as a customs official hed been rejected for police work therefore the constant mockery of the policethe prevalence of bribe taking which was basic to every inspector dhar moviewas adored by the customs official nevertheless it was most irregular for someone to be entering the country under a false identity and the customs official wanted dhar to know that he was hip to dhars disguise while at the same time he would do nothing to interfere with the creative genius who stood before him besides dhar didnt look well his color was poorhe was mostly pale and blotchyand he appeared to have lost a lot of weight is this your first time in bombay since your birth the customs official asked martin mills thereupon the official winked again and smiled martin mills smiled and winked back yes he said but im going to stay here for at least three months this was an absurdity to the customs official but he insisted on being cool about it he saw that the missionarys visa was conditional it was possible to extend it for three months the examination of the visa elicited more winking it was also expected of the customs official that he look through the missionarys belongings for a visit of three months the scholastic had brought only a single suitcase albeit a large and heavy one and in his ungainly luggage were some surprises the black shirts with the white detachable collarsfor although martin mills wasnt an ordained priest he was permitted to wear such clerical garb there was also a wrinkled black suit and a halfdozen more hawaiian shirts and then came the culpa beads and the footlong whip with the braided cords not to mention the leg iron that was worn around the thigh the wire prongs pointed inward toward the flesh but the customs official remained calm he just kept smiling and winking despite his horror at these instruments of selftorture the father rector father julian would also have been horrified to see such antiquities of mortification as these they were artifacts of an earlier timeeven father cecil would have been horrified or else much amused whips and leg irons had never been notable parts of the jesuit way of perfection even the culpa beads were an indication that martin mills might not have a true jesuit vocation as for the customs official the scholastics books contributed further to the authenticity of inspector dhars disguise which is what the customs official took all of this to bean actors elaborate props doubtless dhar was preparing himself for yet another challenging role this time he plays a priest the customs official wondered he looked over the booksall the while winking and smiling in ceaseless approval while the baffled missionary kept winking and smiling back there was the edition of the catholic almanac and many pamphlets of something called studies in the spirituality of jesuits there was a pocket catholic catechism and a compact dictionary of the bible there was both a bible and a lectionary and a thin book called sadhana a way to god by anthony de mello sj there was the autobiography of st ignatius loyola and a copy of the spiritual exercisesthere were many other books too altogether there were more books than there were hawaiian shirts and clerical collars combined and where will you be stayingfor three months the customs official asked martin mills whose left eye was growing tired from all the winking at st ignatius in mazagaon the jesuit replied oh of course said the customs official i greatly admire your work he whispered then he gave the surprised jesuit one more wink for the road a fellow christian where one least expected to meet one the new missionary thought all this winking would leave poor martin mills ill prepared for the native behavior of most bombayites who find winking an exceptionally aggressive suggestive and rude thing to do but thus did the scholastic pass through customs and into the shitsmelling night airall the while expecting a friendly greeting from one of his brother jesuits where were they the new missionary wondered delayed in traffic outside the airport there was much confusion at the same time there was little traffic there were many standing taxis all parked at the edge of an immense darkness as if the airport were not huge and teeming as martin mills had first thought but a fragile wilderness outpost in a vast desert where unseen fires were dying out and unseen squatters were defecating without interruption throughout the night then like flies the taxiwallas lighted on him they pecked at his clothes they tugged at his suitcase whichalthough it was extremely heavyhe would not relinquish no thank you im being met he said he realized that his hindi had abandoned him which was just as well he spoke it very poorly anyway the weary missionary suspected himself of suffering from that paranoia which is commonplace to firsttime travelers to the east for he grew increasingly apprehensive of the way the taxiwallas looked at him some were in utter awe others appeared to want to kill him they assumed he was inspector dhar and although they flitted near to him like flies and darted away from him like flies they seemed entirely too dangerous for flies after an hour martin mills was still standing there warding off newly arrived flies the old flies hovered at a distance still watching him but not bothering to approach him again the missionary was so tired he got the idea that the taxiwallas were of the hyena class of animal and that they were waiting for him to exhibit a loss of vital signs before they swarmed over him en masse a prayer fluttered to his lips but he was too exhausted to utter it he was thinking that the other missionaries were perhaps too old to have met his plane for hed been informed of their advanced ages he also knew about the jubilee celebration that was pending surely the proper recognition of years of service to god and to humanity was more worthwhile than meeting a newcomers plane this was martin mills in a nutshell he practiced selfdeprecation to such a degree that it had become a vanity with him he shifted the suitcase from one hand to the other he wouldnt allow it to rest on the pavement not only because this sign of weakness would invite the lingering taxiwallas to approach him but also because the weight of the suitcase was steadily becoming a welcome chastisement of his flesh martin mills found a certain focus a pleasing purpose to the specificity of such pain it was neither as exquisite nor as unending a pain as the leg iron when properly tightened around the thigh it wasnt as sudden or breathtaking a pain as the whip on his bare back yet he greeted the pain of the suitcase warmly and the suitcase itself bore a reminder of the ongoing task of martins formation of his search for gods will and the strength of his selfdenial inscribed in the old leather was the latin nostris oursmeaning us jesuits meaning the life as it was called in the society of jesus the suitcase itself called to memory martins two years in the novitiate at st aloysius his room had only a table a straightbacked chair a bed and a twoinchhigh wooden kneeler as his lips formed the word nostris he could summon to his memory the little bell that signaled flagellatio he recalled the days of his first silent retreat he still took strength from these two years pray shave work be silent study pray his was no fit of devotion but an orderly submission to rules perpetual poverty chastity obedience obedience to a religious superior yes but more important obedience to a community life such rules made him feel free yet on the matter of obedience it haunted him that his previous superior had once criticized him on the grounds that martin mills seemed more suited to a monastic ordera stricter order such as the carthusians jesuits are meant to go out into the world if not on our terms worldly they are also not monks i am not a monk martin mills said aloud the nearby taxiwallas understood this as a summons once again they swarmed around him avoid worldliness martin cautioned himself he smiled tolerantly at the milling taxiwallas there had been an admonition in latin above his bed at st aloysius it was an indirect reminder that a man should make his own bedetiam si sacerdotes sint even if they be priests therefore martin mills decided he would get himself into bombay the wrong taxiwalla of the taxiwallas there was only one who looked strong enough to handle the suitcase he was tall and bearded with a swarthy complexion and an exceedingly sharp aggressive thrust to his nose st ignatius mazagaon martin said to this taxiwalla who struck the missionary as a university student with a demanding night joban admirable young man probably paying his way through school with a savage glare the young man took the suitcase and hurled it into his waiting taxi all the taxiwallas had been waiting for the ambassador with the thug dwarf driver for none of them had really believed that inspector dhar would stoop to use any other cab thered been many depictions of taxiwallas in inspector dhar films they were always portrayed as reckless and crazy the particular taxiwalla whod seized the missionarys suitcase and now watched martin mills slide into the back seat was a violentminded young man named bahadur hed just been expelled from a hotelmanagement school for cheating on a foodservices examhed plagiarized the answer to a simple question about catering bahadur means brave hed also just driven to the airport from bombay and had seen the posters advertising inspector dhar and the towers of silence which had greatly offended his loyal sensibilities although taxi driving wasnt his preferred profession bahadur was grateful to his present employer mr mirza mr mirza was a parsi doubtless inspector dhar and the towers of silence would be monstrously offensive to mr mirza bahadur felt honorbound to represent the feelings of his boss not surprisingly bahadur had hated all the earlier dhar films before the release of this new offense bahadur had been hoping that inspector dhar would be murdered by offended hijras or offended female prostitutes bahadur generally favored the notion of murdering famous people for he found it offensive to unfamous people that only very few people were famous moreover he felt that driving a taxi was beneath him he was doing it only to prove to a rich uncle that he was capable of mingling with the masses it was bahadurs expectation that this uncle would soon send him off to another school the present interim was unfortunate but one could do worse than work for mr mirza like vinod mr mirza operated a privately owned taxi company meanwhile in his spare time bahadur was seeking to improve his english by concentrating on vulgar and profane expressions should he ever encounter a famous person bahadur wished to have such expressions on the tip of his tongue the reputations of famous people were entirely inflated bahadur knew hed heard stories of how tough inspector dhar was supposed to be also that dhar was a weight lifter one look at the missionarys scrawny arms proved this to be a typical lie movie hype bahadur thought he liked to drive by the film studios hoping to give actresses a ride but no one important ever chose his taxi and at asha picturesand at rajkamal studio and famous studio and central studiohed been accosted by the police for loitering fuck these film people bahadur thought i suppose you know where st ignatius is martin mills said nervously once they were under way its a jesuit mission a church a school he added looking for some sign of recognition in the glare of the taxiwalla when the scholastic saw that the young man was watching him in the rearview mirror martin did the friendly thingat least he presumed it was the nativebehavior thing to do he winked that does it bahadur thought whether the wink was condescending or whether it was the lewd invitation of a homosexual bahadur had made up his mind inspector dhar should not be allowed to get away with the violent farce he made of bombay life in the middle of the night dhar wanted to go to st ignatius what was he going to do there pray in addition to everything else that was fake about inspector dhar bahadur decided that the man was a fake hindu too inspector dhar was a bleeding christian youre supposed to be a hindu bahadur told the jesuit martin mills was thrilled his first religious confrontation in the missionary kingdomhis first hindu he knew they were the majority religion here well well martin said cheerfully men of all faiths must be brothers fuck your jesus and fuck you bahadur remarked coldly well well martin said possibly there was a time to wink and a time not to wink the new missionary thought proselytehunting among the prostitutes through the smoldering reeking darkness the taxi careened but darkness had never intimidated martin mills in crowds he could be anxious but the black of night did not menace him nor did it concern the missionary that he was in danger of some violence he meditated on the unfulfilled dream of the middle ages which was to win back jerusalem for christ he contemplated that st ignatius loyolas own pilgrimage to jerusalem had been a journey fraught with endless dangers and accidents ignatiuss attempted conquest of the holy land was a failure for he was sent back yet the saints desire to rescue unsaved souls remained ardent it was always the ignatian purpose to conform to the will of god it was no coincidence that to this end the spiritual exercises of st ignatius began with a vivid representation of hell in all its horror the fear of god was purifying it had long been so to martin mills to see both the fires of hell and a union with god in mystical ecstasy one needed only to follow the spiritual exercises and call upon the eye of the imagination for the missionary had no doubt that this was the clearest eye of all toil and will martin mills said aloud this was his creed i said fuck your jesus and fuck you the taxiwalla repeated bless you martin said even you and whatever you do to me is gods willthough you know not what you do most of all martin admired ignatius loyolas notable encounter with the moor on a mule and their ensuing discussion of the holy virgin the moor said he could believe that our lady had conceived without a man but he could not believe that shed remained a virgin after giving birth after the moor rode on young ignatius thought that he should hurry after the muslim and kill him he felt obliged to defend our ladys honor the defaming of the virgins postbirth vaginal condition was gross and unacceptable behavior ignatius as always sought gods will on the matter where the road parted he let his own mules reins go slack if the animal followed the moor ignatius would kill the infidel but the mule chose the other road and fuck your st ignatius the taxiwalla shouted st ignatius is where i would like to go martin replied calmly but take me where you will where they went the missionary believed would be gods will martin mills was just the passenger he thought of the late father de mellos renowned book christian exercises in eastern form so many of these exercises had helped him in the past for example there was that exercise which concerned the healing of hurtful memories whenever martin mills was troubled by the shame his parents had caused him or by his seeming inability to love and forgive and honor his parents he followed father de mellos exercise verbatim return to some unpleasant event such events were never hard to recall but the selection of which horror to revisit was always an arduous decision now place yourself before christ crucifiedthat always had a certain power even the depravities of veronica rose paled before such an agony even the selfdestruction of danny mills seemed a trifling pain keep commuting between the unpleasant event and the scene of jesus on the cross for years martin mills had engaged in such commuting father de mello was a hero to him he had been born in bombay and until his death was the director of the sadhana institute of pastoral counseling near poona it had been father de mello who had inspired martin mills to come to india now as the embracing darkness gradually yielded to the lights of bombay the bodies of the sidewalk sleepers appeared in mounds the moonlight glinted off mahim bay martin couldnt smell the horses as the taxi rocketed past the mahalaxmi race course but he could see the dark silhouette of haji alis tomb the slender minarets stood out against the fishscale glint of the arabian sea then the taxi veered away from the moonlit ocean and the missionary saw the sleeping city come to lifeif the eternal sexual activity of kamathipura could fairly be called life it wasnt a life that martin mills had ever knownit was nothing hed ever imaginedand he prayed that his brief glimpse of the muslim mausoleum wouldnt be the last holy edifice hed see in his allotted time on this mortal earth he saw the brothels overflowing into the little lanes he saw the sexstoned faces of the men let loose from the wetness cabaret the last show was over and the men who couldnt yet bear to go home were wandering and just when martin mills thought hed encountered a greater evil than st ignatius loyola had met on the streets of rome the taxiwalla jostled and edged his way into a darker hell there were suddenly those prostitutes in human cages on falkland road wont the cage girls just love to get a look at you cried bahadur who saw himself as inspector dhars designated persecutor martin mills remembered how ignatius had raised money among rich people and founded an asylum for fallen women it was in rome where the saint had announced that he would sacrifice his life if he could prevent the sins of a single prostitute on a single night thank you for bringing me here the missionary said to the taxiwalla who screeched to a halt in front of a compelling display of eunuchtransvestites in their cages bahadur assumed that the hijra prostitutes were by far the angriest at inspector dhar but to the taxiwallas surprise martin mills cheerfully opened the rear door and stepped into falkland road with a look of eager anticipation he took his heavy suitcase from the trunk and when the taxiwalla hurled the money for the fare at the missionarys feet and spat on itfor the trip from the airport had been prepaidmartin retrieved the wet money and handed it back to bahadur no noyouve done your job i am where i should be the missionary said a circle of pickpockets and street prostitutes with their pimps were slowly surrounding the scholastic but bahadur wanted the hijras to be certain to see their enemy and so he pushed against the gathering crowd dharinspector dhar dhar dhar the taxiwalla cried but this was entirely unnecessary for the word that dhar was on falkland road had traveled ahead of the taxiwallas cries martin mills quite easily made his own way through the crowd the degraded women in those cages were the ones he wished to address it never occurred to him of course that they werent really women please let me speak with you the missionary said to a transvestite in his cage most of the hijras were at first too stunned to attack the hated actor surely you must know of the diseasesnowadays of the certain death you are exposing yourselves to but i tell you if you want to be saved that is all you needto want to be two pickpockets and several pimps were fighting over the money that martin had tried to give back to the taxiwalla bahadur had already been beaten to his knees and several prostitutes continued to kick at him but martin mills was oblivious to what was behind him the apparent women in the cages faced him and it was only to them that he spoke st ignatius he said in mazagaon you must know it i can always be found there you have only to come there it is intriguing to imagine how father julian and father cecil might have responded to this generous invitation for surely the missions th jubilee would be a much more colorful celebration with the added presence of several eunuchtransvestite prostitutes in search of salvation unfortunately the father rector and the senior priest were not on hand to witness martin millss extraordinary proposition did martin suppose that if the prostitutes arrived at st ignatius during school hours the schoolchildren might benefit from the visible conversion of these fallen women if you feel but the slightest remorse you must take this as a sign that you can be saved the scholastic told them it wasnt a hijra who struck the first blow but one of the street prostitutes probably she was feeling ignored she shoved martin in the small of his back and he stumbled forward on one knee then the pimps and pickpockets pulled his suitcase away from himthat was when the hijras became involved after all dhar had been speaking to them they didnt want their territory or their vengeance trespassed oncertainly not by this common rabble off the street the transvestite prostitutes easily beat away the street prostitutes and their pimps and not even the pickpockets could escape with the heavy suitcase which the hijras opened for themselves they wouldnt touch the wrinkled black suit and the black shirts or the clerical collarsthese werent their stylebut the hawaiian shirts were appealing to them and they quickly took these then one of them stripped the shirt off martin mills being careful not to tear it and when the missionary was naked above his waist one of the hijras discovered the whip with the braided cords which was too tempting to ignore with the first of the stinging lashes from the whip martin lay on his stomach then he curled himself into a ball he wouldnt cover his face for it mattered too much to him that he clasped his hands together in prayer thus he maintained the extreme conviction that even such a beating as this was ad majorem dei gloriam to the greater glory of god the transvestite prostitutes were respectful of all the assembled evidence of education that was contained in the suitcase even in their excitement to each take a turn with the whip they wouldnt tear or wrinkle a page of a single book the leg iron however was misinterpreted by them as were the culpa beads a transvestite prostitute tried to eat the beads before he threw them away as for the leg iron the hijras didnt know it went around the thighor else they simply thought it would be more suitable to attach the device around inspector dhars neck which they did it wasnt too tight a fit but the wire prongs had raked the missionarys facethe hijras were so impatient that theyd scraped the leg iron over their victims headand now the prongs dug into martins throat which caused a multitude of minor cuts the missionarys torso was striped with blood gamely he tried to stand as he kept trying he faced the whip the transvestites stepped away from him for he wasnt behaving as theyd expected he didnt fight back he didnt beg for his life either it is you and everything that happens to you that i care for martin mills called to them though you revile me and i am nothing i want only for you to save yourselves i can show you how but only if you let me the hijras passed the whip but there was noticeably less enthusiasm among them when one would hold it he would quickly pass it on without taking a whack the raised red welts covered martins exposed fleshthey were especially startling on his faceand the blood from the wrongly placed leg iron streaked his chest he protected not himself but his books he closed the suitcase safely around these treasures of his learning and still he beseeched the prostitutes to join him take me to mazagaon he said to them take me to st ignatius and you shall also be welcome there to those few of them who understood what he said the concept was preposterous to their surprise the man before them was a physical weakling but his courage seemed unsurpassed it wasnt the kind of toughness theyd anticipated suddenly no one wanted to hurt him they hated him yet he made them feel ashamed but the street prostitutes and their pimps and the pickpocketsthey would have made short work of him just as soon as the hijras left him this was precisely when that familiar offwhite ambassador which all night had cruised between kamathipura and grant road and falkland road cruised by them again in the driversside window soberly looking them over was the driver they all thought of as dhars thug dwarf one can imagine vinods surprise upon seeing his famous client stripped of half his clothes and bloodied the wretched villains had even shaved off inspector dhars mustache this was a humiliation beyond the obvious pain that the beloved movie star had suffered and what ghastly instrument of torture had the filthy prostitutes fitted around the actors neck it looked like a dogs collar only the spikes were on the inside furthermore poor dhar was as pale and scrawny as a cadaver it looked like vinods famous client had lost pounds a pimp with a big brass ring of keys scratched a key against the driversside door of the ambassadorall the while meeting vinods eyes straight on he didnt see vinod reach under his specially constructed car seat where the dwarf driver kept a ready supply of squashracquet handles there was confusion regarding what happened next some claimed that the dwarfs taxi swerved and deliberately ran over the pimps foot others explained that the ambassador jumped the curb and that it was the panicked crowd that pushed the pimpeither way his foot was run over by the car all agreed that vinod was hard to see in the crowd he was so much shorter than everyone else his presence could be detected by the wary however for everywhere people were dropping from sight clutching their knees or their wrists and writhing on the garbagestrewn pavement vinod swung the squashracquet handles at a level equal to most peoples knees their cries commingled with the cries of the cage girls on falkland road continuously hawking their wares when martin mills saw the grim face of the dwarf who was whacking his way toward him the scholastic thought that his time had come he repeated what jesus said to pilate john my kingdom is not of this world then he turned to face the oncoming dwarf i forgive you martin said he bowed his head as if awaiting the executioners blow it didnt occur to him that if he hadnt bowed his head vinod never could have reached his head with the racquet handles but vinod simply grabbed the missionary by the rear pocket of his pants and steered him to the taxi when martin was rescuedpinned under the weight of his suitcase in the back seat of the carthe scholastic foolishly struggled albeit briefly to return to falkland road wait he cried i want my whipthats my whip vinod had already swung a racquet handle and cracked the wrist of the unfortunate hijra who was the last to hold the whip the dwarf easily retrieved martin millss mortification toy and handed it to him bless you the scholastic said the doors of the ambassador slammed solidly around him the sudden acceleration pressed him against the seat st ignatius he told the brutal driver vinod thought that dhar was praying which was dismaying to the dwarf because hed never thought of dhar as a religious man at the intersection of falkland road and grant road a boy who was a teaserver for one of the brothels threw a glass of tea at the passing taxi vinod just kept going although his stubby fingers reached under the car seat to reassure himself that the squashracquet handles were properly in place before the taxi turned onto marine drive vinod stopped the car and lowered the rear windows he knew how dhar enjoyed the smell of the sea you sure are fooling me vinod said to his battered client i am thinking you are sleeping the whole night on daruwallas balcony but the missionary was asleep in the rearview mirror the sight of him took vinods breath away it wasnt the lash marks on his swollen face or even his bare bloodied torso it was the spiked leg iron around his neck for the dwarf had seen the terrible depictions that the christians worshipedtheir gory versions of christ on the crossand to vinod it appeared that inspector dhar had undertaken the role of christ however his crown of thorns had slipped the cruel device gripped the famous actor by his throat all togetherin one small apartment as for dhar the real dhar a smog the consistency and color of egg whites had rolled over dr daruwallas balcony where the actor was still sleeping had he looked he couldnt have seen through this soupat least not six floors below him to the predawn sidewalk where vinod struggled with the movie stars semiconscious twin nor did dhar hear the predictable eruption from the firstfloor dogs vinod allowed the missionary to lean heavily on him while the dwarf dragged the suitcase carrying martin millss education across the lobby to the forbidden lift a firstfloor apartment owner a member of the residents society got a glimpse of the thug driver and his mangled companion before the elevator door closed martin mills even as mauled and mindless of his surroundings as he was was surprised by the elevator and the modernity of the apartment building for he knew that the mission school and its venerable church were years old the sound of savage dogs seemed out of place st ignatius the missionary asked the good samaritan midget you are not needing a saintyou are needing a doctor the dwarf told him actually i know a doctor in bombay hes a friend of my mother and fathera certain dr daruwalla martin mills said vinod was truly alarmed the lashes from the whip and even the bleeding from the leg iron around the poor mans neck seemed superficial but this incomprehensible muttering about dr daruwalla was an indication to vinod that the movie star was suffering from some sort of amnesia a serious head injury perhaps of course you are knowing dr daruwalla vinod shouted we are going to see dr daruwalla ah so you know him too said the astonished scholastic try to not be moving your head the worried dwarf replied in a reference to the echoing dogs which vinod completely failed to grasp martin mills said it sounds like a veterinariansi thought he was an orthopedist of course he is being an orthopedist vinod cried standing on tiptoe the dwarf tried to peer into martins ears as if he were expecting to see some stray brain matter there but vinod wasnt tall enough dr daruwalla woke to the distant orchestra of the dogs from the sixth floor their barks and howls were muted but nonetheless identifiable the doctor had no doubt as to the cause of their cacophony that damn dwarf he said aloud to which julia didnt respond she was familiar with the many things her husband said in his sleep but when farrokh got out of bed and put on his robe julia was instantly awake is it vinod again she asked him i assume so dr daruwalla replied it was a little before in the morning when the doctor crept past the closed slidingglass doors that led to the balcony which was completely enveloped in a mournfullooking mist the smog had mingled with a dense sea fog the doctor couldnt see dhars cot or the tortoise mosquito coils with which the actor surrounded himself whenever he slept on the balcony in the foyer farrokh seized a dusty umbrella he was hoping to give vinod a good scare then the doctor opened his apartment door the dwarf and the missionary had just exited from the lift when dr daruwalla first saw martin mills the doctor feared that dhar had violently shaved off his mustache in the smogthus inflicting on himself a multitude of razor cutsand then doubtless depressed the muchreviled actor had jumped off the sixthfloor balcony as for the missionary he was taken aback to see a man in a black kimono holding a black umbrellaan ominous image but the umbrella was undaunting to vinod who slipped close to dr daruwalla and whispered i am finding him preaching to transvestite prostitutesthe hijras are almost killing him farrokh knew who martin mills was as soon as the missionary spoke i believe youve met my mother and fathermy name is martin martin mills please come inive been expecting you dr daruwalla said taking the beaten mans arm you have said martin mills there is being brain damage vinod whispered to the doctor who supported the wobbly missionary into the bathroom where he told martin to strip then the doctor prepared an epsomsalts bath while the bath was filling farrokh got julia out of bed and told her to get rid of vinod whos taking a bath at this hour she asked her husband its john ds twin dr daruwalla said free will julia had managed to coax vinod no farther than the foyer when the phone rang she answered quickly vinod could hear the entire conversation because the man on the other end of the phone was screaming it was mr munim the firstfloor member of the residents society i saw him getting on the lift he woke all the dogs i saw himyour dwarf mr munim shouted julia said i beg your pardonwe dont own a dwarf you dont fool me mr munim hollered that movie stars dwarfthats who i mean we dont own a movie star either julia told him you are violating a stated rule mr munim screamed i dont know what you meanyou must be out of your mind julia replied the taxiwalla used the liftthat midget thug mr munim cried dont make me call the police julia said then she hung up i am using the stairs but they are making me limpthe whole six floors vinod said martyrdom strangely suited him julia thought but she realized that vinod was lingering in the foyer for a purpose there are being five umbrellas in your umbrella stand the dwarf observed would you like to borrow one vinod julia asked him only for helping me on the stairs vinod replied i am needing a cane hed left the squashracquet handles in his taxi were he to encounter either a firstfloor dog or mr munim vinod wanted a weapon therefore he took an umbrella with him julia let him out the kitchen door which led to the back stairs maybe you are never seeing me again vinod told her as the dwarf peered down the stairwell julia noticed that he was slightly shorter than the umbrella that hed chosen vinod had taken the biggest umbrella in the bathtub martin mills looked as if he welcomed the stings from his raised red welts and he never flinched while dr daruwalla sponged off the multitude of minor wounds caused by the gruesome leg iron the doctor thought that the missionary appeared to miss the leg iron after it had been removed and martin twice expressed concern that hed left his whip in the heroic dwarfs car vinod will surely return it to you dr daruwalla said the doctor was not as amazed by the missionarys story as the missionary himself was amazed given the magnitude of the mistaken identity dr daruwalla was astonished that martin mills was still alivenot to mention that his wounds were minor and the more the missionary babbled on and on about his experience the less he bore any resemblance in farrokhs eyes to his taciturn twin dhar didnt babble well i mean i knew i wasnt among christians martin mills said but still i hardly expected the violent hostility toward christianity that i encountered now nowi wouldnt jump to that conclusion dr daruwalla cautioned the agitated scholastic there is some sensitivity however toward proselytizing of any kind saving souls is not proselytizing martin mills said defensively well as you say you were not exactly in christian territory dr daruwalla replied how many of those prostitutes are carrying the aids virus martin asked im an orthopedist the doctor reminded the scholastic but people who know say forty percentsome say sixty either way said martin mills thats christian territory for the first time farrokh considered that the madman before him posed a threat to himself that might exceed the danger presented by his striking resemblance to inspector dhar but i thought you were an english teacher said dr daruwalla as a former student of the place i can assure you st ignatius is first and foremost a school the doctor knew the father rector dr daruwalla could well anticipate that this was precisely what father julian would have to say about the matter of saving prostitutes souls but as farrokh watched martin step naked from the bathwhereupon unmindful of his wounds the missionary began to vigorously towel himself drythe doctor further anticipated that the father rector and all the aged defenders of the faith at st ignatius would have a hard time convincing such a zealous scholastic as this that his duties were restricted to improving the english of the upper classes for as he rubbed and rubbed the towel against the lash marks until his face and torso were striped as bright red as when the whip had only just struck him martin mills was all the while thinking of a reply like the crafty jesuit that he was he began his answer with a question arent you a christian the missionary asked the doctor i believe my father said you were converted but that youre not a roman catholic yes thats true dr daruwalla replied cautiously he gave martin mills a clean pair of his best silk pajamas but the scholastic preferred to stand naked are you familiar with the calvinist jansenist position in regard to free will martin asked farrokh im greatly oversimplifying but this was that dispute born of luther and those protestant divines of the reformationnamely the idea that were doomed by original sin and can expect salvation only through divine grace luther denied that good works could contribute to our salvation calvin further denied that our faith could save us according to calvin we are all predestined to be savedor not do you believe that by the way the logic of the jesuit was leaning farrokh guessed that he should not believe that and so he said nonot exactly well goodthen youre not a jansenist the scholastic said they were very discouragingtheir doctrine of grace over that of free will was quite defeatist really they made us all feel that there was absolutely nothing we could do to be savedin short why bother with good works and so what if we sin are you still oversimplifying asked dr daruwalla the jesuit regarded the doctor with sly respect he also took this interruption as a useful time in which to put on the doctors silk pajamas if youre suggesting that its almost impossible to reconcile the concept of free will with our belief in an omnipotent and omniscient god i agree with youits difficult martin said the question of the relationship between human will and divine omnipotence is that your question dr daruwalla guessed that this should be his question and so he said yessomething like that well that really is an interesting question the jesuit said i just hate it when people try to reduce the spiritual world with purely mechanical theoriesthose behaviorists for example who cares about loebs plantlice theories or pavlovs dog dr daruwalla nodded but he didnt dare speak hed never heard of plant lice hed heard of pavlovs dog of course he could even recall what made the dog salivate and what the saliva meant we must seem excessively strict to youwe catholics to you protestants i mean martin said dr daruwalla shook his head oh yes we do the missionary said we are a theology of rewards and punishments which are meted out in the life after death compared to you we make much of sin we jesuits however tend to minimize those sins of thought as opposed to those of deed interjected dr daruwalla for although this was obvious and totally unnecessary to say the doctor felt that only a fool would have nothing to say and hed been saying nothing to usto us catholics i meanyou protestants appear at times to overemphasize the human propensity toward evil and here the missionary paused but dr daruwalla unsure whether he should nod or shake his head just stared stupidly at the bathwater spiraling down the drain as if the water were his own thoughts escaping him do you know leibniz the jesuit suddenly asked him well in university but that was years ago the doctor said the leibniz assumption is that mans freedom was not taken from him by his fall which makes leibniz quite a friend of oursof us jesuits i mean martin said there is some leibniz i can never forget such as although the impulse and the help come from god they are at all times accompanied by a certain cooperation of man himself if not we could not say that we had actedbut you agree dont you yes of course said dr daruwalla well you see thats why i cant be just an english teacher the jesuit replied naturally i shall endeavor to improve the childrens englishand to the most perfect degree possible but given that i am free to actalthough the impulse and the help come from god of coursei must do what i can not only to save my soul but to rescue the souls of others i see said dr daruwalla who was also beginning to understand why the enraged transvestite prostitutes had failed to make much of a dent in the flesh or the indomitable will of martin mills furthermore the doctor found that he was standing in his own living room and watching martin lie down on the couch without the slightest recollection of having left the bathroom that was when the missionary handed the leg iron to the doctor who received the instrument reluctantly i can see i will not be needing this here the scholastic said there will be sufficient adversity without it st ignatius loyola also changed his mind in regard to these weapons of mortification he did said farrokh i think he overused thembut only out of a positive abhorrence of his earlier sins the jesuit said in fact in the later version of the spiritual exercises st ignatius urges against such scourges of the fleshhe is also opposed to heavy fasting so am i said dr daruwalla who didnt know what to do with the cruel leg iron please throw it away martin said to him and perhaps youd be so kind as to tell the dwarf to keep the whipi dont want it dr daruwalla knew all about vinods racquet handles the prospect of what use the dwarf might make of the whip was chilling then the doctor noticed that martin mills had fallen asleep with his fingers interlocked on his chest and with an utterly beatific expression the missionary resembled a martyr en route to the heavenly kingdom farrokh brought julia into the living room to see him at first she wouldnt approach past the glasstopped tableshe viewed him as one might view a contaminated corpsebut the doctor encouraged her to take a closer look the nearer julia drew to martin mills the more relaxed she became it was as ifat least when he was asleepmartin had a pacifying effect on everyone around him eventually julia sat on the floor beside the couch she would say later that he reminded her of john d as a much younger more carefree man although farrokh maintained that martin mills was simply the result of no weight lifting and no beermeaning that he had no muscles but that he had no belly either without remembering when he sat down the doctor found himself on the floor beside his wife they were both sitting beside the couch as if transfixed by the sleeping body when dhar came in from the balcony to have a shower and to brush his teeth from dhars perspective farrokh and julia appeared to be praying then the movie star saw the dead personat least the person looked dead to dharand without taking too close a look he said whos that farrokh and julia were shocked that john d didnt immediately recognize his twin after all an actor is especially familiar with his own facial featuresand under a variety of makeup including the radical altering of his agebut dhar had never seen such an expression on his own face its doubtful that dhars face ever reflected beatification for not even in his sleep had inspector dhar imagined the happiness of heaven dhar had many expressions but none of them was saintly finally the actor whispered well okay i see who it is but whats he doing here is he going to die hes trying to be a priest farrokh whispered jesus christ john d said either he should have whispered or else the particular name he spoke was one that martin mills was prone to hear a smile of such immense gratitude crossed the missionarys sleeping face that dhar and the daruwallas felt suddenly ashamed without a word to one another they tiptoed into the kitchen as if they were unanimously embarrassed that theyd been spying on a sleeping man what truly had disturbed them and had made them feel as if they didnt belong where they were was the utter contentment of a man momentarily at peace with his soulalthough none of them could have identified what it was that so upset them whats wrong with him dhar asked nothings wrong with him dr daruwalla said then he wondered why hed said that about a man whod been whipped and beaten while he was proselytizing among transvestite prostitutes i should have told you he was coming the doctor added sheepishly to which john d merely rolled his eyes his anger was often understated julia rolled her eyes too as far as im concerned farrokh said to john d its entirely your decision as to whether or not you want to let him know that you exist although i dont know if now would be the right time to tell him forget about now dhar said tell me what hes like dr daruwalla could not utter the first word that came to his lipsthe word was crazy on second thought he almost said like you except that he talks but this was such a contradictory conceptthe very idea of a dhar who talked might be insulting to dhar i said whats he like john d repeated i saw him only when he was asleep julia told john d both of them were staring at farrokh whose mindon the matter of what martin mills was likewas truly blank not a single picture came to his mind although the missionary had managed to argue with him lecture to him and even educate himand most of this had transpired while the zealot was naked hes somewhat zealous the doctor offered cautiously zealous said dhar liebchen is that all you can say julia asked farrokh i heard him talking and talking in the bathroom he must have been saying something in the bathroom john d asked hes very determined farrokh blurted i guess that would follow from being zealous said inspector dhar he was at his most sarcastic it was exasperating to dr daruwalla that they expected him to be able to summarize the jesuits character on the basis of this one peculiar meeting the doctor didnt know the history of that other zealotthe greatest zealot of the th century st ignatius loyolawho had so inspired martin mills when ignatius died without ever having permitted a portrait of himself to be painted the brothers of the order sought to have a portrait made of the dead man a famous painter tried and failed the disciples declared that the death mask which was the work of an unknown was also not the true face of the father of the jesuits three other artists tried and failed to capture him but they had only the death mask for their model it was finally decided that god did not wish for ignatius loyola his servant to be painted dr daruwalla couldnt have known how greatly martin mills loved this story but it doubtless would have pleased the new missionary to see how the doctor struggled to describe even such a fledgling servant of god as this mere scholastic farrokh felt the right word come to his lips but then it escaped him hes well educated farrokh managed to say both john d and julia groaned well damn it hes complicated dr daruwalla shouted its too soon to know what hes like ssshhh youll wake him up julia told farrokh if its too soon to know what hes like john d said then its too soon for me to know if i want to meet him dr daruwalla was irritated he felt that this was a typical inspector dhar thing to say julia knew what her husband was thinking hold your tongue she told him she made coffee for herself and john dfor farrokh she made a pot of tea together the daruwallas watched their beloved movie star leave by the kitchen door dhar liked to use the back stairs so that he wouldnt be seen the early morningit wasnt quite was one of the few times he could walk from marine drive to the taj without being recognized and surrounded at that hour only the beggars would hassle him they hassled everyone equally it simply didnt matter to the beggars that he was inspector dhar many beggars went to the cinema but what did a movie star matter to them standing still an exercise at exactly in the morning when farrokh and julia were sharing a bath togethershe soaped his back he soaped her breasts but there was no more extensive hankypanky than thatmartin mills awoke to the soothing sounds of dr aziz the praying urologist praise be to allah lord of creationdr azizs incantations to allah drifted upward from his fifthfloor balcony and brought the new missionary instantly to his feet although hed been asleep for less than an hour the jesuit felt as refreshed as a normal man who had slept the whole night through thus invigorated he bounded to dr daruwallas balcony where he could oversee the morning ritual that urology aziz enacted on his prayer rug from the vantage point of the daruwallas sixthfloor apartment the view of back bay was stunning martin mills could see malabar hill and nariman point in the distance a small city of people had already congregated on chowpatty beach but the jesuit had not come to bombay for the view he followed the prayers of dr aziz with the keenest concentration there was always something one could learn from the holiness of others martin mills did not take prayer for granted he knew that prayer wasnt the same as thinking nor was it an escape from thinking it was never as simple as mere asking instead it was the seeking of instruction for to know gods will was martins hearts desire and to attain such a state of perfectiona union with god in mystical ecstasyrequired the patience of a corpse watching urology aziz roll up his prayer rug martin mills knew it was the perfect time for him to practice another exercise of father de mellos christian exercises in eastern formnamely stillness most people didnt appreciate how impossible it was to stand absolutely still it could be painful too but martin was good at it he stood so still that minutes later a passing forktailed kite almost landed on his head it wasnt because the missionary so much as blinked that the bird suddenly veered away from him the light that was reflected in the brightness of the missionarys eyes frightened the bird away meanwhile dr daruwalla was tearing through his hate mail wherein he found a troubling tworupee note the envelope was addressed to inspector dhar in care of the film studio typed on the serialnumber side of the money in capital letters was this warning youre as dead as lal the doctor would show this to deputy commissioner patel of course but farrokh felt he didnt need the detectives confirmation in order to know that the typist was the same lunatic whod typed the message on the money found in mr lals mouth then julia burst into the bedroom shed peeked into the living room to see if martin mills was still sleeping but he wasnt on the couch the slidingglass doors to the balcony were open but shed not seen the missionary on the balconyhe was standing so still shed missed him dr daruwalla stuffed the tworupee note into his pocket and rushed to the balcony by the time the doctor got there the missionary had moved ahead to a new prayer tacticthis one being one of father de mellos exercises in the area of body sensations and thought control martin would lift his right foot move it forward then put it down as he did this he would chant lifting lifting lifting and then naturally moving moving moving and finally placing placing placing in short he was merely walking across the balcony but with an exaggerated slownessall the while exclaiming aloud his exact movements to dr daruwalla martin mills resembled a patient in physical therapysomeone recovering from a recent strokefor the missionary appeared to be teaching himself how to speak and walk at the same time with only modest success farrokh tiptoed back to the bedroom and julia perhaps ive underestimated his injuries the doctor said ill have to take him to the office with me at least for a while its best to keep an eye on him but when the daruwallas cautiously approached the jesuit he was dressed in clerical garb he was looking through his suitcase they took only my culpa beads and my casual clothes martin remarked ill have to buy some cheap local wearit would be ostentatious to show up at st ignatius looking like this whereupon he laughed and plucked at his startlingly white collar it certainly wont do to have him walking around bombay like this dr daruwalla thought what was required was the sort of clothing that would allow the madman somehow to fit in possibly i could arrange to shave his head the doctor thought julia simply gaped at martin mills but as soon as he began to relate again the tale of his introduction to the city he completely charmed her and she became as alternately flirtatious and shy as a schoolgirl for a man whod taken a vow of chastity the jesuit was remarkably at ease with womenat least with an older woman dr daruwalla thought the complexities of the day ahead for dr daruwalla were almost as frightening to the doctor as the thought of spending the next hours in the missionarys discarded leg ironor being followed around by vinod with the angry dwarf wielding the missionarys whip there was no time to lose while julia fixed a cup of coffee for martin farrokh glanced hurriedly at the library collected in the jesuits suitcase father de mellos sadhana a way to god drew a particularly covert look for in it farrokh found a dogeared page and an assertively underlined sentence one of the biggest enemies to prayer is nervous tension i guess thats why i cant do it dr daruwalla thought in the lobby the doctor and the missionary didnt escape the notice of that firstfloor member of the residents society the murderous mr munim so there is your movie star where is your dwarf mr munim shouted pay no attention to this man farrokh told martin hes completely crazy the dwarf is in the suitcase mr munim cried thereupon he kicked the scholastics suitcase which was ill considered because he was wearing only a floppy pair of the most insubstantial sandals from the instant expression of pain on mr munims face it was clear that hed made contact with one of the more solid tomes in martin millss librarymaybe the compact dictionary of the bible which was compact but not soft i assure you sir there is no dwarf in this suitcase martin mills began to say but dr daruwalla pulled him on the doctor was beginning to realize that it was the new missionarys most basic inclination to talk to anyone in the alley they found vinod asleep in the ambassador the dwarf had locked the car leaning against the driversside door was the exact anyone whom dr daruwalla most feared for the doctor imagined there was no one more inspiring of missionary zeal than a crippled child unless thered been a child missing both arms and both legs by the shine of excitement in the scholastics eyes farrokh could tell that the boy with the mangled foot was sufficiently inspiring to martin mills birdshit boy it was the beggar from the day beforethe boy who stood on his head at chowpatty beach the cripple who slept in the sand the crushed right foot was once again an offense to the doctors standard of surgical neatness but martin mills was fatally drawn to the rheumy discharge about the beggars eyes to his missionary mind it was as if the stricken child already clutched a crucifix the scholastic only momentarily took his eyes off the boyto glance heavenwardbut that was long enough for the little beggar to fool martin with the infamous bombay birdshit trick in dr daruwallas experience it was a filthy trick usually performed in the following fashion while one hand pointed to the skyto the nonexistent passing birdthe other hand of the little villain squirted your shoe or your pants the instrument that applied the presumed bird shit was similar to a turkey baster but any kind of bulb with a syringelike nozzle would suffice the fluid it contained was some whitish stuffoften curdled milk or flour and waterbut on your shoe or your pants it appeared to be bird shit when you looked down from the sky having failed to see the bird there was the shitit had already hit youand the sneaky little beggar was wiping it off your shoe or your pants with a handy rag you then rewarded him with at least a rupee or two but in this instance martin mills didnt comprehend that a reward was expected hed looked in a heavenly direction without the boy needing to point thereupon the beggar had drawn out the syringe and squirted the jesuits scuffed black shoe the cripple was so quick on the draw and so smooth at concealing the syringe under his shirt that dr daruwalla had seen neither the quick draw nor the shotonly the slick return to the shirt martin mills believed that a bird had unceremoniously shat on his shoe and that the tragically mutilated boy was wiping off this bird shit with the tattered leg of his baggy shorts to the missionary this maimed child was definitely heavensent with that in mind there in the alley the scholastic dropped to his knees which wasnt the usual response that was made to the outstretched hand of the beggar the boy was frightened by the missionarys embrace o godthank you martin mills cried while the cripple looked to dr daruwalla for help this is your lucky day the missionary told the greatly bewildered beggar that man is a doctor martin mills told the lame boy that man can fix your foot i cant fix his foot dr daruwalla cried dont tell him that well certainly you can make it look better than this martin replied the cripple crouched like a cornered animal his eyes darting back and forth between the two men its not as if i havent already thought of it farrokh said defensively but im sure i cant give him a foot that works and what do you think a boy like this cares for the appearance of the thing hell still limp wouldnt you like your foot to be cleanerlooking martin mills asked the cripple wouldnt you like it to look less like a hoe or a club as he spoke he cupped his hand near the bony fusion of ankle and foot which the beggar awkwardly rested on the heel close up the doctor could confirm his earlier suspicion he would have to saw through bone there would be little chance of success a greater chance of risk primum non nocere farrokh said to martin mills i presume you know latin above all do no harm the jesuit replied he was stepped on by an elephant dr daruwalla explained then farrokh remembered what the cripple had said dr daruwalla repeated this to the missionary but the doctor looked at the boy when he spoke you cant fix what elephants do the boy nodded albeit cautiously do you have a mother or a father the jesuit asked the beggar shook his head does anyone look after you martin asked the cripple shook his head again dr daruwalla knew it was impossible to understand how much the boy understood but the doctor remembered that the boys english was better than he was letting ona clever boy theres a gang of them at chowpatty the doctor said theres a kind of pecking order to their begging but martin mills wasnt listening to him although the zealot manifested a certain modesty of the eyes which was encouraged among the jesuits there was nonetheless an intensity to his gazing into the rheumy eyes of the crippled child dr daruwalla realized that the boy was mesmerized but there is someone looking after you the missionary said to the beggar slowly the cripple nodded do you have any other clothes but these the missionary asked no clothes the boy instantly said he was undersized but hardened by the street life maybe he was or and how long has it been since youve had any foodsince youve had a lot of food martin asked him long time the beggar said at the most he might have been you cant do this martin farrokh said in bombay there are more boys like this than would fit into all of st ignatius they wouldnt fit in the school or in the church or in the cloisterthey wouldnt fit in the schoolyard or in the parking lot there are too many boys like thisyou cant begin your first day here by adopting them not themjust this one the missionary replied st ignatius said that he would sacrifice his life if he could prevent the sins of a single prostitute on a single night oh i see said dr daruwalla i understand youve already tried that its very simple really said martin mills i was going to buy clothesill buy half as many for me and the rest for him i presume that i will eat something sometime later today ill eat half as much as i normally would have eaten anddont tell methe rest is for him dr daruwalla said angrily oh this is brilliant i wonder why i didnt think of it years ago everything is just a start the jesuit calmly replied nothing is overwhelming if you take one step at a time then he stood up with the child in his arms leaving his suitcase for dr daruwalla to deal with he walked with the boy circling vinods taxi as the dwarf slept on and on lifting lifting lifting martin mills said moving moving moving he repeated placing placing placing the missionary said the boy thought this was a gamehe laughed you see hes happy martin mills announced first the clothes then the food thenif not the footyou can at least do something about his eyes cant you im not an eye doctor dr daruwalla replied eye diseases are common here i could refer him to someone well thats a start isnt it martin said were just going to get you started he told the cripple dr daruwalla pounded on the driversside window startling vinod awake the dwarfs stubby fingers were groping for his squashracquet handles before he recognized the doctor vinod hurried to unlock the car if in the light of day the dwarf saw that martin mills bore a lessthanexact resemblance to his famous twin vinod gave no indication of any suspicion not even the missionarys clerical collar appeared to faze the dwarf if dhar looked different to vinod the dwarf assumed this was the result of being beaten by transvestite whores furiously farrokh threw the fools suitcase into the trunk there was no time to lose the doctor realized that he had to get martin mills to st ignatius as soon as he could father julian and the others would lock him up martin would have to obey themafter all wasnt that what a vow of obedience meant the doctors advice to the father rector would be simple enough keep martin mills in the mission or keep him in school dont let him loose in the rest of bombay the chaos he could cause was inconceivable as vinod backed the ambassador out of the alley dr daruwalla saw that both the scholastic and the crippled child were smiling that was when farrokh thought of the word that had escaped him it floated to his lips in belated answer to john ds question regarding what martin mills was like the word was dangerous the doctor couldnt stop himself from saying it you know what you are dr daruwalla asked the missionary youre dangerous thank you the jesuit said there was no further conversation until the dwarf was struggling to park the taxi on that busy stretch of cross maidan near the bombay gymkhana dr daruwalla was taking martin mills and the cripple to fashion street where they could buy the cheapest cotton clothesfactory seconds with small defectswhen the doctor caught sight of the gob of fake bird shit that had hardened on the strap of his right sandal farrokh could feel that a bit of the stuff had also dried between his bare toes the boy must have squirted dr daruwalla while the doctor and the scholastic had been arguing although the doctor supposed there was a slim possibility that the bird shit was authentic whats your name the missionary asked the beggar ganesh the boy replied after the elephantheaded godthe most popular god in maharashtra dr daruwalla explained to martin mills it was the name of every other boy on chowpatty beach ganeshmay i call you birdshit boy farrokh asked the beggar but there was no reading the deepblack eyes that flashed in the cripples feral face either he didnt understand or he thought it was politic to remain silenta clever boy you certainly shouldnt call him birdshit boy the missionary protested ganesh said dr daruwalla i think you are dangerous too ganesh the black eyes moved quickly to martin mills then they fixed once again on farrokh thank you ganesh said vinod had the last word unlike the missionary the dwarf was not automatically moved to pity cripples you birdshit boy vinod said you are definitely being dangerous the dwarf told him mr gargs girl a little something venereal deepa had taken the night train to bombay shed traveled from somewhere in gujaratfrom wherever the great blue nile was playing shed arranged to bring the runaway child prostitute to dr daruwallas office at the hospital for crippled children intending to shepherd the girl through her examinationit was the childs first doctors visit deepa didnt expect there would be anything wrong she planned to take the girl back to the great blue nile with her it was true that the child had run away from a brothel butaccording to mr gargshed managed to run away when she was still a virgin dr daruwalla didnt think so her name was madhu which means honey she had the floppy oversized hands and feet and the disproportionately small body of a largepawed puppy of the kind one always assumes will become a big dog but in madhus case this was a sign of malnutrition her body had failed to develop in proportion to her hands and feet also madhus head wasnt as large as it appeared at first glance her long oval face was simply unmatched to her petite body her protuberant eyes were the tawny yellow of a lions but remote with distraction her lips were full and womanly and entirely too grownup for her unformed face which was still the face of a child it was her childwoman appearance that must have been madhus particular appeal in the brothel shed run away from her undersized body reflected this disquieting ambivalence she had no hipsthat is she had the hips of a boybut her breasts which were absurdly small were nonetheless as fully formed and womanly as her compelling mouth although garg had told deepa that the child was prepubescent dr daruwalla guessed that madhu had not yet had her period because shed never had enough to eat and she was overworked furthermore it was not that the girl hadnt grown any underarm or pubic hairsomeone had skillfully shaved her farrokh made deepa feel the faint stubble that was growing in madhus armpits the doctors memory of his accidental encounter with deepas pudenda surfaced at the oddest times the sight of the dwarfs wife touching the hollow of the young girls armpit gave farrokh the shivers it was the wiry strength of the former flyers hand that the doctor rememberedhow shed grabbed his chin as hed struggled to raise the bridge of his nose off her pubic bone how shed simply wrenched his head out of her crotch and he was off balance his forehead pressing into her belly and the scratchy sequins on her singlet so that a good portion of his weight rested on her yet deepa had cranked on his chin with only one hand and had managed to lift him her hands were strong from the trapeze work and now the sight of deepas sinewy hand in the girls armpit was enough to make farrokh turn awaynot from the exposed girl but from deepa farrokh realized that probably there remained more innocence in deepa than what innocence if any remained in madhu the dwarfs wife had never been a prostitute the indifference with which madhu had undressed for dr daruwallas cursory examination made the doctor feel that the girl was probably an experienced prostitute farrokh knew how awkwardly most children madhus age undressed after all it wasnt only that he was a doctor he had daughters madhu was silent perhaps she didnt comprehend the reason for her physical exam or else she was ashamed when she covered her breasts and held her hand over her mouth madhu looked like an yearold child but dr daruwalla believed that the girl was at least or im sure it was someone else who shaved hershe didnt shave herself farrokh told deepa from his research for inspector dhar and the cagegirl killer the doctor knew a few things about the brothels in the brothels virginity was a term of salenot one of accuracy maybe in order to look like a virgin one had to be shaved the doctor knew that most of the older prostitutes were also shaved pubic hair like underarm hair was simply an invitation to lice the dwarfs wife was disappointed shed hoped that dr daruwalla was going to be the first and last doctor whom madhu would be required to see dr daruwalla didnt think so he found madhu disturbingly mature not even to please deepa could he give the girl a clean bill of health not without first making madhu see gynecology tatatata two as he was more commonly known dr tata the son was not the best obgyn in bombay butlike his father before himhe saw any referral from any other physician immediately it had long been dr daruwallas suspicion that these referrals were the heart of tata twos business farrokh doubted that many patients were inclined to see tata two twice despite removing the adjectival best and most famous from his clinics descriptionit was now called dr tatas clinic for gynecological maternity needsthe clinic was the most steadfastly mediocre in the city if one of his orthopedic patients had a problem of an obgyn nature dr daruwalla never would have referred her to tata two but for a routine examinationfor a simple certificate of health or a standard venerealdisease screeningtata two would do and tata two was fast he was remarkably fast in madhus case while vinod drove deepa and madhu to dr tatas office where dr tata would keep them waiting only a short time farrokh attempted to restrain martin mills from playing too zealous a role in embracing that cause which the dwarf and his wife practiced like a religion having observed the scholastics compassion for the elephantfooted beggar vinod had wasted little time in enlisting the famous inspector dhars services unfortunately it had been impossible to conceal from the missionary that the only uncrippled child in dr daruwallas waiting room was or had been a child prostitute even before dr daruwalla could complete his examination of madhu the damage had been done martin mills had been totally swayed by vinod and deepas insane idea that every runaway from the brothels of bombay could become an acrobat in the circus to martin sending child prostitutes to the circus was a step en route to saving their souls farrokh feared what was coming nextthat is as soon as it occurred to martin it was only a matter of time before the missionary would decide that ganesh the elephantfooted boy could save his little soul at the circus too dr daruwalla knew there werent enough circuses for all the children that the jesuit believed he could rescue then dr tata called with the news about madhu yes she is certainly sexually activetoo many previous partners to countand yes she has a little something venereal said tata two but under the circumstances it could be a lot worse and youll check if shes hivpositive asked dr daruwalla were checkingwell let you know dr tata said so what have you found farrokh asked is it gonorrhea no but theres some inflammation of the cervix and a slight discharge dr tata explained she doesnt complain of any urethritisthe inflammation in her urethra is so mild it may go unnoticed im guessing its chlamydia ill put her on a course of tetracycline but its difficult to diagnose a chlamydial infectionas you know chlamydiae are not visible under the microscope yes yes said dr daruwalla impatiently he didnt know this about chlamydiae but he didnt care to know he had been lectured to enough for one day commencing with a rehashing of the protestant reformation and the jesuitical approach to free will all he wanted to know was if madhu was sexually active and might there be something venereal that he could pin on the acidscarred mr garg all of mr gargs previous discoveries had carried something venereal the doctor would have loved to attribute the blame for this to garg himself farrokh didnt believe that the cause of the sexually transmitted disease was always the brothel that the girl was running away from most of alland the doctor couldnt have explained whyit was deepa and vinods seemingly good opinion of mr garg that dr daruwalla wished he could change why didnt the dwarf and his wife see that mr garg was egregiously slimy so if shes not hivpositive youll call her clean farrokh asked tata two after the course of tetracycline and provided no one lets her return to the brothel dr tata said and provided deepa doesnt take the girl back to the wetness cabaret or to mr garg farrokh thought dr daruwalla understood that deepa would need to return to the great blue nile before the doctor knew the results of madhus hiv test vinod would have to look after madhu and keep her away from garg the girl would be safe with the dwarf meanwhile the doctor could observe that the morally meddlesome nature of martin mills had been momentarily curbed the missionary was enthralled by farrokhs favorite circus photographthe doctor always kept it on his office desk it was a picture of pratap singhs adopted sister suman the star of the great royal circus suman was in her costume for the peacock dance she stood in the wing of the main tent helping two little girls into their peacock costumes the peacocks were always played by little girls suman was putting on their peacock heads she was tucking their hair under the bluegreen feathers of the long peacock necks the peacock dance was performed in all the indian circuses the peacock is the national bird of india in the great royal suman always played the legendary woman whose lover has been cast under a spell to make him forget her in the moonlight she dances with two peacocks she wears bells on her ankles and wrists but what haunted dr daruwalla about the peacock dance was neither sumans beauty nor the little girls in their peacock costumes instead it always seemed to him that the little girls the peacocks were about to die the music for the dance was soft and eerie and the lions were audible in the background in the darkness outside the ring the lions were being moved from their cages and into the holding tunnel which was a long tubular cage that led to the ring the lions hated the holding tunnel they fought among themselves because they were pressed too low to the ground they could neither go back to their cages nor advance into the ring farrokh had always imagined that a lion would escape when the peacock girls were finished with their dance and running back to their troupe tentthere in the dark avenue the escaped lion would catch them and kill them after the peacock dance the roustabouts set up the cage for the lions in the ring to distract the audience from the tedious assembly of the cage and the setting up of the hoops of fire a motorcycle act was performed in the open wing of the main tent it was so insanely loud no one would hear the peacock girls screaming if a lion was loose the motorcycles raced in opposite directions inside a steelmesh ball this was called the globe of death because if the motorcycles ever collided it was possible that both riders could be killed but dr daruwalla imagined it was called the globe of death because the sound of the motorcycles concealed the fate of the peacock girls the first time hed seen suman she was helping the little girls into their peacock costumes she seemed to be a mother to them although she had no children of her own but it also seemed to farrokh that suman was dressing the little girls for the last time they would run out of the ring the globe of death would begin and the escaped lion would already be waiting for them in the dark avenue of the troupe tents maybe if she wasnt hivpositive madhu would become one of the peacock girls at the great blue nile either way whether she was hivpositive or a peacock girl dr daruwalla thought that madhus chances were pretty slim gargs girls were always in need of more than a dose of tetracycline martin luther is put to dubious use martin mills had insisted on observing dr daruwalla at his doctors chores for the zealot had proclaimedeven before he saw a single one of dr daruwallas patientsthat the doctor was performing the lords work after all what activity was nearer to jesus than healing crippled children it was right up there with saving their little souls farrokh guessed dr daruwalla had allowed the missionary to follow him as closely as his own shadow but only because he wanted to observe how the zealot was recovering from his beating the doctor had alertly anticipated any indications that the scholastic might have suffered a serious head injury but martin mills was ploddingly disproving this theory martins particular madness seemed in no way traumarelated rather it appeared to be the result of blind conviction and a systematic education furthermore after their experience on fashion street dr daruwalla didnt dare let martin mills wander freely in bombay yet the doctor hadnt found the time to deliver the madman to the presumed safety of st ignatius on fashion street martin mills had been completely unaware of that giant likeness of inspector dhar which was freshly plastered above the stalls of the clothes bazaar the missionary had noticed the other movie advertisement side by side with inspector dhar and the towers of silence was a poster for death wish with a sizable likeness of charles branson that looks like charles bronson the jesuit had observed that is charles bronson farrokh had informed him but of himself in the image of inspector dhar the missionary saw no resemblance the clothes vendors however looked upon the jesuit with baleful eyes one refused to sell him anything the scholastic assumed that the merchant had nothing in the right size another screamed at martin mills that his appearance on fashion street was nothing but a filmpublicity stunt this was probably because the missionary insisted on carrying the crippled beggar the accusation had been made in marathi and the elephantfooted boy had enlivened the exchange by spitting on a rack of the merchants clothes now noweven though they revile you simply smile martin mills had told the crippled boy show them charity the jesuit must have assumed it was ganesh and his crushed foot that had caused the outburst it was a wonder theyd escaped from fashion street with their lives dr daruwalla had also managed to persuade martin mills to get his hair cut it was short enough to begin with but the doctor had said something about the weather growing hotter and hotter and that in india many ascetics and holy men shaved their heads the haircut that farrokh had arrangedwith one of those threerupee curbside barbers who hang out at the end of the clothing stalls on fashion streethad been as close to a shaven head as possible but even as a skinhead martin mills exhibited something of inspector dhars aggressive quality the resemblance went well beyond the propensity for the family sneer john d had little to say yet he was unstoppably opinionatedand when he was acting he always knew his lines martin mills on the other hand never shut up but wasnt what martin had to say also a recitation werent they the lines of another kind of actor the ceaseless intervening of a true believer werent both twins unstoppably opinionated certainly they were both stubborn the doctor was fascinated that barely a majority of bombayites appeared to recognize inspector dhar in martin mills there were almost as many individuals who seemed to see no resemblance whatsoever vinod who knew dhar well never doubted that martin was dhar deepa also knew dhar and she was indifferent to the movie stars fame because shed never seen an inspector dhar movie the character meant nothing to her when deepa met the missionary in dr daruwallas waiting room she instantly took martin mills for what he was an american dogooder but this had long been her opinion of dhar if the dwarfs wife had never seen an inspector dhar movie she had seen dhars tv appearance on behalf of the hospital for crippled children dhar had always struck deepa as a dogooder and a nonindian on the other hand ranjit wasnt fooled the medical secretary saw only the slightest resemblance to dhar in the frail missionary ranjit didnt even suspect the two of being twins his only comment which he whispered to dr daruwalla was that hed never known dhar had a brother given martin millss ravaged condition ranjit assumed he was dhars older brother dr daruwallas first concern was to keep martin mills in the dark once the doctor could get the missionary to st ignatius martin would be kept in perpetual darknessor so the doctor hoped farrokh wanted it to be john ds decision whether to know his twin or not but in the doctors office and in the waiting room it had been awkward to keep martin mills separated from vinod and deepa short of telling the dwarf and his wife that the missionary was dhars twin dr daruwalla didnt know what to do or how to keep them apart it was upon vinods initiative that madhu and ganesh were introduced to each other as if a yearold child prostitute and a yearold beggar whod allegedly been stepped on by an elephant would instantly have worlds in common to dr daruwallas surprise the children appeared to hit it off madhu was excited to learn that the ugly problem with ganeshs eyesif not the ugly footmight soon be corrected ganesh imagined that he could do very well for himself in the circus too with that foot farrokh said what could you do in the circus with that foot well there are things he can do with his arms martin mills replied dr daruwalla feared that the jesuit had been schooled to refute any defeatist argument vinod farrokh said beseechingly could the boy even be a roustabout with a limp like that do you see them letting him shovel the elephant shit he could limp after the wheelbarrow i suppose clowns are limping vinod replied i am limping the dwarf added so youre saying that he can limp and be laughed at like a clown said dr daruwalla theres always working in the cooks tent vinod said stubbornly he could be kneading and rolling out the dough for the chapati he could be chopping up the garlic and the onions for the dhal but why would they take him when there are countless boys with two good feet to do that dr daruwalla asked the doctor kept his eye on birdshit boy knowing that his discouraging arguments might meet with the beggars disapproval and a corresponding measure of bird shit we could tell the circus that they had to take the two of them together martin cried madhu and ganeshwe could say that theyre brother and sister that one looks after the other we could lie in other words said dr daruwalla for the good of these children i could lie the missionary said ill bet you could farrokh cried he was frustrated that he couldnt remember his fathers favorite condemnation of martin luther what had old lowji said about luthers justification for lying farrokh wished he could surprise the scholastic with what he recalled as a fitting quotation but it was martin mills who surprised him youre a protestant arent you the jesuit asked the doctor you should be advised by what your old friend luther said what wrong can there be in telling a downright good lie for a good cause luther is not my old friend dr daruwalla snapped martin mills had left something out of the quotation but farrokh couldnt remember what it was what was missing was the part about this downright good lie being not only for a good cause but also for the advancement of the christian church farrokh knew hed been fooled but he lacked the necessary information to fight back therefore he chose to fight with vinod instead and i suppose youre telling me that madhu here is another pinkyis that it farrokh asked the dwarf this was a sore point between them because vinod and deepa had been great blue nile performers they were sensitive to dr daruwallas preference for the performers of the great royal there was a pinky in the great royal circus she was a star shed been bought by the circus when she was only three or four shed been trained by pratap singh and his wife sumi by the time pinky was seven or eight she could balance on her forehead at the top of a foothigh bamboo pole the pole was balanced on the forehead of a bigger girl who stood on another girls shoulders the act was that kind of impossible thing it was an item that called for a girl whose sense of balance was one in a million although deepa and vinod had never performed for the great royal circus they knew which circuses had high standardsat least higher than the standards at the great blue nile yet deepa brought the doctor these wrecked little whores from kamathipura and proclaimed them circus material at best they were great blue nile material can madhu even stand on her head farrokh asked deepa can she walk on her hands the dwarfs wife suggested that the child could learn after all deepa had been sold to the great blue nile as a boneless girl a future plastic lady she had learned to be a trapeze artist a flyer but you fell the doctor reminded deepa she is merely falling into a net vinod exclaimed there isnt always a net dr daruwalla said did you land in a net vinod farrokh asked the dwarf i am being fortunate in other ways vinod replied madhu wont be working with clownsor with elephants the dwarf added but farrokh had the feeling that madhu was clumsy she looked clumsynot to mention the dubious coordination of the limping garlicandonion chopper madhus newly appointed brother farrokh felt certain that the elephantfooted boy would find another elephant to step on him dr daruwalla imagined that the great blue nile might even conceive of a way to display the cripples mashed foot ganesh would become a minor sideshow eventthe elephant boy they would call him that was when the missionary on the evidence of less than one days experience in bombay had said to dr daruwalla whatever the dangers in the circus the circus will be better for them than their present situationwe know the alternatives to their being in the circus vinod had remarked to inspector dhar that he was looking surprisingly well recovered from his nightmarish experience on falkland road farrokh thought the missionary looked awful to keep the dwarf and the missionary from talking further to each other which dr daruwalla knew would be confusing to them both the doctor pulled vinod aside and informed him that he should humor dharand by no means contradict himbecause the dwarf had correctly diagnosed the movie star there had been brain damage it would be delicate to assess how much are you having to delouse him too vinod had whispered to farrokh the dwarf was referring to the reason for the scholastics horrible haircut but dr daruwalla had solemnly agreed yes there had been lice and brain damage those are being filthy prostitutes vinod had exclaimed what a morning it had been already dr daruwalla thought hed finally gotten rid of vinod and deepaby sending them with madhu to dr tata dr daruwalla had not expected tata two to send them back so soon farrokh barely had time to get rid of martin mills the doctor wanted the scholastic out of the office and the waiting room before vinod and deepa and madhu returned whats more dr daruwalla wanted time to be alone the deputy commissioner expected the doctor to come to crime branch headquarters doubtless the doctors viewing of the photographs of the murdered prostitutes would serve to undermine the collected optimism of the jesuit the dwarf and the dwarfs wife but before farrokh could slip away to crawford market where he was meeting deputy commissioner patel it was necessary for the doctor to create an errand for martin mills if only for an hour or two the missionary was in need of a mission another warning the elephant boy was a problem ganesh had behaved badly in the exercise yard where many of the postoperative patients among the crippled children were engaged in their various physicaltherapy assignments ganesh took this opportunity to squirt several of the more defenseless children with the birdshit syringe when ranjit took the syringe away from the aggressive boy ganesh bit dr daruwallas faithful secretary on the hand ranjit was offended that hed been bitten by a beggar dealing with the unruly likes of the elephantfooted boy wasnt a suitable use of the medical secretarys training on a day that had barely begun dr daruwalla was already exhausted nevertheless the doctor made quick and clever use of the biting episode if martin mills was so sure that birdshit boy was capable of contributing to the daily chores of a circus perhaps the missionary could be persuaded to take some responsibility for the little beggar martin mills was eager to take responsibility for the elephant boy the zealot would be likely to claim responsibility for a world of cripples farrokh imagined thereupon dr daruwalla assigned martin mills the task of taking ganesh to parsi general hospital the doctor wanted the crippled beggar to be examined by eye ear nose and throat jeejeebhoydouble ent jeejeebhoy as he was called dr jeejeebhoy was an expert on the eye problems that were epidemic in india although there was a rheumy discharge and ganesh had said that his eyelids were gummed shut every morning there wasnt that softness of the eyeballs that dr daruwalla thought of as endstage or white eyes then the cornea is dull and opaque and the patient is blind farrokh hoped that whatever was wrong with ganesh it was in an early stage vinod had admitted that the circus wouldnt take a boy who was going blindnot even the great blue nile but before farrokh could hurry the elephant boy and the jesuit on their way to parsi general which wasnt far martin mills had spontaneously come to the aid of a woman in the waiting room she was the mother of a crippled child the missionary had dropped to his knees at her feet which farrokh found to be an irritating habit of the zealot the woman was frightened by the gesture also she wasnt in need of aid she was not bleeding from her lips and gums as the scholastic had declaredshe was merely eating betel nut which the jesuit had never seen dr daruwalla ushered martin from the waiting room to his office where the doctor believed that the missionary could do slightly less harm dr daruwalla insisted that ganesh come with them for the doctor was fearful that the dangerous beggar might bite someone else thereupon farrokh calmly told martin mills what paan wasthe local version of betel the areca nut is wrapped in a betel leaf other common ingredients are rose syrup aniseed lime paste but people put almost everything in the betel leaf even cocaine the veteran betelnut eater has redstained lips and teeth and gums the woman the missionary had alarmed was not bleeding she was merely eating paan finally farrokh was able to free himself from martin mills dr daruwalla hoped that double ent jeejeebhoy would take forever to examine ganeshs eyes by midmorning the days confusion had achieved a lunatic pace it was already a day that brought to farrokhs mind those whitefaced darkskinned girls in their purple tutus it was a load cycle kind of day as if everyone in the doctors office and waiting room were riding bicycles to cancan music as if to emphasize this chaos ranjit walked into the office without knocking the medical secretary had just read dr daruwallas mail although the envelope that ranjit handed to dr daruwalla was addressed to the doctor not to inspector dhar there was something familiar about the cold neutrality of the typescript even before the doctor looked inside the envelope and saw the tworupee note he knew what hed find farrokh was nevertheless stunned to read the message typed in capital letters on the serialnumber side of the money this time the warning said youre as dead as dhar madhu uses her tongue there was a telephone call that added to the general confusion in his distress ranjit made a mistake the secretary thought the caller was radiology patelit was a question regarding when dr daruwalla would come to view the photographs ranjit assumed that the photographs were x rays and he answered abruptly that the doctor was busy either ranjit or the doctor would call back with the answer but after the secretary hung up he realized that the caller hadnt been radiology patel it had been deputy commissioner patel of course there was a patel on the phone for you ranjit told farrokh in an offhand fashion he wants to know when youre coming to see the photographs and now there were two tworupee notes in dr daruwallas pocket there was the warning to dhar youre as dead as lal and the warning to the doctor youre as dead as dhar farrokh felt certain that these threats would enhance the grimness of the photographs that the deputy commissioner wanted to show him farrokh knew that john d who was good at concealing his anger was already angry with him for not forewarning the actor of the arrival of his bothersome twin dhar would be even angrier if dr daruwalla saw the photographs of the elephants drawn on the murdered prostitutes without him but the doctor thought it unwise to bring dhar to crime branch headquartersnor would it be advisable to bring martin mills the particular police station was near st xaviers college another jesuit institution this one was coeducationalst ignatius admitted only boys martin mills would doubtless attempt to persuade his fellow jesuits to admit madhu to their school in case she wasnt acceptable to the circus the madman would probably insist that st xaviers offer scholarships to other available child prostitutes the scholastic had already announced that he would approach the father rector of st ignatius on ganeshs behalf dr daruwalla couldnt wait to hear father julians response to the notion of st ignatius school attempting to educate a crippled beggar from chowpatty beach while the doctor was speculating in this fashion and as he was hurrying to examine his remaining patients vinod and deepa returned with madhu and the tetracycline before he could abscond to the police station farrokh felt obliged to set a trap for mr garg the doctor told deepa to tell garg that madhu was being treated for a sexually transmitted disease that sounded vague enough if mr garg had diddled the child he would need to call dr daruwalla to find out which diseasein order to learn the prescribed cure and tell him were checking to see if shes hivpositive farrokh said that ought to make the bastard squirm dr daruwalla thought the doctor wanted deepa and vinod to understand that madhu must be kept away from the wetness cabaret and away from garg the dwarf would drive his wife to the train stationdeepa had to return to the great blue nilebut vinod had to keep madhu with him and remember shes not clean until shes taken all the tetracycline the doctor told the dwarf i am remembering vinod said then the dwarf asked about dhar where was he was he all right and didnt dhar need his faithful driver dr daruwalla explained to vinod that dhar was suffering from the common posttrauma delusion that he was someone else who is he being the dwarf inquired a jesuit missionary in training to be a priest the doctor replied vinod was instantly sympathetic to this delusion the actor was even more braindamaged than the dwarf had first suspected the key to dealing with dhar the doctor explained was to expect him to be one person one minute and another person the next the dwarf gravely nodded his big head then deepa kissed the doctor goodbye there always lingered on her lips the sticky sweetness of those lemon drops she liked any physical contact with the dwarfs wife made dr daruwalla blush farrokh could feel himself blush but hed never known if his blushes were visible he knew he was darkskinned for a parsi although he was fairskinned in comparison to many other indianscertainly say to a goan or to a south indian in canada of course the doctor was well aware that he was usually perceived as a man of color but when it came to blushing he never knew whether or not he could blush undetected naturally his embarrassment was communicated by other signals quite unrelated to his complexion and utterly unknown to him for example in the aftermath of deepas kiss he averted his eyes but his lips remained parted as if hed forgotten something he was about to say thus he was caught all the more off guard when madhu kissed him he wanted to believe that the child was merely imitating the dwarfs wife but the girls kiss was too lush and knowingdeepa had not inserted her tongue farrokh felt madhus tongue flick his own tongue dartingly and the girls breath was redolent of some dark spicenot lemon drops possibly cardamom or clove as madhu withdrew from him she flashed her first smile and dr daruwalla saw the bloodred edge to her teeth at the gum line for farrokh to realize that the child prostitute was a veteran betelnut eater was only a mild surprise even anticlimactic the doctor presumed that an addiction to paan was the least of madhus problems a meeting at crime branch headquarters the inappropriately lewd encounter with madhu left dr daruwalla in no mood to be tolerant of the photographic record of rahuls artistry on the bellies of the murdered whores the subject matter was no less limited than what the doctor had seen depicted on beths belly years ago nor had the intervening years imparted to the artist any measurable subtlety of style the evermirthful elephant winked its eye and raised the opposite tusk the water from the end of the elephants trunk continued to spray the pubic hairin many cases the shaved pubic areaof the dead women not even the passing of so many years not to mention the horror of so many murders was sufficient to inspire rahul beyond the first act of his imaginationnamely that the victims navel was always the winking eye the differences among the womens navels provided the only variety in the many photographs detective patel remarked that both the drawings and the murders gave new meaning to that tired old phrase a onetrack mind dr daruwalla who was too appalled to speak could only nod that he agreed farrokh showed the deputy commissioner the threatening tworupee notes but dcp patel was unsurprised hed been expecting more warnings the deputy commissioner knew that the note in mr lals mouth had been just the beginning no murderer the detective had ever known was content to threaten potential victims only once either killers didnt warn you or they repeatedly warned you yet for years this killer hadnt given anyone a warning only now beginning with mr lal had there emerged a kind of vendetta against inspector dhar and dr daruwalla it seemed unlikely to the deputy commissioner that the sole motivation for this change in rahul had been a stupid movie something about the daruwalladhar connection must have infuriated rahulboth personally and for a long time it was the deputy commissioners suspicion that inspector dhar and the cagegirl killer had simply exacerbated rahuls longstanding hatred tell meim just curious said detective patel to dr daruwalla do you know any hijrasi mean personally but as soon as he saw that the doctor was thinking about the questionthe doctor had been unable to answer spontaneouslythe detective added in your movie you made a hijra the murderer whatever gave you such an idea i mean in my experience the hijras i know are reasonably gentletheyre mostly nice people the hijra prostitutes may be bolder than the female prostitutes yet i dont think of them as dangerous but possibly you knew onesomeone who wasnt very nice im just curious well someone had to be the murderer dr daruwalla said defensively it was nothing personal let me be more specific said the deputy commissioner it was a line that got dr daruwallas attention because the doctor had often written that line for inspector dhar did you ever know somebody with a womans breasts and a boys penis it was a rather small penis from all reports the detective added i dont mean a hijra i mean a zenanaa transvestite with a penis but with breasts that was when farrokh felt a flutter of pain in the area of his heart it was his injured rib trying to remind him of rahul the rib was crying out to him that rahul was the second mrs dogar but the doctor mistook the pain for an actual signal from his heart his heart said rahul but rahuls connection to mrs dogar still eluded dr daruwalla yes or maybei mean i knew a man who was trying to become a woman farrokh replied hed obviously taken estrogens maybe hed even had surgical implantshe definitely had a womans breasts but whether hed been castrated or if hed had other surgery i dont knowi mean i presumed he had a penis because he was interested in the complete operation a total sex change and did he have this operation the deputy commissioner asked i wouldnt know the doctor replied i havent seen him or her for twenty years that would be the right number of years wouldnt it the detective asked again farrokh felt the twinge in his rib that he confused with his excited heart he was hoping to go to london for the operation farrokh explained in those days i believe it would have been very difficult to get a complete sexchange operation in india theyre still illegal here i believe that our murderer also went to london patel informed the doctor obviously and only recently heor shecame back the person i knew was interested in going to art school in london farrokh said numbly the photographs of the drawings on the bellies of the murdered prostitutes grew clearer in his mind although the photographs lay facedown on the deputy commissioners desk it was patel who picked one up and looked at it again not a very good art school would have taken him i suspect the detective said he never shut his office door which opened on an outdoor balcony there were a dozen such offices off this balcony and it was the deputy commissioners policy that no one ever closed a doorexcept in the monsoon rains and then only when the wind was wrong with the doors open no one being interrogated could later claim that theyd been beaten also the sound of the police secretaries typing their officers reports was a sound that the deputy commissioner enjoyed the cacophony of typewriters implied both industry and order he knew that many of his fellow policemen were lazy and their secretaries were sloppy the typed reports themselves were rarely as orderly as the clacking of the keys on his desk deputy commissioner patel faced three reports in need of rewriting and an additional report in greater need but he pushed these four reports aside in order to spread out the photographs of the murdered whores bellies the elephant drawings were so familiar to him that they calmed him he didnt want the doctor to sense his eagerness and would this person that you knew have had a common sort of name a name like rahul the detective asked it was a delivery worthy of the insincerity of inspector dhar rahul rai said dr daruwalla it was almost a whisper but this didnt lessen the deputy commissioners quickening pleasure and would this rahul rai have been in goa perhaps visiting the beaches at or about the time when the german and the americanthose bodies you sawwere murdered patel asked the doctor was slumped in his chair as if bent by indigestion at my hotelat the bardez farrokh replied he was staying with his aunt and the thing is if rahul is in bombay he is certainly familiar with the duckworth clubhis aunt was a member was the detective said shes dead dr daruwalla said i would presume that rahul he or she inherited her fortune dcp patel touched the raised tusk of the elephant in one of the photographs then he stacked the photos in a single neat pile hed always known there was family money in india but the duckworth club connection was a surprise what had misled him for years was rahuls brief notoriety in the transvestite brothels on falkland road and grant road these were hardly the usual haunts of a duckworthian of course i know that you know my wife the detective said i must put you together with her she knows your rahul too and it might help me to hear you compare notesso to speak we could have lunch at the club someone there might know more about rahul farrokh suggested dont you ask any questions the deputy commissioner suddenly shouted it offended dr daruwalla to be yelled at but the detective was quickly tactful if not exactly mollifying we wouldnt want to warn rahul would we patel said as if he were speaking to a child the rising dust from the courtyard had coated the leaves of the neem trees the rail of the balcony was also coated with dust in the detectives office the dull brass ceiling fan labored in an effort to push the motes of dust back out the open door the darting shadows of forktailed kites occasionally moved across the deputy commissioners desk the one open eve of the topmost elephant in the stack of photos seemed to notice all these things which the doctor knew he would never forget lunch today suggested the detective tomorrow is better for me dr daruwalla said his pending obligation to deliver martin mills into the hands of the jesuits at st ignatius was a welcome intrusion he also needed to talk to julia and he wanted the time to tell dhardhar should be at the lunch with the wounded hippie farrokh knew that john d had a superior memory maybe even of rahul tomorrow is fine said the deputy commissioner but his disappointment was evident the words his wife had used to describe rahul were constantly with him also with him was the size of rahuls big hands which had held his wifes big breasts also the erectness and the shapeliness of rahuls breasts which nancy had felt against her back also the small silky little boys penis which his wife had felt against her buttocks nancy had said he was condescending mocking teasingcertainly sophisticated probably cruel because dr daruwalla had only begun the struggle to compose a written report on rahul rai the detective couldnt quite leave him alone give me one word for rahul patel asked farrokh the first word that comes to your mindim just curious the detective said arrogant the doctor replied after years it was visible on detective patels face that this was unsatisfactory please try another the detective said superior said dr daruwalla youre getting closer patel replied rahul is a tease farrokh explained he condescends to you he mocks you he bullies you with a sort of selfsatisfied sophistication like his late aunt he uses his sophistication as a weapon i think he is basically a cruel person the doctor paused in his description because the detective had closed his eyes and sat smiling at his desk all the while deputy commissioner patel articulated his fingers as if he were typing up another report but his fingers werent tapping the keys of his typewriter the detective had once more spread out the photographsthey covered his deskand he typed on the many heads of the mocking elephants his fingers finding the navels of the murdered prostitutes all those ceaselessly winking eyes down the balcony from another detectives office a man was screaming that he was telling the truth while a policeman calmly contradicted him with the almost harmonious repetition of the word lies from the courtyard kennel came a corresponding clamorthe police attack dogs after dr daruwalla had completed his written report on rahul the doctor wandered onto the balcony to have a look at the dogs theyd barked themselves out the latemorning sun was now beating down on the courtyard the police dogs all dobermans were asleep in the only shady corner of their kennel which was obscured from farrokhs view by a clump of neem trees on the balcony itself however was a small cage with a newspaper floor and the doctor knelt to play with a doberman pinscher puppya prisoner in a portable pen the puppy wriggled and whined for farrokhs attention it thrust its sleek black muzzle through a square of the wire mesh it licked the doctors handits needlesharp teeth nipped his fingers are you a good dog farrokh asked the puppy its wild eyes were ringed with the rustybrown markings of its breed which is preferred for police work in bombay because the dobermann short hair is suitable for the hot weather the dogs were large and powerful and fast they had the terriers jaws and tenacity although they werent quite as intelligent as german shepherds a subinspector a junior officer came out of an office where at least three typewriters were resounding and this young officious policeman spoke aggressively to dr daruwalla something to the effect that spoiling the doberman puppy would make it untrainable for police business something about not treating a future attack dog as a pet whenever anyone spoke hindi this abruptly to the doctor farrokh felt frozen by his lack of fluency in the language im sorry dr daruwalla said in english no dont you be sorry someone suddenly shouted it was deputy commissioner patel hed popped out of his office onto the balcony where he stood clutching farrokhs written statement in his hands go onplay with the puppy all you want to the deputy commissioner shouted the junior policeman realized his error and quickly apologized to dr daruwalla im sorry saar he said but before the subinspector could slip back into his office and the safe din of the typewriters he was barked at by detective patel too you should be sorryspeaking to my witness the deputy commissioner yelled so i am a witness farrokh realized hed made a small fortune satirizing the police now he knew he was in utter ignorance of even a matter as trivial as the pecking order among policemen go onplay with the puppy patel repeated to the doctor and so farrokh once more turned his attention to the doberman since the little dog had just dropped a surprisingly large turd on the newspaper floor of its cage dr daruwallas attention was momentarily attracted to the turd that was when he saw that the newspaper was todays edition of the times of india and that the dobermans turd had fallen on the review of inspector dhar and the towers of silence it was a bad review of such a hostile nature that its surliness seemed enhanced by the smell of dog shit the turd prevented all but a partial reading of the review which was just as well farrokh was angered enough there was even a gratuitous swipe taken at dhars perceived weight problem the reviewer asserted that inspector dhar sported too protrusive a beer belly to justify the film studios claim that dhar was the charles bronson of bombay by the nearby flutter of pages dr daruwalla realized that the deputy commissioner had finished reading the doctors statement the detective also stood close enough to the puppys cage to observe what farrokh had been reading detective patel was the one who had put the newspaper there im afraid its not a very good review the deputy commissioner observed they never are farrokh said he followed patel back to his office dr daruwalla could feel that the detective wasnt altogether pleased by the doctors written report sit down detective patel said but when the doctor moved to the chair hed sat in before the detective caught his arm and steered him around the desk no noyou sit where i usually sit and so farrokh seated himself in the deputy commissioners chair it was higher than the doctors previous seat the photographs of the murdered prostitutes were easier to see or else harder to ignore the doctor remembered the day at chowpatty beach when little john d had been so frightened by the festival mob by all the elephant heads being carried into the sea theyre drowning the elephants the child had cried now the elephants will be angry in his written statement farrokh had said that he believed the hateful phone calls about his fathers assassination had been from rahul after all it was the voice of a woman trying to sound like a man and this might suit whatever voice rahul had ended up with twenty years ago rahuls voice had been a workinprogress it had been sexually undecided but although detective patel found this speculation interesting the detective was disturbed by dr daruwallas conclusion that rahul had been old lowjis assassin this was too imaginativeit was too big a leap this was the kind of conjecture that marred the doctors written report and made it in the deputy commissioners opinion amateurish your father was blown up by professionals dcp patel informed farrokh i was still an inspector at the colaba stationonly the duty officer the tardeo police station answered that call i wasnt allowed at the scene of the crime and then the investigation was turned over to the government but i know for a fact that lowji daruwalla was exploded by a team for a while i heard that they thought the head mali might have been involved the duckworth club gardener cried dr daruwalla hed always disliked the head mali without knowing why there was a different head mali then you will remember the detective said oh farrokh said he was feeling more and more amateurish by the minute anyway rahul is possibly the one making the phone callsthats as good a guess as any patel said but hes no carbomb expert the doctor sat dismally still looking at the photographic history of the murdered women but why would rahul hate meor dhar dr daruwalla asked that is the question you dont answer or even ask in your written statement said dcp patel why indeed thus were both men left with this unanswered questiondr daruwalla as he took a taxi uptown to meet martin mills and detective patel as he reclaimed his desk chair there the deputy commissioner once more faced the winking elephants on the slack bellies of the brutalized women no motive the deputy commissioner reflected that the mystery of rahuls hatred was probably unsolvable there would be no end to the conjecture on this subject which would remain unsatisfactorily answered probably forever the matter of what motivated rahuls hatred would remain incomplete what was truly implausible in all the inspector dhar films was that all the murderers motives were plainly established the reasons for this or that hatred which would lead to this or that violence were always clear detective patel regretted that rahul rai wasnt in a movie in addition to dr daruwallas written statement the detective had secured a letter from the doctor for it hadnt escaped patels attention that dr daruwalla was guest chairman of the membership committee at the duckworth club on behalf of deputy commissioner patel the duckworth club was requested to release the names of its new membersnew as of the last years the deputy commissioner sent a subinspector to the club with the letter of requisition the subinspector was instructed not to leave the duckworth club without the list of names detective patel doubted that he would need to peruse the names of all members with any luck a recent membership to a relative of the late promila rai would be easy to spot it was hard for the deputy commissioner to contain himself while he waited for the subinspector to bring him the list at his desk detective patel sat among the dust motes that danced in the movement of the ceiling fan which was silent not because it was truly noiseless but because the constant orchestra of the secretaries typewriters concealed the fans faint whirs and ticks at first the deputy commissioner had been enthusiastic about the information hed received from dr daruwalla the detective had never been this close to rahul now he thought it was inevitable that the killer would be apprehendedan arrest seemed imminent yet detective patel couldnt bring himself to share his enthusiasm with his wife he would hate to see her disappointed if there remained something inconclusive there was always something inconclusive the detective knew but why would rahul hate meor dhar dr daruwalla had asked to the deputy commissioner this question had been a typical inanity from the creator of inspector dhar even so the detectivethe real detectivehad encouraged the doctor to keep asking himself that same inane question detective patel had lived with the photographs for too long that little elephant with its cocky tusk and its mischievous eyes had gotten to him not to mention those murdered women with their unresponsive stomachs there would never be a satisfactory motive for such hatred the deputy commissioner believed rahuls real crime was that he didnt have sufficient justification for his actions something about rahul would remain uncaptured the horror about murders like his was that they were never sufficiently motivated and so it seemed to detective patel that his wife was destined to be disappointed he wouldnt call her because he didnt want to get her hopes up as he might have guessed nancy called him no sweetie the detective said from the adjacent office the sound of typing ceased then from the next office the typing also stoppedand so on all along the balcony no i would have told you sweetie the deputy commissioner said for years nancy had called him almost every day she always asked him if hed caught beths killer yes of course i promise sweetie the detective said below in the courtyard the big dobermans were still asleep and the police mechanic had mercifully stopped his infernal revving of the patrolmens motorcycles the tuning of these ancient engines was so constant the dogs usually slept through it but even this sound had ceased as if the mechanicin spite of his throttling up and throttling downhad managed to hear the typing stop the motorcycle mechanic had joined the speechless typewriters yes i showed the doctor the photographs patel told nancy yes of course you were right sweetie the deputy commissioner told his wife there was a new sound in detective patels office the detective looked all around trying to identify it gradually he became aware of the absence of typing then he looked up at the revolving ceiling fan and realized that it was the fans whirring and ticking that he heard it was so quiet he could hear the rusted iron wheels of the hotlunch wagons that were pushed by hand along dr dadabhai navroji road the dabbawallas were on their way to deliver hot lunches to the office workers uptown deputy commissioner patel knew that his fellow policemen and their secretaries were listening to every word of his conversation and so he whispered into the phone sweetie the detective said it is slightly better than you first believed the doctor didnt merely see the bodies the doctor also knows rahul both daruwalla and dharthey actually know who he is or at least who he or she was patel paused and then he whispered no sweetiethey havent seen him or her not for twenty years then the detective once more listened to his wifeand to the ceiling fan and to the grinding wheels of the dabbawallas faraway wagons when the deputy commissioner spoke again it was an outburst not a whisper but i never dismissed your theories he cried into the phone then there entered into his voice a familiar tone of resignation it so pained his fellow policemen who all admired him and could no more fathom the motive for the extreme love that detective patel felt for his wife than there was any fathoming the motivation for rahuls extreme hatred there was simply no determining where either a love or a hate like that came from and this mystery compelled the officers and their secretaries to listen all along the balcony it overwhelmed them to hear the intensity of what appeared to them to be a groundless irrational love no of course im not angry patel told nancy im sorry if i sounded angry sweetie the detective sounded drained the officers and their secretaries wished only that they could help him they werent eavesdropping for information related to those murdered prostitutes they knew that the evidence of what had been done to those women was never farther away from the deputy commissioner than the top drawer of his desk it was the pathetic sound of detective patels love for his wretched wife that removed the hand of the motorcycle mechanic from the throttle in his office patel was painstakingly returning the photographs to his top drawer he always returned them one by one just as he reviewed them faithfully and in the exact order in which the crimes had been discovered i love you too sweetie the detective said into the phone he always waited for nancy to hang up first then he slammed shut the top drawer of his desk and rushed to the balcony he caught his fellow policemen and their secretaries by surprise not one of them was fast enough to start typing before the deputy commissioner started shouting have you run out of things to describe he hollered have your fingers all fallen off he screamed are there no more murders is crime a thing of the past have you all gone on holiday have you nothing better to do than listen to me the typing began again although detective patel knew that most of these first words would be meaningless below him in the courtyard the doberman pinschers started barking witlessly he could see them lunging in their kennel also below him the police mechanic had mounted the nearest motorcycle and was jumping again and again but without success on the kick starter the engine made a dry gasping sound like the catching of a pawl against a rachet wheel bleed the carburetortheres too much air patel shouted to the mechanic who quickly fussed with the carburetor his tireless leg continued to flail the kick starter when the engine caught and the mechanic revved the throttle so loudly that the barking dobermans were drowned out of hearing the deputy commissioner returned to his office and sat at his desk with his eyes closed gradually his head began to bob as if hed found a followable rhythm if not a melody among the staccato outbursts from the police secretaries typewriters hed not exactly neglected to tell nancy that they would have lunch tomorrow at the duckworth club with dr daruwallaprobably with inspector dhar too hed purposefully withheld this information from his wife he knew it would worry her or bring her to tearsor at least cause her another long night of sleeplessness and helpless sorrowing nancy hated to go out in public moreover shed developed a pointless dislike of both inspector dhars creator and dhar himself detective patel understood that his wifes dislike was no more logical than her blaming both men for failing to comprehend how savagely shed been traumatized in goa with equal illogic the detective anticipated nancy would be ashamed of herself in both daruwalla and dhars company for she couldnt bear the thought of encountering anyone whod known her then he would tell her about lunch at the duckworth club in the morning the detective thought that way his wife might have a fair nights sleep also once hed read over the names of the new members at the club the deputy commissioner hoped he might know who rahul wasor who he or she was pretending to be nowadays patels fellow policemen and their secretaries didnt relax until they heard the sound of his typewriter contributing its tedious music to their own this was a welcome boredom they knew for with the flat clacking of the deputy commissioners keys patels colleagues were relieved to know that the deputy commissioner had returned to sanityif not to peace of mind it even comforted his junior officers to know that patel was rewriting their own botched reports they also knew they could expect that sometime in the afternoon detective patel would have their original reports back on their desks the revised reports would be prefaced by a creative array of insults directed to their myriad inabilitiesfor none of them in detective patels opinion knew how to write a proper report and the secretaries would be taken to task for their typing errors he was so disdainful of the secretaries the deputy commissioner did his own typing martins mother makes him sick trachoma which is one of the leading causes of blindness in the world is easily treatable at its earliest phasea chlamydial infection of the conjunctiva in ganeshs case there was no scarring of the cornea double ent jeejeebhoy had prescribed three weeks of tetracycline orally together with a tetracycline ointment sometimes multiple courses of treatment were needed dr jeejeebhoy had said the elephant boys weepy eyes would likely clear up you see martin mills asked dr daruwalla weve already done the boy some good it wasnt hard was it it seemed disloyal of the doctor that they were riding in a taxi not driven by vinod it wasnt even a taxi from the dwarfs company it also seemed dangerous for the decrepit driver had warned them that he was unfamiliar with bombay before they proceeded to the mission in mazagaon they dropped the beggar at chowpatty beach where he said he wanted to go dr daruwalla couldnt resist saying to martin mills that the little cripple was doubtless eager to sell his fashion street clothes youre so cynical the scholastic said hell probably sell the tetracycline too farrokh replied hell probably be blind before he gets to see the circus as he escorted the missionary to st ignatius farrokh felt sufficiently overwhelmed to have reached the stage of making bitter resolutions to himself dr daruwalla had resolved that he would never write another inspector dhar movie the doctor had resolved that he would call a press conference at which he would take the full blame for dhars creation upon himself thus distracted and always a nervous passenger in bombayeven when vinod was at the wheel and the dwarf was a decent driverdr daruwalla was frightened to see that their taxi had nearly mowed down a pedestrian the nearaccident had no effect on martin millss impromptu lecture on jainism a prebuddhist offshoot of hinduism martin declared the jains were absolutely pure the missionary explained not just no meat but no eggs kill nothing not even flies bathe every morning he would love to meet a jain martin said just that quickly was the chaos of the morning behind him if not entirely forgotten apropos of nothing the missionary then moved on to the wellworn subject of gandhi farrokh reflected on how he might derail this conversation possibly the doctor could say he preferred the warrior shivaji to gandhinone of this turntheothercheek shit for shivaji but before the doctor could deflate so much as a sentence of the scholastics zeal for gandhi martin mills once more changed the subject personally im more interested in shirdi sai baba the missionary said ah yesthe jesus of maharashtra farrokh replied facetiously sai baba was a patron saint of many circus performers the acrobats wore little shirdi sai baba medallions around their necksthe hindu equivalents of st christopher medals there were shirdi sai baba calendars hanging in the troupe tents of the great royal and the great blue nile the saints shrine was in maharashtra the parallels to jesus are understandable martin mills began although sai baba was a teenager before he gained attention and he was an old man in his eighties when he died i believe in from his pictures i always thought he looked a little like lee marvin the lee marvin of maharashtra farrokh said lee marvin not shirdi sai baba the missionary protested and here in an effort to interrupt the zealots upcoming lecture on the parallels between christianity and the cult of sai baba worship the doctor launched into a description of the terrible teeterboard item that bore responsibility for vinods aerial assault of the surprised audience at the lessthangreat blue nile circus dr daruwalla made it clear that such careless elephantstamping acts would likely be in store for the lessthaninnocent madhu and the elephantfooted ganesh but the doctors calculated pessimism failed to bait the missionary into repeating his claim that the perils of the circusof any circuspaled in comparison to the hardships facing a prostitute or a beggar in bombay as swiftly as hed dropped gandhi for sai baba martin mills now abandoned the jesus of maharashtra too the missionarys new and sudden interest was prompted by a billboard they were passing an advertisement for closeup do you mouthwash when you toothpaste look at that cried martin mills their taxis startled driver barely avoided being broadsided by a thums up cola truck it was as big and bright red as a fire engine english usage is so important the scholastic declared what worries me about those children is that their english will deteriorate in the circus perhaps we could insist that someone in the circus tutor them how will speaking english serve them in the circus farrokh asked he knew it was nonsense to think that madhu possessed enough english for her grasp of the language to deteriorate it was still a mystery to dr daruwalla that the elephant boys spoken english and his apparent understanding of the language were as good as they were perhaps someone had already tutored him maybe the missionary would suggest that ganesh tutor madhu but martin mills didnt wait for the doctor to elaborate on his thesis that english would never provide these children with any advantagenot in the circus speaking english serves anyone well said the english teacher one day english will be the language of the world bad english is already the language of the world said dr daruwalla despairingly that the children might be mashed by elephants was not the missionarys concern but the moron wished proper english usage on them passing dr voras gynecological and maternity hospital farrokh realized that their decrepit driver was lost the wretch made a sudden turn and was almost sideswiped by a careening olivedrab van belonging to the spastics society of india only a moment lateror so it seemed it was longerthe doctor realized that his own sense of direction had deserted him for they were passing the times of india building when martin mills announced we could give the children a subscription to the times of india and have it sent to them at the circus wed have to insist that they give it at least an hour a day of their attention of course of course said dr daruwalla the doctor thought he might faint with frustration for their troubled driver had missed the turn he should have takenthere went sir j j road im planning to read the newspaper myself daily the missionary went on when youre a foreigner theres nothing like a local newspaper to orient you the thought of anyone becoming oriented by the times of india made farrokh feel that a headon collision with an approaching doubledecker bus might be an improvement on the scholastics continued conversation then in the next instant theyd plunged into mazagaonst ignatius was now very nearand the doctor for no calculated reason instructed their driver to take a slight detour through the slum on sophia zuber road a part of this slum was once a movie set dr daruwalla explained to martin mills it was in this very slum that your mother fainted when she was sneezed on and then licked by a cow of course she was pregnant with you at the timei suppose youve heard the story please stop the car the missionary cried when their driver braked but before the taxi came to a complete halt martin mills opened the rear door and vomited into the moving street because nothing in a slum goes unseen this episode attracted the attention of several slum dwellers who began to jog beside the slowing car their frightened driver speeded up in order to get away from them after your mother fainted there was a riot farrokh continued apparently there was massive confusion concerning who licked whom your mother or the cow please stopnot the car please dont mention my mother martin said im sorry said dr daruwalla who was secretly excited at last farrokh had found a subject that gave him the upper hand a half dozen cobras it would be no less long a day for deputy commissioner patel than it would be for dr daruwalla but the level of confusion in the detectives day would be slightly less overwhelming the deputy commissioner easily revised the first botched report that awaited his attentiona suspected murder at the suba guest house it turned out to be a suicide the report had to be rewritten because the duty officer had misinterpreted the young mans suicide note as a clue left behind by the presumed murderer later the victims mother had identified her sons handwriting the deputy commissioner could sympathize with the duty officers mistake for it wasnt much of a suicide note had sex with a woman who smelled like meat not very pure as for the second report in need of rewriting the deputy commissioner was less sympathetic with the subinspector whod been summoned to the alexandria girls english institution a young student had been discovered in the lavatory presumably raped and murdered but when the subinspector arrived at the school he found the girl to be very much alive she was totally recovered from her own murder and indignant at the suggestion that shed been raped it turned out shed suffered her first period andwithdrawing to the lavatory to look more closely at what was happening to hershed fainted at the sight of her own blood there a hysterical teacher had found her mistaking the blood as proof of the rape of a virgin the teacher also assumed that the girl was dead the reason the report had to be rewritten was that the subinspector couldnt bring himself to mention that the poor girl had suffered her period it was he said upon interrogation as morally impossible for him to write this word as it would be for him to write the word menstruation which he added was very nearly a morally impossible word for him even to say and so the erroneously reported rape and murder was called in writing a case of first female bleeding detective patel needed to remind himself that his years with nancy had made it easy for him to recognize the tortured morality of many of his colleagues he restrained himself from too harsh a judgment of the subinspector the third report that needed to be revised was dharrelated it had never been reported as a crime at all thered been a perplexing brouhaha on falkland road in the wee hours dhars dwarf bodyguardthat cocky thughad beaten up a halfdozen hijras two were still hospitalized and one of the four whod been released was wearing a cast on a broken wrist two of the transvestite prostitutes had been persuaded not to press charges against dhars dwarf whom the investigating officer referred to by the name many policemen used for vinod the halfbodyguard but the report was stupidly written because the part about inspector dhar being under attack and vinod coming to his rescue was merely a footnote there was no mention of what dhar had been doing in the neighborhood in the first placethe report was too unfinished for submission the deputy commissioner made a note to inquire of dhar what had possessed the actor to approach the hijra prostitutes if the fool wanted to fuck a prostitute surely an expensive call girl would be within his financial reachand safer the incident struck the detective as highly out of character for the circumspect celebrity wouldnt it be funny if inspector dhar was a homosexual the deputy commissioner thought there was at least some humor in the deputy commissioners day the fourth report had come to crime branch headquarters from the tardeo police station at least six snakes were loose near the mahalaxmi temple but there were no reported bitingsmeaning none yet the duty officer from the tardeo station had taken photographs detective patel recognized the broad expanse of stairs leading to the mahalaxmi at the top of the steps where the temple loomed there was a wide pavilion where the worshipers bought coconut and flowers for their offerings this was also where the worshipers left their sandals and shoes but in the photos the deputy commissioner could see that the stairs leading to the temple were dotted with stray sandals and shoesindicating that a panicked crowd had only recently fled up or down the steps in the aftermath of riots the ground was always strewn with sandals and shoes people had run right out of them or up the backs of other peoples heels the temple steps were usually crowded now they were desertedthe flower stalls and the coconut shops were empty of people too everywhere there were only scattered sandals and shoes at the bottom of the temple stairs detective patel noted the tall woven baskets where the cobras were kept the baskets were overturned presumably empty the snake charmers had fled with everyone else but where had the cobras gone it must have been quite a scene the deputy commissioner imagined the worshipers running and screaming the snakes slithering away detective patel thought that most of the cobras belonging to snake charmers had no venom although they could still bite the puzzle in the photographs was what was missing from the pictures what had been the crime had one snake charmer thrown his cobra at another snake charmer had a tourist tripped over one of the cobra baskets in one second the snakes were loose in another second people were running out of their shoes but what was the crime deputy commissioner patel sent the snake report back to the tardeo police station the escaped cobras were their problem probably the snakes were venomless if they were snake charmers snakes at least they were tame the detective knew that a halfdozen cobras in mahalaxmi werent half as dangerous as rahul at the mission farrokh is inspired it was a surprisingly subdued missionary whom farrokh delivered to the jesuits at st ignatius inside the cloister martin mills exhibited the obedience of a welltrained dog the onceadmired modesty of the eyes became a fixed feature of his facehe looked more like a monk than a jesuit the doctor couldnt have known that the father rector and father cecil and brother gabriel had been expecting a loud clown in a hawaiian shirt dr daruwalla was disappointed at the almost reverential greeting the scholastic received in his unpressed fashion street shirtnot to mention his haunted scratched face and his concentrationcamp haircutthe new missionary made a serious first impression dr daruwalla unaccountably lingered at the mission farrokh supposed that he was hoping for an opportunity to warn father julian that martin mills was a madman but the doctor was of a considerably mixed mind when it came to involving himself to a greater extent in the newcomers future furthermore farrokh found that it was impossible to get the father rector alone theyd arrived just after the schoolboys had finished lunch father cecil and brother gabrielwith not fewer than a combined years between theminsisted on struggling with the scholastics suitcase and this left father julian to conduct martins first tour of st ignatius dr daruwalla followed behind since his own school days farrokh had spent only intermittent time at the place he reviewed the examination scrolls in the entrance hall with a detached curiosity the indian certificate of secondary education icse marked the completion of junior high school in the examination certificate of st ignatius demonstrated its spanish connection by commemorating the death of picasso this must have been brother gabriels idea a photograph of the artist was among the photos of that years graduates as if picasso had also passed the requisite exam and there were these few words picasso passes away in the th anniversary of shivajis coronation was commemorated in the montreal olympics was observed in the deaths of both charlie chaplin and elvis were mournedthey were also pictured among the graduates this yearbookminded sentimentality was interamixed with religious and nationalistic fervor the centerpiece of the entrance hall was a largerthanlife statue of the virgin mary standing on the head of the serpent with the apple in its mouth as if she thus circumvented or had altered the old testament and over the entranceway itself were sidebyside portraitsone of the pope of the moment the other of nehru as a young man haunted by nostalgia but more strongly disturbed by a culture that had never become his farrokh felt himself losing his faint resolve why warn the father rector about martin mills why try to warn any of them the whole place perhaps owing its inspiration to st ignatius loyola himself spoke of survivalnot to mention a humbling instinct for repentance as for the jesuits success in bombay and the rest of india farrokh assumed that the indian stress on motherworship gave the catholics a certain advantage the cult of the virgin mary was just more motherworship wasnt it even in an allboys school the holy mother dominated the statuary only a scattering of english names appeared on the examination scrolls yet passable english was an admissions requirement and fluency in the language was expected of any st ignatius graduate it was the classroom language throughout the school and the only language posted in writing at the student canteen in the courtyard was a photograph of the junior schools most recent trip there were the boys in their white shirts with navyblue ties they wore navyblue shorts and kneesocks tooand black shoes the caption to this photo said our juniors inc our midgets and our submidgets dr daruwalla disapproved of abbreviations in the firstaid room a boy with a stomach ache lay curled on a cot above which was tacked a photo of the stereotypical sunset at haji alis tomb the caption that accompanied this sunset was as egregious a non sequitur as any that had thus far been uttered by martin mills you only live once but if you live right once is enough moving on to the music parlor the doctor was struck by the tunelessness of the piano which in combination with the abrasive singing of the untalented music teacher made it hard for dr daruwalla to recognize even as oftdroned a dirge as swing low sweet chariot she was an english teacher a certain miss tanuja and farrokh overheard father julian explaining to martin mills that this timehonored method of teaching a language through song lyrics was still popular with the younger children since very few of the children were contributing more than mumbles to miss tanujas braying voice farrokh doubted the father rector on this point maybe the problem wasnt the method but miss tanuja she struck dr daruwalla as one of those indian women who remain uncontained by western clothes which miss tanuja was wearing with special gracelessness and folly perhaps the children couldnt sing swing low sweet chariot because they were distracted by the riotous array of miss tanujas ensemble the doctor observed that even martin mills appeared to be distracted by her farrokh cruelly assumed that miss tanuja was desperate to marry she was very roundfaced and of a medium milkchocolate complexion and she wore very sharply angled glassesof the kind with upwardsweeping wing tips embedded with small bright gems perhaps miss tanuja thought that these eyeglasses contrasted pleasingly with the smoothness and roundness of her face she had the plump youthful figure of a highschool voluptuary but she wore a dark skirt that hugged her hips too tightly and was the wrong length for her miss tanuja was short and the dress chopped her legs off at midcalf which gave dr daruwalla the impression that her thick ankles were wrists and her fat little feet were hands her blouse had a reflecting luminosity of a bluegreen nature as if flecked with algae dredged from a pond and although the womans most pleasing quality was an overall curvaceousness shed chosen a bra that served her badly from what little dr daruwalla knew of bras he judged it to be the oldfashioned pointy typeone of those rigidly constructed halters more suitable for protecting women from fencing injuries than for enhancing their natural shapeliness and between miss tanujas outrageously uplifted and sharply pointed breasts there hung a crucifix as if the christ on miss tanujas crossin addition to his other agonieswere expected to endure the misery of bouncing on the teachers ample but spearheaded bosoms miss tanuja has been with us for many years father julian whispered i see said dr daruwalla but martin mills merely stared then they passed a classroom of smaller children in i the kids were napping with their heads on their deskseither midgets or submidgets farrokh guessed do you play the piano the father rector was asking the new missionary i always wanted to learn martin said maybe the madman could practice the piano between bouts of orienting himself in the times of india dr daruwalla thought and to change the subject from his lack of musical skills the scholastic asked father julian about the sweepers for there were everywhere about the mission an abundance of men and women who were sweepingthey also cleaned the toiletsand the missionary assumed that these sweepers were people from the untouchable castes the father rector used the words bhangee and maitrani but martin mills was a man with more of a mission than father julian supposed martin asked the father rector directly and do their children attend this school all of a sudden dr daruwalla liked him well nothat wouldnt be suitable you see father julian was saying but farrokh was impressed by how gracefully martin mills interrupted the father rector the scholastic simply breezed into a description of rescuing the crippled beggar and the child prostitute it was martins onestepatatime method and the missionary virtually waltzed the father rector through the steps first the circusinstead of begging or the brothel then the mastery of the english languageso civilizing as to be essentialand then the intelligent conversion martin mills also called this the informed life in christ a class of seniors on recess was enjoying a savage silent dirt fight in the courtyard but dr daruwalla marveled how the jesuits were undistracted by this minor violence they spoke and listened with the concentration of lions stalking a kill but surely martin you wouldnt credit yourself with these childrens conversion father julian said that is should they eventually be converted well no what do you mean martin asked only that i never know if i have converted anyone the father rector replied and if these children were converted how could you presume it happened because of you dont be too proud if it happens it was god it wasnt you why noof course not said martin mills if it happens it was god was this obedience dr daruwalla wondered when father julian led martin to his cubicle which dr daruwalla imagined as a kind of prison cell with builtin instruments to chastise the flesh the doctor continued to roam he wanted to look at the sleeping children again because that image of sleeping with his head on his desk was more appealing than anything else he could remember about attending st ignatius schoolit had been so many years ago but when he peered into i again a teacher he hadnt seen before regarded him sternly as if his presence in the doorway would disturb the children and this time the doctor noticed the exposed wiring for the fluorescent lights which were off and the exposed wiring for the ceiling fan which was on suspended over the blackboard like a puppet on tangled immobile strings was yet another statue of the virgin mary from farrokhs canadian perspective this particular holy mother was covered with frost or a light snow but it was only rising chalk dust from the blackboard that had settled on the statue dr daruwalla amused himself by reading as many printed messages and announcements as he could find there was a plea from the social concern groupto help less fortunate brothers and sisters prayers were offered for the souls in purgatory there was the pleasing juxtaposition of the minimax fire extinguisher that was mounted on the wall beside the statue of christ with the sick child in fireextinguisher language a short list of instructions was printed next to a page from a lined notebook on which a childs handwriting proclaimed thanks to infant jesus and our lady of perpetual help farrokh felt somewhat more comforted by the presence of the fire extinguisher the great stone mission had been erected in the fluorescent lights the ceiling fans the vast network of haphazard wiringthese had been added later the doctor concluded that an electrical fire was entirely possible farrokh tried to familiarize himself with all the meetings that a good christian could go to there was an announced meeting of liturgical readers and the meeting of the members of the crossto make parish members more politically conscious the present topic of proposed conversation in the adult catholic education program was the christian today in the world of nonchristian religions this month the hope alive center was conducted by dr yusuf merchant dr daruwalla wondered what conducted by meant there was a get to know each other party for the altar service corps which farrokh suspected would be a grim gathering under the archway of the secondfloor balcony the doctor was struck by the unfinished irregularity of the pieces of stained glassas if the very notion of god were this fragmented this incomplete in the icon chapel the doctor abruptly closed a hymnal upon encountering the hymn called bring me oil then he read the bookmark that hed removed from the hymnal the bookmark celebrated st ignatiuss upcoming jubilee yeara labour of love in building youth for years there was also the word worldaffirming dr daruwalla had never had the slightest idea what this implied farrokh peeked into the hymnal again but even the name of the thing offended him it was called the song book of the charismatic renewal in indiahe hadnt known that there was any charismatic renewal and so he exchanged the hymnal for a prayer book wherein he looked no further than the opening line of the first prayer keep us lord as the apple of your eye dr daruwalla then discovered the holy fathers intentions for for january it was advised that the dialogue between the catholic and anglican communities continue in the quest for christian unity for february prayers were offered for those catholics who in many parts of the world suffered either verbal or physical persecution for march the parishioners were exhorted to give a more authentic witness for support of the needyand fidelity to the poverty of the gospels dr daruwalla couldnt read past march for the phrase poverty of the gospels stopped him farrokh felt surrounded by too much that was meaningless to him even brother gabriels fastidious collecting of icons meant little to the doctor and the iconcollection room at st ignatius was famous in bombay to farrokh the depictions were lugubrious and obscure there was a thcentury adoration of the magi of the ukrainian school there was a thcentury decapitation of john the baptist of the central northern school in the passing of our lord category there was a last supper a crucifixion a deposition the taking of christs body from the cross an entombment a resurrection and an ascension they were all icons from the th through the th centuries and they varied among the novgorod school the byzantine school the moscow school and so on there was one called the dormition of the virgin and that did it for dr daruwalla the doctor didnt know what the dormition was from the icons the doctor roamed to the father rectors office where something resembling a cribbage board was nailed to the closed door by means of holes and pegs father julian could indicate his whereabouts or availabilityback soon or do not disturb rec room or back late back for supper or out of bombay that was when dr daruwalla considered that he should be out of bombay that hed been born here didnt mean that he belonged here when he heard the bell signifying the end of school farrokh realized that it was already in the afternoon he stood on the secondfloor balcony and watched the schoolboys racing through the dusty courtyard cars and buses were taking them away either their mothers or their ayahs were coming to fetch them home from the perspective of the balcony dr daruwalla determined that they were the fattest children hed ever seen in india this was uncharitable not half the children at st ignatius were half as plump as farrokh nevertheless the doctor knew that he would no more interfere with the new missionarys zeal than he would choose to leap from the balcony and kill himself in front of these blameless children farrokh also knew that almost no one of rank at the mission would mistake martin mills for inspector dhar the jesuits werent known for their appreciation of socalled bollywood the trashy hindi film scene young women in soakingwet saris werent their thing superheroes and fiendish villains violence and vulgarity tawdriness and corninessand the occasional descending god intervening in pathetic merely human affairs inspector dhar was not famous at st ignatius among the schoolboys however more than one student of martin mills might note the resemblance inspector dhar was popular with schoolboys dr daruwalla still lingered he had things to do but he couldnt make himself leave he didnt know that he was writing it had never begun quite like this before when the children were gone he went inside st ignatius churchbut not to pray a huge wheel of unlit candles hung above the center table which resembled a refectory table only in its shape in fact it was a folding table of a household kindbetter suited say for sorting laundry the pulpit to the right of this table as farrokh faced the altar was equipped with an inappropriately shiny microphone upon this pulpit a lectionary lay open from which the doctor assumed that the lector would be readingpossibly at the evening mass dr daruwalla couldnt resist snooping the lectionary was open to the second epistle of paul to the corinthians therefore since we have this ministry as we have received mercy we do not lose heart wrote the converted one ii corinthians skipping ahead the doctor read we are hard pressed on every side yet not crushed we are perplexed but not in despair persecuted but not forsaken struck down but not destroyedalways carrying about in the body the dying of the lord jesus that the life of jesus may also be manifested in our body dr daruwalla felt small he ventured into a pew in one of the side aislesas if he wasnt significant enough in his lack of faith to sit in a centeraisle seat his own conversion seemed trifling and very far behind him in his daily thoughts he barely honored itperhaps he had been bitten by a monkey he concluded he noted that the church was without an organ another probably tuneless piano stood to the left of the folding tableanother inappropriately shiny microphone stood on it from far outside the church the doctor was aware of the constantly passing mopedsthe snarling of their lowpowered engines the ducklike quacking of their infernal horns the highly staged altarpiece drew the doctors eye there was christ on the cross and those two familiar women forlornly flanking him mother mary and mary magdalene dr daruwalla presumed the lifesized figures of the saints all in stone were mounted on the columns that defined the aisles these massive pillars each supported a saint and at the saints feet were tilted oscillating fanspointed down in order to cool the congregation blasphemously dr daruwalla noticed that one of the stone saints had worked herself loose from her pillar a thick chain had been secured around the saints neck and this chain was attached to the pillar by a sizable steel grommet the doctor wished he knew which saint she was he thought that all the female saints too closely resembled the virgin maryat least as statues whoever this saint was she appeared to have been hung in effigy but without the chain around her neck she might have toppled into a pew dr daruwalla judged that the stone saint was big enough to kill a pew of worshipers finally farrokh said his goodbyes to martin mills and the other jesuits the scholastic suddenly begged to hear the details of dr daruwallas conversion the doctor supposed that father julian had given martin a cunning and sarcastic rendition of the story oh it was nothing farrokh replied modestly this probably concurred with the father rectors version but i should love to hear about it martin said if you tell him yours im sure hell tell you his father julian said to farrokh maybe another time dr daruwalla said never had he so much desired to flee he had to promise that hed attend martins lecture at the ywca although he had no intentions of attending he would rather die than attend hed heard quite enough lecturing from martin mills its the ywca at cooperage you know father cecil informed him since dr daruwalla was sensitive to those bombayites who assumed that he barely knew his way around the city the doctor was snappish in his reply i know where it is farrokh said then a little girl appeared out of nowhere she was crying because shed come to st ignatius with her mother to pick up her brother after school and somehow theyd left without her thered been other children in the car it wasnt a crisis the jesuits decided the mother would realize what had happened and return to the school it was merely necessary to comfort the child and someone should call the mother so that shed not drive recklessly in fear that her daughter was lost but there was another problem the little girl confided to them that she needed to pee brother gabriel declared to dr daruwalla that there was no official peeing place for girls at st ignatius but where does miss tanuja pee martin mills asked good for him dr daruwalla thought hes going to drive them all crazy and i saw several women among the sweepers martin added there must be three or four women teachers arent there dr daruwalla asked innocently of course there was a peeing place for girls these old men simply didnt know where it was someone could see if a mens room is unoccupied father cecil suggested then one of us could guard the door father julian advised when farrokh finally left them all they were still discussing this awkward necessity to bend the rules the doctor presumed that the little girl still needed to pee tetracycline dr daruwalla was on his way back to the hospital for crippled children when he realized that hed started another screenplay he knew that this one would not be starring inspector dhar in his minds eye he saw a beggar working the arab hotels along marine drive he saw the queens necklace at night that string of yellow smog lights and he heard julia saying that yellow wasnt the proper color for the necklace of a queen for the first time farrokh felt that he understood the start of a storythe characters were set in motion by the fates that awaited them something of the authority of an ending was already contained in the beginning scene he was exhausted he had much to talk about with julia and he had to talk to john d dr daruwalla and his wife were having an early dinner at the ripon club then the doctor had planned to write a first draft of a little speech he would be giving soon hed been invited to say something to the society for the rehabilitation of crippled childrenthey were such faithful sponsors of the hospital but now he knew he would write all nightand not his speech at last he thought he had a screenplay in him that justified the telling in his minds eye he saw the characters arriving at victoria terminus but this time he knew where they were going he wondered if hed ever been so excited the familiar figure in dr daruwallas waiting room distracted the doctor from the story hed imagined among the waiting children the tall man indeed stood out even seated his military erectness immediately captured farrokhs attention the taut sallow skin and the slack mouth the lionyellow eyes the acidshriveled ear and the raw pink smear that had burned a swath along his jawline and down the side of his throat where it disappeared under the collar of mr gargs shirtall this captured dr daruwallas attention too one look at the nervously wriggling fingers of mr gargs locked hands confirmed farrokhs suspicions it was clear tc the doctor that garg was itching to know the specific nature of madhus sexually transmitted disease dr daruwalla felt only an empty triumph to see gargguilty and ready to grovel and reduced to waiting his turn among the crippled childrenwould be the full extent of the doctors slight victory for dr daruwalla knew even at this very moment that something more than professional confidentiality would prevent him from disclosing mr gargs guilt to deepa and vinod besides how could the dwarf and his wife not already know that garg diddled young girls it may have been gargs guilt that compelled him to allow deepa and vinod to attempt their circus rescues of so many of these children surely the dwarf and his wife already knew what farrokh was only beginning to guess that many of these little prostitutes would have preferred to stay with mr garg like the circus even the great blue nile maybe garg was better than a brothel mr garg stood and faced farrokh the eyes of every crippled child in dr daruwallas waiting room were fixed on the acid scar but the doctor looked only at the whites of gargs eyes which were a jaundiceyellowand at the deeper tawny lionyellow of gargs irises which offset his black pupils garg had the same eyes as madhu the doctor passingly wondered if they might be related i was here firstbefore any of them mr garg whispered ill bet you were said dr daruwalla if it was guilt that had flickered in gargs lion eyes it seemed to be fading a shy smile tightened his usually slack lips and something conspiratorial crept into his voice so i guess you know about madhu and me mr garg said what can one say to such a man dr daruwalla thought the doctor realized that deepa and vinod and even martin mills were right let every girlchild be an acrobat in the circus even in the great blue nileeven if they fall and die let them be eaten by lions for it was true that madhu was both a child and a prostituteworse she was mr gargs girl there was truly nothing to say to such a man only a strictly professional question came to dr daruwallas mind and he put it to garg as bluntly as he could are you allergic to tetracycline the doctor asked him strange customs southern california because he had a history of suffering in unfamiliar bedrooms martin mills lay awake in his cubicle at the mission of st ignatius at first he followed the advice of st teresa of avilaher favorite spiritual exercise which allowed her to experience the love of christbut not even this remedy would permit the new missionary to fall asleep the idea was to imagine that christ saw you mira que te mira st teresa said notice him looking at you but try as he might to notice such a thing martin mills wasnt comforted he couldnt sleep he loathed his memory of the many bedrooms that his awful mother and pathetic father had exposed him to this was the result of danny mills overpaying for a house in westwood which was near the ucla campus but which the family could rarely afford to live in it was perpetually rented so that danny and vera could live off the rent this also provided their decaying marriage with frequent opportunities for them not to live with each other as a child martin mills was always missing clothes and toys that had somehow become the temporary possessions of the tenants of the westwood house which he only vaguely could remember he remembered better the ucla student who was his babysitter for she used to drag him by his arm across wilshire boulevard at high speed and usually not at the proper crosswalks she had a boyfriend who ran around and around the ucla track shed take martin to the track and theyd watch the boyfriend run and run she made martins fingers ache she held his hand so tightly if the traffic on wilshire had forced an uncommonly hasty crossing of the boulevard martins upper arm would throb whenever danny and vera went out in the evening vera insisted that martin sleep in the other twin bed in the babysitters bedroom the rest of her quarters consisted only of a tiny kitchenettea kind of breakfast nook where a blackandwhite television shared the small countertop with a toaster here the babysitter sat on one of two barstools because there wasnt enough space for chairs and a table often when he lay in the bedroom with the babysitter martin mills could hear her masturbating because the room was sealed and permanently airconditioned more often he would wake up in the morning and detect that she had masturbated by the smell which was on the fingers of her right hand when she stroked his face and told him it was time for him to get up and brush his teeth then shed drive him to school which she did in a manner of recklessness equivalent to her habit of dragging him across wilshire boulevard there was an exit from the san diego freeway that seemed to draw out of the babysitter a dramatic catching of her breath which reminded martin mills of the sound she made while masturbating just before this exit martin would always close his eyes it was a good school an accelerated program conducted by the jesuits at loyola marymount university which was a fair drive from westwood but although the traveling to school and back was hazardous the fact that martin mills was first educated in facilities also used by university students seemed to have an austere effect on the boy befitting an experiment in earlychildhood educationthe program was discontinued after a few yearseven the chairs were grownupsized and the classrooms were not festooned with childrens crayon drawings or animals wearing the letters of the alphabet in the mens room used by these gifted children the smaller boys stood on a stool to peethese were the days before there were urinals at wheelchair level for the handicapped thus both at the towering urinals and in the undecorated classrooms it was as if these special children had been granted the opportunity to skip over childhood but if the classrooms and the urinals spoke of the seriousness of the business at hand they also suffered from the anonymity and impersonality of the many bedrooms in young martins life whenever the westwood house was rented danny and vera also lost the services of the ucla babysitter thenfrom other unfamiliar parts of towndanny would be the designated driver who spirited martin mills to his accelerated education at loyola marymount driving with danny was no less dangerous than the trip from and to westwood with the ucla babysitter danny would be hungover at the earlymorning hour if he wasnt still inebriated and by the time martin was ready to be picked up after school danny would have begun to drink again as for vera she didnt drive the former hermione rosen had never learned to drive which is not unusual among people who pass their teenage years in brooklyn or manhattan her father the producer harold rosen had also never learned to drive he was a frequent limousineuser and oncefor several months when danny mills had lost his drivers license to a dwi convictionharold had sent a limo to take martin mills to school on the other hand veras uncle the director gordon hathaway was a veteran speedster behind the wheel and his penchant for speed in combination with his permanently purple ears of varying deafness would result in the periodic suspension of his drivers license gordon never yielded to fire trucks or ambulances or police cars as for his own horn since he couldnt hear it he never used it and he was utterly oblivious to the warning blasts that emanated from other vehicles he would meet his maker on the santa monica freeway where he rearended a station wagon full of surfers gordon was killed instantly by a surfboard maybe it flew off the roof rack of the station wagon or out of the open tailgateeither way it came through gordons windshield there were ensuing vehicular collisions spanning four lanes in two directions and involving eight automobiles and a motorcycle only gordon was killed surely the director had a second or two to see his death coming but at his memorial service his renowned c of m sister who was harold rosens wife and veras mother remarked that gordons deafness had at least spared him the noise of his own death for it was generally agreed that the sounds of a ninevehicle collision must have been considerable nevertheless martin mills survived the harrowing trips to his advanced schooling at loyola marymount it was the bedroomstheir foreignness their disorientationthat got to him the quintessential sellout danny had rashly bought the westwood house with the money hed received for a threescreenplay deal unfortunately at the time he took the money the screenplays were unwrittennone would be produced then as always there were more deals based on unfinished work danny would have to rent westwood this depressed him he drank to blur his selfdisgust this also led him to live in other peoples houses these were usually the houses of producers or directors or actors to whom danny owed a finished screenplay since these philanthropic souls could stand neither the spectacle nor the company of the desperate writer they would vacate their houses and run off to new york or europe sometimes martin mills learned later vera would run off with them writing a script under such pressure was a process danny mills referred to as ballbusting which had long been a favorite expression of gordon hathaways as martin mills lay awake in his cubicle at st ignatius the new missionary couldnt stop himself from remembering these houses belonging to strangers who were always people in a position of power over his feckless father thered been the house belonging to a director in beverly hills it was on franklin canyon drive and danny lost the privilege of living there because the driveway was so steepthat was how danny put it what happened was he came home drunk he left the directors car in neutral with the brake off and the garage door open and the car rolled over a grapefruit tree and into the swimming pool this wouldnt have been so damaging had vera not been having an affair with the directors maid who the next morning dove naked into the swimming pool and broke her jaw and collarbone against the submerged windshield of the car this happened while danny was calling the police to report that the car had been stolen naturally the maid sued the director for having a car in his pool the movie that danny was writing at the time was never produced which was not an infrequent conclusion to danny busting his balls martin mills had liked that house if not that maid in retrospect martin regretted that his mothers sexual preference for young women had been passing her appetite for young men was messier as for martins particular bedroom in the house on franklin canyon drive it had seemed nicer than the rest it was a corner room with enough natural ventilation that he could sleep without the air conditioner that was why hed heard the car sinking into the swimming poolfirst the splash then all the bubbles but hed not gotten out of bed to look because he assumed it was his drunken father by the sound martin suspected that danny was cavorting with about a dozen drunken menthey were belching and farting underwater he deduced he had no idea a car had been involved in the morning up early as always martin had been only mildly surprised to see the car resting on the bottom of the deep end slowly it occurred to him that his father might be trapped inside martin was naked and crying when he ran downstairs to the swimming pool where he found the naked maid she was drowning under the diving board martin would never be credited with rescuing her he picked up the long pole with the net on one end which was used for skimming frogs and salamanders out of the water and he extended this to the brown ferallooking little woman of mexican descent but she couldnt speak because her jaw was broken and she couldnt lift herself out of the pool because her collarbone was broken too she held fast to the pole while martin towed her to the pool curb and there she clung she looked beseechingly at martin mills who covered his genitals with his hands from the depths of the pool the sunken car emitted another bubble that was when martins mother exited the maids bungalow which was next to the shed for pool toys wrapped in a towel vera saw martin standing naked by the deep end but she failed to see her floundering lover of the night before martin you know what i think of skinnydipping vera told the boy go put on your trunks before maria sees you maria of course was also skinnydipping as for putting on his clothes that was the moment when martin mills identified one of his dislikes for his repeated use of someone elses bedroom their clothes were in the drawersat best the bottommost drawers had been emptied for martinand their clothes hung lifelessly but prepossessingly in the closets their old toys filled up a chest their baby pictures were on the walls sometimes their tennis trophies or horseriding ribbons were displayed often there were shrines to their first dogs or cats apparently deceased this could be discerned by the presence of a glass jar that contained a dogs toenail or a tuft from a cats tail and when martin would carry his little triumphs home from schoolhis a papers and other evidence of his accelerated educationhe wasnt allowed to display these on their walls then in los angeles thered been an actors virtually unlivedin house on south lorrainea huge grandly conceived mansion with many small musty bedrooms all boasting blurry enlarged photographs of unknown children of a conspicuously similar age it seemed to martin that the children who grew up there had died when they were six or eight or that theyd uniformly become uninteresting subjects for photography upon reaching this approximate age but there had simply been a divorce in that house time had stoppedmartin had hated it thereand danny had at last outworn his welcome by falling asleep while smoking on the couch in front of the tv the smoke alarm woke him but he was drunk he called the police instead of the fire department and by the time that confusion was sorted out the entire living room was consumed in flames danny took martin to the pool where he paddled about on an inflated raft in the form of donald duckanother relic of the permanently six and eightyearold children danny waded back and forth in the shallow end of the pool although he wore long trousers and a wrinkled dress shirt instead of a bathing suit and he held the pages of his screenplayinprogress against his chest clearly he didnt want the pages to get wet together father and son watched the firefighters subduing the disaster the actor who was almost famous and whose living room was ruined came home much laterafter the fire was out and the firemen had left danny and martin mills were still playing in the swimming pool lets wait up for mommy so you can tell her all about the fire danny had suggested wheres mommy martin had asked out danny had replied she was out with the actor when vera and the actor returned together martin imagined that his father was slightly pleased with the smoldering wreck hed made of the living room the screenplay wasnt going too well it was to be an opportunity for the actor to do something timelyit was a story about a younger man with an older woman something bittersweet the actor had suggested vera was hoping for the role of the older woman but that screenplay was never made into a movie either martin mills was not sorry to leave those permanently six and eightyearold children on south lorraine in his stark cubicle at st ignatius in mazagaon the missionary was now looking for his copy of the pocket catholic catechism he hoped that these essentials of his faith might rescue him from reliving every bedroom hed ever slept in in california but he couldnt find the reassuring little paperback he presumed hed left it on dr daruwallas glasstopped tablein fact he had dr daruwalla had already put it to use farrokh had read up on extreme unction the sacrament of the anointing of the sick for this fit rather neatly into the new screenplay that the doctor was dying to begin hed also skimmed a passage about the crucifixionhe thought that he might make some sly use of it the doctor was feeling mischievous and the earlier hours of the evening had seemed interminable to him because nothing mattered to him as much as beginning this suddenly important piece of writing had martin mills known that dr daruwalla was about to recreate him as a character in a romantic comedy the unfortunate missionary might have welcomed the distraction of remembering his itinerant childhood in los angeles thered been another la house on kings road and martin had cautiously loved that one it had a fish pond and the producerowner kept rare birds which were unfortunately dannys responsibility while he lived and wrote there on the very first day martin had observed that the house had no screens the rare birds werent caged they were chained to their perches one evening during a dinner party a hawk flew inside the houseand then another hawk flew insideand to the considerable alarm of the assembled dinner guests the rare birds fell victims to these visiting birds of prey while the rare birds were shrieking and dying danny was so drunk that he insisted on finishing his version of how he was evicted from his favorite beachview duplex in venice it was a story that never failed to bring tears to martins eyes because it concerned the death of his only dog meanwhile the hawks swooped and killed and the dinner guestsat first just the womenput their heads under the diningroom table danny kept telling the story it had not yet occurred to young martin that the declining fortunes of his fathers screenwriting career would occasionally result in lowrent housing although this was a step down from freeloading in the generally welltodo homes of directors and producers and almostfamous actors the cheap rentals were at least free of other peoples clothes and toys in this sense these rentals seemed a step up to martin mills but not venice it had also not occurred to young martin that danny and vera were simply waiting for their son to be old enough to send away to school they presumed this would spare the child the continuing embarrassment of his parents livestheir virtually separate existences even within the confines of the same residence their coping with veras affairs and with dannys drinking but venice was too lowrent for vera she chose to spend the time in new york while danny was pounding the keys of a portable typewriter and dangerously driving martin to and from loyola marymount in venice theyd shared the groundfloor half of a shockingpink duplex on the beach it was the best place we ever lived because it was so fucking real danny explained to his cowering dinner guests isnt that right marty but young martin was silent he was noticing the death agonies of a mynahthe bird was succumbing to a hawk very near where the uneaten hors doeuvres still occupied a coffee table in the living room in truth martin thought venice had seemed rather unreal to him there were drugged hippies on south venice boulevard martin mills was terrified of such an environment but danny touched and surprised him by giving him a dog for a prechristmas present it was a beaglesized mongrel from the poundsaved from death danny said he named it whiskey because of its color and in spite of martins protests this must have condemned the dog to name it after booze whiskey slept with martin and martin was allowed to put his own things on the oceandamp walls when he came home from school he waited until the lifeguards were offduty before he took whiskey walking on the beach where for the first time he imagined he was the envy of those children who can always be found in public playgroundsin this case those children who stood in line to use the slide on venice beach surely they would have liked a dog of their own to walk on the sand for christmas vera visitedalbeit briefly she refused to stay in venice she claimed a suite of rooms at a plain but clean hotel on ocean avenue in santa monica there she ate a christmas breakfast with martinthe first of many lonely meals he would remember with his mother whose principal measure of luxury was drawn from her qualified praise of room service veronica rose repeatedly said that she would be happier living on reliable room service than in a house of her ownthrow the towels on the floor leave the dishes on the bed that kind of thing she gave young martin a dog collar for christmas which profoundly moved him because he could remember no other instance of apparent collaboration between his mother and father in this isolated case danny must have communicated with veraat least enough for vera to know that danny had given the boy a dog but on new years eve a roller skater who lived in the turquoise duplex next door fed the dog a big plate of marijuana lasagna when danny and martin took whiskey out for a walk after midnight the stoned runt attacked a weight lifters rottweiler whiskey was killed by the first snap and shake the rottweilers owner was a contrite sort of muscle man wearing a tank top and a pair of gym shorts danny fetched a shovel and the apologetic weight lifter dug an enormous grave in the vicinity of the childrens slide no one was permitted to bury a dead dog on venice beach some civicminded observer called the police martin was awakened by two cops very early on new years morning when danny was too hungover to assist him and there was no weight lifter available to help him dig the dead dog up when martin had finished stuffing whiskey in a trash bag one of the cops put the body in the trunk of the police car and the other cop at the moment he handed martin his fine asked the boy where he went to school im part of an accelerated educational program at loyola marymount martin mills explained to the cop not even this distinction would prevent the landlord from evicting danny and martin shortly thereafter out of fear of further trouble with the police by the time they left martin mills had changed his mind about the place almost every day hed seen the weight lifter with his murderous rottweiler andeither entering or leaving the turquoise duplex next doorthe roller skater with a fondness for marijuana lasagna was a daily presence too once again martin wasnt sorry to go it was danny who mindlessly loved the story in the producers house on kings road danny seemed to prolong the telling of the tale almost as if the ongoing bird deaths were an enhancement to the suddenness of poor whiskeys demise what a great fucking neighborhood that was danny was shouting to his dinner guests by now all the men had put their heads under the table with the women both sexes were fearful that the swooping hawks would mistake them for rare birds daddy there are hawks in the house martin had cried daddythe birds this is hollywood marty danny mills had replied dont worry about the birdsthe birds dont matter this is hollywood the story is all that matters that screenplay wasnt made into a movie either this was almost a refrain for danny mills the bill for the rare dead birds would reintroduce the millses to more lowrent housing it was at this juncture in his memories that martin mills struggled to stop remembering for if young martins familiarity with his fathers shortcomings was well established before the boy was sent away to school it was after hed been sent away that his mothers moral unconcern became more apparent and struck young martin as more odious than any weakness to be found in danny alone in his cubicle in mazagaon the new missionary now sought any means by which he might halt further memories of his mother he thought of father joseph moriarity sj hed been young martins mentor at loyola marymount and when martin had been sent to massachusettswhere he was not enrolled in jesuit or even in catholic schoolsit had been father joe whod answered the boys religious questions by mail martin mills also thought of brother brennan and brother labombard his coadjutores or fellow workers in his novice years at st aloysius he even remembered brother flynn inquiring if nocturnal emissions were allowedfor was this not the impossible namely sex without sin was it father toland or father feeney whod implied that a nocturnal emission was in all likelihood an unconscious act of masturbation martin was certain that it was either brother monahan or brother dooley whod inquired if the act of masturbation was still forbidden in the case of it being unconscious yes always father gannon had said father gannon was bonkers of course no priest in his right mind would call an involuntary nocturnal emission an act of masturbation nothing unconscious is ever a sin since sin implies freedom of choice father gannon would one day be taken bodily from his classroom at st aloysius for his ravings were considered to lend credence to those thcentury antipapist tracts in which convents are depicted as brothels for priests but how martin mills had approved of father gannons answer that will separate the men from the boys hed thought it was a rule hed been able to live withno nocturnal emissions unconscious or otherwise he never touched himself but martin mills knew that even his triumph over masturbation would lead him to thinking of his mother and so he tried to think of something elseof anything else he repeated times the date of august it was the day st ignatius loyola in a chapel in paris had taken the vow to go to jerusalem for minutes martin mills concentrated on the correct pronunciation of montmartre when this didnt workwhen he found himself seeing the way his mother brushed her hair before she went to bedmartin opened his bible to genesis chapter for the lords destruction of sodom and gomorrah always calmed him and within the story of gods wrath was also deftly planted that lesson in obedience which martin mills much admired it was terribly human of lots wife that she should look back even though the lord had commanded all of them do not look behind you but lots wife was nevertheless turned to a pillar of salt for her disobedience as well she should have been thought martin mills but even his pleasure at the lords destruction of those cities that flaunted their depravities did not spare the missionary from his keenest memories of being sent away to school turkey bird and country veronica rose and danny mills had agreed that their academically gifted son should attend a new england prep school but vera didnt wait for young martin to be of highschool age in veras view the boy was becoming too religious as if it wasnt enough that the jesuits were educating him theyd managed to put it in the boys head that he should attend mass on sunday and get himself to confession too what does this kid have to confess vera would ask danny she meant that young martin was far too well behaved for a normal boy as for mass vera said that it screwed up her weekends and so danny took him a free sunday morning was wasted on danny anyway with hangovers like his he might as well have been sitting and kneeling at a mass they sent young martin first to the fessenden school in massachusetts it was strict but not religious and vera liked it because it was close to boston when she visited martin she could stay at the ritzcarlton and not in some dreary motel or a cutesyquaint country inn martin started fessenden in the sixth grade and would stay through the ninth grade which was the schools final year he didnt feel especially sorry for himselfthere were even younger boarders at the school although the majority of boarders were of the fiveday variety which meant that they went home every weekend the sevenday boarders like martin included many foreign students or americans whose families were in diplomatic service in unfriendly countries some of the foreign students like martins roommate were the children of diplomats in residence in washington or new york despite the roommate for martin mills would rather have had a single room young martin enjoyed the crowded cubicle he was allowed to put his own things on the walls provided that this could be done without damage to the walls and that the subject matter was not obscene obscene subject matter wouldnt have tempted martin mills but young martins roommate was tempted his name was arif koma and he was from turkey his father was with the turkish consulate in new york arif stashed a calendar of women in bathing suits between his mattress and the bedsprings arif didnt offer to share his calendar with martin and the turk usually waited until he thought martin was asleep before he made masturbatory use of the women often a full half hour after the required lights out martin would notice arifs flashlightthe glow emerging from under the sheets and blanketand the corresponding creak of arifs bedsprings martin had looked at the calendar privatelywhen arif was in the shower or otherwise out of the cubicleand it appeared from the more abused pages that arif preferred march and august to the other women although martin couldnt fathom why but martin didnt observe the calendar in great detail or for long there was no door on the cubicle he shared with arifthere was only a curtainand should a faculty member have found him with the swimsuit calendar the women all months of them would have been confiscated martin would have considered this unfair to arif it was less out of growing friendship than out of some silent mutual respect that the two boys continued to be roommates into their final year at fessenden the school assumed that if you didnt complain about your roommate you must like him furthermore the boys had attended the same summer camp in the spring of his first year at fessenden when martin was sincerely missing his father and actually looking forward to what residential horrors he might encounter in the summer months back in la vera had sent the boy a summercamp brochure this was where he was going it was a matter that had already been decidedit wasnt a questionand as martin leafed through the brochure arif looked at the pictures with him i might as well go to that one too the turk had told martin i mean ill have to go somewhere but there was another reason they stayed together they were both unathletic and neither was inclined to assert any physical superiority over the other at a school like fessenden where sports were compulsory and the boys grew feverishly competitive arif and martin could protect their lack of athletic interest only by remaining roommates they joked to each other that fessendens most rabidly despised athletic rivals were schools named fay and fenn they found it comic that these were other f schools as if the letter f signified a conspiracy of athleticisma frenzy of the competitive spirit having concurred on this observation the two roommates devised a private way to indicate their contempt of fessendens obsessively athletic vigor arif and martin resolved not only to remain unathleticthey would use an f word for all the things they found distasteful about the school to the dominant colors of the faculty dress shirts which were a buttondown variety of pinks and yellows the boys would say fashionable of an unattractive faculty wife far from fetching to the school rule that the top button of the shirt must always be buttoned when wearing a tie they would respond with fastidious other favorites for varying encounters with the faculty and their fellow students included faltering fascistic fatuous fawning featherbrained fecal fervid fiendish fishy flatulent fogyish forbidding foul fraudulent freakish frigid fulsome and fussy these oneword adjectival signals amused them martin and arif became like many roommates a secret society naturally this led other boys to call them fags faggots fruits flits and fairies but the only sexual activity that took place in their shared cubicle was arifs regular masturbation by the time they were ninth graders they were given a room with a door this inspired arif to take fewer pains to conceal his flashlight with this memory the yearold missionary who was alone and wide awake in his cubicle at st ignatius realized that the subject of masturbation was insidious in a desperate effort to distract himself from where he knew this subject would lead himnamely to his mothermartin mills sat bolt upright on his cot turned on his light and began to read at random in the times of india it wasnt even a recent issue of the newspaper it was at least two weeks old and rolled into a tube and it was kept under the cot where it was handy for killing cockroaches and mosquitoes but thus it happened that the new missionary began the first of the exercises with which he intended to orient himself in bombay a more important matterthat being whether there was anything in the times of india that could defuse martins memory of his mother and her connection to the unwelcome theme of masturbationwould remain for the moment unresolved as martins luck would have it his eyes fell first upon the matrimonials he saw that a yearold publicschool teacher in search of a bride confessed to a minor squint in one eye a government servant with his own house admitted to a slight skewness in the legs but he maintained that he was able to walk perfectlyhe would also accept a handicapped spouse elsewhere a ish issueless widower of wheatish complexion sought a slim beautiful homely wheatish nonsmoker teetotaller vegetarian under with sharp features on the other hand the widower tolerantly proclaimed caste language state and education were no bar to him this was one of ranjits ads of course a bride seeking a groom advertised herself as having an attractive face with an embroidery diploma another slim beautiful homely girl who said she was planning to study computers sought an independent young man who was sufficiently educated not to have the usual hangups about fair complexion caste and dowry about all that martin mills could conclude from these selfadvertisements and these desires was that homely meant well suited for domestic life and that a wheatish complexion meant reasonably fairskinnedprobably a pale yellowbrown like dr daruwalla martin couldnt have guessed that the ish issueless widower of wheatish complexion was ranjit hed met ranjit who was darkskinneddefinitely not wheatish to the missionary any matrimonial advertisementany expressed longing to be a coupleseemed merely desperate and sad he got off his cot and lit another mosquito coil not because hed noticed any mosquitoes but because brother gabriel had lit the last coil for him and martin wanted to light one for himself he wondered if his former roommate arif koma had had a wheatish complexion no arif was darker than wheat martin thought remembering how clear the turks complexion had been in ones teenage years a clear complexion was more remarkable than any color in the ninth grade arif already needed to shave every day which made his face appear much more mature than the faces of the other ninth graders yet arif was utterly boyish in his lack of body hairhis hairless chest his smooth legs his girlishly unhairy bum such attributes as these connoted a feminine sleekness although theyd been roommates for three years it wasnt until the ninth grade that martin began to think of arif as beautiful later he would realize that even his earliest perception of arifs beauty had been planted by vera and how is your pretty roommatethat beautiful boy martins mother would ask him whenever she called it was customary in boarding schools for visiting parents to take their children out to dinner often roommates were invited along understandably martin millss parents never visited him together like a divorced couple although they werent divorced vera and danny saw martin separately danny usually took martin and arif to an inn in new hampshire for the thanksgiving holiday vera was more inclined to visits of a single night during the thanksgiving break in their ninthgrade year arif and martin were treated to the inn in new hampshire with danny and to a onenight visit with verathat being the saturday night of the long weekend danny returned the boys to boston where vera was waiting for them at the ritz she had arranged a twobedroom suite her quarters were rather grand with a kingsized bed and a sumptuous bathroom the boys received a smaller bedroom with two twin beds and an adjacent shower and toilet martin had enjoyed the time at the inn in new hampshire thered been a similar arrangement of rooms but different at the inn arif was given a bedroom and a bathroom of his own while danny had shared a room with twin beds with his son for this enforced isolation danny was apologetic to arif you get to have him as your roommate all the time danny explained to the turk surei understand arif had said after all in turkey seniority was the basic criterion for relationships of superiority and deference im used to deference to seniority arif had added pleasantly sadly danny drank too much he fell almost instantly asleep and snored martin was disappointed that thered been little conversation between them but before danny passed out and as they both lay awake in the dark the father had said to the son i hope youre happy i hope youll confide in me if youre ever not happyor just tell me what youre thinking in general before martin could think of what to say hed heard his fathers snores nevertheless the boy had appreciated the thought in the morning to have witnessed dannys affection and pride one would have presumed that the father and son had talked intimately then in boston on saturday night vera wanted to stray no farther than the dining room at the ritz her heaven was a good hotel and she was already in it but the dress code in the ritz dining room was even more severe than fessendens the captain stopped them because martin was wearing white athletic socks with his loafers vera said simply i was going to mention it darlingnow someone else has she gave him the room key to go change his socks while she waited with arif martin had to borrow a pair of arifs calflength black hose the incident drew veras attention to how much more comfortably arif wore proper clothes she waited for martin to rejoin them in the dining room before making her observation known it must be your exposure to the diplomatic life martins mother remarked to the turk i suppose there are all sorts of dressup occasions at the turkish embassy the turkish consulate arif corrected her as he had corrected her a dozen times im frightfully uninterested in details vera told the boy i challenge you to make the difference between an embassy and a consulate interestingi give you one minute this was embarrassing to martin for it seemed to him that his mother had only recently learned to talk this way shed been such a vulgar young woman and shed gained no further education since that trashy time of her life yet in the absence of acting jobs shed learned to imitate the language of the educated upper classes vera was clever enough to know that trashiness was less appealing in older women as for the adverb frightfully and the prefatory phrase i challenge you martin mills was ashamed to know where vera had acquired this particular foppery there was a pretentious brit in hollywood just another wouldbe director whod failed to get a film made danny had written the unsuccessful script to console himself the brit had made a series of moisturizer commercials they were aimed at the older woman who was making an effort to preserve her skin and vera had been the model shamelessly there was his mother in a revealing camisole seated in front of a makeup mirrorthe kind that was framed with bright balls of light superimposed the titles read veronica rose hollywood actress to martins knowledge this commercial had been his mothers first acting job in years im frightfully opposed to dry skin vera is saying to the makeup mirror and to the camera in this town only the youthful last the camera closes on the corners of her mouth a pretty finger applies the moisturizing lotion are those the telltale lines of age we see something appears to pucker the skin of her upper lip where it meets the welldefined edge of her mouth but then the lip is miraculously smooth again possibly this is only our imagination i challenge you to tell me im getting old the lips say it was a trick with the camera martin mills was sure before the closeup that was his mother yet those lips up close were unfamiliar to himsomeone elses younger mouth martin guessed it was a favorite tv commercial among the ninthgrade boys at fessenden when they gathered to watch an occasional television show in one of the dorm masters apartments the boys were always ready to answer the question that the closeup lips posed i challenge you to tell me im getting old youre already old the boys would shout only two of them knew that veronica rose the hollywood actress was martins mother martin would never have identified her and arif koma was a loyal roommate arif always said she looks young enough to me so it was doubly embarrassing in the ritz dining room when martins mother said to arif im frightfully uninterested in details i challenge you to make the difference between an embassy and a consulate interestingi give you one minute martin knew that arif must have known that the frightfully and the i challenge you had come from the moisturizer commercial in the roommates secret language martin mills suddenly said frightfully he thought arif would understand martin was indicating that his own mother merited an f word but arif was taking vera seriously an embassy is entrusted with a mission to a government and is headed by an ambassador the turk explained a consulate is the official premises of a consul who is simply an official appointed by the government of one country to look after its commercial interests and the welfare of its citizens in another country my father is the consul general in new yorknew york being a place of commercial importance a consul general is a consular officer of the highest rank in charge of lowerranking consular agents that took just thirty seconds martin mills informed his mother but vera was paying no attention to the time tell me about turkey she said to arif you have thirty seconds turkish is the mother tongue of more than ninety percent of the population and we are more than ninetynine percent muslims here arif koma paused for vera had shiveredthe word muslims made her shiver every time ethnically we are a melting pot the boy continued turks may be blond and blueeyed we may be of alpine stockthat is roundheaded with dark hair and dark eyes we may be of mediterranean stock dark but longheaded we may be mongoloid with high cheekbones what are you vera interrupted that was only twenty seconds martin pointed out but it was as if he werent there at the dinner table with them just the two of them were talking im mostly mediterranean arif guessed but my cheekbones are a little mongoloid i dont think so vera told him and where do your eyelashes come from from my mother arif replied shyly what a lucky mother said veronica rose whos going to have what asked martin mills he was the only one looking at the menu i think im going to have the turkey you must have some strange customs vera said to arif tell me something strangei mean sexually marriage is permitted between close kinunder the incest rules of islam arif answered something stranger vera demanded boys are circumcised at any age from about six to twelve arif said his dark eyes were downcast roaming the menu how old were you vera asked him its a public ceremony the boy mumbled i was ten so you must remember it very clearly vera said i think ill have the turkey too arif said to martin what do you remember about it arif vera asked him how you behave during the operation reflects on your familys reputation arif replied but as he spoke he looked at his roommatenot at his roommates mother and how did you behave vera asked i didnt cryit would have dishonored my family the boy told her ill have the turkey he repeated didnt you two have turkey two days ago vera asked them dont have the turkey againhow boring have something different okayill have the lobster arif replied thats a good choiceill have the lobster too vera said what are you having martin ill take the turkey said martin mills the sudden strength of his own will surprised him in the power of his will there was already something jesuitical this particular recollection gave the missionary the strength to return his attention to the times of india wherein he read about a family of whod been burned alive their house had been set on fire by a rival family martin mills wondered what a rival family was then he prayed for the souls whod been burned alive brother gabriel whod been awakened by roosting pigeons could see the light shining under martins door another of brother gabriels myriad responsibilities at st ignatius was to foil the pigeons in their efforts to roost at the mission the old spaniard could detect pigeons roosting in his sleep the many columns of the secondfloor outdoor balcony afforded the pigeons almost unlimited access to the overhanging cornices one by one brother gabriel had fenced in the cornices with wire after hed shooed away these particular pigeons he left the stepladder leaning against the column that way he would know which cornice to reenclose with wire in the morning when brother gabriel passed by martin millss cubicle again on his way back to bed the new missionarys light was still on pausing by the cubicle door brother gabriel listened he feared that young martin might be ill but to his surprise and eternal comfort brother gabriel heard martin mills praying such latenight litanies suggested to brother gabriel that the new missionary was a man very strongly in gods clutches yet the spaniard was sure hed misunderstood what he heard of the prayer it must be the american accent old brother gabriel thought for although the tone of voice and the repetition was very much in the nature of a prayer the words made no sense at all to remind himself of the power of his will which surely was evidence of gods will within him martin mills was repeating and repeating that longago proof of his inner courage ill take the turkey the missionary was saying ill take the turkey he said again he knelt on the stone floor beside his cot clutching the rolledup copy of the times of india in his hands a prostitute had tried to eat his culpa beads then shed thrown them away a dwarf had his whip hed rashly told dr daruwalla to dispose of his leg iron it would take a while for the stone floor to hurt his knees but martin mills would wait for the painworse he would welcome it ill take the turkey he prayed he saw so clearly how arif koma was unable to raise his dark eyes to meet veras fixed stare which so steadily scrutinized the circumcised turk it must have been frightfully painful vera was saying and you honestly didnt cry it would have dishonored my family arif said again martin mills could tell that his roommate was about to cry hed seen arif cry before vera could tell too but its all right to cry now she was saying to the boy arif shook his head but the tears were coming vera used her handkerchief to pat arifs eyes for a while arif completely covered his face with veras handkerchief it was a strongly scented handkerchief martin mills knew his mothers scent could sometimes make him gag ill take the turkey ill take the turkey ill take the turkey the missionary prayed it was such a steadysounding prayer brother gabriel decided oddly it reminded him of the pigeons maniacally roosting on the cornices two different men both wide awake it was a different issue of the times of india that dr daruwalla was readingit was the current days issue if the sleeplessness of this night seemed full of the torments of hell for martin mills dr daruwalla was exhilarated to feel so wide awake farrokh was merely using the times of india which he hated as a means to energize himself nothing enlivened him with such loathing as reading the review of a new inspector dhar film usual inspector dhar idiom the headline said farrokh found this typically infuriating the reviewer was the sort of cultural commissar whod never stoop to say a single favorable word about any inspector dhar film that dog turd which had prevented dr daruwalla from more than a partial reading of this review had been a blessing it was a form of foolish selfpunishment for the doctor to read the entire thing the first sentence was bad enough the problem with inspector dhar is his tenacious umbilical bindings with his first few creations farrokh felt that this sentence alone would provide him with the desired fury to write all night umbilical bindings dr daruwalla cried aloud then he cautioned himself not to wake up julia she was already angry with him he made further use of the times of india by putting it under his typewriter the newspaper would keep the typewriter from rattling against the glasstopped table he had set up his writing materials in the dining room his writing desk which was in the bedroom was out of the question at this late hour but hed never tried to write in the dining room before the glasstopped table was too low it had never been a satisfactory diningroom table it was more like a coffee tableto eat at it one sat on cushions on the floor now in an effort to make himself more comfortable farrokh tried sitting on two cushions he rested his elbows on either side of the typewriter as an orthopedist dr daruwalla was aware that this position was unwise for his back also it was distracting to peer through the glasstopped table at his own crossed legs and bare feet for a while the doctor was additionally distracted by what he thought was the unfairness of julias being angry with him their dinner at the ripon club had been hasty and quarrelsome it was a difficult day to summarize and julia was of the opinion that her husband was condensing too much interesting material in his recitation of the day she was ready to speculate all night on the subject of rahul rai as a serial killer moreover she was perturbed with farrokh that he thought her presence at the duckworth club lunch with detective patel and nancy would be inappropriate after all john d was going to be there im asking him to be present because of his memory dr daruwalla had claimed i suppose i dont have a memory julia had replied even more frustrating was that farrokh had not been successful in reaching john d hed left messages at both the taj and the oberoi concerning an important lunch at the duckworth club but dhar hadnt returned his calls probably the actor was still miffed about the unannouncedtwin business not that he would deign to admit it as for the efforts now under way to send poor madhu and the elephantfooted ganesh to the great blue nile circus julia had questioned the wisdom of farrokh involving himself in such dramatic intervention as she called it she wondered why hed never so directly undertaken the dubious rescue of maimed beggars and child prostitutes before dr daruwalla was irritated because he already suffered from similar misgivings as for the screenplay that the doctor was dying to begin julia expressed further criticism she was surprised that farrokh could be so selfcentered at such a timeimplying that it was selfish of him to be thinking of his own writing when so much that was violent and traumatic was happening in the lives of others theyd even had a spat about what to listen to on the radio julia chose those channels with programs that made her sleepy song miscellany and regional light music were her favorites but dr daruwalla became caught up in the last stages of an interview with some complaining writer who was incensed that there was no followthrough in india everything is left incomplete the writer was complaining we get to the bottom of nothing he cried as soon as we poke our noses into something interesting we take our noses away again the writers anger interested farrokh but julia flipped to a channel featuring instrumental music by the time dr daruwalla found the complaining writer again the writers anger was being directed at a news story hed heard today a rape and murder had been reported at the alexandria girls english institution the account that the writer had heard went as follows there was no rape and no murder as previously and erroneously reported at the alexandria girls english institution today this was the kind of thing that drove the writer crazy farrokh guessed it was what he meant by no followthrough its truly ridiculous to listen to this julia had said and so hed left her with her instrumental music now dr daruwalla put all this behind him he thought about limpsall the different kinds hed seen he wouldnt use madhus name he would call the girl in his screenplay pinky because pinky was a real star he would also make the girl much younger than madhu that way nothing sexual could threaten hernot in dr daruwallas story ganesh was the right name for the boy but in the movie the boy would be older than the girl farrokh would simply reverse the ages of the real children he would give his ganesh a bad limp too but not nearly so grotesquely crushed a foot as the real ganesh had it would be too hard to find a child actor with such a nasty deformity and the children should have a mother because the screenwriter had already planned how he would take their mother away storytelling was a ruthless business briefly dr daruwalla considered that hed not only failed to understand the country of his origin hed also failed to love it he realized he was about to invent an india he could both comprehend and lovea simplified version but his selfdoubt passedas selfdoubt must in order to begin a story it was a story set in motion by the virgin mary farrokh believed he meant the stone statue of the unnamed saint in st ignatius churchthe one that needed to be restrained with a chain and a steel grommet she wasnt really the blessed mother but she had nevertheless become the virgin mary to dr daruwalla he liked the phrase well enough to write it downa story set in motion by the virgin mary it was a pity that it wouldnt work as a title for a title he would need to find something shorter but the simple repetition of this phrase enabled him to begin he wrote it down again and then againa story set in motion by the virgin mary then he crossed out every trace of this phrase so that not even he could read it instead he said it aloudrepeatedly thus in the dead of night while almost five million residents of bombay were fast asleep on the sidewalks of the city these two men were wide awake and mumbling one spoke only to himselfa story set in motion by the virgin maryand this allowed him to get started the other spoke not only to himself but to god understandably his mumbles were a little louder he was saying ill take the turkey and his repetitionshe hopedwould prevent him from being consumed by that past which everywhere surrounded him it was the past that had given him his tenacious will which he believed was the will of god within him yet how he feared the past ill take the turkey said martin mills by now his knees were throbbing ill take the turkey ill take the turkey ill take the turkey a story set in motion by the virgin mary limo roulette in the morning julia found farrokh slumped over the glasstopped table as if hed fallen asleep while looking through the glass at the big toe of his right foot julia knew this was the same toe that had been bitten by a monkey for which the family had suffered some religious disruption she was thankful that the effects of the monkey bite had been neither fanatical nor longlasting but to observe her husband in the apparent position of praying to this same toe was disconcerting julia was relieved to see the pages of the screenplayinprogress which she realized had been the true object of farrokhs scrutinynot his toe the typewriter had been pushed aside the typed pages had many penciled corrections written on them and the doctor still held the pencil in his right hand it appeared to julia that her husbands own writing had served him as a soporific she assumed she was a witness to the genesis of yet another inspector dhar disaster but she saw at a glance that dhar was not the voiceover character after reading the first five pages she wondered if dhar was even in the movie how odd she thought altogether there were about pages she took them into the kitchen with her there she made coffee for herself and tea for farrokh the voiceover was that of a yearold boy whod been crippled by an elephant oh noits ganesh julia thought she knew the beggar whenever she left the apartment building he was there to follow her shed bought him many things most of which hed sold but his unusually good english had charmed her unlike dr daruwalla julia knew why ganeshs english was so polished once when hed been begging at the taj an english couple had spotted him they were traveling with a shy lonely boy a little younger than ganesh and the child had requested that they find him someone to play with there was also a nanny in tow and ganesh had traveled with this family for over a month they fed him and clothed him and kept him atypically cleanthey had him examined by a doctor to be sure he wasnt carrying any infectious diseasesjust so he could be a playmate for their lonely child the nanny taught ganesh english during the several hours of every day that she was under orders to give language instruction to the english boy and when it was time for the family to return to england they simply left ganesh where theyd found himbegging at the taj he quickly sold the unnecessary clothes for a time ganesh said hed missed the nanny the story had touched julia it also struck her as highly unlikely but why would the beggar have made it up now here was her husband putting the poor cripple in a movie and farrokh had given ganesh a sister a sixyearold girl named pinky she was a gifted street acrobat a sidewalk beggar who performed various tricks this didnt fool julia julia knew the real pinkyshe was a circus star it was also obvious that another inspiration for the fictional pinky was madhu deepa and vinods newest child prostitute in the movie farrokh had made pinky totally innocent these fictional children were also fortunate to have a mother not for long the mother is a sweeper at st ignatius where the jesuits have not only employed hertheyve converted her her children are strict vegetarian hindus theyre quite disgusted by their mothers conversion but especially by the concept of holy communion the idea that the wine really is christs blood and the bread really is his body well understandably this is nauseating to the little vegetarians it shocked julia to see that her husband as a writer was such a shameless borrower for she knew hed robbed the memoir of a nun it was a terrible story that had long amused himand old lowji before him the nun was working hard to convert a tribe of former cannibals she had a difficult time explaining the concept of the body and blood of jesus in the eucharist since there were many former cannibals in the tribe who could still remember eating human flesh the theological notion of holy communion pushed a lot of buttons for them julia saw that her husband was up to his usual blasphemies but where was inspector dhar julia halfexpected to see dhar come to the childrens rescue but the story went on without him the mother is killed in st ignatius church while genuflecting a statue of the virgin mary falls from a pedestal and crushes her she is given extreme unction on the spot ganesh does not mourn her passing greatly at least she was happy says his voiceover it is not every christian who is fortunate enough to be instantly killed by the blessed virgin if there was ever a time for dhar to come to the rescue nows the time julia thought but dhar didnt come instead the little beggars begin to play a game called limo roulette all the street children in bombay know there are two special limousines that cruise the city in one is a scout for the circusa dwarf named vinod of course the dwarf is a former circus clown his job is looking for gifted acrobats pinky is so gifted the crippled ganesh believes that vinod would let him go to the circus with pinkyso that he could look after her the problem is theres another scout hes a man who steals children for the freak circus hes called acid man because he pours acid on your face the acid is so disfiguring that your own family wouldnt recognize you only the circus for freaks will take care of you so farrokh was after mr garg again julia thought what an appalling story even without inspector dhar good and evil were once more plainly in position which scout would find the children first would it be the good samaritan dwarf or would it be acid man the limos move around at night we see a sleek car pass the children who run after it we see the brake lights flicker but then the dark car drives on other children are chasing after it we see a limousine stopped at the curb motor running the children approach it cautiously the driversside window opens a crack we see the stubby fingers on the edge of the glass like claws when the window is rolled down there is the dwarfs big head this is the right limothis is vinod or else its the wrong limo the back door opens a kind of frost escapes its as if the cars airconditioning is too coldthe car is like a freezer or a meat locker possibly the acid must be preserved at such a temperature maybe acid man himself must be kept this cold or else hell rot apparently the poor children wouldnt be forced to play limo roulette if the virgin mary hadnt toppled off a pedestal and murdered their mother what was her husband thinking julia wondered she was used to reading farrokhs first drafts his raw beginnings normally she felt she wasnt invading her husbands privacy he always shared with her his workinprogress but julia was worried that this screenplay was something hed never share with her there was something desperate about it probably it suffered from the potential disappointment of attempted arta vulnerability that had certainly been lacking in the doctors inspector dhar scripts it occurred to julia that farrokh might care too much about this one it was this reasoning that led her to return the manuscript to its previous position on the glasstopped table more or less between the typewriter and her husbands head farrokh was still asleep although a smile of droolingidiot proportions indicated that he was dreaming and he emitted a nasal hummingan unfollowable tune the awkward position of the doctors head on the glasstopped table allowed him to imagine that he was a child again napping at st ignatius school with his head on his desk in i suddenly farrokh snorted in his sleep julia could tell that her husband was about to wake up but she was startled when he woke up screaming she thought hed had a nightmare but it turned out to be a cramp in the arch of his right foot he looked so disheveled she was embarrassed for him then her anger with him returned that hed thought it inappropriate for her to attend the interesting lunch with the deputy commissioner and the limping hippie from years ago worse farrokh drank his tea without mentioning his screenplayinprogress he even attempted to conceal the pages in his doctors bag julia remained aloof when he kissed her goodbye but she stood in the open doorway of the apartment and watched him push the button for the lift if the doctor was demonstrating the early symptoms of an artistic temperament julia thought she should nip such an ailment in the bud she waited until the elevator door opened before she called to him if that ever was a movie julia said mr garg would sue you dr daruwalla stood dumbfounded while the elevator door closed on his doctors bag and then opened the door kept opening and closing on his bag as he stared indignantly at his wife julia blew him a kiss just to make him cross the elevator door grew more aggressive farrokh was forced to fight his way inside he hadnt time to retort to julia before the door closed and he was descending hed never successfully kept a secret from her besides julia was right garg would sue him dr daruwalla wondered if the creative process had eclipsed his common sense in the alley another blow to his common sense awaited him when vinod opened the door of the ambassador for him the doctor saw the elephantfooted beggar asleep in the back seat madhu had chosen to sit up front beside the dwarf driver except for the crusty exudation on his eyelashes the sleeping boy looked angelic his crushed foot was covered with one of the rags he carried for wiping off the fake bird shit even in his sleep ganesh had managed to conceal his deformity this wasnt a makebelieve ganesh but a real boy nevertheless farrokh found himself looking at the cripple as he might stand back and take pride in one of his fictional creations the doctor was still thinking about his story he was thinking that what would happen next to ganesh was entirely a matter of the screenwriters imagination but the real beggar had found a benefactor until the circus took him the back seat of vinods ambassador would doit was already better than what he was used to good morning ganesh the doctor said the boy was instantly awake as alert as a squirrel what are we doing today the beggar asked no more birdshit tricks the doctor said the beggar registered his understanding with a tightlipped smile but what are we doing the boy repeated were going to my office dr daruwalla said were waiting for some test results for madhu before we make our plans and this morning you will be kind enough not to practice the birdshit trick on those postoperative children in the exercise yard the boys black eyes kept darting with the movements of the traffic the doctor could see madhus face reflected in the rearview mirror shed not respondedshed not even glanced in the mirror at the mention of her name what concerns me about the circus dr daruwalla said he paused deliberately the emphasis hed given to the word had gained ganeshs full attention but not madhus my arms are the bestvery strong i could ride a ponyno legs necessary with hands as strong as mine ganesh suggested i could do lots of trickshang by my arms from an elephants trunk maybe ride a lion but what concerns me is that they wont let you do tricksno tricks dr daruwalla replied theyll give you all the bad jobs all the hard work scooping up the elephant shit for examplenot hanging from their trunks ill have to show them ganesh said but what do you do to the lions to make them stand on those little stools your job would be to wash the lion piss off the stools farrokh told him and what do you do with tigers ganesh asked what you would do with tigers is clean their cagestiger shit said dr daruwalla ill have to show them the boy repeated maybe something with their tailstigers have long tails the dwarf entered the roundabout that the doctor hated there were too many easily distracted drivers who stared at the sea and at the worshipers milling in the mudflats around haji alis tomb the rotary was near tardeo where farrokhs father had been blown to smithereens now in the midst of this roundabout the traffic swerved to avoid a lunatic cripple a legless man in one of those makeshift wheelchairs powered by a hand crank was navigating the rotary against the flow of other vehicles the doctor could follow ganeshs roaming gaze the boys black eyes either ignored or avoided the wheelchair madman the little beggar was probably still thinking about the tigers dr daruwalla didnt know the exact ending of his screenplay he had only a general idea of what would happen to his pinky to his ganesh caught in the roundabout the doctor realized that the fate of the real ganeshin addition to madhus fatewas out of his hands but farrokh felt responsible for beginning their stories just as surely as hed begun the story he was making up in the rearview mirror dr daruwalla could see that madhus lionyellow eyes were following the movements of the legless maniac then the dwarf needed to brake sharply he brought his taxi to a full stop in order to avoid the crazed cripple in the wrongway wheelchair the wheelchair sported a bumper sticker opposed to horn blowing practice the virtue of patience a battered oil truck loomed over the wheelchair lunatic in a fury the oiltruck driver repeatedly blew his horn the great cylindrical body of the truck was covered with foothigh lettering the color of flame worlds first choice gulf engine oils the oil truck also sported a bumper sticker which was almost illegible behind flecks of tar and splattered insects keep a fire extinguisher in your glove compartment dr daruwalla knew that vinod didnt have one as if it wasnt irritating enough to be obstructing traffic the cripple was begging among the stopped cars the clumsy wheelchair bumped against the ambassadors rear door farrokh was incensed when ganesh rolled down the rear window toward which the wheelchair madman extended his arm dont give that idiot anything the doctor cried but farrokh had underestimated the speed of birdshit boy dr daruwalla never saw the birdshit syringe only the look of surprise on the face of the crazed cripple in the wheelchair he quickly withdrew his armhis palm his wrist his whole forearm dripping bird shit vinod cheered got him ganesh said a passing paint truck nearly obliterated the wheelchair lunatic vinod cheered for the paint truck too celebrate with asian paints when the paint truck was gone from view the traffic moved againthe dwarfs taxi taking the lead the doctor remembered the bumper sticker on vinods ambassador hey you with the evil eye may your face turn black i said no more birdshit tricks ganesh farrokh told the boy in the rearview mirror dr daruwalla could see madhu watching him when he met her eyes she looked away through the open window the air was hot and dry but the pleasure of a moving car was new to the boy if not to the child prostitute maybe nothing was new to her the doctor feared but for the beggar if not for madhu this was the start of an adventure where is the circus ganesh asked is it far farrokh knew that the great blue nile might be anywhere in gujarat the question that concerned dr daruwalla was not where the circus was but whether it would be safe ahead the traffic slowed again probably pedestrians dr daruwalla thoughtshoppers from the nearby chowk crowding into the street then the doctor saw the body of a man in the gutter his legs extended into the road the traffic was squeezed into one lane because the oncoming drivers didnt want to drive over the dead mans feet or ankles a crowd was quickly forming soon there would be the usual chaos for the moment the only concession made to the dead man was that no one drove over him is the circus far ganesh asked again yes its farits a world apart said dr daruwalla a world apart was what he hoped for the boy whose bright black eyes spotted the body in the road ganesh quickly looked away the dwarfs taxi inched past the dead man once more vinod moved ahead of the traffic did you see that farrokh asked ganesh see what the cripple said there is a man being dead vinod said they are nonpersons ganesh replied you think you seem them but they are not really being there o god keep this boy from becoming a nonperson dr daruwalla thought his fear surprised him he couldnt bring himself to seek the cripples hopeful face in the rearview mirror madhu was watching the doctor again her indifference was chilling it had been quite a while since dr daruwalla had prayed but he began india wasnt limo roulette there were no good scouts or bad scouts for the circus there was no freak circus either there were no rightlimo wronglimo choices for these children the real roulette would begin after they got to the circusif they got there at the circus no good samaritan dwarf could save them at the great blue nile acid mana comicbook villainwasnt the danger mother mary in the new missionarys cubicle the last mosquito coil had burned out just before dawn the mosquitoes had come with the early gray light and had departed with the first heat of the dayall but the mosquito that martin mills had mashed against the white wall above his cot hed killed it with the rolledup issue of the times of india after the mosquito was full of blood the bloodstain on the wall was conspicuous and only a few inches below the crucifix that hung there which gave martin the gruesome impression that a sizable drop of christs blood had spotted the wall in his inexperience martin had lit the last mosquito coil too close to his cot when his hand trailed on the floor his fingers must have groped through the dead ashes then in his brief and troubled sleep hed touched his face this was the only explanation for the surprising view of himself that he saw in the pitted mirror above the sink his face was dotted with fingerprints of ash as if hed meant to mock ash wednesdayor as if a ghost had passed through his cubicle and fingered him the marks struck him as a sarcastic blessing or else they made him look like an insincere penitent when hed filled the sink and wet his face to shave he held the razor in his right hand and reached for the small sliver of soap with his left it was a jaggedshaped piece of such an iridescent bluegreen color that it was reflected in the silver soap dish it turned out to be a lizard which leaped into his hair before he could touch it the missionary was frightened to feel the reptile race across his scalp the lizard launched itself from the top of martins head to the crucifix on the wall above the cot then it jumped from christs face to the partially open slats of the window blind through which the light from the low sun slanted across the floor of the cubicle martin mills had been startled in an effort to brush the lizard out of his hair hed slashed his nose with the razor an imperceptible breeze stirred the ashes from the mosquito coils and the missionary watched himself bleed into the water in the sink hed long ago given up shaving lather plain soap was good enough in the absence of soap he shaved himself in the cold bloody water it was only in the morning martin mills had to survive another hour before mass he thought it would be a good idea to go to st ignatius church early if the church wasnt locked he could sit quietly in one of the pewsthat usually helped but his stupid nose kept bleeding he didnt want to bleed all over the church hed neglected to pack any handkerchiefshed have to buy someand so for now he chose a pair of black socks although they were of a thin material not very absorbent at least they wouldnt show the bloodstains he soaked the socks in fresh cold water in the sink he wrung them out until they were merely damp he balled up a sock in each hand and first with one hand and then the other he restlessly dabbed at the wound on his nose someone watching martin mills dress himself might have suspected the missionary of being in a deep trance a less kind observer might have concluded that the zealot was semiretarded for he wouldnt put down the socks the awkward pulling on of his trouserswhen he tied his shoes he held the socks in his teethand the buttoning of his shortsleeved shirt these normally simple tasks were turned arduous almost athletic these clumsy feats were punctuated by the ceaseless dabbing at his nose in the second buttonhole of his shirt martin mills affixed a silver cross like a lapel pin and together with this adornment he left a thumbprint of blood on his shirt for the socks had already stained his hands st ignatius church was unlocked the father rector unlocked the church at every morning and so martin mills had a safe place to sit and wait for mass for a while he watched the altar boys setting up the candles he sat in a centeraisle pew alternately praying and dabbing at his bleeding nose he saw that the kneeling pad was hinged martin didnt like hinged kneelers because they reminded him of the protestant school where danny and vera had sent him after fessenden st lukes was an episcopalian place as such in martins view it was barely a religious school at all the morning service was only a hymn and a prayer and a virtuous thought for the day which was followed by a curiously secular benedictionhardly a blessing but some sage advice about studying relentlessly and never plagiarizing sunday church attendance was required but in st lukes chapel the service was of such a low episcopalian nature that no one knelt for prayers instead the students slumped in their pews probably they werent sincere episcopalians and whenever martin mills would attempt to lower the hinged kneeling padso that he could properly kneel to prayhis fellow students in the pew would firmly hold the hinged kneeler in the upright nonpraying position they insisted on using the kneeling pad as a footrest when martin complained to the schools headmaster the reverend rick utley informed the underclassman that only senior catholics and senior jews were permitted to attend worship services in their churches and synagogues of choice until martin was a senior st lukes would have to doin other words no kneeling in st ignatius church martin mills lowered the kneeling pad and knelt in prayer in the pew was a rack that held the hymnals and prayer books whenever martin bled on the binding of the nearest hymnal he dabbed at his nose with one sock and wiped the hymnal with the other he prayed for the strength to love his father for merely pitying him seemed insufficient although martin knew that the task of loving his mother was an insurmountable one he prayed for the charity to forgive her and he prayed for the soul of arif koma martin had long ago forgiven arif but every morning he prayed that the holy virgin would forgive arif too the missionary always began this prayer in the same way o mother mary it was my fault martin prayed in a way the new missionarys story had also been set in motion by the virgin maryin the sense that martin held her in higher esteem than he held his own mother had vera been killed by a falling statue of the blessed virginespecially if such good riddance had occurred when the zealot was of a tender unformed agemartin might never have become a jesuit at all his nose was still bleeding a drop of his blood dripped on the hymnal once more the missionary dabbed at his wound arbitrarily he decided not to wipe the song book perhaps he thought that bloodstains would give the hymnal character after all it was a religion steeped in bloodchrists blood and the blood of saints and martyrs it would be glorious to be a martyr martin thought he looked at his watch in just half an hour if he could make it the missionary knew he would be saved by the mass is there a gene for it whatever it is in his steppedup efforts to save madhu from mr garg dr daruwalla placed a phone call to tata two but the obgyns secretary told farrokh that dr tata was already in surgery the poor patient whoever she was dr daruwalla thought farrokh wouldnt want a woman he knew to be subjected to the uncertain scalpel of tata two for fairly or unfairly farrokh assumed that the surgical procedures of the second dr tata were secondrate too it was quickly apparent to dr daruwalla that tata twos medical secretary lived up to the family reputation for mediocrity because the doctors simple request for the quickest possible results of madhus hiv test were met with suspicion and condescension dr tatas secretary had already identified himself rather arrogantly as mister subhash you are wanting a rush job mr subhash asked dr daruwalla are you being aware that you are paying more for it of course farrokh said it is normally costing four hundred rupees mr subhash informed dr daruwalla a rush job is costing you a thousand rupees or is the patient paying no im paying i want the quickest possible results farrokh replied it is normally taking ten days or two weeks mr subhash explained it is most conveniently being done in batches we are normally waiting until we are having forty specimens but i dont want you to wait in this case dr daruwalla replied thats why i calledi know how its normally done if the elisa is being positive we are normally confirming the results by western blot the elisa is having a lot of false positives you know mr subhash explained i know said dr daruwalla if you get a positive elisa please send it on for a western blot this is prolonging the turnaround time for a positive test mr subhash explained yes i know dr daruwalla replied if the test is being negative you are having the results in two days mr subhash explained naturally if it is being positive then it would take longeri know dr daruwalla cried please just order the test immediately thats why i called only dr tata is ordering the testing mr subhash said but of course i am telling him what you are wanting thank you dr daruwalla replied is there anything else you are wanting mr subhash asked there had been something else but farrokh had forgotten what it was that hed meant to ask tata two doubtless it would come back to him please just ask dr tata to call me farrokh replied and what is being the subject you are wishing to discuss with dr tata mr subhash asked it is a subject of discussion between doctors dr daruwalla said i am telling him mr subhash said testily dr daruwalla resolved that he would never again complain about the nincompoopish matrimonial activities of ranjit ranjit was competent and he was polite moreover dr daruwallas secretary had steadfastly maintained his enthusiasm for the doctors dwarfblood project no one else had ever encouraged the doctors genetic studiesleast of all the dwarfs dr daruwalla had to admit that even his own enthusiasm for the project was slipping the elisa test for hiv was simple in comparison to farrokhs genetic studies for the latter had to be performed on cells rather than on serum whole blood needed to be sent for the studies and the unclotted blood had to be transported at room temperature blood specimens could cross international boundaries although the paperwork was formidable the specimens were usually shipped on dry ice to preserve the proteins but in the case of a genetic study shipping dwarf blood from bombay to toronto was risky it was likely that the cells would be killed before reaching canada dr daruwalla had solved this problem with the help of an indian medical school in bombay the doctor let their research lab perform the studies and prepare the slides the lab gave farrokh finished sets of photographs of the chromosomes it was easy to carry the photographs back to toronto but there the dwarfblood project had stalled through a close friend and colleaguea fellow orthopedic surgeon at the hospital for sick children in torontofarrokh had been introduced to a geneticist at the university even this contact proved fruitless for the geneticist maintained that there was no identifiable genetic marker for this type of dwarfism the geneticist at the university of toronto was quite emphatic to farrokh it was farfetched to imagine that he would find a genetic marker for this autosomal dominant traitachondroplasia is transmitted by a single autosomal dominant gene this was a type of dwarfism that resulted from a spontaneous mutation in the case of a spontaneous mutation unaffected parents of dwarf children have essentially no further risk of producing another dwarf child the unaffected brothers and sisters of an achondroplastic dwarf are similarly not at riskthey wont necessarily produce dwarfs either the dwarfs themselves on the other hand are quite likely to pass the trait on to their childrenhalf their children will be dwarfs as for a genetic marker for this dominant characteristic none could be found dr daruwalla doubted that he knew enough about genetics to argue with a geneticist the doctor simply continued to draw samples of the dwarfs blood and he kept bringing the photographs of the chromosomes back to toronto the u of t geneticist was discouraging but fairly friendly if not sympathetic he was also the boyfriend of farrokhs friend and colleague at the hospital for sick childrensick kids they called the hospital in toronto farrokhs friend and the geneticist were gay dr gordon macfarlane who was the same age as dr daruwalla had joined the orthopedic group at the hospital for sick children in the same year as farrokh their hospital offices were next door to each other since farrokh hated to drive he often rode back and forth to work with macfarlane they both lived in forest hill early on in their relationship thered been those comic occasions when julia and farrokh had tried to interest mac in various single or divorced women eventually the matter of macfarlanes sexual orientation grew clear in no time mac was bringing his boyfriend to dinner dr duncan frasier the gay geneticist was renowned for his research on the socalled and elusive gay chromosomes frasier was used to being teased about it biological studies of homosexuality generally irritate everybody the debate as to whether homosexuality is present at birth or is a learned behavior is always inflamed with politics conservatives reject scientific suggestions that sexual orientation is biological liberals anguish over the possible medical misuse of an identifiable genetic marker for homosexualityshould one be found but dr frasiers research had led him to a fairly cautious and reasonable conclusion there were only two natural sexual orientations among humansone in the majority one in the minority nothing hed studied about homosexuality nor anything hed personally experienced or had ever felt could persuade dr frasier that either homosexuality or heterosexuality was a matter of choice sexual orientation wasnt a lifestyle we are born with what we desirewhatever it is frasier liked to say farrokh found it an interesting subject but if the search for gay genes was so fascinating to dr frasier it discouraged dr daruwalla that the gay geneticist would entertain no hope of finding a genetic marker for vinods dwarfism sometimes dr daruwalla was guilty of thinking that frasier had no personal interest in dwarfs whereas gays got the geneticists full attention nevertheless farrokhs friendship with macfarlane was unshakable soon farrokh was admitting to his gay friend how hed always disliked the word gay in its current commonplace homosexual sense to farrokhs surprise mac had agreed he said he wished that something as important to him as his homosexuality had a word of its owna word that had no other meaning gay is such a frivolous word macfarlane had said dr daruwallas dislike of the contemporary usage of the word was more a generational matter than a matter of prejudiceor so the doctor believed it was a word his mother meher had loved but overused we had a gay time she would say what a gay evening we hadeven your father was in a gay mood it disheartened dr daruwalla to see this oldfashioned adjectivea synonym for jolly or merry or frolicsome or blithetake on a much more serious meaning come to think of it straight isnt an original word either farrokh had said macfarlane laughed but his longtime companion frasier responded with a touch of bitterness what youre telling us farrokh is that you accept gays when were so quiet about it that we might as well still be in the closetand provided that we dont dare call ourselves gay which offends you isnt that what youre saying but this wasnt what farrokh meant im not criticizing your orientation dr daruwalla replied i just dont like the word for it there lingered an air of dismissiveness about dr frasier the rebuke reminded dr daruwalla of the geneticists dismissal of the notion that the doctor might find a genetic marker for the most common type of dwarfism the last time dr daruwalla had brought dr frasier the photographs of the dwarfs chromosomes the gay geneticist had been more dismissive than usual those dwarfs must be bleeding to death farrokh frasier told him why dont you leave the little buggers alone if i used the word bugger you would be offended farrokh said but what did dr daruwalla expect dwarf genes or gay genes genetics was a touchy subject all this left farrokh feeling full of contempt for his own lack of followthrough on his dwarfblood project dr daruwalla didnt realize that his notion of followthrough or lack thereof had originated with the radio interview hed briefly overheard the previous eveningthat silliness with the complaining writer but at last the doctor stopped brooding on the dwarfblood subject farrokh now made the mornings second phone call the enigmatic actor it was early to call john d but dr daruwalla hadnt told him about rahul the doctor also wanted to stress the importance of john ds attending the lunch at the duckworth club with detective patel and nancy to farrokhs surprise it was an alert inspector dhar who answered the phone in his suite at the taj you sound awake dr daruwalla said what are you doing im reading a playactually two plays john d replied what are you doing isnt it time you were cutting open someones knee this was the famous distant dhar the doctor felt hed created this character cold and sarcastic farrokh immediately launched into the news about rahulthat he had a female identity these days that in all likelihood the complete sex change had been accomplished but john d seemed barely interested as for participating in the lunch at the duckworth club not even the prospect of taking part in the capture of a serial murderer or murderess could engage the actors enthusiasm i have a lot of reading to do john d told farrokh but you cant read all day the doctor said what reading i told youtwo plays said inspector dhar oh you mean homework farrokh said he assumed that john d was studying his lines for his upcoming parts at the schauspielhaus zürich the actor was thinking of switzerland of his day job the doctor supposed john d was thinking of going home after all what was keeping him here if under the present threat he gave up his membership at the duckworth club what would he do with himself stay in his suite at the taj or at the oberoi like farrokh john d lived at the duckworth club when he was in bombay but now that the murderer is known its absurd to resign from the club dr daruwalla cried any day now theyre going to catch him catch her inspector dhar corrected the doctor well him or her farrokh said impatiently the point is the police know who theyre looking for there wont be any more killings i suppose seventy is enough john d said he was in a simply infuriating mood dr daruwalla thought so what are these plays farrokh asked in exasperation i have only two leading roles this year john d replied in the spring its osbornes der entertainerim billy riceand in the fall im friedrich hofreiter in schnitzlers das weite land i see farrokh said but this was all foreign to him he knew only that john daruwalla was a respected professional as an actor and that the schauspielhaus zürich was a sophisticated city theater with a reputation for performing both classical and modern plays in farrokhs opinion they gave short shrift to slapstick he wondered if there were more slapstick comedies performed at the bernhard or at the theater am hechtplatzhe didnt really know zürich the doctor knew only what his brother jamshed had told him and jamshed was no veteran theatergoerhe went to see john d in addition to jamsheds possibly philistine opinions there was what little information farrokh could force out of the guarded dhar the doctor didnt know if two leading roles a year were enough or if john d had chosen only two such roles the actor went on to say that he had smaller parts in something by dürrenmatt and something by brecht a year ago hed made his directing debutit was something by max frischand hed played the eponymous volpone in the ben jonson play next year john d had said he hoped to direct gorkis wassa schelesnowa it was a pity that everything had to be in german dr daruwalla thought except for his outstanding success as inspector dhar john d had never acted in films he never auditioned was he lacking in ambition dr daruwalla wondered for it seemed a mistake for dhar not to take advantage of his perfect english yet john d said he detested england and he refused to set foot in the united states he ventured to toronto only to visit farrokh and julia the actor wouldnt even stray to germany to audition for a film many of the guest performers at the schauspielhaus zürich were german actors and actresseskatharina thalbach for example jamshed had once told farrokh that john d had been romantically linked with the german actress but john d denied this dhar never appeared in a german theater and to farrokhs knowledge there was no one at the schauspielhaus zürich to whom the actor had ever been romantically linked dhar was a friend of the famous maria becker but not romantically a friend besides dr daruwalla guessed maria becker would be a little too old for john d and jamshed had reported seeing john d out to dinner at the kronenhalle with christiane hörbiger who was also famousand closer to john ds age the doctor speculated but dr daruwalla suspected that this sighting was no more significant than spotting john d with any other of the regular performers at the schauspielhaus john d was also friends with fritz schediwy and peter ehrlich and peter arens dhar was seen dining on more than one occasion with the pretty eva rieck jamshed also reported that he frequently saw john d with the director gerd heinzand as often with a local terror of the avantgarde matthias frei john d as an actor eschewed the avantgarde yet apparently he was on friendly terms with one of zürichs elder statesmen of such theater matthias frei was a director and occasional playwright a kind of deliberately underground and incomprehensible fellowor so dr daruwalla believed frei was about the doctors age but he looked older more rumpled he was certainly wilder jamshed had told farrokh that john d even split the expense of renting a flat or a chalet in the mountains with matthias frei one year they would rent something in the grisons another year theyd try the bernese oberland supposedly it was agreeable for them to share a place because john d preferred the mountains in the ski season and matthias frei liked the hiking in the summer also dr daruwalla presumed freis friends would be people of a different generation from john ds friends but once again farrokhs view of the culture john d inhabited was marginal as for the actors love life there was no understanding his aloofness hed appeared to have a long relationship with someone in a publishing housea publicist or so farrokh remembered her she was an attractive intelligent younger woman theyd occasionally traveled together but not to india for dhar india was strictly business theyd never lived together and now farrokh was told this publicist and john d were just good friends julia surmised that john d didnt want to have children and that this would eventually turn most younger women away but now at john d might meet a woman his own age or a little oldersomeone who would accept childlessness or julia had said perhaps hed meet a nice divorced woman whod already had her childrensomeone whose children would be grownups that would be ideal for john d julia had decided but dr daruwalla didnt think so inspector dhar had never exhibited a nesting instinct the rentals in the mountains a different one each year utterly suited john d even in zürich he made a point of owning very little his flatwhich was within walking distance of the theater the lake the limmat the kronenhallewas also rented he didnt want a car he seemed proud of his framed playbills and even an inspector dhar poster or two in zürich dr daruwalla supposed these hindi cinema advertisements were probably amusing to john ds friends they could never have imagined that such craziness translated into a raving audience beyond the wildest dreams of the schauspielhaus in zürich jamshed had observed john d was infrequently recognized he was hardly the bestknown of the schauspielhaus troupe not exactly a character actor he was also no star in restaurants around town theatergoers might recognize him but they wouldnt necessarily know his name only schoolchildren after a comedy would ask for his autograph the children simply held out their playbills to anyone in the cast jamshed said that zürich had no money to give to the arts thered recently been a scandal because the city wanted to close down the schauspielhaus keller this was the more avantgarde theater for younger theatergoers john ds friend matthias frei had made a big fuss as far as jamshed knew the theater was always in need of money technical personnel hadnt been given an annual raise if they quit they werent replaced farrokh and jamshed speculated that john ds salary couldnt be very significant but of course he didnt need the money inspector dhar was rich what did it matter to dhar that the schauspielhaus zürich was inadequately subsidized by the city by the banks by private donations julia also implied that the theater somewhat complacently rested on its illustrious history in the s and s when it was a refuge for people fleeing from germany not only jews but social democrats and communistsor anyone whod spoken out against the nazis and as a result either wasnt permitted to work or was in danger thered been a time when a production of wilhelm tell was defiant even revolutionarya symbolic blow against the nazis many swiss had been afraid to get involved in the war yet the schauspielhaus zürich had been courageous at a time when any performance of goethes faust might have been the last theyd also performed sartre and von hofmannsthal and a young max frisch the jewish refugee kurt hirschfeld had found a home there but nowadays julia thought there were many younger intellectuals who might find the schauspielhaus rather staid dr daruwalla suspected that staid suited john d what mattered to him was that in zürich he was not inspector dhar when the hindi movie star was asked where he lived because it was obvious that he spent very little time in bombay dhar always replied with characteristic vagueness that he lived in the himalayasthe abode of snow but john ds abode of snow was in the alps and in the city on the lake the doctor thought that dhar was probably a kashmiri name but neither dr daruwalla nor inspector dhar had ever been to the himalayas now on the spur of the moment the doctor decided to tell john d his decision im not writing another inspector dhar movie farrokh informed the actor im going to have a press conference and identify myself as the man responsible for inspector dhars creation i want to call an end to it and let you off the hookso to speak if you dont mind the doctor added uncertainly of course i dont mind john d said but you should let the real policeman find the real murdereryou dont want to interfere with that well i wont dr daruwalla said defensively but if youd only come to lunch i just thought you might remember something you have an eye for detail you know what sort of detail have you got in mind john d asked well anything you might remember about rahul or about that time in goa i dont know reallyjust anything farrokh said i remember the hippie said inspector dhar he began with his memory of her weight after all hed carried her down the stairs of the hotel bardez and into the lobby she was very solid shed looked into his eyes the whole time and there was her fragrancehe knew shed just had a bath then in the lobby shed said if its not too much trouble you could do me a big favor shed showed him the dildo without removing it from her rucksack dhar remembered its appalling size and the head of the thing pointing at him the tip unscrews nancy had told him she was still watching his eyes but im just not strong enough it was screwed together so tightly he needed to grip the big cock in both hands and then she stopped him as soon as hed loosened the tip thats enough she told him im going to spare you she said too softly you dont want to know whats inside the thing it had been quite a challengeto meet her eyes to stare her down john d had focused on the idea of the big dildo inside her he believed that she would see in his eyes what he was thinking what he thought hed seen in nancys eyes was that shed courted danger beforemaybe it had even thrilled herbut that she wasnt so sure about danger anymore then shed looked away i cant imagine whats become of the hippie dr daruwalla blurted out suddenly its inconceivablea woman like that with deputy commissioner patel lunch is tempting if only to see what she looks like after twenty years said inspector dhar hes just acting thought dr daruwalla dhar didnt care what nancy looked like something else was on the actors mind so youll come to lunch the doctor asked sure why not the actor said but dr daruwalla knew that john d wasnt as indifferent as he seemed as for inspector dhar hed never intended to miss the lunch at the duckworth club and he thought he would rather be murdered by rahul than resign his membership under a threat so coarse that it had to be left in a dead mans mouth it was not how nancy looked that mattered to him rather he was an actora professionaland even years ago hed known that nancy had been acting she wasnt the young woman shed pretended to be twenty years ago even the young john d could tell that nancy had been terrified that shed been bluffing now the actor wanted to see if nancy was still bluffing if she was still pretending maybe now dhar thought nancy had stopped acting maybe now after years she simply let her terror show something rather odd it was in the morning when nancy awoke in her husbands arms vijay was holding her the way she loved to be held it was the best way for her to wake up and she was astonished at what a good nights sleep shed had she felt vijays chest against her back his delicate hands held her breasts his breath slightly stirred her hair detective patels penis was quite stiff and nancy could feel its light but insistent pulse against the base of her spine nancy knew she was fortunate to have such a good husband and such a kind one she regretted how difficult she was to live with vijay took such pains to protect her she began to move her hips against him it was one of the ways he liked to make love to herto enter her from behind while she was on her side but the deputy commissioner didnt respond to the rolling motion of his wifes hips although he truly worshiped her nakednessher whiteness her blondness her voluptuousness the policeman let go of nancys breasts and simultaneously with his retreating from her she noticed that the bathroom door was open they always went to sleep with the door closed the bedroom smelled fresh like soap her husband had already had his morning shower nancy turned to face vijayshe touched his wet hair he couldnt meet her eyes its almost seven oclock the detective told her detective patel was normally out of bed before he usually left for crime branch headquarters before but this morning hed let her sleep hed showered and then hed got back into bed beside her hed merely been waiting for her to wake up nancy thought yet he hadnt been waiting to have sex what are you going to tell me nancy asked him what have you not told me vijay its really nothingjust a little lunch patel replied we areat the duckworth club the policeman told her with the doctor you mean nancy said with the actor too i imagine the detective said oh vijay no not dhar she cried i think dhar will be there vijay told her they both know rahul he explained it sounded crude to him to put it the way hed said it yesterday to the doctor to compare notes and so he said it could be valuable just to hear what all of you remember there might be some detail that would help me his voice trailed off he hated to see his wife so withdrawn then she was suddenly wracked with sobs were not members of the duckworth club nancy cried weve been invitedwere guests patel told her but theyll see me theyll think im horrible nancy moaned they know youre my wife they just want to help the deputy commissioner replied what if rahul sees me nancy asked him she was always raising this question would you recognize rahul patel asked the detective thought it was unlikely that any of them would recognize rahul but the question was spurious nancy wasnt in disguise i dont think so but maybe nancy said deputy commissioner patel dressed himself and left her while she was still naked in the bedroom nancy was aimlessly searching through her clothes the dilemma of what she should wear to the duckworth club was gradually overwhelming her vijay had told her that he would come home from the police station to drive her to the duckworth club nancy wouldnt have to get herself there but the detective doubted that shed heard him hed have to come home early because he suspected she would still be naked in the bedroom possibly shed have progressed to trying on her clothes sometimes on her good days she wandered into the kitchen which was the only room where the sun penetrated the apartment and she would lie on the countertop in a long patch of sunlight the sun came through the open window for only two hours of the morning but it was enough to give her a sunburn if she didnt apply some protection to her skin once shed stretched herself out on the countertop completely naked and a woman from a neighboring flat had called the police the caller had described nancy as obscene after that shed always worn something even if it was only one of vijays shirts sometimes she wore sunglasses too although she liked to have a nice tan and the sunglasses gave her raccoon eyes she said she never shopped for food because she said the beggars assailed her nancy was a decent cook but vijay did the shopping they didnt believe in grocery lists he brought home something that appealed to him and she would think of a way to prepare it once or twice a month she went out to buy books she preferred shopping curbside along churchgate and at the intersection of mahatma gandhi and hornby roads she liked secondhand books best especially memoirs her favorite was a combat widow of the raja memoir that ended with a suicide note she also bought a lot of remaindered american novels for one of these novels she rarely paid more than rupeessometimes as little as she said that beggars didnt bother people who bought books once or twice a week vijay took her out to dinner although theyd still not spent all of the dildo money they thought they couldnt afford the hotel restaurants which were the only places where nancy could feel she was anonymousamong foreigners only once had they argued about it vijay had told her that he suspected she preferred the hotel restaurants because she could imagine that she was only a tourist just passing through hed accused her of wishing that she didnt live in indiaof wanting to be back in the states shed showed him the next time they went to their regular restauranta chinese place called kamling at churchgatenancy had summoned the owner to their table shed asked the owner if he knew that her husband was a deputy commissioner indeed the chinese gentleman knew thiscrime branch headquarters was nearby just opposite crawford market well then nancy wanted to know how come you never offer us a free meal after that they always ate there for free they were treated splendidly too nancy said that with the money theyd saved they could afford to go to one of the hotel restaurantsor at least to one of the hotel barsbut they rarely did so on those few occasions nancy mercilessly criticized the food she would also pick out the americans and say hateful things about them dont you dare tell me that i want to go back to the states vijay she said she only had to say it once the deputy commissioner never suggested it again and nancy could tell he was pleased all of it had needed saying this was how they lived with a delicate passionwith something usually held back they were so careful nancy felt it was unfair that a lunch at the duckworth club could completely undo her she put on one of the dresses that she knew she would never wear to the club she didnt bother with underwear because she supposed she would just keep changing it nancy went into the kitchen and made some tea for herself then she found her sunglasses and she stretched out on her back in the long patch of sunlight on the countertop shed forgotten to put any sunscreen on her faceit was hard to find sunscreen in bombaybut she told herself that she would lie there for only an hour in a half hour shed take the sunglasses off she didnt want raccoon eyes but she wanted dr daruwalla and inspector dhar to see that she was healthy that she took care of herself nancy wished the apartment had a view she would have liked to see a sunrise or a sunset what were they saving the dildo money for coming from iowa nancy would have especially appreciated a view of the arabian sea which was the view to the west instead she stared out the open window she could see other women in the windows of other apartments but they were constantly in motion too busy to notice her one day nancy hoped she might spot the woman whod called the police and told them that she was obscene but nancy didnt know how she would ever recognize the anonymous caller this thought led her to wondering if she would recognize rahul it was of more concern to nancy that rahul might recognize her what if she was alone just buying a book and rahul saw her and knew who she was she lay on the countertop staring at the sun until it was blocked by an adjacent building now ill have raccoon eyes she told herself but another thought obsessed her that she would one day be standing right next to rahul and she wouldnt know who rahul was yet rahul would know who she was that was her fear nancy removed the sunglasses but she remained motionless on her back on the countertop she was thinking about the curl to inspector dhars lip he had an almost perfect mouth and she recalled how the curl to his lip had first struck her as friendly even inviting then shed realized he was sneering at her nancy knew she was attractive to men in years shed gained pounds but only a woman would have been troubled by the way shed put on the weight the pounds had spread themselves over her generously they hadnt all ended up in her face or on the backs of her thighs nancys face had always been round but it was still firm her breasts had always been goodnow for most men they were better certainly they were bigger her hips were a little fuller her waist a little thicker the exaggerated curvaceousness of her body lent to her overall figure a voluptuous definition her waist however thickened still went in her breasts and her hips still stood out she was about dhars age not quite but it was not only her blondness or the fairness of her skin that made her seem younger it was her nervousness she was as awkward as a teenager who believes everyone is staring at her this was because she was convinced that rahul was watching her everywhere she went unfortunately in a crowd or in a new place where people would look at herand people tended to look at her both men and womennancy became so selfconscious that she found it difficult to speak she thought that people stared at her because she was grotesque on her good days she thought she was merely fat and whenever she was around strangers she would recall dhars sneer shed been a pretty girl then but he hadnt noticed shed shown him a huge dildo and shed asked him quite suggestively to unscrew it for her shed added that she was sparing him to not let him see what was inside the thing yet in his sneer thered not been the smallest measure of attraction to her nancy believed that shed disgusted him she wandered back into the bedroom where she removed the unsuitable dress once again she stood naked she was surprised at herself for wanting to look her best for inspector dhar she thought she hated him but the strangest conviction was compelling her to dress herself for him she knew he wasnt a real inspector but nancy believed that dhar had certain powers nancy believed that it would not be her beloved husband vijay patel who would catch the killer nor would the funny doctor be the hero there was no reason for itnone beyond the authority of an actors sneerbut nancy believed that inspector dhar would be rahuls undoing but what exactly did dhar like he must like something rather odd nancy decided a faint ridge of blond fuzz extended from her pubic hair to her navel which was especially long and deep when nancy rubbed her belly with coconut oil this blond streak of fur would darken slightly and become more noticeable if she wore a sari she could leave her navel bare maybe dhar would like her furry navel nancy knew that vijay liked it our lady of victories another author in search of an ending the second mrs dogar also suspected dhar of unconventional sexual interests it was frustrating to the former rahul that inspector dhar had not returned the recently married womans attentions and although both the disapproving mr sethna and dr daruwalla had observed the unrequited flirtations of mrs dogar neither gentleman had truly appreciated the seriousness of mrs dogars designs the former rahul did not suffer rejection lightly while farrokh had been struggling to begin his first artistic screenplay his first quality picture the second mrs dogar had also undertaken the first draft of a storyinprogress she had hatched a plot last night at the duckworth club the second mrs dogar had loudly denounced her husband for having had too much to drink mr dogar had had no more than his usual one whiskey and two beers he was surprised at his wifes accusations this is your night to drivethis is my night to drink mrs dogar had said shed spoken distinctly and deliberately in the presence of the everdisapproving mr sethnaone waiter and one busboy had overheard her tooand shed chosen to utter her criticism at a lull in the other conversations in the ladies garden where the grieving bannerjees were the only duckworthians still dining the bannerjees had been having a late sober dinner the murder of mr lal had upset mrs bannerjee too much to cook and her intermittent conversation with her husband had concerned what efforts they might make to comfort mr lals widow the bannerjees would never have guessed that the second mrs dogars rude outburst was as premeditated as her intentions to soon join mrs lal in the state of widowhood rahul had married mr dogar out of eagerness to become his widow also deliberately mrs dogar had turned to mr sethna and said my dear mr sethna would you kindly call us a taxi my husband is in no condition to drive us home promila please mr dogar began to say give me your keys mrs dogar commanded him you can take a taxi with me or you can call your own taxi but youre not driving a car sheepishly mr dogar handed her his ring of keys now just sit heredont get up and wander around mrs dogar told him mrs dogar herself stood up wait for me she ordered her husbandthe rejected designated driver when mr dogar was alone he glanced at the bannerjees who looked away not even the waiter would look at the condemned drunk and the busboy had slunk into the circular driveway to smoke a cigarette rahul timed how long everything took heor rather she if outward anatomy is the measure of a man or a womanwalked into the mens room by the door from the foyer she knew no one could be in the mens room for none of the waitstaff were permitted to use itexcept mr sethna who so disapproved of peeing with the hired help that he made uncontested use of the facilities marked for members only the old steward was more in charge of the duckworth club than any member but mrs dogar knew that mr sethna was busy calling a taxi since shed become a woman mrs dogar didnt regret not using the mens room at the duckworth club its decor wasnt as pleasing to her as the ladies roomrahul loathed the mens room wallpaper she found the tigerhunting motif brutal and stupid she moved past the urinals the toilet stalls the sinks for shaving and into the darkened locker room which extended to the clubhouse and the clubhouse bar these latter facilities were never in use at night and mrs dogar wanted to be sure that she could navigate their interiors in darkness the big windows of frosted glass admitted the moonlight that reflected from the tennis courts and the swimming pool which was presently under repair and not in service it was an empty cementlined hole with some construction debris in the deep end and the members were already betting that it wouldnt be ready for use in the hotter months ahead mrs dogar had sufficient moonlight to unlock the rear door to the clubhouse she found the right key in less than a minutethen she relocked the door this was just a test she also found mr dogars locker and unlocked it it took the smallest key on the ring and mrs dogar discovered that she could easily find this key by touch she unlocked and relocked the locker by touch too although she could see everything in the moonlight one night she might not have the moon rahul could quite clearly make out the shrine of old golf clubs displayed on the wall these were the clubs of famous golfers past and of some living less famous duckworthians who had retired from active play mrs dogar needed to assure herself that these clubs could be easily removed from the wall after all it had been a while since rahul had visited the mens locker room she hadnt been there since shed been a boy when shed handled a few of the clubs to her satisfaction she went back into the mens roomafter assuring herself that neither mr sethna nor mr bannerjee was using the facilities she knew her husband wouldnt leave the table in the ladies garden he did what he was told when she could see from the mens room that there was no one in the foyer she returned to the ladies garden she went directly to the bannerjees tablethey werent friends of the dogarssand she whispered to them im sorry for my outspokenness but when hes like this hes virtually a babyhes so senile hes not to be trusted and not only in a car one night after dinnerhe had all his clothes oni stopped him just before he dove into the club pool the empty pool said mr bannerjee im glad you understand mrs dogar replied thats what im talking about if i dont treat him like a child hell hurt himself then she went to her husband leaving the bannerjees with this impression of mr dogars senility and selfdestructiveness for her husband being found dead in the deep end of the clubs empty pool was one of the possible outcomes for the first draft that the second mrs dogar was hard at work on she was merely foreshadowing as any good storyteller does she also knew that she should set up other options and these alternative endings were already in her mind i hate to treat you like this darling but just sit tight while i see about our cab mrs dogar told her husband he was bewildered although his second wife was in her fifties she was a young woman in comparison to what mr dogar had been used to the old gentleman was in his seventieshed been a widower for the last years he supposed these swings of mood were characteristic among younger women he wondered if perhaps he had drunk too much he did remember that his new wife had lost a brother to an automobile accident in italy he just couldnt recall if alcohol had been the cause of the wreck now rahul was off whispering to mr sethna who disapproved of women whispering to menfor whatever reason my dear mr sethna the second mrs dogar said i do hope youll forgive my aggressive behavior but hes simply not fit to wander about the clubmuch less drive a car im sure hes the one whos been killing the flowers mr sethna was shocked by this allegation but he was also eager to believe it was true something or someone was killing the flowers an undiagnosed blight had struck patches of the bougainvillea the head mali was stymied here at last was an answer mr dogar had been pissing on the flowers hes incontinent mr sethna inquired not at all said mrs dogar hes doing it deliberately he wants to kill the flowers mr sethna asked im glad you understand mrs dogar replied poor man with a wave she indicated the surrounding golf course naturally he wanders out there only after dark like a dog he always goes to the same spots territorial i suppose said mr sethna im glad you understand mrs dogar said now wheres our cab in the taxi old mr dogar looked as if he wasnt sure if he should apologize or complain but before he could decide his younger wife once more surprised him oh darling never let me treat you like that againat least not in public im so ashamed she cried theyll think i bully you you mustnt let me if i ever tell you that you cant drive a car again heres what you must do are you listening or are you too drunk mrs dogar asked him no i mean yes im listening mr dogar said no im not too drunk the old man assured her you must throw the keys on the floor and make me pick them up as if i were your servant mrs dogar told him what he asked then tell me that you always carry an extra set of keys and that youll drive the car home when and if you choose then tell me to gotell me you wouldnt drive me home if i begged you mrs dogar cried but promila i would never mr dogar began to say but his wife cut him off just promise me one thingnever back down to me she told him then she seized his face in her hands and kissed him on his mouth first you should tell me to take a taxiyou just carry on sitting at the dinner table as if youre smoldering with rage then you should go to the mens room and wash your face wash my face said mr dogar with surprise i cant stand the smell of food on your face darling mrs dogar told her husband just wash your facesoap and warm water then come home to me ill be waiting for you thats how i want you to treat me only you must wash your face first promise me it had been years since mr dogar had been so aroused nor had he ever been so confused it was difficult to understand a younger woman he decidedyet surely worth it this was a pretty good first draft rahul felt certain the next time mr dogar would do as he was told he would be abusive to her and tell her to go but she would take the taxi no farther than the access road to the duckworth club or perhaps three quarters of the length of the drivewayjust out of the reach of the overhead lamps shed tell the driver to wait for her because shed forgotten her purse then shed cross the first green of the golf course and enter the clubhouse through the rear door which she would have previously unlocked shed take off her shoes and cross the dark locker room and wait there until she heard her husband washing his face shed either kill him with a single blow from one of the retired golf clubs in the locker room or if possible kill him by lifting his head by his hair and smashing his skull against the sink her preference for the latter method was because she preferred the swimmingpool ending shed be careful to clean the sink then mrs dogar would drag her husbands body out the rear door of the clubhouse and dump him in the deep end of the empty pool she wouldnt keep her taxi waiting longat the most minutes but killing him with a golf club would certainly be easier after she had clubbed her husband to death she would put a tworupee note in his mouth and stuff his body in his locker the note which mrs dogar already carried in her purse displayed a typed message on the serialnumber side of the money because dhar is still a member it was an intriguing decisionwhich ending rahul would choosefor although she liked the appearance of the accidental death in the deep end of the pool she also favored the attentiongetting murder of another duckworthian especially if inspector dhar didnt give up his membership the second mrs dogar was quite sure that dhar wouldnt resign at least not without another killing to coax him into it the way it happened to mr lal it was an embarrassed and exhaustedlooking mr dogar who appeared at the duckworth club before the next morning looking every inch the portrait of a hangover but it wasnt alcohol that had wrecked him mrs dogar had made violent love to him the previous night shed scarcely waited for the taxi to depart their driveway or for mr dogar to unlock the doorshed given him back his keys they were fortunate that the servants didnt mistake them for intruders for mrs dogar had pounced on her husband in the front hall shed torn the clothes off both of them while they were still on the first floor of the house then shed made the old man run up the stairs after her and shed straddled him on the bedroom floor she wouldnt let him crawl a few feet farther so that they could do it on the bednor had she once volunteered to relinquish the top position this was of course another firstdraft possibility that old mr dogar would suffer a heart attack while rahul was deliberately overexciting him but the second mrs dogar had resolved that she wouldnt wait as long as a year for this natural ending to occur it was simply too boring if it happened soon fine if not there was always the golfclub lockerroom ending in this version it amused the second mrs dogar to imagine how they might finally find the body she would report that her husband had not come home for the night they would find his car in the duckworth club parking lot the waitstaff would relate what had transpired after the dogars had eaten their dinner doubtless mr sethna would convey more intimate information it was possible that no one would think to look for mr dogar in his locker until the body began to stink but the swimmingpool version also intrigued rahul the bannerjees would confide to the authorities that such a dive in the pool was reputed to be the old fools inclination mrs dogar herself could always say i told you so for rahul the hard part about this version would be maintaining a straight face and the rumor that old mr dogar was pissing on the bougainvillea was already established when the ashamed mr dogar appeared at the duckworth club to claim his car he spoke in apologetic tones to the disapproving mr sethna to whom the very idea of urinating outdoors was repugnant did i seem especially drunk to you mr sethna mr dogar asked the venerable steward im really very sorry if i behaved insensitively nothing happened really mr sethna replied coldly hed already spoken to the head mali about the bougainvillea the fool gardener confirmed that there were only isolated patches of the blight the dead spots in the bougainvillea bordered the green at the fifth and the ninth holes both these greens were out of sight of the duckworth club dining room and the clubhousealso they couldnt be seen from the ladies garden as for that bougainvillea which surrounded the ladies garden there was only one dead patch and it was suspiciously in a spot that was out of sight from any of the clubs facilities mr sethna surmised that this gave credence to mrs dogars urine theorypoor old mr dogar was peeing on the flowers it would never have occurred to the old steward that a womannot even as vulgar a member of the species as mrs dogarcould be the pissing culprit but the killer was no amateur at foreshadowing shed been systematically murdering the bougainvillea for months one of many things that the new mrs dogar liked about wearing dresses was that it was comfortable not to wear underwear the only thing rahul missed about having a penis was how convenient it had been to pee outdoors but her penchant for pissing on certain outoftheway plots of the bougainvillea was not whimsical while in the pursuit of this odd habit mrs dogar had been mindful of her larger workinprogress even before the unfortunate mr lal had happened upon her while she was squatting in the bougainvillea by the fatal ninth hole which had long been mr lals nemesis rahul had already made a plan in her purse for weeks shed carried the tworupee note with her first typed message to the duckworthians more members die if dhar remains a member shed always assumed that the easiest duckworthian to murder would be someone who stumbled into her in one of her outoftheway peeing places shed thought it would happen at nightin the darkness shed imagined a younger member than mr lal probably someone whod drunk too much beer and wandered out on the nighttime golf coursedrawn by the same need that had drawn mrs dogar there shed imagined a brief flirtationthey were the best kind so you had to pee too if you tell me what you like about doing it outdoors ill tell you my reasons or maybe what else do you like to do outdoors mrs dogar had also imagined that she might indulge in a kiss and a little fondling she liked fondling then she would kill him whoever he was and shed stick the tworupee note in his mouth shed never strangled a man with her hand strength she didnt doubt she could do it shed never much liked strangling womennot as much as she enjoyed the pure strength of a blow from a blunt instrumentbut she was looking forward to strangling a man because she wanted to see if that old story was true if men got erections and ejaculated when they were close to choking to death disappointingly old mr lal had offered mrs dogar neither the opportunity for a brief flirtation nor the novelty of a strangulation rahul was so lazy she rarely made breakfast for herself although he was officially retired mr dogar left early for his office and mrs dogar often indulged in an earlymorning pee on the golf coursebefore even the most zealous golfers were on the fairways then shed have her tea and some fruit in the ladies garden and go to her health club to lift weights and skip rope shed been surprised by old mr lals earlymorning assault on the bougainvillea at the ninth green rahul had only just finished peeing she rose up out of the flowers and there was the old duffer plodding off the green and tripping through the vines mr lal was searching for a challenging spot in this jungle in which to deposit the stupid golf ball when he looked up from the flowers the second mrs dogar was standing directly in front of him shed startled him sofor a moment she thought it would be unnecessary to kill him he clutched his chest and staggered away from her mrs dogar he cried whats happened to you has someone molested you thus he gave her the idea after all her dress was still hiked up to her hips clearly distraught she wriggled her dress down she would change into a sari for lunch oh mr lal thank god its you she cried ive been taken advantage of she told him what a world mrs dogar but how may i assist you help the old man shouted out oh no please i couldnt bear to see anyone elseim so ashamed she confided to him but how may i help you mrs dogar mr lal inquired its painful for me to walk she confessed they hurt me they the old man shouted perhaps if you would lend me one of your clubs if i could just use it as a cane mrs dogar suggested mr lal was on the verge of handing her his nine iron then changed his mind the putter would be best he declared poor mr lal was out of breath from the short trot to his golf bag and his stumbling return to her side through the tangled vines the destroyed flowers he was much shorter than mrs dogar she was able to put one of her big hands on his shoulderthe putter in her other hand that way she could see over the old mans head to the green and the fairway no one was there you could rest on the green while i fetch you a golf cart mr lal suggested yes thank youyou go ahead she told him he tripped purposefully forward but she was right behind him before he reached the green she had struck him senselessshe hit him just behind one ear after hed fallen she bashed him directly in the temple that was turned toward her but his eyes were already open and unmoving when she struck him the second time mrs dogar suspected hed been killed by the first blow in her purse she had no difficulty finding the tworupee note for years shed clipped her small bills to the top half of that silver ballpoint pen which shed stolen from the beach cottage in goa she even kept this silly memento well polished the clipthe pocket clasp as her aunt promila had called itcontinued to maintain the perfect tension on a small number of bills and the polished silver made the top half of the pen easy to spot in her purse she hated how small things could become lost in purses shed inserted the tworupee note in mr lals gaping mouth to her surprise when she closed his mouth it opened again shed never tried to close a dead persons mouth before shed assumed that the body parts of the dead would be fairly controllable that had certainly been her experience with manipulating limbssometimes an elbow or a knee had been in the way of her belly drawing and shed easily rearranged it the distracting detail of mr lals mouth was what caused her to be careless shed returned the remaining small notes to her purse but not the top half of the welltraveled pen it must have fallen in the bougainvillea she hadnt been able to find it later and there in the bougainvillea was the last place she recalled holding it in her hand mrs dogar assumed that the police were presently puzzling over it with the widow lals help theyd probably determined that the top half of the pen hadnt even belonged to mr lal mrs dogar speculated that the police might even conclude that no duckworthian would be caught dead with such a pen that it was made of real silver was somehow negated by the sheer tackiness of the engraved word india rahul found tacky things amusing it also amused rahul to imagine how aimlessly the police must be tracking her for mrs dogar believed that the halfpen would be just another link in a chain of meaningless clues some small tragedy it was after mr dogar had apologized to mr sethna and retrieved his car from the duckworth club parking lot that the old steward received the phone call from mrs dogar is my husband still there i suppose not id meant to remind him of something to attend tohes so forgetful he was here but hes gone mr sethna informed her did he remember to cancel our reservation for lunch i suppose not anyway were not coming rahul told the steward mr sethna prided himself in his daily memorizing of the reservations for lunch and dinner he knew that thered been no reservation for the dogars but when he informed mrs dogar of this fact she surprised him oh the poor man she cried he forgot to cancel the reservation but he was so drunk last night that he forgot to make the reservation in the first place this would be comic if it werent also so tragic i suppose i suppose mr sethna replied but rahul could tell that shed achieved her goal one day mr sethna would be an important witness to mr dogars utter frailty foreshadowing was simply necessary preparation rahul knew that mr sethna would be unsurprised when mr dogar became a victimeither of a murder in the locker room or of a swimmingpool mishap in some ways this was the best part of a murder rahul believed in the first draft of a workinprogress you had so many optionsmore options than you would end up with in the final act it was only in the planning phase that you saw so many possibilities so many variations on the outcome in the end it was always over too quickly that is if you cared about neatness you couldnt prolong it the poor man mrs dogar repeated to mr sethna the poor man indeed mr sethna thought with a wife like mrs dogar mr sethna presumed it might even be a comfort to already have one foot in the grave so to speak the old steward had just hung up the phone when dr daruwalla called the duckworth club to make a reservation there would be four for lunch the doctor informed mr sethna he hoped no one had already taken his favorite table in the ladies garden there was plenty of room but mr sethna disapproved of making a reservation for lunch on the morning of the same day people shouldnt trust in plans that were so spurofthemoment youre in luckive just had a cancellation the steward told the doctor may i have the table at noon farrokh asked one oclock would be better mr sethna instructed him for the steward also disapproved of the doctors inclination to eat his lunch early mr sethna theorized that early luncheating contributed to the doctors being overweight it was most unsightly for small men to be overweight mr sethna thought dr daruwalla had just hung up the phone when dr tata returned his call farrokh remembered instantly what hed wanted to ask tata two do you remember rahul rai and his aunt promila farrokh asked doesnt everybody remember them tata two replied but this is a professional question dr daruwalla said i believe your father examined rahul when he was twelve or thirteen that would have been in my father examined rahul when he was only eight or ten it was his aunt promilas requestthe matter of his hairlessness was bothering her my father dismissed it but i believe promila took rahul to see your father i was wondering if the alleged hairlessness was still the issue why would anyone see your father or mine about hairlessness asked dr tata a good question farrokh replied i believe that the real issue concerned rahuls sexual identity possibly a sex change would have been requested my father didnt do sex changes said tata two he was a gynecologist an obstetrician i know what he was said dr daruwalla but he might have been asked to make a diagnosis im speaking of rahuls reproductive organs whether there was anything peculiar about them that would have warranted a sexchange operationat least in the boys mind or in his aunts mind if youve kept your fathers records i have my fathers of course ive kept his records dr tata cried mr subhash can have them on my desk in two minutes ill call you back in five so even tata two called his medical secretary mister perhaps like ranjit mr subhash was a medical secretary whod remained in the family dr daruwalla reflected that mr subhash had sounded on the phone like a man in his eighties ten minutes later when dr tata had not called him back farrokh also reflected on the presumed chaos of tata twos record keeping apparently old dr tatas file on rahul wasnt exactly at mr subhashs fingertips or maybe it was the diagnosis of rahul that gave tata two pause regardless farrokh told ranjit that he would take no calls except one he was expecting from dr tata dr daruwalla had one office appointment before his muchanticipated lunch at the duckworth club and he told ranjit to cancel it dr desai from london was in town in his spare time from his own surgical practice dr desai was a designer of artificial joints he was a man with a theme joint replacement was his only topic of conversation this made it hard on julia whenever farrokh tried to converse with dr desai at the duckworth club it was easier to deal with desai in the office should the implant be fixated to the skeleton with bone cement or is biologic fixation the method of choice this was typical of dr desais initial conversation it was what dr desai said instead of how are your wife and kids for dr daruwalla to cancel an office appointment with dr desai was tantamount to his admitting a lack of interest in his chosen orthopedic field but the doctor had his mind on his new screenplayhe wanted to write to this end farrokh sat on the opposite side of his desk eliminating his usual view the doctor found the exercise yard of the hospital for crippled children distractingthe physical therapy for some of his postoperative patients was hard for him to ignore dr daruwalla was more enticed by a makebelieve world than he was drawn to confront the world he lived in for the most part inspector dhars creator was unaware of the reallife dramas that teemed all around him poor nancy with her raccoon eyes was dressing herself for inspector dhar the famous actor even offstage and offcamera was still acting mr sethna who so strongly disapproved of everything had discovered to his deep distaste that human urine was killing the bougainvillea and that wasnt the only murderinprogress at the duckworth club where rahul was already envisioning herself as the widow dogar but dr daruwalla was still untouched by these realities instead for his inspiration the doctor chose to stare at the circus photograph on his desk there was the beautiful sumansuman the skywalker the last time dr daruwalla had seen her shed been unmarrieda yearold star acrobat the idol of all the child acrobats in training the screenwriter was presuming that suman was and that it was high time for her to be wed she should be engaged in more practical activities than walking upside down across the roof of the main tent feet from the ground with no net a woman as wonderful as suman should definitely be married the screenwriter thought suman was an acrobat not an actress the screenwriter intended to give his circus characters very little responsibility in the way of acting the boy ganesh would be an accomplished actor but his sister pinky would be the real pinkyfrom the great royal circus pinky would perform as an acrobat it wouldnt be necessary to have her talk keep her dialogue to a minimum the screenwriter thought farrokh was getting ahead of himself he was already casting the movie in his screenplay he still had to get the children to the circus that was when dr daruwalla thought of the new missionary in the screenplay the doctor wouldnt call him martin millsthe name mills was too boring the screenwriter would call him simply mr martin the jesuit mission would take charge of these children because their mother was killed in st ignatius church by an unsafe statue of the holy virgin st ignatius would certainly bear some responsibility for that and so the children would manage to be picked up by the right limousine by vinod the socalled good samaritan dwarf would still need to get the jesuits permission to take the kids to the circus oh this is brilliant thought dr daruwalla that would be how suman and mr martin meet the morally meddlesome missionary takes the children to the circus and the fool falls in love with the skywalker why not the jesuit would soon find suman preferable to chastity the fictional mr martin would have to be a skilled actor and the screenwriter would provide the character with a far more winning personality than that of martin mills in the screenplay the seduction of mr martin would be an unconversion story there was no small measure of mischief in the screenwriters next idea that john d would play a perfect mr martin how happy hed beto not be inspector dhar what a screenplay this was going to bewhat an improvement on reality that was when dr daruwalla realized that nothing was preventing him from putting himself in the movie he wouldnt presume to make himself a heroperhaps a minor character with admirable intentions would suffice but how should he describe himself farrokh wondered the screenwriter didnt know he was handsome and to speak of himself as highly intelligent sounded defensive also in movies you could only describe how one appeared there was no mirror in the doctors office and so he saw himself as he often looked in the fulllength mirror in the foyer of the duckworth club which doubtless conveyed to dr daruwalla a duckworthian sense of himself as an elegant gentleman such a gentlemanly doctor could play a small but pivotal role in the screenplay for the character of the dogooder missionary would naturally be obsessed with the idea that ganeshs limp could be fixed ideally the character of mr martin would bring the boy to be examined by none other than dr daruwalla the doctor would announce the hard truth there were exercises that ganesh could dothese would strengthen his legs including the crippled legbut the boy would always limp a few scenes of the crippled boy struggling bravely to perform these exercises would be excellent for audience sympathy the screenwriter believed like rahul dr daruwalla enjoyed this phase of storytellingnamely plot the thrill of exploring ones options in the beginning there were always so many but euphoria in the case of murder and in the case of writing is shortlived farrokh began to worry that his masterpiece had already been reduced to a romantic comedy the two kids escape in the right limo the circus is their salvation suman gives up skywalking to marry a missionary who gives up being a missionary even inspector dhars creator suspected that this ending was too happy surely something bad should happen the screenwriter thought thus the doctor sat pondering in his office at the hospital for crippled children with his back to the exercise yard in such a setting one might imagine that dr daruwalla must have felt ashamed of himself for trying to imagine some small tragedy not a romantic comedy contrary to rahuls opinion the police had not found the top half of the silver pen with india inscribed on it rahuls money clip had no longer been in the bougainvillea when the deputy commissioner had examined mr lals body the silver was so shiny in the morning sun it had caught a crows sharp eyes it was the halfpen that led the crow to discover the corpse the crow had begun by pecking out one of mr lals eyes the bird was busy at the open wound behind mr lals ear and at the wound at mr lals temple when the first of the vultures settled on the ninth green the crow had stood its ground until more vultures came after all it had found the body first and before taking flight the crow had stolen the silver halfpen crows were always stealing shiny objects that this crow had promptly lost its prize in the ceiling fan in the duckworth club dining room was not necessarily a comment on the birds overall intelligence but the blade of the fan at that time of the morning had moved in and out of the sunlight the fan had also caught the crows sharp eyes it was a silly place for a crow to land and a waiter had rudely shooed the shitting bird away as for the shiny object that the crow had held so tenaciously in its beak it had been left where it occasionally disturbed the mechanism of the ceiling fan dr daruwalla had observed one such disturbance the doctor had also observed the landing of the shitting crow upon the fan and so the top half of the silver pen existed only in the crowded memory of dr daruwalla and the doctor had already forgotten that the second mrs dogar had reminded him of someone elsean old movie star farrokh had also forgotten the pain of his collision with mrs dogar in the foyer of the duckworth club that shiny something which first nancy and then rahul and then the crow had lost might now be lost forever for its discovery lay within the limited abilities of dr daruwalla frankly both the memory and the powers of observation of a closet screenwriter are not the best one might more sensibly rely on the mechanism of the ceiling fan to spit out the halfpen and present it as a miracle to detective patel or to nancy an unlikely miracle of that coincidental kind was exactly what was needed to rescue martin mills for the mass had been celebrated too late to save the missionary from his worst memories there were times when every church reminded martin of our lady of victories when his mother was in boston martin always went to mass at our lady of victories on isabella street it was only an eightminute walk from the ritz that sunday morning of the long thanksgiving weekend of his ninthgrade year young martin slipped out of the bedroom he shared with arif koma without waking the turk up in the living room of the twobedroom suite at the hotel martin saw that the door to his mothers bedroom was ajar this struck the boy as indicative of veras carelessness and he was about to close the doorbefore he left the suite to go to masswhen his mother spoke to him is that you martin vera asked come kiss me goodmorning dutifully although he was loath to see his mother in the strongly scented disarray of her boudoir martin went to her to his surprise both vera and her bed were unrumpled he had the impression that his mother had already bathed and brushed her teeth and combed her hair the sheets werent in their usual knot of apparent bad dreams also veras nightgown was a pretty almost girlish thing it was revealing of her dramatic bosom but not sluttishly revealing as was often the case martin cautiously kissed her cheek off to church his mother asked him to massyes martin told her is arif still sleeping vera inquired yes i think so martin replied arifs name on his mothers lips reminded martin of the painful embarrassment of the night before i dont think you should ask arif about such personal things martin said suddenly personal do you mean sexual vera asked her son honestly martin the poor boy has probably been dying to talk to someone about his terrible circumcision dont be such a prude i think arif is a very private person martin said also he added stubbornly i think he might be a bit disturbed vera sat up in her bed with new interest sexually disturbed she asked her son what gives you that idea it didnt seem a betrayal not at the time martin thought he was speaking to his mother in order to protect arif he masturbates martin said quietly goodness i should hope so vera exclaimed i certainly hope that you do martin wouldnt take this bait but he replied i mean that he masturbates a lotalmost every night the poor boy vera remarked but you sound so disapproving martin i think its excessive her son told her i think masturbation is quite healthy for boys your age have you discussed masturbation with your father vera asked him discussed wasnt the right word martin had listened to danny go on and on in reassuring tones in regard to all the desires danny presumed that martin was experiencinghow such desires were perfectly natural that was dannys theme yes martin told his mother dad thinks masturbation is normal well thereyou see vera said sarcastically if your sainted father says its normal i suppose we should all be trying it ill be late for mass martin said run along then his mother replied martin was about to close the door to her bedroom behind him when his mother gave him a parting shot personally dear i think masturbation would be better for you than mass and please leave the door openi like it that way martin remembered to take the room key in case arif was still sleeping when he came back from massin case his mother was in the bathroom or talking on the telephone when mass was over he looked briefly at a window display of mens suits in a brooks brothers store the mannequins wore christmastree neckties but martin was struck by the smoothness of the mannequins skinit reminded him of arifs perfect complexion except for his pausing at this window martin came straight back to the suite at the ritz when he unlocked the door he was happy hed brought the room key because he thought his mother was talking on the phone it was a onesided conversationall vera but then the awful words themselves were clear to him im going to make you squirt again his mother was saying i absolutely know you can squirt againi can feel you youre going to squirt again soonarent you arent you the door to his mothers bedroom was still opena little wider open than the way she liked itand martin mills could see her naked back her naked hips and the crack in her shapely ass she was riding arif koma who lay wordlessly under her martin was grateful that he couldnt see his roommates face he quietly let himself out of the suite as his mother continued to urge arif to squirt on the short walk back to isabella street martin wondered if it had been his own revelation of arifs penchant for masturbation that had given vera the idea probably his mother had already had the seduction in mind but the masturbation story must have provided her with greater incentive martin mills had sat as stupefied in our lady of victories church as hed sat waiting for the mass at st ignatius brother gabriel was worried about him first the latenightprayersill take the turkey ill take the turkeyand then even after mass was over the missionary knelt on the kneeling pad as if he were waiting for the next mass that was exactly what hed done in our lady of victories on isabella street hed waited for the next mass as if one mass hadnt been enough what also troubled brother gabriel were the bloodstains on the missionarys balledup fists brother gabriel couldnt have known about martins nose for the wound had stopped bleeding and was almost entirely concealed by a small scab on one nostril but brother gabriel wondered about the bloody socks that martin mills clutched in his hands the blood had dried between his knuckles and under his nails and brother gabriel feared that the source of the bleeding might have been the missionarys palms thats all we need to make our jubilee year a success brother gabriel thoughtan outbreak of stigmata but later when martin attended the morning classes he seemed back on track so to speak he was lively with the students humble with the other teachersalthough as a teacher hed had more experience than many of the staff at st ignatius school watching the new scholastic interact with both the pupils and the staff the father rector suspended his earlier anxieties that the american might be a crazed zealot and father cecil found martin mills to be every bit as charming and dedicated as hed hoped brother gabriel kept silent about the turkey prayer and the bloody socks but he noted the haunted faraway smile that occasionally stole over the scholastics repertoire of otherwise earnest expressions martin seemed to be struck by some remembrance possibly inspired by a face among the upperschool boys as if the smooth dark skin of one of the yearolds had called to mind someone hed once known or so brother gabriel guessed it was an innocent friendly smilealmost too friendly brother gabriel thought but martin mills was just remembering back in school at fessenden after the long thanksgiving weekend hed waited until the lights were out before saying what he wanted to say fucker martin quietly said whats that arif asked him i said fucker as in motherfucker martin said is this a game arif inquired after too long a pause you know what i mean you motherfucker said martin mills after another long pause arif said she made me do itsort of youll probably get a disease martin told his roommate martin didnt really mean it nor would he have said it had it occurred to him that arif might have fallen in love with vera he was surprised when arif pounced on him in the dark and began to hit his face dont ever say that about your mother the turk cried not about your mother shes beautiful mr weems the dorm master broke up the fight neither of the boys was hurtneither of them knew how to fight mr weems was kindly with rougher boys he was entirely ineffectual he was a music teacher andwith hindsight this is easy to saymost likely a homosexual but no one thought of him that way except a few of the brassier faculty wives women of the type who thought that any unmarried man over was a queer mr weems was well liked by the boys despite his taking no part in the schools prevailing athleticism in his report to the discipline committee the dorm master would dismiss the altercation between martin and arif as a spat this unfortunate choice of a word would have grave consequences later when arif koma was diagnosed as suffering from gonorrheaand when he wouldnt tell the school doctor where he might have acquired itthe suspicion fell on martin mills that word spat connoted a lovers quarrelat least to the more manly members of the discipline committee mr weems was instructed to ask the boys if they were homosexuals if theyd been doing it the dorm master was more sympathetic to the notion that arif and martin might be doing it than any of the faculty jocks would have been if you boys are lovers then you should see the doctor too martin mr weems explained tell him martin said to arif were not lovers arif said thats rightwere not lovers martin repeated but go ontell him i dare you martin said to arif tell me what the dorm master asked he hates his mother arif explained to mr weems mr weems had met vera he could understand hes going to tell you that i got the disease from his motherthats how much he hates her he fucked my motheror rather she fucked him martin told mr weems you see what i mean arif koma said at most private schools the faculty is composed of truly saintly people and incompetent ogres martin and arif were fortunate that their dorm master was a teacher of the saintly category yet mr weems was so wellmeaning he was perhaps more blind to depravity than a normal person please martin the dorm master said a sexually transmitted disease especially at an allboys school is not something to lie about whatever your feelings are for your mother what we hope to learn here is the truthnot to punish anyone but only so that we may advise you how can we instruct you how can we tell you what we think you should do if you wont tell us the truth my mother fucked him when she thought i was at mass martin told mr weems mr weems shut his eyes and smiled he did this when he was counting which he did to summon patience i was trying to protect you martin arif koma said but i can see its no use boys please one of you is lying the dorm master said okayso we tell him arif said to martin what do you say okay martin replied he knew that he liked arif for three years arif had been his only friend if arif wanted to say theyd been lovers why not go along with it there was no one else martin mills wanted to please as much as he wanted to please arif okay martin repeated okay what mr weems asked okay were lovers said martin mills i dont know why he doesnt have the disease arif explained he should have it maybe hes immune are we going to get thrown out of school martin asked the dorm master he hoped so it might teach his mother something martin thought at he still thought vera was educable all we did was try it arif said we didnt like it we dont do it anymore martin added this was the first and last time that hed lied it made him feel giddyit was almost as if he were drunk but one of you must have caught this disease from someone else mr weems reasoned i mean it couldnt have originated here with you not if each of you has had no other sexual contact martin mills knew that arif koma had been phoning vera and that she wouldnt talk to the turk martin knew that arif had written to vera tooand that shed not written the boy back but it was only now that martin realized how far his friend would go to protect vera he must have been absolutely gaga about her i paid a prostitute i caught this disease from a whore arif told mr weems where would you ever see a whore arif the dorm master asked you dont know boston arif koma asked him i stayed with martin and his mother at the ritz when they were asleep i left the hotel i asked the doorman to get me a taxi i asked the taxi driver to find me a hooker thats the way you do it in new york too arif explained or at least thats the only way i know how to do it and so arif koma was booted from the fessenden school for catching a venereal disease from a whore there was a statute in the schools book of rules something pertaining to morally reprehensible behavior with women or girls being punishable by dismissal under this rubric the discipline committee despite mr weemss protestations expelled arif it was judged that having sex with a prostitute was not a gray area when it came to morally reprehensible behavior with women or girls as for martin mr weems also pleaded on his behalf his homosexual encounter was a single episode of sexual experimentation the incident should be forgotten but the discipline committee insisted that vera and danny should know veras first response was to reiterate that masturbation was preferable for boys martins age all martin said to his mothernaturally not in dannys hearingwas arif koma has gonorrhea and so do you there was barely time to talk to arif before he was sent home the last thing martin said to the turk was dont hurt yourself trying to protect my mother but i also like your father arif explained once again vera had gotten away with murder because no one wanted to hurt danny arifs suicide was the bigger shock the note to martin didnt arrive in his fessenden mailbox until two days after arif had jumped out of the thfloor window of his parents apartment on park avenue dishonored my familythat was all the note said martin recalled that it was for the purpose of not dishonoring his parents or reflecting ill on his familys reputation that arif hadnt shed a tear at his own circumcision there was no blaming vera for it the first time she was alone with martin vera said dont try to tell me that its my fault dear you told me he was disturbedsexually disturbed you said so yourself besides you dont want to do anything that would hurt your father do you actually it had hurt danny quite a bit to hear that his son had dabbled in a homosexual experience even if it was only a single episode martin assured his father that hed only tried it and that he hadnt liked it still martin realized that this was the sole impression danny had of his sons sexuality hed screwed his turkish roommate when both boys were only years old it didnt occur to martin mills that the truth about his sexuality might have been even more painful for dannynamely that his son was a yearold virgin whod never even masturbated nor had it occurred to martin that he might actually have been in love with arif koma certainly this was more plausible not to mention more justifiable than arif falling in love with vera now here was dr daruwalla inventing a missionary called mr martin the screenwriter knew that he needed to provide motives for mr martins decision to become a priest even in a movie farrokh felt that a vow of chastity required some explanation having met vera the screenwriter should have guessed that the real missionarys motives in taking a vow of chastity and becoming a priest were not made of the material usually found in a romantic comedy a makebelieve death the real children the screenwriter had the good sense to know he was stalling the problem was who was going to die in real life it was the doctors hope that madhu and ganesh would be saved by the circus in the screenplay it simply wasnt realistic for both children to live happily ever after the more believable story was that only one of them would be a survivor pinky was the acrobat the star the crippled ganesh could hope for no role more important than that of a cooks helperthe circuss servant boy the circuss sweeper the circus would surely start him out at the bottom hed be scooping up the elephant shit and washing the lion piss off the stools from such a shitandpiss beginning ganesh would be fortunate to be promoted to the cooks tent cooking food or serving it would represent a form of graduationprobably the best that the crippled boy could hope for this was true for the real ganesh and for the character in the screenplaythis was realism dr daruwalla believed it should be pinky who dies the screenwriter decided the only reason that the circus accepted the crippled brother in the first place was that they wanted the talented sister the brother was part of the deal that was the premise of the story but if pinky was to die why wouldnt the circus get rid of ganesh what use does the circus have for a cripple now this is a better story farrokh imagined the burden of performance is suddenly shifted to the cripple ganesh must come up with something to do so that the circus will find him worth keeping a boy without a limp can shovel the elephant shit faster but it was the bane of the screenwriter to always be rushing ahead of himself before he found something for ganesh to do at the circus wasnt it necessary to determine how pinky would die well shes an acrobatshe could always fall the doctor prematurely decided maybe shes trying to learn sumans skywalk item and she simply falls but realistically pinky wouldnt be learning to skywalk from the roof of the main tent at the great royal pratap singh always taught the skywalk from the roof of the family troupe tent the rope rungs of the ladder werent feet in the airthe upsidedown skywalker wasnt more than a foot or two above the ground if farrokh wanted to use the real great royal circus which he didand if he wanted to use his actual favorite performers pinky and suman and pratap principallythen the screenwriter could not have a death attributed to carelessness or to some cheap accident farrokh meant only to praise the great royal and circus lifenot to condemn them no pinkys death couldnt be the responsibility of the circusthat wasnt the right story that was when dr daruwalla thought of mr garg the reallife acid man after all acid man was already an established villain in the screenplay why not use him the threat of a lawsuit seemed remote in these moments when sheer invention struck acid man could be so enthralled by pinkys loveliness and ability he simply cant bear her rising stardomor that shes escaped disfigurement of his special kind having lost pinky to the great royal the fiend performs acts of sabotage at the circus one of the lion cubs is burned with acid or maybe one of the dwarf clowns poor pinky is killed by a lion that escapes its cage because acid man has burned off the lock great stuff the screenwriter thought the irony momentarily eluded dr daruwalla here he was plotting the death of his fictional pinky while at the same time he awaited the real results of madhus hiv test but farrokh had once more got ahead of himself he was trying to imagine what ganesh could do to make himself irreplaceable to the circus the boy is a lowly cripple a mere beggar hes clumsy hell always limpthe only stunt he can perform is the birdshit trick the screenwriter made a hasty note to put the birdshit trick in the screenplay more comic relief was necessary now that pinky was going to be killed by a lion at that moment ranjit put through the phone call from dr tata farrokhs forward momentum his entire train of thought was interrupted farrokh was even more annoyed by the nature of dr tatas information oh deardear old dad said tata two im rather afraid he blew this one it wouldnt have surprised dr daruwalla to learn that the senior dr tata had blown many a diagnosis after all the old fool had not known until the delivery that vera was giving birth to twins what is it this time farrokh was tempted to ask but he more politely inquired so he did see rahul you bet he did said dr tata it must have been an exciting examinationpromila claimed that the boy had proved himself to be impotent in an alleged single episode with a prostitute but i suspect the diagnosis was a bit premature what was the diagnosis dr daruwalla asked eunuchoidism cried tata two nowadays we would use the term hypogonadism but call it what you will this is merely a symptom or syndrome with several possible causes rather like the syndrome of headache or dizziness yes yes dr daruwalla said impatiently he could tell that tata two had been doing a little research or perhaps hed been talking to a better obgyn most obgyns tended to know more about this sort of thing than other doctorsbecause they were well versed in hormones farrokh supposed what conditions might cause you to suspect hypogonadism dr daruwalla asked tata two if i saw a boy or a man with long limbs and an arm spanwhen he stretches his arms outthat is two inches more than his height also his pubistofloor height being greater than his pubistocrown height dr tata replied he must be reading from a book dr daruwalla thought and if this boy or man also had absent secondary sexual characteristics tata two continued you knowvoice muscular development phallic development extension of pubic hair up the belly in a diamond pattern but how could you assess such secondary sexual characteristics as being incomplete unless the boy is over fifteen or so dr daruwalla asked well thats the problemyou really couldnt said tata two rahul was only twelve or thirteen in farrokh cried it was preposterous that promila had pronounced the boy impotent because he hadnt been able to get an erection or keep an erection with a prostitute it was more preposterous that old dr tata had believed her well thats what i mean by the diagnosis being a bit premature tata two admitted the process of maturation begins at eleven or twelve is heralded by the hardening of the testes and is usually completed within five yearsalthough some things like the growth of chest hair may take another decade with the word heralded dr daruwalla was certain that tata two was reading from a book in short you mean that rahuls puberty might simply have been delayed it was entirely too soon to call him a kind of eunuch farrokh cried well now to say eunuchoidism isnt really calling someone a kind of eunuch dr tata explained to a twelve or thirteenyearold boy this diagnosis would have come at an impressionable agewouldnt you agree asked dr daruwalla thats true tata two replied it might be a more appropriate diagnosis in the case of an eighteenyearold with a microphallus jesus christ said dr daruwalla well we must remember that all the rais were rather strange dr tata reasoned just the sort of family to make the most out of a misdiagnosis dr daruwalla remarked i wouldnt call it a misdiagnosisjust a bit early to know for sure tata two said defensively it was understandable why dr tata then wanted to change the subject oh i have an answer for you about the girl mr subhash told me you wanted a rush job actually mr subhash had told dr daruwalla that the hiv test would take at least two daysmore if the first phase was positive anyway shes okay the test was negative dr tata said that was fast dr daruwalla replied this is the girl whos named madhu her name is madhu yes yes said dr tata it was his turn to sound impatient im looking at the results the name is madhu the test was negative mr subhash just put the file on my desk how old is mr subhash dr daruwalla wanted to ask but he was annoyed enough for one conversation at least he could get the girl out of town he thanked tata two then hung up the phone he wanted to go back to his screenplay but first he called ranjit into his office and asked the secretary to notify mr garg that madhu was not hivpositive the doctor himself didnt want to give garg the satisfaction that was fast ranjit said but the screenplay was still occupying the majority of dr daruwallas thoughts at the moment he was giving more of his attention to those children than to the children in his charge the doctor did remember to ask ranjit to contact the dwarfs wife deepa should be told that madhu and ganesh were coming to the circusand that dr daruwalla needed to know where in all of gujarat the circus was farrokh should also have called the new missionaryto forewarn the jesuit that they would be spending the weekend traveling to the circus with the childrenbut the screenplay beckoned to him the fictional mr martin was more compelling to dr daruwalla than martin mills unfortunately the more vividly the screenwriter recalled and described the acts of the great royal circus the more he dreaded the disappointment he was certain hed feel when he and martin mills delivered the real children to the great blue nile the bribe time to slip away as for martin mills and how he compared to the fictional mr martin farrokh felt only the slightest guilt the screenwriter suspected hed created a lightweight fool out of a heavyweight lunatic but this was only the faintest suspicion in the screenplay the first time the missionary visits the children in the circus he slips and falls in elephant shit it hadnt yet crossed dr daruwallas mind that the real missionary had possibly stepped into a worse mess than elephant shit as for elephant shit it wouldnt work as a title farrokh had written it in the margin of the page where the phrase first appeared but now he crossed this out a film of that title would be banned in india besides who would want to go to a movie called elephant shit people wouldnt bring their children and it was a movie for children dr daruwalla hopedif it was for anybody he thought darkly thus did selfdoubt the screenwriters old enemy assail him he seemed to welcome it as a friend the screenwriter baited himself with other badtitle possibilities limo roulette was the arty choice farrokh worried that dwarfs the world over would be offended by the film no matter what the title was in his closet career as a screenwriter dr daruwalla had managed to offend almost everyone else rather than worry about offending dwarfs the doctor took up the even smaller task of wondering which movie magazine would be the first to misunderstand and mock his efforts the two he detested most were stardust and cine blitz he thought they were the most scandalous and libelous of the filmgossip press the mere thought of these media goons this journalistic slime set farrokh to worrying about the press conference at which he intended to announce an end to inspector dhar it occurred to farrokh that if he called for a press conference no one would attend the screenwriter would have to ask dhar to call for such a conference and dhar would have to be thereotherwise it would look like a hoax worse dhar himself would have to do the talking after all he was the movie star the trashy journalists would be less interested in dr daruwallas motives for perpetrating this fraud than in the reasons for dhars complicity why had dhar gone along with the fiction that the actor was his own creator as always even at such a revealing press conference as farrokh had imagined dhar would deliver the lines that the screenwriter had written the truth would simply be another acting job moreover the most important truth would never be toldthat it was out of love for john d that dr daruwalla had invented inspector dhar such a truth would be wasted on the media sleaze farrokh knew that he wouldnt want to read what mockery would be made of such a love especially in stardust or cine blitz dhars last press conference had been deliberately conducted as a farce dhar had chosen the swimming pool at the taj as the site for he said he enjoyed the bewildered gaping of foreigners the journalists were instantly irritated because theyd expected a more intimate environment are you trying to emphasize that you are a foreigner that you arent really indian at all that had been the first question dhar had responded by diving into the pool hed meant to splash the photographers that had been no accident hed answered only what he wanted to and ignored the rest it was an interview punctuated by dhar repeatedly diving into the pool the journalists said insulting things about him while he was underwater farrokh presumed that john d would be happy to be free of the role of inspector dhar the actor had enough money and he clearly preferred his swiss life yet dr daruwalla suspected that deep down dhar had cherished the loathing hed inspired among the media scum earning the hatred of the cinemagossip journalists might have been john ds best performance with that in mind farrokh thought he knew what john d would prefer no press conference no announcement let them wonder dhar would saydhar had often said there was another line that the screenwriter remembered after all hed not only written itit was repeated in every inspector dhar movie near the end of the story there was always the temptation for dhar to do something moreto seduce one more woman to gun down one more villainbut inspector dhar knew when to stop he knew when the action was over sometimes to a scheming bartender sometimes to a fellow policeman of a generally dissatisfied nature sometimes to a pretty woman whod been waiting impatiently to make love to him inspector dhar would say time to slip away then he would in this case facing the factsthat he wanted to call an end to inspector dhar and that he wanted to finally leave bombayfarrokh knew what john ds advice would be time to slip away inspector dhar would say bedbugs ahead in the old days before the doctors offices and the examining rooms of the hospital for crippled children were airconditioned thered been a ceiling fan over the desk where dr daruwalla now sat thinking and the window to the exercise yard was always open nowadays with the window closed and the hum of the airconditioning a reassuring constant farrokh was cut off from the sound of children crying in the exercise yard when the doctor walked through the yard or when he was called to observe the progress of one of his postoperative patients in physical therapy the crying children did not greatly upset him farrokh associated some pain with recovery a joint after surgeryespecially after surgeryhad to be moved but in addition to the cries of pain there were the whines that children made in anticipation of their pain and this piteous mewling affected the doctor strongly farrokh turned and faced the closed window with its view of the exercise yard from the soundless expressions of the children the doctor could still discern the difference between those children who were in pain and those who were pitifully frightened of the pain they expected soundlessly the therapists were coaxing the children to move there was the recent hip replacement being told to stand up there was the new knee being asked to step forwardand the first rotation of the new elbow the landscape of the exercise yard was timeless to dr daruwalla who reflected that his ability to hear that which was soundless was the only measure of his humanity that he was certain of even with the airconditioning on even with the window closed dr daruwalla could hear the whimpering time to slip away he thought he opened the window and leaned outside the heat at midday was oppressive in the rising dust although for bombay the weather had remained relatively cool and dry the cries of the children commingled with the car horns and the chainsaw clamor of the mopeds dr daruwalla breathed it all in he squinted into the dusty glare he gave the exercise yard an almost detached appraisal it was a goodbye look then the doctor called ranjit for his messages it was no surprise to dr daruwalla that deepa had already negotiated with the great blue nile the doctor hadnt expected the dwarfs wife to get a better deal the circus would attempt to train the talented sister they would commit themselves to this effort for three months theyd feed her clothe her shelter her and care for her crippled brother if madhu could be trained the great blue nile would keep both children if she was untrainable the circus would let them go in farrokhs screenplay the great royal paid pinky three rupees a day while they trained her the fictional ganesh worked without pay for his food and shelter at the great blue nile madhus training was considered a privilege she wouldnt be paid at all and for a real boy with a crushed foot it was enough of a privilege to be fed and sheltered the real ganesh would work too at the parents expenseor in the case of orphans it was the obligation of the childrens sponsorsmadhu and ganesh would be brought to the site of the great blue niles present location at this time the circus was performing in junagadh a small city of about people in gujarat junagadh it would take a day to get there another day to get back they would have to fly to rajkot and then endure a car ride of two or three hours to the smaller town a driver from the circus would meet their planedoubtless a reckless roustabout but the train would be worse farrokh knew that julia hated him to be away overnight and in junagadh there would probably be nowhere to stay but the government circuit house lice were likely bedbugs a certainty there would be hours of conversation with martin mills and no time to keep writing the screenplay it had also occurred to the screenwriter that the real dr daruwalla was part of a parallel storyinprogress raging hormones when dr daruwalla phoned st ignatius school to alert the new missionary to their upcoming journey the doctor wondered if his writing was prophetic hed already described the fictional mr martin as the most popular teacher at the school now here was father cecil telling the screenwriter that martin mills on the evidence of his first morning of visiting the classrooms had instantly made a most popular impression young martin as father cecil still called him had even persuaded the father rector to permit the teaching of graham greene to the upperschool boys although controversial graham greene was one of martin millss catholic heroes after all the novelist popularized catholic issues father cecil said farrokh who considered himself an old fan of graham greene asked suspiciously catholic issues suicide as a mortal sin for example father cecil replied apparently father julian was allowing martin mills to teach the heart of the matter to the upper school dr daruwalla felt briefly uplifted on the long trip to junagadh and back perhaps the doctor would be able to steer the missionarys conversation to graham greene who were some of the zealots other heroes the doctor wondered farrokh hadnt had a good discussion of graham greene in quite a while julia and her literary friends were happier discussing more contemporary authors they found it oldfashioned of farrokh to prefer rereading those books he regarded as classics dr daruwalla was intimidated by martin millss education but possibly the doctor and the scholastic would discover a common ground in the novels of graham greene dr daruwalla couldnt have known that the subject of suicide was of more interest to martin mills than the craft of graham greene as a writer for a catholic suicide was a violation of gods dominion over human life in the case of arif koma martin reasoned the muslim hadnt been in full possession of his faculties falling in love with vera surely suggested a loss of faculties or a vastly different set of faculties altogether the denial of ecclesiastical burial was a horror to martin mills however the church permitted suicides among those whod lost their senses or were unaware that they were killing themselves the missionary hoped that god would judge the turks suicide as an outofhishead kind after all martins mother had fucked the boys brains out how could arif have made a sane decision after that but if dr daruwalla would be unprepared for martin millss catholic interpretation of the doctors muchadmired author farrokh was also in the dark regarding the unwelcome disturbance that had shaken st ignatius school in the late morning to which father cecil made incoherent references the mission had been disrupted by an unruly intruder the police had been forced to subdue the violent individual whose violence father cecil attributed to raging hormones farrokh liked the phrase so much that he wrote it down it was a transvestite prostitute of all things father cecil whispered into the phone why are you whispering dr daruwalla asked the father rector is still upset about the episode father cecil confided to farrokh can you imagine a hijra coming hereand during school hours dr daruwalla was amused at the presumed spectacle perhaps he or she wanted to be better educated the doctor suggested to father cecil it claimed it had been invited father cecil replied it dr daruwalla cried well he or shewhatever it was it was big and strong a rampaging prostitute a crazed crossdresser father cecil whispered they give themselves hormones dont they not hijras dr daruwalla replied they dont take estrogens they have their balls and their penises removedwith a single cut the wound is then cauterized with hot oil it resembles a vagina goodnessdont tell me father cecil said sometimes but not usually their breasts are surgically implanted dr daruwalla informed the priest this one was implanted with iron father cecil said enthusiastically and young martin was busy teaching the father rector and i and poor brother gabriel had to deal with the creature by ourselvesuntil the police came it sounds exciting farrokh remarked fortunately none of the children saw it father cecil said arent transvestite prostitutes allowed to convert asked dr daruwalla who enjoyed teasing any priest raging hormones father cecil repeated it must have just given itself an overdose i told youthey dont usually take estrogens the doctor said this one was taking something father cecil insisted may i speak with martin now dr daruwalla asked or is he still busy teaching hes eating his lunch with the midgets or maybe hes with the submidgets today father cecil replied it was almost time for the doctors lunch at the duckworth club dr daruwalla left a message for martin mills but father cecil struggled with the message to such a degree that the doctor knew hed have to call again just tell him ill call him back farrokh finally said and tell him were definitely going to the circus oh wont that be fun father cecil said the hawaiian shirt detective patel had wanted to compose himself before his lunch at the duckworth club however there was the interruption of this incident at st ignatius it was merely a misdemeanor but the episode had been brought to the deputy commissioners attention because it fell into the category of dharrelated crimes the perpetrator was one of the transvestite prostitutes whod been injured by dhars dwarf driver in the fracas on falkland road it was the hijra whose wrist had been broken by a blow from one of vinods squashracquet handles the eunuchtransvestite had shown up at st ignatius clubbing the old priests with his cast his story was that inspector dhar had told all the transvestite prostitutes that theyd be welcome at the mission also dhar had told the hijras that they could always find him there but it wasnt dhar the hijra told detective patel in hindi it was someone being a dhar imposter it would have been laughable to patel to hear a transvestite complaining that someone else was an imposter if the detective had been in a laughing mood instead the deputy commissioner looked at the hijra with impatience and scorn he was a tall broadshouldered bonyfaced hooker whose small breasts were showing because the top two buttons of his hawaiian shirt were unbuttoned and the shirt was too loose for him the looseness of his shirt and the tightness of his scarlet miniskirt were an absurd combinationhijra prostitutes usually wore saris also they generally made more of an effort to be feminine than this one was making his breasts what the deputy commissioner could see of them were shapelyin fact they were very well formedbut there were whiskers on his chin and the noticeable shadow of a mustache on his upper lip possibly the hijra had thought that the colors of the hawaiian shirt were feminine not to mention the parrots and flowers yet the shirt did little for his figure dcp patel continued the interrogation in hindi whered you get that shirt the detective asked dhar was wearing it the prostitute replied not likely said the deputy commissioner i told you he was being an imposter the prostitute said what sort of fool would pretend to be dhar and dare show his face on falkland road patel asked he looked like he didnt know he was dhar the hijra replied oh i see said detective patel he was an imposter but he didnt know he was an imposter the hijra scratched his hooked nose with the cast on his wrist patel was bored with the interrogation he kept the hijra sitting there only because the preposterous sight of him helped the detective to focus on rahul of course rahul would be or now and she wouldnt stand out as someone who was making a halfassed effort to look like a woman it had occurred to the deputy commissioner that this might be one of the ways that rahul managed to commit so many murders in the same area of bombay rahul could enter a brothel as a man and leave looking like a hag she could also leave looking like an attractive middleaged woman and until this wasteoftime hijra had interrupted him patel had been enjoying a fairly profitable mornings work the deputy commissioners research on rahul was progressing rather nicely the list of new members at the duckworth club had been helpful did you ever hear of a zenana by the name of rahul patel asked the hijra that old question the transvestite said only shed be a real woman nowthe complete operation the detective added he knew there were some hijras who envied the very idea of a complete transsexual but not most most hijras were exactly what they wanted to bethey had no use for a fully fashioned vagina if i knew of there being someone like that id probably kill her the hijra said goodnaturedly for her parts he added with a smile he was just kidding of course detective patel knew more about rahul than this hijra did in the last hours the detective had learned more about rahul than hed known for years you may go now said the deputy commissioner but leave the shirt by your own admission you stole it but i have nothing else to wear the hijra cried well find you something you can wear the policeman said it just may not match your miniskirt when detective patel left crime branch headquarters for his lunch at the duckworth club he took a paper bag with him in it was the hawaiian shirt that belonged to dhars imposter the deputy commissioner knew that not every question would or could be answered over one lunch but the question posed by the hawaiian shirt seemed a relatively simple one the actor guesses right no said inspector dhar i would never wear a shirt like that hed glanced quickly and indifferently into the bag not bothering to draw out the shirtnot even touching the material it has a california label detective patel informed the actor ive never been to california dhar replied the deputy commissioner put the paper bag under his chair he seemed disappointed that the hawaiian shirt had not served as an icebreaker to their conversation which had halted once again poor nancy hadnt spoken at all worse shed chosen to wear a sari wound up in the navelrevealing fashion the golden hairs that curled upward in a sleek line to her belly button were as worrisome to mr sethna as the unsightly paper bag the policeman had placed under his chair it was the kind of bag that a bomb would be in the old steward thought and how he disapproved of western women in indian attire furthermore the fair skin of this particular womans midriff clashed with her sunburned face she must have been lying in the sun with tea saucers over her eyes mr sethna thought any evidence of women lying on their backs disturbed him as for the evervoyeuristic dr daruwalla his eyes were repeatedly drawn to nancys furry navel since shed pulled her chair snugly to their table in the ladies garden the doctor was restless because he could no longer see this marvel farrokh found himself glancing sideways at nancys raccoon eyes instead the doctor made nancy so nervous that she took her sunglasses out of her purse and put them on she had the look of someone who was trying to gather herself together for a performance inspector dhar knew how to handle sunglasses he simply stared into them with a satisfied expression on his face which implied to nancy that her sunglasses were no impediment to his visionthat he could see her clearly nonetheless dhar knew this would soon cause her to take the sunglasses off oh greattheyre both acting dr daruwalla thought mr sethna was disgusted with all of them they were as socially graceless as teenagers not one of them had glanced at a menu none of them had so much as raised an eyebrow to a waiter to suggest an aperitif and they couldnt even talk to one another mr sethna was also full of indignation at the explanation that was now before him of why detective patel spoke such good english the policemans wife was a slatternly american needless to say mr sethna considered this a mixed marriage of which he strongly disapproved and the old steward was no less outraged that inspector dhar should have brashly presented himself at the duckworth club so soon after the warning in the late mr lals mouth the actor was recklessly endangering other duckworthians that mr sethna had come by this information through the relentlessness and the practiced stealth of his eavesdropping didnt cause the old steward to consider that he might not know the whole story to a man with mr sethnas readiness to disapprove a mere shred of information was sufficient to form a full opinion but of course mr sethna had another reason to be outraged with inspector dhar as a parsi and a practicing zoroastrian the old steward had reacted predictably to the posters for the newest inspector dhar absurdity not since his days at the ripon club and his famous decision to pour hot tea on the head of the man wearing the wig had mr sethna felt so aroused to righteous anger hed seen the work of the posterwallas on his way home from the duckworth club and he blamed inspector dhar and towers of silence for giving him uncharacteristically lurid dreams hed suffered a vision of a ghostlywhite statue of queen victoria that resembled the one they took away from victoria terminus but in his dream the statue was levitating queen victoria was hovering about a foot off the floor of mr sethnas beloved firetemple and all the parsi faithful were bolting for the doorway were it not for the blasphemous cinema poster mr sethna believed he would never have had such a blasphemous dream hed promptly woken up and donned his prayer cap but the prayer cap fell off when he suffered another dream he was riding in the parsi panchayat hearse to the towers of silence although he was already a dead body he could smell the rites attendant to his own deaththe scent of burning sandalwood suddenly the stink of putrefaction which clung to the vultures beaks and talons was choking him he woke again his prayer cap was on the floor where he mistook it for a waiting hunchbacked crow pathetically hed tried to shoo the imagined crow away dr daruwalla glanced only once at mr sethna from the stewards withering stare the doctor wondered if another hottea incident was brewing mr sethna interpreted the doctors glance as a summons an aperitif before lunch perhaps the steward asked the awkward foursome since aperitif wasnt a word much used in iowanor had nancy heard it from dieter nor was it ever spoken in her life with vijay patelshe made no response to mr sethna who was looking directly at her if anywhere nancy might have encountered the word in one or another of the remaindered american novels shed read but she wouldnt have known how to pronounce aperitif and she would have assumed that the word was inessential to understanding the plot would the lady enjoy something to drink before her lunch mr sethna asked still looking at nancy no one at the table could hear what she said but the old steward understood that shed whispered for a thums up cola the deputy commissioner ordered a gold spot orange soda dr daruwalla asked for a london diet beer and dhar wanted a kingfisher well this should be lively dr daruwalla joked two teetotalers and two beer drinkers this lead balloon lay on the table which inspired the doctor to discourse at length on the history of the lunch menu it was chinese day at the duckworth club the culinary low point of the week in the old days thered been a chinese chef among the kitchen staff and chinese day had been an epicures delight but the chinese chef had left the club to open his own restaurant and the presentday collection of cooks could not concoct chinese yet one day a week they tried its probably safest to stick with something vegetarian farrokh recommended by the time you saw the bodies nancy suddenly began i suppose they were pretty bad yesim afraid the crabs had found them dr daruwalla replied but i guess the drawing was still clear or you wouldnt have remembered it nancy said yesindelible ink im sure said dr daruwalla it was a laundrymarking pena dhobi pen nancy told him although she appeared to be looking at dhar with her sunglasses on who knew where she was looking i buried them you know nancy went on i didnt see them die but i heard them the sound of the spade she added dhar continued to stare at her his lip not quite sneering nancy took her sunglasses off and returned them to her purse something she saw in her purse made her pause she held her lower lip in her teeth for three or four seconds then she reached in her purse and brought out the bottom half of the silver ballpoint pen which shed carried with her everywhere shed gone for years he stole the other half of thishe or she nancy said she handed the halfpen to dhar who read the interrupted inscription made in where dhar asked her india said nancy rahul must have stolen it who would want the top half of a pen farrokh asked detective patel not a writer dhar replied he passed the halfpen to dr daruwalla its real silver the doctor observed it needs to be polished nancy said the deputy commissioner looked away he knew his wife had polished the thing only last week dr daruwalla couldnt see any indication that the silver was dull or blackened everything was shiny even the inscription when he handed the halfpen to nancy she didnt put it back in her purse instead she placed it alongside her knife and spoonit was brighter than both i use an old toothbrush to polish the lettering she said even dhar looked away from her that he couldnt meet her eyes gave her confidence in real life nancy said to the actor have you ever taken a bribe she saw the sneer shed been looking for shed been expecting it no never dhar told her now nancy had to look away from him she looked straight at dr daruwalla how come you keep it a secret that you write all his movies nancy asked the doctor i already have a career dr daruwalla replied the idea was to create a career for him well you sure did it nancy told farrokh detective patel reached for her left hand which was on the table by her fork but nancy put her hand in her lap then she faced dhar and how do you like it your career nancy asked the actor he responded with his patterned shrug which enhanced his sneer something both cruel and merry entered his eyes i have a day job another life dhar replied lucky you nancy told him sweetie said the deputy commissioner he reached into his wifes lap and took her hand she seemed to go a little limp in the rattan chair even mr sethna could hear her exhale the old steward had heard almost everything else too and what he hadnt actually heard hed fairly accurately surmised from reading their lips mr sethna was a good lipreader and for an elderly man he could move spryly around a conversation a table for four posed few problems for him it was easier to pick up conversation in the ladies garden than in the main dining room because only the bower of flowers was overhead there were no ceiling fans from mr sethnas point of view it was already a much more interesting lunch than hed anticipated dead bodies a stolen part of a pen and the most startling revelationthat dr daruwalla was the actual author of that trash which had elevated inspector dhar to stardom in a way mr sethna believed that hed known it all along the old steward had always sensed that farrokh wasnt the man his father was mr sethna glided in with the drinks then he glided away the venomous feelings that the old steward had felt for dhar were now what mr sethna was feeling for dr daruwalla a parsi writing for the hindi cinema and making fun of other parsis how dare he mr sethna could barely restrain himself in his mind he could hear the sound that his silver serving tray would make off the crown of dr daruwallas head it sounded like a gong the steward had needed all his strength to resist the temptation to cover that appalling womans fuzzy navel with her napkin which was carelessly lumped in her lap a belly button like hers should be clothedif not banned but mr sethna quickly calmed himself for he didnt want to miss what the real policeman was saying i should like to hear the three of you describe what rahul would look like today assuming that rahul is now a woman said the deputy commissioner you first patel said to dhar vanity and an overall sense of physical superiority would keep her looking younger than she is dhar began but she would be fiftythree or fiftyfour dr daruwalla interjected youre next please let him finish said detective patel she wouldnt look fiftythree or fiftyfour except maybe very early in the morning dhar continued and she would be very fit she has a predatory aura shes a stalkeri mean sexually i think she was quite hot for him when he was a boy dr daruwalla remarked who wasnt nancy asked bitterly only her husband looked at her please let him finish patel said patiently shes also the sort of woman who enjoys making you want her even if she intends to reject you dhar said he made a point of looking at nancy and i would assume that like her late aunt she has a caustic manner she would always be ready to ridicule someone or some ideaanything yes yes said dr daruwalla impatiently but dont forget she is also a starer excuse mea what asked detective patel a family traitshe stares at everyone rahul is a compulsive starer farrokh replied she does it because shes deliberately rude but also because she has a kind of uninhibited curiosity that was her aunt in spades rahul was brought up that way no modesty whatsoever now she would be very feminine i suppose but not with her eyes she is a man with her eyesshes always looking you over and staring you down were you finished the deputy commissioner asked dhar i think so the actor replied i never saw her clearly nancy said suddenly there was no light or the light was badonly an oil lamp i got just a peek at her and i was sicki had a fever she toyed with the bottom half of the ballpoint pen on the table turning it at a right angle to her knife and spoon then lining it up again she smelled good and she felt very silkybut strong nancy added talk about her now not then patel said what would she be like now the thing is nancy said i think she feels like she cant control something in herself like she just needs to do things she cant stop herself the things she wants are just too strong what things asked the detective you know weve talked about it nancy told him tell them her husband said shes hornyi think shes horny all the time nancy told them thats unusual for someone whos fiftythree or fiftyfour dr daruwalla observed thats just the feeling she gives youbelieve me nancy said shes awfully horny does this remind you of someone you know the detective asked inspector dhar but dhar kept looking at nancy he didnt shrug or you doctorare you reminded of anyone the deputy commissioner asked farrokh are you talking about someone weve actually metas a woman dr daruwalla asked the deputy commissioner precisely said detective patel dhar was still looking at nancy when he spoke mrs dogar dhar said farrokh put both his hands on his chest exactly where the familiar pain in his ribs was suddenly sharp enough to take his breath away oh very goodvery impressive said detective patel he reached across the table and patted the back of dhars hand you wouldnt have made a bad policeman even if you dont take bribes the detective told the actor mrs dogar dr daruwalla gasped i knew she reminded me of someone but theres something wrong isnt there dhar asked the deputy commissioner i mean you havent arrested herhave you quite so patel said something is wrong i told you hed know who it was nancy told her husband yes sweetie the detective said but its not a crime for rahul to be mrs dogar how did you find out dr daruwalla asked the deputy commissioner of coursethe list of new members it was a good place to start said detective patel the estate of promila rai was inherited by her niece not her nephew i never knew there was a niece farrokh said there wasnt patel replied rahul her nephew went to london he came back as her niece he even gave himself her namepromila its perfectly legal to change your sex in england its perfectly legal to change your nameeven in india rahul rai married mr dogar farrokh asked that was perfectly legal too the detective replied dont you see doctor the fact that you and dhar could verify that rahul was there in goa at the hotel bardez does not confirm that rahul was ever at the scene of the crime and it would not be believable for nancy to physically identify mrs dogar as the rahul of twenty years ago as she told you she hardly saw rahul besides he had a penis then nancy said but in all these killings are there no fingerprints farrokh asked in the cases of the prostitutes there are hundreds of fingerprints dcp patel replied what about the putter that killed mr lal dhar asked oh very good the deputy commissioner said but the putter was wiped clean those drawings dr daruwalla said rahul always fancied himself an artist surely mrs dogar must have some drawings around that would be convenient patel replied but this very morning i sent someone to the dogar houseto bribe the servants the detective paused and looked directly at dhar there were no drawings there wasnt even a typewriter there must be ten typewriters in this club dhar said the typed messages on the tworupee noteswere they all typed on the same machine oh what a very good question said detective patel so far three messagestwo different typewriters both in this club mrs dogar dr daruwalla said again be quiet please the deputy commissioner said he suddenly pointed to mr sethna the old steward attempted to hide his face with his silver serving tray but detective patel was too fast for him what is that old snoops name the detective asked dr daruwalla thats mr sethna farrokh said please come here mr sethna the deputy commissioner said he didnt raise his voice or look in the stewards direction when mr sethna pretended that he hadnt heard the detective said you heard me mr sethna did as he was told since youve been listening to uswednesday you listened to my telephone conversation with my wifeyou will kindly give me your assistance detective patel said yes sir mr sethna said every time mrs dogar is in this club you call me the deputy commissioner said every reservation she makes lunch or dinner you let me know about it every little thing you know about her i want to know tooam i making myself clear perfectly clear sir said mr sethna she said her husband is peeing on the flowers and that one night hell try to dive into the empty pool mr sethna babbled she said hes senileand a drunk you can tell me later detective patel said i have just three questions then i want you to go far enough away from this table so that you dont hear another word yes sir mr sethna said on the morning of mr lals death i dont mean lunch because i already know that she was here for lunch but in the morning well before lunch did you see mrs dogar here thats the first question the deputy commissioner said yes she was here for a bit of breakfastvery early mr sethna informed the detective she likes to walk on the golf course before the golfers are playing then she has a little fruit before she does her fitness training second question patel said between breakfast and lunch did she change what she was wearing yes sir the old steward replied she was wearing a dress rather wrinkled at breakfast for lunch she wore a sari third question the deputy commissioner said he handed mr sethna his cardhis telephone number at crime branch headquarters and his home number were her shoes wet i mean for breakfast i didnt notice mr sethna admitted try to improve your noticing detective patel told the old steward now go far away from this tablei mean it yes sir said mr sethna already doing what he did bestgliding away nor did the prying old steward approach the ladies garden again during the foursomes solemn lunch but even at a considerable distance mr sethna was able to observe that the woman with the fuzzy navel ate very little her rude husband ate half her food and all his own at a proper club people would be forbidden to eat off one anothers plates mr sethna thought he went into the mens room and stood in front of the fulllength mirror in which he appeared to be trembling he held the silver serving tray in one hand and pounded it against the heel of his other hand but he felt little satisfaction from the sound it madea muffled bonging he hated policemen the old steward decided farrokh remembers the crow in the ladies garden the earlyafternoon sun had slanted past the apex of the bower and no longer touched the lunchers heads the rays of sunlight now penetrated the wall of flowers only in patches the tablecloth was mottled by this intermittent light and dr daruwalla watched a tiny diamond of the sunit was reflected in the bottom half of the ballpoint pen the brilliantly white point of light shone in the doctors eye as he pecked at his soggy stirfry the limp dullcolored vegetables reminded him of the monsoon at that time of year the ladies garden would be strewn with torn petals of the bougainvillea the skeletal vines still clinging to the bowerwith the brown sky showing through and the rain coming through all the wicker and rattan furniture would be heaped upon itself in the ballroom for there were no balls in the monsoon season the golfers would sit drinking in the clubhouse bar forlornly staring out the streaked windows at the sodden fairways wild clumps of the dead garden would be blowing across the greens the food on chinese day always depressed farrokh but there was something about the winking sun that was reflected in the bottom half of the silver ballpoint pen something that both caught and held the doctors attention something flickered in his memory what was it that reflected light that shiny something it was as small and lonely but as absolutely a presence as the faroff light of another airplane when you were flying across the miles of darkness over the arabian sea at night farrokh stared into the dining room and at the open veranda through which the shitting crow had flown dr daruwalla looked at the ceiling fan where the crow had landed the doctor kept watching the fan as if he were waiting for it to falter or for the mechanism to catch on somethingthat shiny something which the shitting crow had held in its beak whatever it was it was too big for the crow to have swallowed dr daruwalla thought he took a wild guess i know what it was the doctor said aloud no one else had been talking the others just looked at him as he left the table in the ladies garden and walked into the dining room where he stood directly under the fan then he drew an unused chair away from the nearest table but when he stood on it he was still too short to reach over the top of the blades turn the fan off dr daruwalla shouted to mr sethna who was no stranger to the doctors eccentric behaviorand his fathers before him the old steward shut off the fan almost everyone in the dining room had stopped eating dhar and detective patel rose from their table in the ladies garden and approached farrokh but the doctor waved them away neither of you is tall enough he told them only she is tall enough the doctor was pointing at nancy he was also following the good advice that the deputy commissioner had given to mr sethna try to improve your noticing the fan slowed the blades were unmoving by the time the three men helped nancy to stand on the chair just reach over the top of the fan the doctor instructed her do you feel a groove her full figure above them in the chair was quite striking as she reached into the mechanism i feel something she said walk your fingers around the groove said dr daruwalla what am i looking for nancy asked him youre going to feel it he told her i think its the top half of your pen they had to hold her or she would have fallen for her fingers found it almost the instant that the doctor warned her what it was try not to handle itjust hold it very lightly the deputy commissioner said to his wife she dropped it on the stone floor and the detective retrieved it with a napkin holding it only by the pocket clasp india patel said aloud reading that inscription which had been separated from made in for years it was dhar who lifted nancy down from the chair she felt heavier to him than she had years before she said she needed a moment to be alone with her husband they stood whispering together in the ladies garden while farrokh and john d watched the fan start up again then the doctor and the actor went to join the detective and his wife whod returned to the table surely now youll have rahuls fingerprints dr daruwalla told the deputy commissioner probably said detective patel when mrs dogar comes to eat here well have the steward save us her fork or her spoonto compare but her fingerprints on the top of the pen dont place her at the crime dr daruwalla told them all about the crow clearly the crow had brought the pen from the bougainvillea at the ninth green crows are carrion eaters but what would rahul have been doing with the top of the peni mean during the murder of mr lal detective patel asked in frustration dr daruwalla blurted out you make it sound as if you have to witness another murderor do you expect mrs dogar to offer you a full confession its only necessary to make mrs dogar think that we know more than we know the deputy commissioner answered thats easy dhar said suddenly you tell the murderer what the murderer would confess if the murderer were confessing the trick is youve got to make the murderer think that you really know the murderer precisely patel said wasnt that in inspector dhar and the hanging mali nancy asked the actor she meant that it was dr daruwallas line very good dr daruwalla told her detective patel didnt pat the back of dhars hand he tapped dhar on one knucklejust once but sharplywith a dessert spoon lets be serious said the deputy commissioner im going to offer you a bribesomething youve always wanted theres nothing i want dhar replied i think there is the detective told him i think youd like to play a real policeman i think youd like to make a real arrest dhar said nothinghe didnt even sneer do you think youre still attractive to mrs dogar the detective asked him oh absolutelyyou should see how she looks him over cried dr daruwalla im asking him said detective patel yes i think she wants me dhar replied of course she does nancy said angrily and if i told you how to approach her do you think you could do iti mean exactly as i tell you the detective asked dhar oh yesyou give him any line he can deliver it cried dr daruwalla im asking you the policeman said to dhar this time the dessert spoon rapped his knuckle hard enough for dhar to take his hand off the table you want to set her upis that it dhar asked the deputy commissioner precisely patel said and i just follow your instructions the actor asked him thats itexactly said the deputy commissioner you can do it dr daruwalla declared to dhar thats not the question nancy said the question is do you want to do it detective patel asked dhar i think you really want to all right dhar said okay yes i want to for the first time in the course of the long lunch patel smiled i feel better now that ive bribed you the deputy commissioner told dhar do you see thats all a bribe is reallyjust something you want in exchange for something else its no big deal is it well see dhar said when he looked at nancy she was looking at him youre not sneering nancy said sweetie said detective patel taking her hand i need to go to the ladies room she said you show me where it is she said to dhar but before his wife or the actor could stand up the deputy commissioner stopped them just a trivial matter before you go the detective said what is this nonsense about you and the dwarf brawling with prostitutes on falkland roadwhat is this nonsense about detective patel asked dhar that wasnt him said dr daruwalla quickly so theres some truth to the rumor of a dhar imposter the detective asked not an impostera twin the doctor replied you have a twin nancy asked the actor identical said dhar thats hard to believe she said theyre not at all alike but theyre identical farrokh explained its not the best time for you to have a twin in bombay detective patel told the actor dont worrythe twin is totally out of it a missionary farrokh declared god help us nancy said anyway im taking the twin out of town for a couple of daysat least overnight dr daruwalla told them the doctor started to explain about the children and the circus but no one was interested the ladies room nancy said to dhar where is it dhar was about to take her arm when she walked past him untouched he followed her to the foyer almost everyone in the dining room watched her walkthe woman whod stood on a chair it will be nice for you to get out of town for a couple of days the deputy commissioner said to dr daruwalla time to slip away farrokh was thinking then he realized that even the moment of nancy leaving the ladies garden with dhar had been planned was there something you wanted her to say to him something only she could sayalone the doctor asked the detective oh what a very good question patel replied youre learning doctor the deputy commissioner added ill bet you could write a better movie now a threedollar bill in the foyer nancy said to dhar ive thought about you almost as much as ive thought about rahul sometimes you upset me more i never intended to upset you dhar replied what have you intended what do you intend she asked him when he didnt answer her nancy asked him how did you like lifting me youre always carrying me do i feel heavier to you were both a little heavier than we were dhar answered cautiously i weigh a ton and you know it nancy told him but im not trashi never was i never thought you were trash dhar told her you should never look at people the way you look at me nancy said he did it again there was his sneer thats what i mean she told him i hate you for itthe way you make me feel later after youre gone it makes me keep thinking about you ive thought about you for twenty years she was about three inches taller than the actor when she reached out suddenly and touched his upper lip he stopped sneering thats better now say something nancy told him but dhar was thinking about the dildoif she still had it he couldnt think of what to say you know you really should take some responsibility for the effect you have on people do you ever think about that i think about it all the timeim supposed to have an effect dhar said finally im an actor you sure are nancy said she could see him stop himself from shrugging when he wasnt sneering she liked his mouth more than she thought was possible do you want me do you ever think about that she asked him she saw him thinking about what to say so she didnt wait you dont know how to read what i want do you she asked him youre going to have to be better than this with rahul you cant tell me what i want to hear because you dont really know if i want you do you youre going to have to read rahul better than you can read me nancy repeated i can read you dhar told her i was just trying to be polite i dont believe youyou dont convince me nancy said bad acting she added but she believed him in the ladies room when she washed her hands in the sink nancy saw the absurd faucetthe water flowing from the single spigot which was an elephants trunk nancy adjusted the degree of hot and cold water first with one tusk then the other twenty years ago at the hotel bardez not even four baths had made her feel clean now nancy felt unclean again she was at least relieved to see that there was no winking eye that much rahul had imagined with the help of many murdered womens navels shed also noticed the pulldown platform on the inside of the toiletstall door the handle that lowered the shelf was a ring through an elephants trunk nancy reflected on the psychology that had compelled rahul to select one elephant and reject the other when nancy returned to the ladies garden she offered only a matteroffact comment on her discovery of what she believed to be the source of inspiration for rahuls belly drawings the deputy commissioner and the doctor rushed off to the ladies room to see the telltale elephant for themselves their opportunity to view the victorian faucet was delayed until the last woman had vacated the ladies room even from a considerable distancefrom the far side of the dining roommr sethna was able to observe that inspector dhar and the woman with the obscene navel had nothing to say to each other although they were left alone in the ladies garden for an uncomfortable amount of time later in the car detective patel spoke to nancybefore theyd left the driveway of the duckworth club i have to go back to headquarters but ill take you home first he told her you should be more careful about what you ask me to do vijay nancy said im sorry sweetie patel replied but i wanted to know your opinion can i trust him the deputy commissioner saw that his wife was about to cry again you can trust me nancy cried i know i can trust you sweetie patel said but what about him do you think he can do it hell do anything you tell him if he knows what you want nancy answered and you think rahul will go for him her husband asked oh yes she said bitterly dhar is a pretty cool customer said the detective admiringly dhar is as queer as a threedollar bill nancy told him not being from iowa detective patel had some difficulty with the concept of how queer a threedollar bill wasnot to mention that in bombay they call a bill a note you mean that hes gaya homosexual her husband asked no doubt about it you can trust me nancy repeated they were almost home before she spoke again a very cool customer she added im sorry sweetie said the deputy commissioner because he saw that his wife couldnt stop crying i do love you vijay she managed to say i love you too sweetie the detective told her just some old attractionrepulsion kind of thing in the ladies garden the sun now slanted sideways through the latticework of the bower the same shade of pinkness from the bougainvillea dappled the tablecloth which mr sethna had brushed free of crumbs it seemed to the old steward that dhar and dr daruwalla would never leave the table theyd long ago stopped talking about rahulor rather mrs dogar for the moment they were both more interested in nancy but exactly what do you think is wrong with her farrokh asked john d it appears that the events of the last twenty years have had a strong effect on her dhar answered oh elephant shit cried dr daruwalla cant you just once say what youre really feeling okay dhar said it appears that she and her husband are a real couple very much in love and all of that yes that does appear to be the main thing about them the doctor agreed but farrokh realized that this observation didnt greatly interest him after all he was still very much in love with julia and hed been married longer than detective patel but what was happening between the two of youbetween you and her the doctor asked dhar it was just some old attractionrepulsion kind of thing john d answered evasively the next thing youll tell me is that the world is round farrokh said but the actor merely shrugged suddenly it was not rahul or mrs dogar who frightened dr daruwalla it was dhar the doctor was afraid of and only because dr daruwalla felt that he didnt really know dharnot even after all these years as beforebecause he felt that something unpleasant was pendingfarrokh thought of the circus yet when he mentioned again his upcoming journey to junagadh he saw that john d still wasnt interested you probably think its doomed to failjust another savethechildren project said dr daruwalla like coins in a wishing well like pebbles in the sea it sounds as if you think its doomed to fail dhar told him it was truly time to slip away the doctor thought then dr daruwalla spotted the hawaiian shirt in the paper bag detective patel had left the package under his chair both men were standing ready to leave when the doctor pulled the loud shirt out of the bag well look at that the deputy commissioner actually forgot something how uncharacteristic john d remarked i doubt that he forgot it i think he wanted you to have it dr daruwalla said impulsively the doctor held up the riotous display of parrots in palm trees there were flowers toored and orange and yellow against a jungle of impossible green farrokh placed the shoulders of the shirt against dhars shoulders its the right size for you the doctor observed are you sure you dont want it i have all the shirts i need the actor told him give it to my fucking twin escaping maharashtra ready for rabies this time julia found him in the morning with his face pressing a pencil against the glasstopped table in the dining room an ongoing title search was evident from farrokhs last jottings there was lion piss crossed out blessedly and raging hormones also crossed out she was happy to see but the one that appeared to have pleased the screenwriter before he fell asleep was circled as a movie title julia had her doubts about it it was limo roulette which reminded julia of one of those french films that defy common senseeven when one manages to read every word of the subtitles but this was far too busy a morning for julia to take the time to read the new pages she woke up farrokh by blowing in his ear while he was in the bathtub she made his tea shed already packed his toilet articles and a change of clothes and shed teased her husband about his habit of taking with him a medicalemergency kit of an elaborately paranoid nature after all he was going to be away only one night but dr daruwalla never traveled anywhere in india without bringing with him certain precautionary items erythromycin the preferred antibiotic for bronchitis lomotil for diarrhea he even carried a kit of surgical instruments including sutures and iodophor gauzeand both an antibiotic powder and an ointment in the usual weather infection thrived in the simplest selection of condoms which he freely dispensed without invitation indian men were renowned for not using condoms all dr daruwalla had to do was meet a man who so much as joked about prostitutes in the doctors mind this amounted to a confession herenext time try one of these dr daruwalla would say the doctor also toted with him a halfdozen sterile disposable needles and syringesjust in case anyone needed any kind of shot at a circus people were always being bitten by dogs and monkeys someone had told dr daruwalla that rabies was endemic among chimpanzees for this trip especially farrokh brought along three starterdoses of rabies vaccine together with three ml vials of human rabies immune globulin both the vaccine and the immune globulin required refrigeration but for a journey of less than hours a thermos with ice would be sufficient are you expecting to be bitten by something julia had asked him i was thinking of the new missionary farrokh had replied for he believed that if he were a rabid chimpanzee at the great blue nile he would certainly be inclined to bite martin mills yet julia knew that hed packed enough vaccine and immune globulin to treat himself and the missionary and both childrenjust in case a rabid chimpanzee attacked them all lucky day in the morning the doctor longed to read and revise the new pages of his screenplay but there was too much to do the elephant boy had sold all the clothes that martin mills had bought for him on fashion street julia had anticipated this shed bought the ungrateful little wretch more clothes it was a struggle to get ganesh to take a bathat first because he wanted to do nothing but ride in the elevator and then because hed never been in a building with a balcony overlooking marine drive all he wanted to do was stare at the view ganesh also objected to wearing a sandal on his good foot and even julia doubted the wisdom of concealing the mangled foot in a clean white sock the sock wouldnt stay clean or white for long as for the lone sandal ganesh complained that the strap across the top of his foot hurt him so much he could scarcely walk when the doctor had kissed julia goodbye he steered the disgruntled boy to vinods waiting taxi there in the front seat beside the dwarf was the sullen madhu she was irritated by dr daruwallas difficulty in understanding her languages she had to try both marathi and hindi before the doctor understood that madhu was displeased with the way vinod had dressed her deepa had told the dwarf how to dress the girl im not a child the former child prostitute said although it was clear that it had been deepas intention to make the little whore look like a child the circus wants you to look like a child dr daruwalla told madhu but the girl pouted nor did she respond to ganesh in a sisterly fashion madhu glanced briefly and with disgust at the boys viscid eyes there was a film of tetracycline ointment which had been recently appliedit tended to give ganeshs eyes a glazed quality the boy would need to continue the medication for a week or more before his eyes looked normal i thought they were fixing your eyes madhu said cruelly she spoke in hindi it had been farrokhs impression when hed been alone with madhu or alone with ganesh that both children endeavored to speak english now that the kids were together they lapsed into hindi and marathi at best the doctor spoke hindi tentativelyand marathi hardly at all its important that you behave like a brother and sister farrokh reminded them but the cripples mood was as sulky as madhus if she were my sister id beat her up ganesh said not with that foot you wouldnt madhu told him now now said dr daruwalla hed decided to speak english because he was almost certain that madhu as well as ganesh could understand him and he presumed that in english he commanded more authority this is your lucky day he told them whats a lucky day madhu asked the doctor it doesnt mean anything ganesh said its just an expression dr daruwalla admitted but it does mean something it means that today it is your good fortune to be leaving bombay to be going to the circus so you mean that were luckynot the day the elephantfooted boy replied its too soon to say if were lucky said the child prostitute on that note they arrived at st ignatius where the singleminded missionary had been waiting for them martin mills climbed into the back seat of the ambassador an air of boundless enthusiasm surrounding him this is your lucky day the zealot announced to the children weve been through that said dr daruwalla it was only on a saturday morning out of place at the taj it was when they arrived at the terminal for domestic flights in santa cruz where they were told that their flight to rajkot would be delayed until the end of the day indian airlines dr daruwalla exclaimed at least they are admitting it vinod said dr daruwalla decided that they could wait somewhere more comfortable than the santa cruz terminal but before farrokh could usher them all back inside the dwarfs taxi martin mills had wandered off and bought the morning newspaper on their way back to bombay in rushhour traffic the missionary treated them to snippets from the times of india it would be before they arrived at the taj it was dr daruwallas eccentric decision that they should wait for their flight to rajkot in the lobby of the taj mahal hotel listen to this martin began two brothers stabbed the police have arrested one assailant while two other accused are absconding on a scooter in a rash manner an unexpected use of the present tense not to mention rash the english teacher observed not to mention absconding absconding is a very popular word here farrokh explained sometimes it is the police who are absconding ganesh said what did he say the missionary asked when a crime happens often the police abscond farrokh replied theyre embarrassed that they couldnt prevent the crime or that they cant catch the criminal so they run away but dr daruwalla was thinking that this pattern of behavior didnt apply to detective patel according to john d the deputy commissioner intended to spend the day in the actors suite at the oberoi rehearsing the best way to approach rahul it hurt farrokhs feelings that hed not been invited to participate or that they hadnt offered to hold up the rehearsal until the screenwriter returned from the circus after all there would be dialogue to imagine and to compose and although dialogue wasnt part of the doctors day job it was at least his other business let me be sure that i understand this martin mills said sometimes when theres a crime both the criminals and the police are absconding quite so replied dr daruwalla he was unaware that hed borrowed this expression from detective patel the screenwriter was distracted by pride he was thinking how clever hed been for hed already made similar disrespectful use of the times of india in his screenplay the fictional mr martin is always reading something stupid aloud to the fictional children life imitates art farrokh was thinking when martin mills announced heres a refreshingly frank opinion martin had found the opinion section of the times of india he was reading one of the letters listen to this the missionary said our culture will have to be changed it should start in primary schools by teaching boys not to urinate in the open catch them young in other words said dr daruwalla then ganesh said something that made madhu laugh what did he say martin asked farrokh he said theres no place to pee except in the open dr daruwalla replied then madhu said something that ganesh clearly approved of what did she say the missionary asked she said she prefers to pee in parked carsparticularly at night the doctor told him when they arrived at the taj madhus mouth was full of betel juice the bloodred spittle overflowed the corners of her mouth no betel chewing in the taj the doctor said the girl spat the lurid mess on the front tire of vinods taxi both the dwarf and the sikh doorman observed with disgust how the stain extended into the circular driveway you wont be allowed any paan at the circus the doctor reminded madhu were not at the circus yet said the sullen little whore the circular driveway was overcrowded with taxis and an array of expensivelooking vehicles the elephantfooted boy said something to madhu who was amused what did he say the missionary asked dr daruwalla he said there are lots of cars to pee in the doctor replied then he overheard madhu telling ganesh that shed been in a car like one of the expensivelooking cars before it didnt sound like an empty boast but farrokh resisted the temptation to translate this information for the jesuit as much as dr daruwalla enjoyed shocking martin mills it seemed prurient to speculate on what a child prostitute had been doing in such an expensivelooking car what did madhu say martin asked farrokh she said she would use the ladies room instead dr daruwalla lied good for you martin told the girl when she parted her lips to smile at him her teeth were brightly smeared from the paan it was as if her gums were bleeding the doctor hoped that it was only his imagination that he saw something lewd in madhus smile when they entered the lobby dr daruwalla didnt like the way the doorman followed madhu with his eyes the sikh seemed to know that she wasnt the sort of girl who was permitted at the taj no matter how deepa had told vinod to dress her madhu didnt look like a child ganesh was already shivering from the airconditioning the cripple looked anxious as if he thought the sikh doorman might throw him out the taj was no place for a beggar and a child prostitute dr daruwalla was thinking it was a mistake to have brought them here well just have some tea farrokh assured the children well keep checking on the plane the doctor told the missionary like madhu and ganesh martin appeared overwhelmed by the opulence of the lobby in the few minutes it took dr daruwalla to arrange for special treatment from the assistant manager some lesser official among the hotel staff had already asked the jesuit and the children to leave when that misunderstanding was cleared up vinod appeared in the lobby with the paper bag containing the hawaiian shirt the dwarf was dutifully observing without comment what he thought were inspector dhars delusionsnamely that the famous actor was a jesuit missionary in training to be a priest dr daruwalla had meant to give the hawaiian shirt to martin mills but the doctor had forgotten the bag in the dwarfs taxi not just any taxiwalla would have been permitted in the lobby of the taj but vinod was known as inspector dhars driver when farrokh presented the hawaiian shirt to martin mills the missionary was excited oh its wonderful the zealot cried i used to have one just like it actually this is the one you used to have farrokh admitted no no martin whispered the shirt i used to have was stolen from meone of those prostitutes took it the prostitute gave it back dr daruwalla whispered she did why thats remarkable said martin mills was she contrite he not she said dr daruwalla nohe wasnt contrite i think what do you mean he the missionary said i mean that the prostitute was a him not a her the doctor told martin mills he was a eunuchtransvestiteall of them were men well sort of men what do you mean sort of the missionary said theyre called hijrastheyve been emasculated the doctor whispered a typical surgeon dr daruwalla liked to describe the procedure in exact detailincluding the cauterizing of the wound with hot oil and not forgetting that part of the female anatomy which the puckered scar resembled when it healed when martin mills came back from the mens room he was wearing the hawaiian shirt the brilliant colors of which were a contrast to his pallor farrokh assumed that the paper bag now contained the shirt that the missionary had been wearing upon which poor martin had been sick its a good thing that were getting these children out of this city the zealot gravely told the doctor who once more happily entertained the notion that life was imitating art now if only the fool would shut up so that the screenwriter could read over his new pages dr daruwalla knew that they couldnt spend the whole day at the taj the children were already restless madhu might proposition stray guests at the hotel and the elephant boy would probably steal somethingthose silver trinkets from the souvenir shop the doctor supposed dr daruwalla didnt dare leave the children with martin mills while he phoned ranjit to check his messages he wasnt expecting any messages anywaynothing but emergencies happened on saturday and the doctor wasnt on call this weekend the girls posture further upset farrokh madhu more than slouched in the soft chairshe lolled her dress was hiked up nearly to her hips and she stared into the eyes of every man who passed this certainly detracted from her looking like a child worse madhu seemed to be wearing perfume she smelled a little like deepa to dr daruwalla doubtless vinod had allowed the girl some access to deepas things and madhu had liked the perfume that the dwarfs wife wore also the doctor believed that the airconditioning at the taj was too comfortablein fact it was too cold at the government circuit house in junagadh where dr daruwalla had arranged for them all to spend the night there wouldnt be any airconditioningjust ceiling fansand in the circus where the children would spend the following night and every night thereafter there would be only tents no ceiling fans and probably the mosquito netting would be in disrepair every second they stayed in the lobby of the taj dr daruwalla realized that he was making it harder for the children to adjust to the great blue nile then a most irksome thing happened a messenger boy was paging inspector dhar the method for paging at the taj was rudimentary some thought it quaint the messenger tramped through the lobby with a chalkboard that dangled brass chimes treating everyone in the lobby to an insistent dinging the messenger boy who thought that hed recognized inspector dhar stopped in front of martin mills and shook the board with its incessant chimes chalked on the board was mr dhar wrong man dr daruwalla told the messenger boy but the boy continued to shake the chimes wrong man you moron the doctor shouted but the boy was no moron he wouldnt leave without a tip once he got it he strolled casually away still chiming farrokh was furious were going now he said abruptly going where madhu asked him to the circus asked ganesh no not yetwere just going somewhere else the doctor informed them arent we comfortable here the missionary asked too comfortable dr daruwalla replied actually a tour of bombay would be nicefor me the scholastic said i realize the rest of you are familiar with the city but possibly theres something you wouldnt mind showing me public gardens perhaps i also like marketplaces not a great idea farrokh knewto be dragging dhars twin through public places dr daruwalla was thinking that he could take them all to the duckworth club for lunch it was certain that they wouldnt run into dhar at the taj because john d was rehearsing with detective patel at the oberoi it was therefore likely that they wouldnt run into john d at the club either as for the outside chance that they might encounter rahul it didnt bother dr daruwalla to contemplate having another look at the second mrs dogar the doctor would do nothing to arouse her suspicions but it was too early to go to lunch at the duckworth club and he had to phone for a reservation without one mr sethna would be rude to them too loud for a library back in the ambassador the doctor instructed vinod to drive them to the asiatic society library opposite horniman circle this was one of those oases in the teeming citynot unlike the duckworth club or st ignatiuswhere the doctor was hoping that dhars twin would be safe dr daruwalla was a member of the asiatic society library hed often dozed in the cool highceilinged reading rooms the largerthanlife statues of literary geniuses had barely noticed the screenwriters quiet ascending and descending of the magnificent staircase im taking you to the grandest library in bombay dr daruwalla told martin mills almost a million books almost as many bibliophiles meanwhile the doctor told vinod to drive the children around and around he also told the dwarf that it was important not to let the kids out of the car they liked riding in the ambassador anywaythe anonymity of cruising the city the secrecy of staring at the passing world madhu and ganesh were unfamiliar with taxi riding they stared at everyone as if they themselves were invisibleas if the dwarfs crude ambassador were equipped with oneway windows dr daruwalla wondered if this was because they knew they were safe with vinod theyd never been safe before the doctor had caught just a departing glimpse of the childrens faces at that moment theyd looked frightenedfrightened of what it certainly wasnt that they feared they were being abandoned with a dwarf they werent afraid of vinod no on their faces farrokh had seen a greater anxietythat the circus they were supposedly being delivered to was only a dream that they would never get out of bombay escaping maharashtra it suddenly struck him as a better title than limo roulette but maybe not farrokh thought im quite fond of bibliophiles martin mills was saying as they climbed the stairs for the first time dr daruwalla was aware of how loudly the scholastic spoke the zealot was too loud for a library there are over eight hundred thousand volumes here farrokh whispered this includes ten thousand manuscripts im glad were alone for a moment the missionary said in a voice that rattled the wrought iron of the loggia ssshhh the doctor hissed the marble statues frowned down upon them or of the library staffers had long ago assumed the frowning air of the statuary and dr daruwalla foresaw that the zealot with his booming voice would soon be rebuked by one of the slipperclad scolding types who scurried through the musty recesses of the asiatic society library to avoid a confrontation the doctor steered the scholastic into a reading room with no one in it the ceiling fan had snagged the string that turned the fan on and off and only the slight ticking of the string against the blades disturbed the silence of the moldering air the dusty books sagged on the carved teak shelves numbered cartons of manuscripts were stacked against the bookcases widebottomed leatherpadded chairs surrounded an oval table that was strewn with pencils and pads of notepaper only one of these chairs was on castors it was tilted for it was fourlegged and had only three castorsthe missing castor like a paperweight held down one of the pads of notepaper the american zealot as if compelled by his countrymens irritating instinct to appear handy with all things instantly undertook the task of repairing the broken chair there were a halfdozen other chairs that the doctor and the missionary could have sat in and dr daruwalla suspected that the chair with the detached castor had probably maintained its disabled condition untouched for the last or years perhaps the chair had been partially destroyed in celebration of independencemore than years ago yet here was this fool determined to make it right is there no place in town i can take this idiot farrokh wondered before the doctor could stop the zealot martin mills had upended the chair on the oval table where it made a loud thump come onyou must tell me the missionary said im dying to hear the story of your conversion naturally the father rector has told me about it naturally dr daruwalla thought father julian had doubtless made the doctor come off as a deluded false convert then suddenly to farrokhs surprise the missionary produced a knife it was one of those swiss army knives that dhar liked so mucha kind of toolbox unto itself with something that resembled a leatherpunch the jesuit was boring a hole into the leg of the chair the rotting wood fell on the table it just needs a new screw hole martin explained i cant believe no one knew how to fix it i suppose people just sat in the other chairs dr daruwalla suggested while the scholastic wrestled with the chair leg the nasty little tool on the knife suddenly snapped closed neatly removing a hunk of martins index finger the jesuit bled profusely onto a pad of notepaper now look youve cut yourself dr daruwalla began its nothing the zealot said but it was evident that the chair was beginning to make the man of god angry i want to hear your story come on i know how it starts youre in goa arent you youve just gone to visit the sainted remains of our francis xavier whats left of him and you go to sleep thinking of that pilgrim who bit off st franciss toe i went to sleep thinking of nothing at all farrokh insisted his voice rising ssshhh this is a library the missionary reminded dr daruwalla i know its a library the doctor criedtoo loudly for they werent alone at first unseen but now emerging from a pile of manuscripts was an old man whod been sleeping in a corner chair it was another chair on castors for it wheeled their way its disagreeable rider whod been roused from the depths of whatever sleep his reading material had sunk him into was wearing a nehru jacket which like his hands was gray from transmitted newsprint ssshhh the old reader said then he wheeled back into his corner of the room maybe we should find another place to discuss my conversion farrokh whispered to martin mills im going to fix this chair the jesuit replied now bleeding onto the chair and the table and the pad of notepaper martin mills jammed the rebellious castor into the inverted chair leg with another dangerouslooking tool a stubby screwdriver he struggled to affix the castor to the chair so you went to sleep your mind an absolute blank or so youre telling me and then what i dreamt i was st franciss corpse dr daruwalla began body dreams very common the zealot whispered ssshhh said the old man in the nehru jacket from the corner i dreamt that the crazed pilgrim was biting off my toe farrokh hissed you felt this martin asked of course i felt it hissed the doctor but corpses dont feel do they the scholastic said oh well so you felt the bite and then when i woke up my toe was throbbing i couldnt stand on that foot much less walk and there were bite marksnot broken skin mind you but actual teeth marks those marks were real the bite was real farrokh insisted of course it was real the missionary said something real bit you what could it have been i was on a balconyi was in the air farrokh whispered hoarsely try to keep it down the jesuit whispered are you telling me that this balcony was utterly unapproachable through locked doors where my wife and children were asleep farrokh began ah the children martin mills cried out how old were they i wasnt bitten by my own children dr daruwalla hissed children do bite from time to timeor as a prank the missionary replied ive heard that children go through actual biting ageswhen theyre especially prone to bite i suppose my wife could have been hungry too farrokh said sarcastically there were no trees around the balcony martin mills asked he was now both bleeding and sweating over the stubborn chair i see it coming dr daruwalla said father julians monkey theory biting apes swinging from vinesis that what you think the point is you were really bitten werent you the jesuit asked him people get so confused about miracles the miracle wasnt that something bit you the miracle is that you believe your faith is the miracle it hardly matters that it was something common that triggered it what happened to my toe wasnt common the doctor cried the old reader in the nehru jacket shot out of his corner on his chair on castors ssshhh the old man hissed are you trying to read or trying to sleep the doctor shouted at the old gentleman come onyoure disturbing him he was here first martin mills told dr daruwalla look the scholastic said to the old man as if the angry reader were a child see this chair ive fixed it want to try it the missionary set the chair on all four castors and rolled it back and forth the gentleman in the nehru jacket eyed the zealot warily he has his own chair for gods sake farrokh said come ongive it a try the missionary urged the old reader i have to find a telephone dr daruwalla pleaded with the zealot i should make a reservation for lunch and we should stay with the childrentheyre probably bored but to his dismay the doctor saw that martin mills was staring up at the ceiling fan the tangled string had caught the handymans eye that string is annoyingif youre trying to read the scholastic said he climbed up on the oval table which accepted his weight reluctantly youll break the table the doctor warned him i wont break the tableim thinking of fixing the fan martin mills replied slowly and awkwardly the jesuit went from kneeling to standing i can see what youre thinkingyoure crazy dr daruwalla said come onyoure just angry about your miracle the missionary said im not trying to take your miracle away from you im only trying to make you see the real miracle it is simply that you believenot the silly thing that made you believe the biting was only a vehicle the biting was the miracle dr daruwalla cried no nothats where youre wrong martin mills managed to say just before the table collapsed under him falling he reached forand fortunately missedthe fan the gentleman in the nehru jacket was the most astonished when martin mills fell the old reader was cautiously trying out the newly repaired chair the collapse of the table and the missionarys cry of alarm sent the old man scrambling the chair leg with the freshly bored hole rejected the castor while both the old reader and the jesuit lay on the floor dr daruwalla was left to calm down the outraged library staffer whod shuffled into the reading room in his slippers we were just leaving dr daruwalla told the librarian its too noisy here to concentrate on anything at all sweating and bleeding and limping the missionary followed farrokh down the grand staircase under the frowning statues to relax himself dr daruwalla was chanting life imitates art life imitates art whats that you say asked martin mills ssshhh the doctor told him this is a library dont be angry about your miracle the zealot said it was long ago i dont think i believe in anything anymore farrokh replied dont say that the missionary cried ssshhh farrokh whispered to him i know i know said martin mills this is a library it was almost noon outside in the glaring sunlight they stared into the street without seeing the taxi that was parked at the curb vinod had to walk up to them the dwarf led them to the car as if they were blind inside the ambassador the children were crying they were sure that the circus was a myth or a hoax no noits real dr daruwalla assured them were going there we really areits just that the plane is delayed but what did madhu or ganesh know about airplanes the doctor assumed that theyd never flown flying would be another terror for them and when the children saw that martin mills was bleeding they were worried that thered been some violence only to a chair farrokh said he was angry at himself for in the confusion hed forgotten to reserve his favorite table in the ladies garden he knew that mr sethna would find a way to abuse him for this oversight a misunderstanding at the urinal as punishment mr sethna had given the doctors table to mr and mrs kohinoor and mrs kohinoors noisy unmarried sister the latter woman was so shrill not even the bower of flowers in the ladies garden could absorb her whinnies or brays probably on purpose mr sethna had seated dr daruwallas party at a table in a neglected corner of the garden where the waiters either ignored you or failed to see you from their stations in the dining room a torn vine of the bougainvillea hung down from the bower and brushed the back of dr daruwallas neck like a claw the good news was it wasnt chinese day madhu and ganesh ordered vegetarian kabobs the vegetables were broiled or grilled on skewers it was a dish that children sometimes ate with their fingers while the doctor hoped that madhus and ganeshs unfamiliarity with knives and forks would go unnoticed mr sethna speculated on whose children they were the old steward observed that the cripple had kicked his one sandal off the calluses on the sole of the boys good foot were as thick as a beggars the foot the elephant had stepped on was still concealed by the sock which was already graybrown and it didnt fool mr sethna who could tell that the hidden foot was oddly flattenedthe boy had limped on his heel on the ball of the bad foot the sock was still mostly white as for the girl the steward detected something lascivious in her posture furthermore mr sethna concluded that madhu had never been in a restaurant beforeshe stared too openly at the waiters dr daruwallas grandchildren would have been better behaved than this and although inspector dhar had proclaimed to the press that he would sire only indian babies these children bore no resemblance to the famous actor as for the actor he looked awful mr sethna thought possibly hed forgotten to wear his makeup inspector dhar looked pale and in need of sleep his gaudy shirt was outrageous there was blood on his pants and overnight his physique had deterioratedhe must be suffering from acute diarrhea the old steward determined how else does one manage to lose to pounds in a day and had the actors head been shaved by muggers or was his hair falling out on second thought mr sethna suspected that dhar was the victim of a sexually transmitted disease in a sick culture where movie actors were revered as demigods a lifestyle contagion was to be expected that will bring the bastard down to earth mr sethna thought maybe inspector dhar has aids the old steward was sorely tempted to place an anonymous phone call to stardust or cine blitz surely either of these filmgossip magazines would be intrigued by such a rumor i wouldnt marry him if he owned the queens necklace and he offered me half cried mrs kohinoors unmarried sister i wouldnt marry him if he gave me all of london if you were in london i could still hear you thought dr daruwalla he picked at his pomfret the fish at the duckworth club was unfailingly overcookedfarrokh wondered why hed ordered it he envied how martin mills attacked his meat kabobs the meat kept falling out of the flatbread because martin had stripped the skewers and tried to make a sandwich the missionarys hands were covered with chopped onions a darkgreen flag of mint leaf was stuck between the zealots upper front teeth as a polite way of suggesting that the jesuit take a look at himself in a mirror farrokh said you might want to use the mens room here martin its more comfortable than the facilities at the airport throughout lunch dr daruwalla couldnt stop glancing at his watch even though vinod had called indian airlines repeatedly the dwarf predicted a lateafternoon departure at the earliest they were in no hurry the doctor had called his office only to learn that there were no messages of any importance thered been just one call for him and ranjit had handled the matter competently mr garg had phoned for the mailing address in junagadh of the great blue nile circus garg had told ranjit that he wanted to send madhu a letter it was odd that mr garg hadnt asked vinod or deepa for the address for the doctor had obtained the address from the dwarfs wife it was odder still how garg imagined that madhu could read a letter or even a postcard madhu couldnt read but the doctor guessed that mr garg was euphoric to learn that madhu was not hivpositive maybe the creep wanted to send the poor child a thankyou note or merely give her goodluck wishes now short of telling him that he wore a mint leaf on his front teeth there seemed no way to compel martin mills to visit the mens room the scholastic took the children to the card room there he tried in vain to teach them crazy eights soon the cards were speckled with blood the zealots index finger was still bleeding rather than unearth his medical supplies from his suitcase which was in the ambassadorbesides the doctor had packed nothing as simple as a bandaidfarrokh asked mr sethna for a small bandage the old steward delivered the bandaid to the card room with characteristic scorn and inappropriate ceremony he presented the bandage to martin mills on the silver serving tray which the steward extended at arms length dr daruwalla took this occasion to tell the jesuit you should probably wash that wound in the mens roombefore you bandage it but martin mills washed and bandaged his finger without once looking in the mirror above the sink or in the fulllength mirrorexcept at some distance and only to appraise his lostandfound hawaiian shirt the missionary never spotted the mint leaf on his teeth he did however notice a tissue dispenser near the flush handle for the urinal and he noted further that every flush handle had a tissue dispenser in close proximity to it these tissues when used were not carelessly deposited in the urinals rather there was a silver bucket at the end of the lineup of urinals something like an ice bucket without ice and the used tissues were deposited in it this system seemed exceedingly fastidious and ultrahygienic to martin mills who reflected that hed never wiped his penis with a tissue before the process of urinating was made to seem more important certainly more solemn by the expectation of wiping ones penis after the act at least this is what martin mills assumed the tissues were for it troubled him that no other duckworthians were urinating at any of the other urinals therefore he couldnt be sure of the purpose of the tissue dispensers he was about to finish peeing as usualthat is without wiping himselfwhen the unfriendly old steward who had presented the jesuit with his bandaid entered the mens room the silver serving tray was stuck in one armpit and rested against the forearm of the same arm as if mr sethna were carrying a rifle because someone was watching him martin mills thought he should use a tissue he tried to wipe himself as if he always completed a responsible act of urination in this fashion but he was so unfamiliar with the process the tissue briefly caught on the end of his penis and then fell into the urinal what was the protocol in the case of such a mishap martin wondered the stewards beady eyes were fastened on the jesuit as if inspired martin mills seized several fresh tissues and with these held between his bandaged index finger and his thumb he plucked the lost tissue from the urinal with a flourish he deposited the bunch of tissues in the silver bucket which tilted suddenly and almost toppled the missionary had to steady it with both hands martin tried to smile reassuringly to mr sethna but he realized that because hed grabbed the silver bucket with both hands hed neglected to return his penis to his pants maybe this was why the old steward looked away when martin mills had left the mens room mr sethna gave the missionarys urinal a wide berth the steward peed as far away as possible from where the diseased actor had peed it was definitely a sexually transmitted disease mr sethna thought the steward had never witnessed such a grotesque example of urination he couldnt imagine the medical necessity of dabbing ones penis every time one peed the old steward didnt know for certain if there were other duckworthians who made the same use of the tissue dispensers as martin mills had made for years mr sethna had assumed that the tissues were for wiping ones fingers and now after hed wiped his fingers mr sethna accurately deposited his tissue in the silver bucket ruefully reflecting on the fate of inspector dhar once a demigod now a terminal patient for the first time since hed poured hot tea on the head of that fop wearing the wig the world struck mr sethna as fair and just in the card room while martin mills had been experimenting at the urinal dr daruwalla realized why the children had such difficulty in grasping crazy eights or any other card game no one had ever taught them their numbers not only could they not read they couldnt count the doctor was holding up his fingers with the corresponding playing cardthree fingers with the three of heartswhen martin mills returned from the mens room still sporting the mint leaf on his front teeth fear no evil their plane to rajkot took off at in the afternoon not quite eight hours after its scheduled departure it was a tiredlooking the inscription on the fuselage was legible but faded forty years of freedom dr daruwalla quickly calculated that the plane had first been put in service in india in where it had flown before then was anybodys guess their departure was further delayed by the need of the petty officials to confiscate martin millss swiss army knifea potential terrorists tool the pilot would carry the weapon in his pocket and hand it over to martin in rajkot well i suppose ill never see it again the missionary said he didnt say this stoically but more like a martyr farrokh wasted no time in teasing him it cant matter to you the doctor told him youve taken a vow of poverty havent you i know what you think about my vows martin replied you think that because ive accepted poverty i must have no fondness for material things this shirt for examplemy knife my books and you think that because ive accepted chastity i must be free of sexual desire well ill tell you i resisted the commitment to become a priest not only because of how much i did like my few things but also because i imagined i was in love for ten years i was smitten i not only suffered from sexual desire id embraced a sexual obsession there was absolutely no getting this person out of my mind does this surprise you yes it does dr daruwalla admitted humbly he was also afraid of what the lunatic might confess in front of the children but ganesh and madhu were too enthralled with the airplanes preparations for takeoff to pay the slightest attention to the jesuits confession i continued to teach at this wretched schoolthe students were delinquents not scholarsand all because i had to test myself martin mills told dr daruwalla the object of my desire was there were i to leave to run away i would never have known if i had the strength to resist such a temptation and so i stayed i forced myself into the closest possible proximity to this person only to see if i had the courage to withstand such an attraction but i know what you think of priestly denial you think that priests are people who simply dont feel these ordinary desires or who feel them less strongly than you do im not judging you said dr daruwalla yes you are martin replied you think you know all about me this person that you were in love with the doctor began it was another teacher at the school the missionary answered i was crippled by desire but i kept the object of my desire this close to me and here the zealot held his hand in front of his face eventually the attraction lessened lessened farrokh repeated either the attraction went away or i overcame it said martin mills finally i won what did you win farrokh asked not freedom from desire the wouldbe priest declared it is more like freedom from the fear of desire now i know i can resist it but what about her dr daruwalla asked her said martin mills i mean what were her feelings for you the doctor asked him did she even know how you felt about her him the missionary replied it was a he not a she does that surprise you yes it does the doctor lied what surprised him was how unsurprised he was by the jesuits confession the doctor was upset without understanding why farrokh felt greatly disturbed without knowing the reason but the plane was taxiing and even its lumbering movement on the runway was sufficient to panic madhu shed been sitting across the aisle from dr daruwalla and the missionarynow she wanted to move over and sit with the doctor ganesh was happily ensconced in the window seat awkwardly martin mills changed places with madhu the jesuit sat with the enraptured boy and the child prostitute slipped into the aisle seat next to farrokh dont be frightened the doctor told her i dont want to go to the circus the girl said she stared down the aisle refusing to look out the windows she wasnt alone in her inexperience half the passengers appeared to be flying for the first time one hand reached to adjust the flow of air then other hands were reaching despite the repeated announcement that carryon baggage be stowed under the seats the passengers insisted on piling their heavy bags on what the flight attendant kept calling the hat rack although there were few hats on board perhaps the fault lay with the long delay but there were many flies on board they were treated with a vast indifference by the otherwise excited passengers someone was already vomiting and they hadnt even taken off at last they took off the elephant boy believed he could fly his animation appeared to be lifting the plane the little beggar will ride a lion if they tell him to hell wrestle a tiger dr daruwalla thought how suddenly the doctor felt afraid for the cripple ganesh would climb to the top of the tentthe full feet probably in compensation for his useless foot the boys hands and arms were exceptionally strong what instincts will protect him the doctor wondered while in his arms he felt madhu tremble she was moaning in her slight bosom the beating of her heart throbbed against farrokhs chest if we crash do we burn or fly apart in little pieces the girl asked him her mouth against his throat we wont crash madhu he told her you dont know she replied at the circus i could be eaten by a wild animal or i could fall and what if they cant train me or if they beat me listen to me said dr daruwalla he was a father again he remembered his daughterstheir nightmares their scrapes and bruises and their worst days at school their awful first boyfriends who were beyond redemption but the consequences for the crying girl in his arms were greater try to look at it this way the doctor said you are escaping but he could say no more he knew only what she was escapingnot what she was fleeing to out of the jaws of one kind of death into the jaws of another i hope not was all the doctor thought something will get me madhu replied with her hot shallow breathing against his neck farrokh instantly knew why martin millss admission of homosexual desire had distressed him if dhars twin was fighting against his sexual inclination what was john d doing dr duncan frasier had convinced dr daruwalla that homosexuality was more a matter of biology than of conditioning frasier had once told farrokh that there was a percent chance that the identical twin of a gay male would also be gay furthermore farrokhs friend and colleague dr macfarlane had convinced him that homosexuality was immutable if homosexuality is a learned behavior how come it cant be unlearned mac had said but what upset dr daruwalla was not the doctors sudden conviction that john d must also be a homosexual rather it was all the years of john ds aloofness and the remoteness of his swiss life neville not danny must have been the twins father after all and what does it say about me that john d wouldnt tell me the doctor wondered instinctively as if she were his beloved john d farrokh hugged the girl later he supposed that madhu only did as shed been taught to do she hugged him back but in an inappropriately wriggling fashion it shocked him he pulled away from her when she began to kiss his throat no please he began to say then the missionary spoke to him clearly the elephant boys delight with flying had delighted martin mills look at him ill bet hed try to walk on the wing if we told him it was safe the zealot said yes ill bet he would said dr daruwalla whose gaze never left madhus face the fear and confusion of the child prostitute were a mirror of farrokhs feelings what do you want the girl whispered to him no its not what you think i want you to escape the doctor told her the concept meant nothing to her she didnt respond she continued to stare at him in her eyes trust still lingered with her confusion at the bloodred edge of her lips the unnatural redness once more overflowed her mouth madhu was eating paan again where shed kissed farrokh his throat was marked with the lurid stain as if a vampire had bitten him he touched the mark and his fingertips came away with the color on them the jesuit saw him staring at his hand did you cut yourself martin mills asked no im fine dr daruwalla replied but he wasnt farrokh was admitting to himself that he knew even less about desire than the wouldbe priest did probably sensing his confusion madhu once more pressed herself against the doctors chest once again in a whisper she asked him what do you want it horrified the doctor to realize that madhu was asking him a sexual question i want you to be a child because you are a child farrokh told the girl please wont you try to be a child there was such an eagerness in madhus smile that for a moment the doctor believed the girl had understood him quite like a child she walked her fingers over his thigh then unlike a child madhu pressed her small palm firmly on dr daruwallas penis thered been no groping for it shed known exactly where it was through the summerweight material of his pants the doctor felt the heat of madhus hand ill try what you wantanything you want the child prostitute told him instantly dr daruwalla pulled her hand away stop that farrokh cried i want to sit with ganesh the girl told him farrokh let her change seats with martin mills theres a matter ive been pondering the missionary whispered to the doctor you said we had two rooms for the night only two i suppose we could get more the doctor began his legs were shaking no nothats not what im getting at martin said i mean were you thinking the children would share one room and wed share the other yes dr daruwalla replied he couldnt stop his legs from shaking butwell i know youll think this is silly butit would seem prudent to me to not allow them to sleep together i mean not in the same room the missionary added after all there is the matter of what we can only guess has been the girls orientation her what the doctor asked he could stop one leg from shaking but not the other her sexual experience i mean said martin mills we must assume shes had some sexual contact what i mean is what if madhu is inclined to seduce ganesh do you know what i mean dr daruwalla knew very well what martin mills meant you have a point was all the doctor said in reply well then suppose the boy and i take one room and you and madhu take the other you see i dont think the father rector would approve of someone in my position sharing a room with the girl martin explained it might seem contradictory to my vows yes your vows farrokh replied finally his other leg stopped shaking do you think im being totally silly the jesuit asked the doctor i suppose you think its idiotic of me to suggest that madhu might be so inclinedjust because the poor child was what she was but farrokh could feel that he still had an erection and madhu had touched him so briefly no i think youre wise to be a little worried about her inclination dr daruwalla answered he spoke slowly because he was trying to remember the popular psalm how does it gothe twentythird psalm the doctor asked the scholastic yea though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil said martin mills yesthats it i will fear no evil farrokh repeated dr daruwalla assumed that the plane had left maharashtra he guessed they were already flying over gujarat below them the land was flat and drylooking in the lateafternoon haze the sky was as brown as the ground limo roulette or escaping maharashtrathe screenwriter couldnt make up his mind between the two titles farrokh thought it depends on what happensit depends on how the story ends the temptation of dr daruwalla on the road to junagadh at the airport in rajkot they were testing the loudspeaker system it was a test without urgency as if the loudspeaker were of no real importanceas if no one believed there could be an emergency one two three four five said a voice five four three two one then the message was repeated maybe they werent testing the loudspeaker system thought dr daruwalla possibly they were testing their counting skills while the doctor and martin mills were gathering the bags their pilot appeared and handed the swiss army knife to the missionary at first martin was embarrassedhed forgotten that hed been forced to relinquish the weapon in bombay then he was ashamed for hed assumed the pilot was a thief while this demonstration of social awkwardness was unfolding madhu and ganesh each ordered and drank two glasses of tea dr daruwalla was left to haggle with the chai vendor well have to be stopping all the way to junagadh so you can pee farrokh told the children then they waited nearly an hour in rajkot for their driver to arrive all the while the loudspeaker system went on counting up to five and down to one it was an annoying airport but madhu and ganesh had plenty of time to pee their drivers name was ramu he was a roustabout whod joined the great blue nile circus in maharashtra and this was his second round trip between junagadh and rajkot today hed been on time to meet the plane in the morning when he learned that the flight was delayed he drove back to the circus in junagadhonly because he liked to drive it was nearly a threehour trip one way but ramu proudly told them that he usually covered the distance in under two hours they soon saw why ramu drove a battered land rover spattered with mud or the dried blood of unlucky pedestrians and animals he was a slight young man perhaps or and he wore a baggy pair of shorts and a begrimed tshirt most notably ramu drove barefoot the padding had worn off the clutch and brake pedalstheir smooth metal surfaces looked slipperyand the doubtlessly overused accelerator pedal had been replaced by a piece of wood it looked as flimsy as a shingle but ramu never took his right foot off it he preferred to operate both the clutch and the brake with his left foot although the latter pedal received little attention through rajkot they roared into the twilight they passed a water tower a womens hospital a bus station a bank a fruit market a statue of gandhi a telegraph office a library a cemetery the havmore restaurant and the hotel intimate when they raced through the bazaar area dr daruwalla couldnt look anymore there were too many childrennot to mention the elderly who werent as quick to get out of the way as the children not to mention the bullock carts and the camel wagons and the cows and donkeys and goats not to mention the mopeds and the bicycles and the bicycle rickshaws and the threewheeled rickshaws and of course there were cars and trucks and buses too at the edge of town off the side of the road farrokh was sure that he spotted a dead mananother nonperson as ganesh would saybut at the speed they were traveling there was no time for dr daruwalla to ask martin mills to verify the shape of death with the frozen face that the doctor saw once they were out of town ramu drove faster the roustabout subscribed to the openroad school of driving there were no rules about passing in the lane of oncoming traffic ramu yielded only to those vehicles that were bigger in ramus mind the land rover was bigger than anything on the roadexcept for buses and a highly selective category of heavyduty trucks dr daruwalla was grateful that ganesh sat in the passenger seat both the boy and madhu had wanted that seat but the doctor was afraid that madhu would distract the drivera highspeed seduction so the girl sulked in the back with the doctor and the missionary while the elephant boy chatted nonstop with ramu ganesh had probably expected that the driver would speak only gujarati to discover that ramu was a fellow maharashtrian who spoke marathi and hindi inspired the beggar although farrokh found their conversation difficult to follow it seemed that ganesh wanted to list all the possible circusrelated activities that a cripple with one good foot might do for his part ramu was discouraging he preferred to talk about driving while demonstrating his violent technique of upshifting and downshifting instead of using the brakes assuring ganesh that it would be impossible to match his skill as a driver without a functioning right foot to ramus credit he didnt look at ganesh when he talked thankfully the driver was transfixed by the developing madness on the road soon it would be dark perhaps then the doctor could relax for it would be better not to see ones own death approaching after nightfall there would be only the sudden nearness of a blaring horn and the blinding onrushing headlights farrokh imagined the entanglement of bodies in the rolling land rover a foot here a hand there the back of someones head a flailing elbowand not knowing who was who or in which direction the ground was or the black sky for the headlights would surely be shattered and in ones hair there would be fragments of glass as fine as sand they would smell the gasoline it would be soaking their clothes at last they would see the ball of flame distract me dr daruwalla said to martin mills start talking tell me anything at all the jesuit whod spent his childhood on the los angeles freeways seemed at ease in the careening land rover the burnedout wrecks off the side of the road were of no interest to himnot even the occasional upsidedown car that was still on fireand the carnage of animals that dotted the highway interested him only when he couldnt identify their remains what was that did you see that the missionary asked his head whipping around a dead bullock answered dr daruwalla please talk to me martin i know it was dead said martin mills whats a bullock a castrated bulla steer farrokh replied theres another one the scholastic cried his head turning again no that was a cow the doctor said i saw a camel earlier martin remarked did you see the camel yes i saw it farrokh answered him now tell me a story it will be dark soon a pitytheres so much to see said martin mills distract me for gods sake dr daruwalla cried i know you like to talktell me anything at all well what do you want me to tell you about the missionary asked farrokh wanted to kill him the girl had fallen asleep theyd made her sit between them because they were afraid shed lean against one of the rear doors now she could lean only against them asleep madhu seemed as frail as a rag doll they had to press against her and hold her shoulders to keep her from flopping around her scented hair brushed against dr daruwallas throat at the open collar of his shirt her hair smelled like clove then the land rover would swerve and madhu would slump against the jesuit who took no notice of her but farrokh felt her hip against his as the land rover again pulled out to pass madhus shoulder ground against the doctors ribs her hand which was limp dragged across his thigh sometimes when farrokh could feel madhu breathe he held his breath the doctor wasnt looking forward to the awkwardness of spending the night in the same room with her it was not only from ramus reckless driving that farrokh sought some distraction tell me about your mother dr daruwalla said to martin mills how is she in the failing but lingering light the doctor could see the missionarys neck tighten his eyes narrowed and your fatherhows danny doing the doctor added but the damage had already been done farrokh could tell that martin hadnt heard him the second time the jesuit was searching the past the landscape of hideously slain animals flew by but the zealot no longer noticed all right if thats what you want im going to tell you a little story about my mother said martin mills somehow dr daruwalla knew that the story wouldnt be little the missionary wasnt a minimalist he favored description in fact martin left out no detail he told farrokh absolutely everything he could remember the exquisiteness of arif komas complexion the different odors of masturbationnot only arifs but also the smell that lingered on the ucla babysitters fingers thus they hurtled through the darkened countryside and the dimly lit towns where the reek of cooking and excrement assailed themtogether with the squabbling of chickens the barking of dogs and the savage threats of the shouting almostrunover pedestrians ramu apologized that his driversside window was missing not only did the rushing night air grow cooler but the backseat passengers were struck by flying insects once something the size of a hummingbird smacked against martins forehead it must have stung and for five minutes or more it lay buzzing and whirring on the floor before it diedwhatever it was but the missionarys story was unstoppable nothing could deter him it took him all the way to junagadh to finish as they entered the brightly lit town the streets were teeming two crowds were surging against each other a loudspeaker on a parked truck played circus music one crowd was coming from the earlyevening show the other hurrying to line up for the show that was to start later on i should tell the poor bastard everything dr daruwalla was thinking that he has a twin that his mother was always a slut that neville eden was probably his real father danny was too dumb to be the father both john d and martin mills were smart neville although farrokh had never liked him had been smart but martins story had struck farrokh speechless moreover the doctor believed that these revelations should be john ds decision and although dr daruwalla wanted to punish vera in almost any way that he could the one thing that martin had said about danny contributed further to the doctors silence i love my fatheri just wish i didnt pity him the rest of the story was all about vera martin hadnt said another word about danny the doctor decided that it wasnt a good time for the jesuit to hear that his probable father was a twotiming bisexual shit named neville eden this news would not help martin to pity danny any less besides they were almost at the circus the elephantfooted boy was so excited he was kneeling on the front seat and waving out the window at the mob the circus music which was blaring at them over the loudspeaker had managed to wake up madhu heres your new life dr daruwalla told the child prostitute wake up and see it a racist chimpanzee although ramu never stopped blowing the horn the land rover barely crawled through the crowd several small boys clung to the door handles and the rear bumper allowing themselves to be dragged along the road everyone stared into the back seat madhu was mistaken to be anxious the crowd wasnt staring at her it was martin mills who drew their attention they were unused to white men junagadh wasnt a tourist town the missionarys skin was as pale as dough in the glare from the streetlights because they were forced to move ahead so slowly it grew hot in the car but when martin rolled his rear window down people reached inside the land rover just to touch him far ahead of them a dwarf clown on stilts was leading the throng it was even more congested at the circus because it was too early to let the crowd in the land rover had to inch its way through the wellguarded gate once inside the compound dr daruwalla appreciated a familiar sensation the circus was a cloister a protected place it was as exempt from the mayhem of junagadh as st ignatius stood like a fort within the chaos of bombay the children would be safe here provided that they gave the place a chanceprovided that the circus gave them a chance but the first omen was inhospitable deepa didnt meet them the dwarfs wife and son were sickconfined to their tent and almost immediately dr daruwalla could sense how the great blue nile compared unfavorably to the great royal there was no owner of the charm and dignity of pratap walawalkar in fact the owner of the great blue nile was away no dinner was waiting for them in the owners tent which they never saw the ringmaster was a bengali named das there was no food in mr dass tent and the sleeping cots were all in a row as in a spartan barracks a minimum of ornamentation was draped on the walls the dirt floor was completely covered with rugs bolts of brightly colored fabric for costumes were hung high in the apex of the tent out of everyones way and the trappings of a temple were prominently displayed alongside the tv and vcr a cot like all the others was identified as madhus mr das was putting her between two older girls who he said would mind her mrs das the ringmaster assured them would mind madhu too as for mrs das she didnt get off her cot to greet them she sat sewing sequins on a costume and only as they were leaving the tent did she speak to madhu i am meeting you tomorrow she told the girl what time shall we come in the morning dr daruwalla asked but mrs daswho manifested something of the victimized severity of an unexpectedly divorced auntdidnt answer him her head remained lowered her eyes on her sewing dont come too early because well be watching television mr das told the doctor well naturally dr daruwalla thought ganeshs cot would be set up in the cooks tent where mr das escorted themand where he left them he said he had to prepare for the show the cook whose name was chandra assumed that ganesh had been sent to help him chandra began to identify his utensils to the cripple who listened indifferentlydr daruwalla knew that the boy wanted to see the lions kadhai a wok jhara a slotted spoon kisni a coconut grater from outside the cooks tent in the darkness they also listened to the regular coughs of the lions the crowd still hadnt been admitted to the main tent but they were present in the darkness like the lions as a kind of background murmur dr daruwalla didnt notice the mosquitoes until he began to eat the doctor and the others ate standing up off stainlesssteel platescurried potatoes and eggplant with too much cumin then they were offered a plate of raw vegetablescarrots and radishes onions and tomatoeswhich they washed down with warm orange soda good old gold spot gujarat was a dry state because gandhi was born therethe tedious teetotaler farrokh reflected that he would probably be awake all night hed been counting on beer to keep him away from his screenplay to help him sleep then he remembered that hed be sharing a room with madhu in that case it would be best to stay awake all night and to not have any beer throughout their hasty unsatisfying meal chandra progressed to naming vegetables to ganesh as if the cook assumed the boy had lost his language in the same accident that had mangled his foot aloo potato chawli a white pea baingan eggplant as for madhu she appeared neglected and she was shivering surely she had a shawl or a sweater in her small bag but all their bags were still in the land rover which was parked god knew where ramu their driver was god knew where too besides it was almost time for the late show when they stepped into the avenue of troupe tents they saw that the performers were already in costume the elephants were being led down the aisle in the wing of the main tent the horses were standing in line a roustabout had already saddled the first horse then a trainer prodded a big chimpanzee with a stick launching the animal into what appeared to be a vertical leap of at least five feet the horse had started forward just a nervous step or two when the chimpanzee landed on the saddle there the chimp squatted on all fours when the trainer touched the saddle with his stick the chimpanzee performed a front flip on the horses backand then another the band was already on the platform stage above the arena which was still filling with the crowd the visitors would be in the way if they stood in the wing but mr das the ringmaster hadnt appeared there was no one to show them to their seats martin mills suggested that they find seats for themselves before the tent was full dr daruwalla resented such informality while the doctor and the missionary were arguing about what to do the chimp doing front flips on the horse grew distracted martin mills was the distraction the chimpanzee was an old male named gautam because even as a baby hed demonstrated a remarkable similarity to buddha he could sit in the same position and stare at the same thing for hours as hed aged gautam had extended his capacity for meditation to include certain repetitive exercises the front flips on the horses back were but one example gautam could repeat the move tirelessly whether the horse was galloping or standing still the chimpanzee always landed on the saddle there was however a diminished enthusiasm to gautams front flips and to his other activities as well his trainer kunal attributed gautams emotional decline to the big chimps infatuation with mira a young female chimpanzee mira was new to the great blue nile and gautam could be observed pining for heroften at inappropriate times if he saw mira when he was doing front flips gautam would miss not only the saddle but the whole horse hence mira rode a horse far back in the procession of animals that paraded around the main tent during the grand entry it was only when gautam was warming up in the wing that the old chimpanzee could spot mira she was kept near the elephants because gautam was afraid of elephants at some trancelike distance in gautams mind this view of miraas the big chimp waited for the curtains to open and the grand entry music to beginsatisfied him he kept doing front flips mechanically almost as if the jumps were triggered by a mild electrical shock at about fivesecond intervals in the corner of gautams eye mira was a faraway presence nevertheless she was enough of a presence to soothe him gautam became extremely unhappy if his view of mira was blocked only kunal was allowed to pass between the chimp and his view of mira kunal never stood anywhere near gautam without a stick in his hand gautam was big for a chimp according to kunal the ape weighed pounds and was almost five feet tall simply put martin mills was standing in the wrong place at the wrong time after the attack kunal speculated that gautam might have imagined that the missionary was another male chimpanzee not only had martin blocked gautams view of mira but gautam might have assumed that the missionary was seeking miras affectionfor mira was a very affectionate female and her friendliness to male chimpanzees was something that regularly drove gautam insane as for why gautam might have mistaken martin mills for an ape kunal suggested that the paleness of the scholastics skin would surely have struck gautam as unnatural for a human being if martins skin color was a novelty to the people of junagadhwho after all had gawked at him and pawed him over in the passing land rovermartins skin was only slightly less foreign to gautams experience since to gautam martin mills didnt look like a human being the ape probably thought that the missionary was a male chim it was with a logic of this kind that gautam interrupted his front flips on the horses back the chimpanzee screamed once and bared his fangs then he vaulted from the rump of the horse and over the back of another horse landing on martins shoulders and chest and driving the missionary to his back on the ground there gautam sunk his teeth into the side of the surprised jesuits neck martin was fortunate to have protected his throat with his hand but this meant that his hand was bitten too when it was over there was a deep puncture wound in martins neck and a slash wound from the heel of his hand to the ball of his thumb and a small piece of the missionarys right earlobe was missing gautam was too strong to be pulled off the struggling scholastic but kunal was able to beat the ape away with his stick the whole time mira was shrieking it was hard to tell if her cries signified requited love or disapproval the discussion of whether the chimp attack had been racially motivated or sexually inspired or both continued throughout the lateevening show martin mills refused to allow dr daruwalla to attend to his wounds until the performance was concluded the jesuit insisted that the children would learn a valuable lesson from his stoicism which the doctor regarded as a stupid stoicism of the showmustgoon variety both madhu and ganesh were distracted by the missionarys missing earlobe and the other gory evidence of the savage biting that the zealot had suffered madhu hardly watched the circus at all farrokh however paid close attention the doctor was content to let the missionary bleed dr daruwalla didnt want to miss the performance a perfect ending the better acts had been borrowed from the great royalin particular an item called bicycle waltz for which the band played the yellow rose of texas a thin muscular woman of an obvious sinewy strength performed the skywalk at a fast mechanical pace the audience was unfrightened for her even without a safety net there was no palpable fear that she could fall while suman looked beautiful and vulnerableas could be expected of a young woman hanging upside down at feetthe skywalker at the great blue nile resembled a middleaged robot her name was mrs bhagwan and farrokh recognized her as the knife throwers assistant she was also his wife in the knifethrowing item mrs bhagwan was spreadeagled on a wooden wheel the wheel was painted as a target with mrs bhagwans belly covering the bullseye throughout the act the wheel revolved faster and faster and mr bhagwan hurled knives at his wife when the wheel was stopped the knives were stuck every which way in the wood not even the crudest pattern could be discerned except that there were no knives sticking in mrs bhagwans spreadeagled body mr bhagwans other specialty was the item called elephant passing which almost every circus in india performs mr bhagwan lies in the arena sandwiched between mattresses that are then covered with a plank an elephant walks this plank over mr bhagwans chest farrokh observed that this was the only act that didnt prompt ganesh to say he could learn it although being crippled wouldnt have interfered with the boys ability to lie under a passing elephant once when mr bhagwan had been stricken with acute diarrhea mrs bhagwan had replaced her husband in the elephant passing item but the woman was too thin for elephant passing there was a story that shed bled internally for days and that even after shed recovered she was never the same again both her diet and her disposition had been ruined by the elephant of mrs bhagwan farrokh understood that her version of the skywalk and her passive contribution to the knifethrowing act were one and the same it was less a skill she had learned or even a drama to be enacted than a mechanical submission to her fate her husbands errant knife or the fall from feetthey were one and the same mrs bhagwan was a robot dr daruwalla believed possibly the elephant passing had done this to her mr das confided this feeling to farrokh when the ringmaster briefly joined them in the audienceto apologize for gautams rude attack and to add his own ideas to the doctors and the jesuits speculations regarding the apes racism andor sexual jealousymr das attributed mrs bhagwans lackluster performance to her elephant episode but in other ways its better since shes been married mr das admitted before mrs bhagwans marriage shed complained bitterly about her menstrual cyclehow hanging upside down when she was bleeding was unusually uncomfortable and before she was married of course it wasnt proper for her to use a tampon mr das added no of course not said dr daruwalla who was appalled when there were lulls in the acts which there often wereor when the band was resting between itemsthey could hear the sounds of the chimp being beaten kunal was disciplining gautam mr das explained in some of the towns where the great blue nile played there might be other white males in the audience they couldnt allow gautam to think that white males were fair game no of course not said dr daruwalla the big apes screams and the sounds of kunals stick were carried to them in the still night air when the band played no matter how badly the doctor and the missionary and the children were grateful if gautam was rabid the ape would die better to beat him in case he wasnt rabid and he livedthis was kunals philosophy as for treating martin mills dr daruwalla knew it was wise to assume the chimp was rabid but for now the children were laughing when one of the lions pissed violently on its stool and then stamped in the puddle both madhu and ganesh laughed yet farrokh felt obliged to remind the elephant boy that washing this same stool might be his first job there was a peacock dance of coursetwo little girls played the peacocks as alwaysand the screenwriter thought that his pinky character should be in a peacock costume when the escaped lion kills her farrokh thought it would be best if the lion kills her because the lion thinks she is a peacock more poignant that way more sympathy for the lion thus would the screenwriter act out his old presentimentthat the restless lions in the holding tunnel were restless because their act was next and the peacock girls were temptingly in sight when acid man applied his acid to the locked cage the lion that got loose would be in an agitated antipeacock mood poor pinky there was an encore to the skywalk item mrs bhagwan didnt climb all the way to the top of the tent to repeat the skywalk which had left the audience largely unimpressed the first time she climbed to the top of the tent only to repeat her descent on the dental trapeze it was the dental trapeze that the audience had liked more specifically it was mrs bhagwans neck that they had liked she had an extremely muscular neck overdeveloped from all her dentaltrapezing and when she descendedtwirling from the top of the tent with the trapeze clamped tightly in her teethher neck muscles bulged the spotlight turning from green to gold i could do that ganesh whispered to dr daruwalla i have a strong neck and strong teeth he added and i suppose you could hang and walk upside down the doctor replied you have to hold both feet rigid at right anglesyour ankles support all your weight as soon as he spoke farrokh realized his error the cripples crushed foot was permanently fused at his anklea perfect right angle it would be no problem for him to keep that foot in a rigid rightangle position there was an idiotic finale in progress in the ringchimps and dwarf clowns riding mopeds the lead chimp was dressed as a gujarati milkman which the local crowd loved the elephantfooted boy was smiling serenely in the semidarkness so it would be only my good foot that i would have to make strongeris this what you are telling me the cripple asked what im telling you ganesh is that your job is with the lion piss and the elephant shit and maybe if youre lucky farrokh told the boy youll get to work with the food now the ponies and the elephants entered the ring as in the beginning and the band played loudly it was impossible to hear gautam being beaten not once had madhu said i could do thatnot about a single actbut here was the elephantfooted boy already imagining that he could learn to walk on the sky up there ganesh told dr daruwalla pointing to the top of the tent i wouldnt walk with a limp dont even think about it the doctor said but the screenwriter couldnt stop thinking about it for it would be the perfect ending to his movie after the lion kills pinkyand justice is done to acid man perhaps acid could accidentally be spilled in the villains crotchganesh knows that the circus wont keep him unless he can make a contribution no one believes he can be a skywalkersuman wont give the crippled boy lessons and pratap wont let him practice on the ladder in the troupe tent there is nowhere he can learn to skywalk except in the main tent if hes going to try it he must climb up to the real device and do the real thingat feet with no net what a great scene the screenwriter thought the boy slips out of the cooks tent in the predawn light theres no one in the main tent to see him climb the trapeze rope to the top if i fall death happens his voiceover says if no one sees you die no one says any prayers for you good line dr daruwalla thought he wondered if it was true the camera is feet below the boy when he hangs upside down from the ladder he holds the sides of the ladder with both hands as he puts his good foot and then his bad one into the first two loops there are loops of rope running the length of the ladder the skywalk requires steps there is a moment when you must let go with your hands ganeshs voiceover says i do not know whose hands i am in then the boy lets go of the ladder with both hands he hangs by his feet the trick is you have to start swinging your body its the momentum you gather from swinging that allows you to step forwardone foot at a time out of the first loop and into the next one still swinging never stop the momentum keep the forward motion constant i think there is a moment when you must decide where you belong the boys voiceover says now the camera approaches him from feet away the camera closes in on his feet at that moment you are in no ones hands the voiceover says at that moment everyone walks on the sky from another angle we see that the cook has discovered what ganesh is doing the cook stands very still looking uphes counting other performers have come into the tentpratap singh suman the dwarf clowns one of them still brushing his teeth they follow the crippled boy with their eyes theyre all countingthey all know how many steps there are in the skywalk let other people do the counting ganeshs voiceover says what i tell myself is i am just walkingi dont think skywalking i think just walking thats my little secret nobody else would be much impressed by the thought of just walking nobody else could concentrate very hard on that but for me the thought of just walking is very special what i tell myself is i am walking without a limp not bad dr daruwalla thought and there should be a scene later with the boy in full costumea singlet sewn with bluegreen sequins as he descends on the dental trapeze spinning in the spotlight the gleaming sequins throw back the light ganesh should never quite touch the ground instead he descends into prataps waiting arms pratap lifts the boy up to the cheering crowd then pratap runs out of the ring with ganesh in his armsbecause after a cripple has walked on the sky no one should see him limp it could work the screenwriter thought after the performance they managed to find where ramu had parked the land rover but they couldnt find ramu the four of them required two rickshaws for the trip across town to the government circuit house madhu and farrokh followed the rickshaw carrying ganesh and martin mills these were the threewheeled rickshaws that dr daruwalla hated old lowji had once declared that a threewheeled rickshaw made as much sense as a moped towing a lawn chair but madhu and ganesh were enjoying the ride as their rickshaw bounced along madhu tightly gripped farrokhs knee with one hand it was a childs gripnot sexual groping dr daruwalla assured himself with her other hand madhu waved to ganesh looking at her the doctor kept thinking maybe the girl will be all rightmaybe shell make it on the mud flaps of the rickshaw ahead of them farrokh saw the face of a movie star he thought it might be a poor likeness of either madhuri dixit or jaya pradain any case it wasnt inspector dhar in the cheap plastic window of the rickshaw there was ganeshs facethe real ganesh the screenwriter reminded himself it was such a perfect ending farrokh was thinkingall the more remarkable because the real cripple had given him the idea in the window of the bouncing rickshaw the boys dark eyes were shining the headlight from the following rickshaw kept crossing the cripples smiling face given the distance between the two rickshaws and the fact that it was night dr daruwalla observed that the boys eyes looked healthy you couldnt see the slight discharge or the cloudiness from the tetracycline ointment from such a partial view you couldnt tell that ganesh was crippled he looked like a happy normal boy how the doctor wished it were true the night of steps there was nothing to do about the missing piece of martins earlobe altogether dr daruwalla used two ml vials of the human rabies immune globulin he injected a halfvial directly into each of the three wound areasthe earlobe the neck the handand he administered the remaining halfvial by a deep intramuscular injection in martins buttocks the hand was the worsta slash wound which the doctor packed with iodophor gauze a bite should drain and heal from the inside so dr daruwalla wouldnt stitch the woundnor did the doctor offer anything for the pain dr daruwalla had observed that the missionary was enjoying his pain however the zealots limited sense of humor didnt permit him to appreciate dr daruwallas jokethat the jesuit appeared to suffer from chimpanzee stigmata the doctor also couldnt resist pointing out to martin mills that on the evidence of the scholastics wounds whatever had bitten farrokh and converted him in goa was certainly not a chimp such an ape would have consumed the whole toemaybe half the foot still angry about your miracle i see martin replied on that testy note the two men said their goodnights farrokh didnt envy the jesuit the task of calming ganesh down for the elephant boy was in no mood to sleep the cripple couldnt wait for his first full day at the circus to begin madhu on the other hand seemed bored and listless if not exactly sleepy their rooms at the government circuit house were adjacent to each other on the third floor off farrokh and madhus bedroom two glass doors opened onto a small balcony covered with bird droppings they had their own bathroom with a sink and a toilet but no door there was just a rug hung from a curtain rodit didnt quite touch the floor the toilet could be flushed only with a bucket which was conveniently positioned under a faucet that dripped there was also a shower of sorts an openended pipe without a showerhead poked out of the bathroom wall there was no curtain for the shower but there was a sloped floor leading to an open drain which upon closer inspection appeared to be the temporary residence of a rat farrokh saw its tail disappearing down the hole very close to the drain was a diminished bar of soap the edges nibbled in the bedroom the two beds were too close togetherand doubtless infested both mosquito nets were yellowed and stiff and one was torn the one window that opened had no screen and little air was inclined to move through it dr daruwalla thought they might as well open the glass doors to the balcony but madhu said she was afraid that a monkey would come inside the ceiling fan had only two speeds one was so slow that the fan had no effect at all and the other was so fast that the mosquito nets were blown away from the beds even in the main tent at the circus the night air had felt cool but the third floor of the government circuit house was hot and airless madhu solved this problem by using the bathroom first she wet a towel and wrung it out and then she lay naked under the towelon the better bed the one with the untorn mosquito net madhu was small but so was the towel it scarcely covered her breasts and left her thighs exposed a deliberate girl the doctor thought lying there she said im still hungry there was nothing sweet you want a dessert dr daruwalla asked if its sweet she said the doctor carried the thermos with the rest of the rabies vaccine and the immune globulin down to the lobby he hoped there was a refrigerator for the thermos was already tepid what if gautam bit someone else tomorrow kunal had informed the doctor that the chimpanzee was almost definitely rabid rabid or not the chimp shouldnt be beaten in the doctors opinion only a secondrate circus beat its animals in the lobby a muslim boy was tending the desk listening to the qawwali on the radio he appeared to be eating ice cream to the religious verseshis head nodding while he ate the spoon conducting the air between the container and his mouth but it wasnt ice cream the boy told dr daruwalla he offered the doctor a spoon and invited him to take a taste the texture differed from that of ice creama cardamomscented saffroncolored yogurt sweetened with sugar there was a refrigerator full of the stuff and farrokh took a container and spoon for madhu he left the vaccine and the immune globulin in the refrigerator after assuring himself that the boy knew better than to eat it when the doctor returned to his room madhu had discarded the towel he tried to give her the gujarati dessert without looking at her probably on purpose she made it awkward for him to hand her the spoon and containerhe was sure she was pretending that she didnt know where the mosquito net opened she sat naked in bed eating the sweetened yogurt and watching him while he arranged his writing materials there was an unsteady table a thick candle affixed by wax to a dirty ashtray a packet of matches alongside a mosquito coil when farrokh had spread out his pages and smoothed his hand over the pad of fresh paper he lit the candle and the mosquito coil and turned off the overhead light at high speed the ceiling fan would have disturbed his work and madhus mosquito net so the doctor kept the fan on low although this was ineffectual he hoped that the movement of the blade might make madhu sleepy what are you doing the child prostitute asked him writing he told her read it to me madhu asked him you wouldnt understand it farrokh replied are you going to be sleeping the girl asked maybe later said dr daruwalla he tried to block her out of his mind but this was difficult she kept watching him the sound of her spoon in the container of yogurt was as regular as the drone of the fan her purposeful nakedness was oppressive but not because he was actually tempted by her it was more that the pure evil of having sex with her the very idea of it was suddenly his obsession he didnt want to have sex with herhe felt only the most passing desire for herbut the sheer obviousness of her availability was numbing to his other senses it struck him that an evil this pure something so clearly wrong wasnt often presented without consequence the horror was that it seemed there could be no harmful result of sex between them if he permitted her to seduce him nothing would come of itnothing beyond what he would remember and feel guilty for forever the lucky girl was not hivpositive besides he happened to be traveling in india as usualwith condoms and madhu wasnt a girl who would ever tell anyone she wasnt a talker in her present situation she might never have the occasion to tell anyone it was not only the childs tarnished innocence that convinced him of the purity of this evil like almost no other evil hed ever imagined it was also her strident amoralitywhether this had been acquired in the brothel or hideously taught to her by mr garg whatever one did to her one wouldnt pay for itnot in this life or only in the torments of ones soul these were the darkest thoughts that dr daruwalla had ever had but he nevertheless thought his way through them soon he was writing again by the movement of his pen for shed never stopped watching him madhu seemed to sense that shed lost him also her dessert was gone she got out of the bed and walked naked to him she peered over his shoulder as if she knew how to read what he was writing the screenwriter could feel her hair against his cheek and neck read it to mejust that part madhu said she leaned more firmly against him as she reached and touched the paper with her hand she touched his last sentence the cardamomscented yogurt smelled sickly on her breath and there was something like the smell of dead flowerspossibly the saffron the screenwriter read aloud to her two stretcher bearers in white dhotis are running with the body of acid man who is curled in a fetal position on the stretcherhis face glazed in pain smoke still drifting from the area of his crotch madhu made him read it again then she said in what position fetal said dr daruwalla like a baby inside its mother who is acid man the child prostitute asked him a man whos been scarred by acidlike mr garg farrokh told her at the mention of gargs name there wasnt even a flicker of recognition in the girls face the doctor refused to look at her naked body although madhu still clung to his shoulder where she pressed against him he felt himself begin to sweat the smoke is coming from what area madhu asked from his crotch the screenwriter replied wheres that the child prostitute asked him you know where that is madhugo back to bed he told her she raised one arm to show him her armpit the hair is growing back she said you can feel it i can see that its growing backi dont need to feel it farrokh replied its growing back everywhere madhu said go back to bed the doctor told her he could tell from the change in her breathing he knew the moment when she finally fell asleep then he thought it was safe to lie down on the other bed although he was exhausted hed not yet fallen asleep when he felt the first of the fleas or the bedbugs they didnt seem to jump like fleas and they were invisible probably they were bedbugs evidently madhu was used to themshe hadnt noticed farrokh decided that he would rather try to sleep among the bird droppings on the balcony possibly it was cool enough outside so there wouldnt be any mosquitoes but when the doctor stepped out on his balcony there on the adjacent balcony was a wideawake martin mills there are a million things in my bed the missionary whispered in mine too farrokh replied i dont know how the boy manages to sleep through all the biting and crawling the scholastic said there are probably a million fewer things here than hes used to in bombay dr daruwalla said the night sky was yielding to the dawn soon the sky would be the same milkytea color as the ground against such graybrown tones the white of the missionarys new bandages was startlinghis mittened hand his wrapped neck his patched ear youre quite a sight the doctor told him you should see yourself the missionary replied have you slept at all since the children were sleeping so soundlyand theyd only recently fallen asleepthe two men decided to take a tour of the town after all mr das had warned them not to come to the circus too early or else theyd interrupt the television watching it being a sunday the doctor presumed that the televisions in all the troupe tents would be tuned to the mahabharata the popular hindu epic had been broadcast every sunday morning for more than a yearaltogether there were episodes each an hour long and the great journey to the gates of heaven where the epic ends wouldnt be over until the coming summer it was the worlds most successful soap opera depicting religion as heroic action it was a legend with countless homilies not to mention blindness and illegitimate births battles and womenstealing a record number of robberies had occurred during the broadcasts because the thieves knew that almost everyone in india would be glued to the tv the missionary would be consumed with christian envy dr daruwalla thought in the lobby the muslim boy was no longer eating to the qawwali on the radio the religious verses had put him to sleep there was no need to wake him in the driveway of the government circuit house a halfdozen threewheeled rickshaws were parked for the night their drivers all but one were asleep in the passenger seats the one driver who was awake was finishing his prayers when the doctor and the missionary hired his services through the sleeping town they rode in the rickshaw such peacefulness was improbable in bombay by the junagadh railroad station they saw a yellow shack where several early risers were renting bicycles they passed a coconut plantation they saw a sign to the zoo with a leopard on it they passed a mosque a hospital the hotel relief a vegetable market and an old fort they saw two temples two water tanks some mango groves and what dr daruwalla said was a baobab treemartin mills said it wasnt their driver took them to a teak forest this was the start of the climb up girnar hill the driver told them from this point on they would have to proceed on foot it was a meter ascent up stone steps it would take them about two hours their driver said why on earth does he think we want to climb ten thousand steps for two hours martin asked farrokh but when the doctor explained that the hill was sacred to the jains the jesuit wanted to climb it its just a bunch of temples dr daruwalla cried the place would probably be crawling with sadhus practicing yoga there would be unappetizing refreshment stalls and scavenging monkeys and the repugnant evidence of human feces along the way there would be eagles soaring overhead their rickshaw driver informed them there was no stopping the jesuit from his holy climb the doctor wondered if the arduous trek was a substitute for mass the climb took them barely an hour and a half largely because the scholastic walked so fast there were monkeys nearby and these doubtless made the missionary walk faster after his chimp experience martin was wary of aperelated animalseven small ones they saw only one eagle they passed several sadhus who were climbing up the holy hill as the doctor and the jesuit were walking down it was too early for most of the refreshment stalls to be open at one stall they split an orange soda between them the doctor had to agree that the marble temples near the summit were impressive especially the largest and the oldest which was a jain temple from the th century by the time they descended they were both panting and dr daruwalla remarked that his knees were killing him no religion was worth steps farrokh said the occasional encounters with human feces had depressed him and during the entire hike hed worried that their driver would abandon them and theyd be forced to walk back to town if farrokh had tipped the driver too much before their climb there would be no incentive for the driver to stay if farrokh had tipped him too little the driver would be too insulted to wait for them it will be a miracle if our driver hasnt absconded farrokh told martin but their driver was not only waiting for them as they came upon him they saw that the faithful man was cleaning his rickshaw you really should restrict your use of this word miracle the missionary said his neck bandage was beginning to unravel because the hike had made him sweat it was time to wake the children and take them to the circus it vexed farrokh that martin mills had waited until now to say the obvious the scholastic would say it only once dear god the jesuit said i hope were doing the right thing leaving the children not charlton heston for weeks after the unusual foursome had departed from the government circuit house in junagadh the rabies vaccine and the vial of immune globulin which dr daruwalla had forgotten remained in the lobby refrigerator one night the muslim boy who regularly ate the saffroncolored yogurt remembered that the unclaimed package was the doctors medicine everyone was afraid to touch it but someone mustered the courage and threw it out as for the one sock and the lone leftfooted sandal which the elephant boy had intentionally left behind these were donated to the town hospital although it was improbable that anyone there could use them at the circus ganesh knew neither the sock nor the sandal would be of any value to him they werent necessary for a cooks helper or for a skywalker the cripple was a barefoot boy when he limped into the ringmasters troupe tent on sunday morning it was still before and mr and mrs das and at least a dozen child acrobats were sitting crosslegged on the rugs watching the mahabharata on tv despite their hike up girnar hill the doctor and the missionary had brought the children to the circus too early no one greeted them which made madhu instantly awkward she bumped into a bigger girl who still paid no attention to her mrs das without taking her eyes from the television waved both her armsa confusing signal did she mean for them to go away or should they sit down the ringmaster cleared up the matter sitanywhere mr das commanded ganesh and madhu were immediately riveted to the tv the seriousness of the mahabharata was obvious to them even beggars knew the sundaymorning routine they often watched the program through storefront windows sometimes people without televisions assembled quietly outside the open windows of those apartments where the tv was on it didnt matter if they couldnt see the screenthey could still hear the battles and the singing child prostitutes too the doctor assumed were familiar with the famous show only martin mills was perplexed by the visible reverence in the troupe tent the zealot failed to recognize that everyones attention had been captured by a religious epic is this a popular musical the jesuit whispered to dr daruwalla its the mahabharatabe quiet farrokh told him the mahabharata is on television the missionary cried the whole thing it must be ten times as long as the bible ssshhh the doctor replied mrs das waved both her arms again there on the screen was lord krishna the dark onean avatar of vishnu the child acrobats gaped in awe ganesh and madhu were transfixed mrs das rocked back and forth she was quietly humming even the ringmaster hung on krishnas every word the sound of weeping was in the background of the scene apparently lord krishnas speech was emotionally stirring whos that guy martin whispered lord krishna whispered dr daruwalla there went both of mrs dass arms again but the scholastic was too excited to keep quiet just before the show was over the jesuit whispered once more in the doctors ear the zealot felt compelled to say that lord krishna reminded him of charlton heston but sunday morning at the circus was special for more reasons than the mahabharata it was the only morning in the week when the child acrobats didnt practice their acts or learn new items or even do their strength and flexibility exercises they did do their chores they would sweep and neaten their bed areas and they swept and cleaned the tiny kitchen in the troupe tent if there were sequins missing from their costumes they would get out the old tea tins that were filled with sequinsone color per tinand sew new sequins on their singlets mrs das wasnt unfriendly as she introduced madhu to these chores nor were the other girls in the troupe tent unwelcoming to madhu an older girl went through the costume trunks pulling out the singlets that she thought might fit the child prostitute madhu was interested in the costumes she was even eager to try them on mrs das confided to dr daruwalla that she was happy madhu wasnt from kerala kerala girls want too much said the ringmasters wife they expect good food all the time and coconut hair oil mr das spoke to dr daruwalla in hushed confidentiality kerala girls were reputed to be a hot lay a virtue negated by the fact that these girls would attempt to unionize everyone the circus was no place for a communistparty revolt the ringmaster concurred with his wifeit was a good thing madhu wasnt a kerala girl this was as close as mr and mrs das could come to sounding reassuringby expressing a common prejudice against people from somewhere else the child acrobats were not unkind to ganesh they simply ignored him martin mills in his bandages was more interesting to them theyd all heard about the chimp attackmany of them had seen it the elaborately bandaged wounds excited them although they were disappointed that dr daruwalla refused to unwrap the ear they wanted to see what was missing how much this much one of the acrobats asked the missionary actually martin replied i didnt see how much was missing this conversation deteriorated into speculation about whether or not gautam had swallowed the piece of earlobe dr daruwalla observed that none of the child acrobats appeared to notice how the missionary resembled inspector dhar although hindi films were a part of their world their interest was in the missing piece of martins earlobe and whether or not the ape had eaten it chimps arent meat eaters said an older boy if gautam swallowed it hed be sick this morning some of them those whod finished their chores went to see if gautam was sick they insisted that the missionary come with them dr daruwalla realized that he shouldnt linger it wouldnt do madhu any good ill say goodbye now the doctor told the child prostitute i hope that your new life is happy please be careful when she put her arms around his neck farrokh flinched he thought she was going to kiss him but he was mistaken all she wanted to do was whisper in his ear take me home madhu whispered but what was homewhat could she mean the doctor wondered before he could ask her she told him i want to be with acid man she whispered just that simply madhu had adopted dr daruwallas name for mr garg all the screenwriter could do was take her arms from his neck and give her a worried look then the older girl distracted madhu with a brightly sequined singletthe front was red the back orangeand farrokh was able to slip away chandra had built a bed for the elephant boy in a wing of the cooks tent ganesh would sleep surrounded by sacks of onions and ricea wall of tea tins was the makeshift headboard for his bed so that the boy wouldnt be homesick the cook had given him a maharashtrian calendar there was parvati with her elephantheaded son ganeshlord ganesha the lord of hosts the onetusked deity it was hard for farrokh to say goodbye he asked the cooks permission to take a walk with the elephantfooted boy they went to look at the lions and tigers but it was well before meatfeeding time the big cats were either asleep or cranky then the doctor and the cripple strolled in the avenue of troupe tents a dwarf clown was washing his hair in a bucket another was shaving farrokh was relieved that none of the clowns had tried to imitate ganeshs limp although vinod had warned the boy that this was sure to happen they paused at mr and mrs bhagwans tent in front was a display of the knife throwers knivesapparently it was knifesharpening day for mr bhagwanand in the doorway mrs bhagwan was unbraiding her long black hair which reached nearly to her waist when the skywalker saw the cripple she called him to her dr daruwalla followed shyly everyone who limps needs extra protection mrs bhagwan was telling the elephant boy therefore she wanted him to have a shirdi sai baba medallionsai baba she said was the patron saint of all people who were afraid of falling now he wont be afraid mrs bhagwan explained to dr daruwalla she tied the trinket around the boys neck it was a very thin piece of silver on a rawhide thong watching her the doctor could only marvel at how as an unmarried woman shed once suffered the skywalk while bleeding from her periodbefore it was proper for her to use a tampon now she mechanically submitted to the skywalk and to her husbands knives although mrs bhagwan wasnt pretty her hair was shiny and beautiful yet ganesh wasnt looking at her hairhe was staring into her tent along the roof was the practice model for the skywalk the ladderlike device complete with exactly loops not even mrs bhagwan could skywalk without practice also hanging from the roof of the troupe tent was a dental trapeze it was as shiny as mrs bhagwans hairthe doctor imagined that it might still be wet from her mouth mrs bhagwan saw where the boy was looking hes got this foolish idea that he wants to be a skywalker farrokh explained mrs bhagwan looked sternly at ganesh that is a foolish idea she said to the cripple she took hold of her gift the boys sai baba medallion and tugged it gently in her gnarled hand dr daruwalla realized that mrs bhagwans hands were as large and powerfullooking as a mans the doctor was unpleasantly reminded of his last glimpse of the second mrs dogars handshow theyd restlessly plucked at the tablecloth how theyd looked like paws not even shirdi sai baba can save a skywalker from falling mrs bhagwan told ganesh what saves you then the boy asked her the skywalker showed him her feet they were bare under the long skirt of her sari and they were oddly graceful even delicate in comparison to her hands but the tops of her feet and the fronts of her ankles were so roughly chafed that the normal skin was gone in its place was hardened scar tissue wrinkled and cracked feel them mrs bhagwan told the boy you too she said to the doctor who obeyed hed never touched the skin of an elephant or a rhino before hed only imagined their tough leathery hides the doctor couldnt help speculating that there must be an ointment or a lotion that mrs bhagwan could put on her poor feet to help heal the cracks in her hardened skin then it occurred to him that if the cracks were healed her skin would be too callused to allow her to feel the loops chafing against her feet if her cracked skin gave her pain the pain was also her guide to knowing that her feet were securely in the loopsthe right way without pain mrs bhagwan would have to rely on her sense of sight alone when it came to putting her feet in the loops two senses pain and sight were probably better than one ganesh didnt appear to be discouraged by the look and feel of mrs bhagwans feet his eyes were healingthey looked clearer every dayand in the cripples alert face there was that radiance which reflected his unchanged belief in the future he knew he could master the skywalk one foot was ready to begin it was merely a matter of bringing the other foot along jesus in the parking lot meanwhile the missionary had provoked mayhem in the area of the chimp cages gautam was infuriated to see himthe bandages being even whiter than the scholastics skin on the other hand the flirtatious mira reached her long arms through the bars of her cage as if she were beseeching martin for an embrace gautam responded by forcefully urinating in the missionarys direction martin believed he should remove himself from the chimpanzees view rather than stand there and encourage their apery but kunal wanted the missionary to stay it would be a valuable lesson to gautam kunal reasoned the more violently the ape reacted to the jesuits presence the more kunal beat the ape to martins mind the psychology of disciplining gautam in this fashion seemed flawed yet the jesuit obeyed the trainers instructions in gautams cage there was an old tire the tread was bald and the tire swung from a frayed rope in his anger gautam hurled the tire against the bars of his cage then he seized the tire and sank his teeth into the rubber kunal responded by reaching through the bars and jabbing gautam with a bamboo pole mira rolled onto her back when dr daruwalla finally found the missionary martin mills was standing helplessly before this apish drama looking as guilty and as compromised as a prisoner for gods sakewhy are you standing here the doctor asked him if you just walked away all this would stop thats what i think the jesuit replied but the trainer told me to stay is he your trainer or the chimps trainer farrokh asked martin thus the missionarys goodbyes to ganesh were conducted with the racist apes shrieks and howls in the background it was hard to imagine this as a learning experience for gautam the two men followed ramu to the land rover the last cages they passed were those of the sleepy disgruntled lions the tigers looked equally listless and out of humor the reckless driver ran his fingers along the bars of the big cats cages occasionally a paw claws extended flicked out but ramu confidently withdrew his hand in time one more hour until meatfeeding time ramu sang to the lions and tigers one whole hour it was unfortunate that such a note of mockery if not an underlying cruelty described their departure from the great blue nile dr daruwalla looked only once at the elephant boys retreating figure ganesh was limping back to the cooks tent in the cripples unsteady gait his right heel appeared to bear the weight of two or three boys like a dewclaw on a dog or a cat the ball of the boys right foot and his toes never touched the ground no wonder he wanted to walk on the sky as for farrokh and martin their lives were once again in ramus hands their drive to the airport in rajkot was in daylight both the highways carnage and the land rovers near misses could be clearly seen once again dr daruwalla sought to be distracted from ramus driving but the doctor found himself up front in the passenger seat this time and there was no seat belt martin clung to the back of the front seat his head over farrokhs shoulder which probably blocked whatever view ramu might have had in the rearview mirrornot that ramu would even glance at what might be coming up behind him or that anything could be fast enough to be coming up from behind because junagadh was the jumpingoff point for visits to the gir forest which was the last habitat of the asian lion ramu wanted to know if theyd seen the forestthey hadntand martin mills wanted to know what ramu had said this would be a long trip the doctor imaginedramu speaking marathi and hindi farrokh struggling to translate the missionary was sorry that they hadnt seen the gir lions maybe when they returned to visit the children they could see the forest by then the doctor suspected the great blue nile would be playing in another town there were a few asian lions in the town zoo ramu told them they could have a quick look at the lions and still manage to catch their plane in rajkot but farrokh wisely vetoed this idea he knew that any delay in their departure from junagadh would make ramu drive to rajkot all the faster nor was a discussion of graham greene as distracting as farrokh had hoped the jesuits catholic interpretation of the heart of the matter wasnt at all what the doctor was looking for it was infuriating not even a novel as profoundly about faith as the power and the glory could or should be discussed in strictly catholic terms dr daruwalla argued the doctor quoted from memory that passage which he loved there is always one moment in childhood when the door opens and lets the future in perhaps youll tell me what is especially catholic about that the doctor challenged the scholastic but martin skillfully changed the subject let us pray that this door opens and lets the future in for our children at the circus the jesuit said what a sneaky mind he had farrokh didnt dare ask him anything more about his mother not even ramus driving was as daunting as the possibility of another story about vera what farrokh desired to hear was more about the homosexual inclinations of dhars twin the doctor was chiefly curious to learn whether or not john d was so inclined but dr daruwalla felt uncertain of how to inspire such a subject of conversation with john ds twin however it would be an easier subject to broach with martin than with john d you say you were in love with a man and that your feelings for him finally lessened the doctor began thats correct the scholastic said stiffly but can you point to any moment or to any single episode that marked the end of your infatuation farrokh asked did anything happenwas there an incident that convinced you what made you decide you could resist such an attraction and become a priest this was beating around the bush dr daruwalla knew but the doctor had to begin somewhere i saw how christ existed for me i saw that jesus had never abandoned me the zealot said do you mean you had a vision farrokh asked in a way the jesuit said mysteriously i was at a low point in my relationship with jesus and id reached a very cynical decision there is no lack of resistance that is as great a givingup as fatalismim ashamed to say i was totally fatalistic did you actually see christ or didnt you the doctor asked him actually it was only a statue of christ the missionary admitted you mean it was real farrokh asked of course it was realit was at the end of a parking lot at the school where i taught i used to see it every daytwice a day in fact martin said it was just a white stone statue of christ in a typical pose and there in the back seat of the speeding land rover the zealot rotated both his palms toward heaven apparently to demonstrate the pose of the supplicant it sounds truly tastelesschrist in a parking lot dr daruwalla remarked it wasnt very artistic the jesuit replied occasionally as i recall the statue was vandalized i cant imagine why farrokh muttered well anyway i had stayed at the school quite late one nighti was directing a school play another musical i cant remember which one and this man whod been such an obsession for me he was also staying late but his car wouldnt starthe had an awful carand he asked me for a ride home uhoh said dr daruwalla my feelings for him had already lessened as ive said but i was still not immune to his attractiveness the missionary admitted here was such a sudden opportunitythe availability of him was painfully apparent do you know what i mean dr daruwalla who was remembering his disturbing night with madhu said yesof course i know what happened this is what i mean by how cynical i was the scholastic said i was so totally fatalistic i decided that if he made the slightest advance toward me i would respond i wouldnt initiate such an advance but i knew i would respond and did you did he the doctor asked then i couldnt find my carit was a huge parking lot martin said but i remembered that i always tried to park near christ the statue you mean farrokh interrupted yes the statue of coursei had parked right in front of it the jesuit explained when i finally found my car it was so dark i couldnt see the statue not even when i was sitting inside my car but i knew exactly where christ was it was a funny moment i was waiting for this man to touch me but all the while i was looking into the darkness at that exact spot where jesus was did the guy touch you farrokh asked i turned on the headlights before he had a chance martin mills replied and there was christhe stood out very brightly in the headlights he was exactly where i knew he would be where else would a statue be dr daruwalla cried do statues move around in your country you belittle the experience to focus on the statue the jesuit said the statue was just the vehicle what i felt was the presence of god i felt a oneness with jesus toonot with the statue i felt id been shown what believing in christ was likefor me even in the darknesseven as i sat expecting something horrible to happen to methere was a certainty that he was there christ was there for me hed not abandoned me i could still see him i guess im not making the necessary leap said dr daruwalla i mean your belief in christ is one thing but wanting to be a priest how did you get from jesus in the parking lot to wanting to be a priest well thats different martin confessed thats the part i dont get farrokh replied then he said it and was that the end of all such desires i mean was your homosexuality ever again engaged so to speak homosexuality said the jesuit thats not the point im not a homosexual nor am i a heterosexual i am simply not a sexual entitynot anymore come on the doctor said if you were to be sexually attracted it would be a homosexual attraction wouldnt it thats not a relevant question the scholastic replied it isnt that im without sexual feelings but i have resisted sexual attraction i will have no problem continuing to resist it but what youre resisting is a homosexual inclination isnt it farrokh asked i mean let us speculateyou can speculate cant you i dont speculate on the subject of my vows the jesuit said but please indulge me if something happenedif for any reason you decided not to be a priestthen wouldnt you be a homosexual dr daruwalla asked mercy you are the most stubborn person martin mills cried out goodnaturedly i am stubborn the doctor shouted i am neither a homosexual nor a heterosexual the jesuit calmly stated the terms dont necessarily apply to inclinations or do they i had a passing inclination it has passed completely is that what youre saying dr daruwalla asked mercy martin repeated you become a person of no identifiable sexuality on the basis of an encounter with a statue in a parking lot yet you deny the possibility that i was bitten by a ghost dr daruwalla cried am i following your reasoning correctly i dont believe in ghosts per se the jesuit replied but you believe you experienced a oneness with jesus you felt the presence of godin a parking lot farrokh shouted i believe that our conversationthat is if you continue to raise your voiceis a distraction to our driver said martin mills perhaps we should resume discussion of this subject after weve safely arrived at the airport they were still nearly an hour from rajkot with ramu dodging death every few miles then there would be the wait at the airport not to mention a likely delay and finally the flight itself on a sunday afternoon or evening the taxi from santa cruz into bombay could take another minutes or an hour worse it was a special sunday it was december but neither the doctor nor the missionary knew it was new years eveor if they knew theyd forgotten at st ignatius the jubilee celebration was planned for new years day which martin mills had also forgotten and the new years eve party at the duckworth sports club was a blacktie occasion of uncharacteristic merriment there would be dancing to a live band and a splendid midnight suppernot to mention the unusual onceayear quality of the champagne no duckworthian in bombay would willingly miss the new years eve party john d and deputy commissioner patel were sure that rahul would be theremr sethna had already informed them theyd spent much of the day rehearsing what inspector dhar would say when he and the second mrs dogar danced julia had pressed farrokhs tuxedo which needed a lengthy airing on the balcony to rid it of its mothball aroma but both new years eve and the duckworth club were far from farrokhs mind the doctor was focused on what remained of his journey to rajkot after which he still had to travel to bombay if farrokh couldnt endure another minute of martins arguments he had to initiate a different conversation perhaps we should change the subject dr daruwalla suggested and keep our voices down as you wish i promise to keep mine down the missionary said with satisfaction farrokh was at a loss to know what to talk about he tried to think of a long personal story something which would allow him to talk and talk and which would render the missionary speechlesspowerless to interrupt the doctor could begin i know your twin that would lead to quite a long personal story that would shut martin mills up but as before farrokh felt it wasnt his place to tell this story that was john ds decision well i can think of something to say the scholastic said hed been politely waiting for dr daruwalla to begin but he hadnt waited long very wellgo ahead the doctor replied i think that you shouldnt go witchhunting for homosexuals the jesuit began not these days not when there is understandable sensitivity toward anything remotely homophobic what do you have against homosexuals anyway i have nothing against homosexuals im not homophobic dr daruwalla snapped and you havent exactly changed the subject youre not exactly keeping your voice down martin said little india at the airport in rajkot the loudspeaker system had progressed to a new test more advanced counting skills were being demonstrated eleven twentytwo thirtythree fortyfour fiftyfive said the tireless voice there was no telling where this would lead it hinted at infinity the voice was without emotion the counting was so mechanical that dr daruwalla thought he might go mad instead of listening to the numbers or enduring the jesuitical provocations of martin mills farrokh chose to tell a story although it was a true storyand as the doctor would soon discover painful to tellit suffered from the disadvantage that the storyteller had never told it before even true stories are improved by revision but the doctor hoped that his tale would illustrate how the missionarys allegations of homophobia were false for dr daruwallas favorite colleague in toronto was a homosexual gordon macfarlane was also farrokhs best friend unfortunately the screenwriter began the story in the wrong place dr daruwalla should have started with his earliest acquaintance of dr macfarlane including how the two had concurred on the misuse of the word gay that theyd generally agreed with the findings of macs boyfriend the gay geneticistregarding the biology of homosexualitywas also interesting had dr daruwalla started with a discussion of this subject he might not have prejudiced martin mills against him but at the airport in rajkot hed made the mistake of inserting dr macfarlane in the form of a flashbackas if mac were only a minor character and not a friend who was often foremost on farrokhs mind hed begun with the wrong story about the time hed been abducted by a crazed cab driver for farrokhs training as a writer of action films had preconditioned him to begin any story with the most violent action he could imagine or in this case remember but to begin with an episode of racial abuse was misleading to the missionary who concluded that farrokhs friendship with gordon macfarlane was secondary to the doctors outrage at his own mistreatment as an indian in toronto this was inept storytelling for farrokh had meant only to convey how his mistreatment as an obvious immigrant of color in canada had further solidified his friendship with a homosexual who was no stranger to discrimination of another kind it was a friday in the spring many of farrokhs colleagues left their offices early on friday afternoons because they were cottagers but the daruwallas enjoyed their weekends in torontotheir second home was in bombay farrokh had had a cancellation hence he was free to leave earlyotherwise he would have asked macfarlane for a ride home or called a cab mac also spent his weekends in toronto and kept late office hours on friday since it wasnt yet rush hour farrokh thought hed walk for a while and then hail a taxi from the street probably in front of the museum for some years hed avoided the subway an uncomfortable racial incident had happened there oh thered been shouts from the occasional passing carno one had ever called him a parsi in toronto few people knew what a parsi was what they called out was paki bastard or wog or babu or go home his palebrown coloring and jetblack hair made it difficult for them he wasnt as identifiable as many indians sometimes they called him an arabtwice hed been called a jew it was his persian ancestry he could pass for a middle easterner but whoever the shouters were they knew he was foreignracially different once hed even been called a wop at the time hed wondered what sort of idiot could mistake him for an italian now he knew that it wasnt what he was that bothered the shouters it was only that he wasnt one of them but most often the theme of the slurs subscribed to that view of him which can only clumsily be expressed as an immigrant of color in canada it seemed the prejudice against the immigrant composition of his features was as strong as whatever prejudice existed of the ofcolor kind he stopped taking the subway after an episode with three teenage boys at first they hadnt seemed so threateningmore mischievous there was a hint of menace only because they sat so deliberately close to him there were many other places for them to sit one sat on either side of him the third across the aisle the boy to the doctors left nudged his arm weve got a bet going the boy said what are you dr daruwalla realized later that the only reason hed found them unthreatening was that they wore their school blazers and ties after the incident he could have called their school he never did i said what are you the boy repeated that was the first moment farrokh felt threatened im a doctor dr daruwalla replied the boys on either side of him looked decidedly hostile it was the boy across the aisle who saved him my dads a doctor the boy stupidly remarked are you going to be a doctor too farrokh asked him the other two got up they pulled the third boy along with them fuck you the first boy said to farrokh but the doctor knew this was a harmless bombalready defused he never took the subway again but after his worst episode the subway incident seemed mild after his worst episode farrokh was so upset he couldnt remember whether the taxi driver had pulled over before or after the intersection of university and gerrard either way hed just left the hospital and he was daydreaming what was odd he remembered was that the driver already had a passenger and that the passenger was riding in the front seat the driver said dont mind him hes just a friend with nothing to do im not a fare the drivers friend said later farrokh remembered only that it wasnt one of metros taxis or one of becksthe two companies he most often called it was probably what they call a gypsy cab i said where are you going the driver asked dr daruwalla home farrokh replied it struck him as pointless to add that hed intended to walk for a while here was a taxi why not take it wheres home the friend in the front seat asked russell hill road north of st clairjust north of lonsdale the doctor answered hed stopped walkingthe taxi had stopped too actually i was going to stop at the beer storeand then go home farrokh added get in if you want the driver said dr daruwalla didnt feel anxious until he was settled in the back seat and the taxi began to move the friend in the front seat belched once sharply and the driver laughed the windshield visor in front of the drivers friend was pushed flat against the windshield and the glovecompartment door was missing farrokh couldnt remember if these were the places where the drivers certification was postedor was it usually on the plexiglas divider between the front and back seats the plexiglas divider itself was unusual in toronto most taxis didnt have these dividers anyway there was no visible drivers certification inside the cab and the taxi was already moving too fast for dr daruwalla to get outmaybe at a red light the doctor thought but there were no red lights for a while and the taxi ran the first red light it came to that was when the drivers friend in the front seat turned around and faced farrokh so wheres your real home the friend asked russell hill road dr daruwalla repeated before that asshole the driver said i was born in bombay but i left india when i was a teenager im a canadian citizen farrokh said didnt i tell you the driver said to his friend lets take him home the friend said the driver glanced in the rearview mirror and made a sudden uturn farrokh was thrown against the door well show you where your home is babu the driver said at no time could dr daruwalla have escaped when they crawled slowly ahead in the traffic or when they were stopped at a red light the doctor was too afraid to attempt it they were moving fairly fast when the driver slammed on the brakes the doctors head bounced off the plexiglas shield dr daruwalla was pressed back into the seat when the driver accelerated farrokh felt the tightness of the instant swelling by the time he gently touched his puffy eyebrow blood was already running into his eye four stitches maybe six the doctors fingers told him the area of little india is not extensive it stretches along gerrard from coxwell to hiawathasome would say as far as woodfield everyone would agree that by the time you get to greenwood little india is over and even in little india the chinese community is interspersed the taxi stopped in front of the ahmad grocers on gerrard at coxwell it was probably no coincidence that the grocer was diagonally across the street from the offices of the canadian ethnic immigration servicesthis was where the drivers friend dragged farrokh out of the back seat youre home nowbetter stay here the friend told dr daruwalla better yet babugo back to bombay the driver added as the taxi pulled away the doctor could see it clearly out of only one eye he was so relieved to be free of the thugs that he paid scant attention to the identifying marks of the car it was redmaybe red and white if farrokh saw any printed names or numbers he wouldnt remember them little india appeared to be mostly closed on friday apparently no one had seen the doctor roughly pulled out of the taxi no one approached him although he was dazed and bleedingclearly disoriented a small potbellied man in a dark suithis white shirt was ruined from the blood that flowed from his split eyebrowhe clutched his doctors bag in one hand he began to walk on the sidewalk dancing in the spring air kaftans were hanging on a clothes rack later farrokh struggled to remember the names of the places pindi embroidery nirma fashions there was another grocery with fresh fruits and vegetablesmaybe the singh farm at the united church there was a sign saying that the church also served as the shri ram hindu temple on sunday evenings at the corner of craven and gerrard a restaurant claimed to be indian cuisine specialists there was also the familiar advertisement for kingfisher lagerinstilled with inner strength a poster promising an asia superstars nite displayed the usual faces dimple kapadia sunny deol jaya pradawith music by bappi lahiri dr daruwalla never came to little india in the storefront windows the mannequins in their saris seemed to rebuke him farrokh saw few indians in toronto he had no close indian friends there parsi parents would bring him their sick childrenon the evidence of his name in the telephone directory dr daruwalla supposed among the mannequins a blonde in her sari struck farrokh as sharing his own disorientation at raja jewellers someone was staring out the window at him probably noticing that the doctor was bleeding there was a south indian pure vegetarian restaurant near ashdale and gerrard at the chaat hut they advertised all kinds of kulfi faluda and paan at the bombay bhel the sign said for true authentic gol guppa aloo tikki etc they served thunderbolt beer super strong lager the spirit of excitement more saris were in a window at hiawatha and gerrard and at the shree groceries a pile of ginger root overflowed the store extending onto the sidewalk the doctor gazed at the india theater at the silk den at j s addison plumbing at the corner of woodfield and gerrard farrokh saw a fabulous copper bathtub with ornate faucets the handles were tiger heads the tigers roaringit was like the tub hed bathed in as a boy on old ridge road malabar hill dr daruwalla began to cry staring at the display of copper sinks and drains and other bathroom victoriana he was suddenly aware of a mans concerned face staring back at him the man came out on the sidewalk youve been hurtmay i help you the man asked he wasnt an indian im a doctor said dr daruwalla please just call me a taxii know where to go he had the taxi take him back to the hospital for sick children you sure you want sick kids mon the driver asked he was a west indian a black manvery black you dont look like a sick kid to me im a doctor farrokh said i work there who done that to you mon the driver asked two guys who dont like people like meor like you the doctor told him i know themthey everywhere mon the driver said dr daruwalla was relieved that his secretary and his nurse had gone home he kept a change of clothes in his office after he was stitched up he would throw the shirt away hed ask his secretary to have the suit drycleaned he examined the split wound on his eyebrow using the mirror he shaved around the gash this was easy but he was used to shaving in a mirror then he contemplated the procaine injection and the suturesto do these properly in the mirror was baffling to him especially the sewing farrokh called dr macfarlanes office and asked the secretary to have mac stop by when he was ready to go home farrokh first tried to tell macfarlane that hed hit his head in a taxi because of a reckless driver the brakes throwing him forward into the plexiglas divider although it was the truth or only a lie of omission his voice trailed off his fear the insult his angerthese things were still reflected in his eyes who did this to you farrokh mac asked dr daruwalla told dr macfarlane the whole storybeginning with the three teenagers on the subway and including the shouts from the passing cars by the time mac had stitched him upit required five sutures to close the woundfarrokh had used the expression an immigrant of color more times than hed ever uttered it aloud before even to julia he would never tell julia about little india either that mac knew was comfort enough dr macfarlane had his own stories hed never been beaten up but hed been threatened and intimidated there were phone calls late at night hed changed his number three times there were also phone calls to his office two of his former secretaries had resigned and one of his former nurses sometimes letters or notes were shoved under his office door perhaps these were from the parents of former patients or from his fellow doctors or from other people who worked at sick kids mac helped farrokh rehearse how he would describe his accident to julia it sounded more plausible if it wasnt the taxi drivers fault they decided that an idiot woman had pulled out from the curb without looking the driver had had no choice but to hit the brakes a blameless woman driver had been blamed again as soon as he realized he was cut and bleeding farrokh had asked the driver to take him back to the hospital fortunately macfarlane was still there and had stitched him up just five sutures his white shirt was a total loss and he wouldnt know about the suit until it came back from the cleaners why not just tell julia what happened mac asked shell be disappointed in mebecause i didnt do anything farrokh told him i doubt that macfarlane said im disappointed that i didnt do anything dr daruwalla admitted that cant be helped mac said on the way home to russell hill road farrokh asked mac about his work at the aids hospicethere was a good one in toronto im just a volunteer macfarlane explained but youre a doctor dr daruwalla said i mean it must be interesting there but exactly what can an orthopedist do nothing mac said im not a doctor there but of course youre a doctoryoure a doctor anywhere farrokh cried there must be patients with bedsores we know what to do with bedsores and what about pain control dr daruwalla was thinking of morphine a wonderful drug it disconnects the lungs from the brain wouldnt many of the deaths in an aids hospice be respiratory deaths wouldnt morphine be especially useful there the respiratory distress is unchanged but the patient is unaware of it and what about muscular wasting from being bedridden farrokh added surely you could instruct families in passive rangeofmotion exercises or dispense tennis balls for the patients to squeeze dr macfarlane laughed the hospice has its own doctors theyre aids doctors macfarlane said im absolutely not a doctor there thats something i like about itim just a volunteer what about the catheters farrokh asked they must get blocked the skin tunnels get inflamed his voice fell away he was wondering if you could unplug them by flushing them with an anticoagulant but macfarlane wouldnt let him finish the thought i dont do anything medical there mac told him then what do you do dr daruwalla asked one night i did all the laundry macfarlane replied another night i answered the phone but anyone could do that farrokh cried yesany volunteer mac agreed listen theres a seizure a patient seizes from uncontrolled infection dr daruwalla began what do you do do you give intravenous valium i call the doctor dr macfarlane said youre kidding me said dr daruwalla and what about the feeding tubes they slip out then what do you have your own x ray facilities or do you have to take them to a hospital i call the doctor macfarlane repeated its a hospicetheyre not there to get well one night i read aloud to someone who couldnt sleep lately ive been writing letters for a man who wants to contact his family and his friendshe wants to say goodbye but he never learned how to write incredible dr daruwalla said they come there to die farrokh we try to help them control it we cant help them like were used to helping most of our patients macfarlane explained so you just go there you show up farrokh began you check in tell someone youve arrived then what usually a nurse tells me what to do mac said a nurse tells the doctor what to do cried dr daruwalla now youre getting it dr macfarlane told him there was his home on russell hill road it was a long way from bombay it was a long way from little india too honestly if you want to know what i think said martin mills whod interrupted farrokhs story only a halfdozen times i think you must drive your poor friend macfarlane crazy obviously you like him but on whose terms on your termson your heterosexual doctor terms but thats what i am dr daruwalla shouted im a heterosexual doctor several people in the rajkot airport looked mildly surprised three thousand eight hundred and ninetyfour the voice on the loudspeaker said the point is could you empathize with a raving gay man the missionary asked not a doctor and someone not even in the least sympathetic to your problemssomeone who couldnt care less about racism or what happens to immigrants of color as you say you think youre not homophobic but how much could you care about someone like that why should i care about someone like that farrokh screamed thats my point about you do you see what i mean the missionary asked youre a typical homophobe three thousand nine hundred and fortynine the voice on the loudspeaker droned you cant even listen to a story dr daruwalla told the jesuit mercy said martin mills they were delayed in boarding the plane because the authorities again confiscated the scholastics dangerous swiss army knife couldnt you have remembered to pack the damn knife in your bag dr daruwalla asked the scholastic given the mood youre in id be foolish to answer questions of that kind martin replied when they were finally on board the aircraft martin said look were both worried about the childreni know that but weve done the best we can for them short of adopting them dr daruwalla remarked well we werent in a position to do that were we the jesuit asked my point is weve put them in a position where at least they can help themselves dont make me throw up farrokh said theyre safer in the circus than where they were the zealot insisted in how many weeks or months would the boy have been blind how long would it have taken the girl to contract some horrible diseaseeven the worst not to mention what she would have endured before that of course youre worried so am i but theres nothing more we can do is this fatalism i hear farrokh asked mercy no the missionary replied those children are in gods handsthats what i mean i guess thats why im worried dr daruwalla replied you werent bitten by a monkey martin mills shouted i told you i wasnt farrokh said you must have been bitten by a snakea poisonous snake the missionary said or else the devil himself bit you after almost two hours of silencetheir plane had landed and vinods taxi was navigating the sunday traffic from santa cruz to bombaymartin mills thought of something to add furthermore the jesuit said i get the feeling youre keeping something from me its as if youre always stopping yourselfyoure always biting your tongue im not telling you half the doctor almost hollered but farrokh bit his tongue again in the slanting light of the late afternoon the lurid movie posters displayed the confident image of martin millss twin many of the posters for inspector dhar and the towers of silence were already defaced yet through the tatters and the muck flung from the street dhars sneer seemed to be assessing them in reality john d had been rehearsing a different role for the seduction of the second mrs dogar was out of inspector dhars genre rahul wasnt the usual cinema bimbo if dr daruwalla had known whod bitten him in his hammock at the hotel bardez the doctor would have agreed with martin mills for farrokh truly had been bitten by the devil himself by the devil herself the second mrs dogar would prefer as the dwarfs taxi came into bombay it was momentarily stalled near an iranian restaurantof a kind not quite in a class with lucky new moon or light of asia dr daruwalla was thinking the doctor was hungry towering over the restaurant was a nearly destroyed inspector dhar poster the movie star was ripped open from his cheek to his waist but his sneer was undamaged beside the mutilated dhar was a poster of lord ganesha the elephantheaded deity might have been advertising an upcoming religious festival but the traffic began to move before farrokh could translate the announcement the god was short and fat but surpassingly beautiful to his believers lord ganeshas elephant face was as red as a china rose and he sported the lotus smile of a perpetual daydreamer his four human arms swarmed with beesdoubtless attracted by the perfume of the ichor flowing in his godly veinsand his three allseeing eyes looked down upon bombay with a benevolence that challenged dhars sneer lord ganeshas potbelly hung almost to his human feet his toenails were as long and brightly painted as a womans in the sharply angled light his one unbroken tusk gleamed that elephant is everywhere exclaimed the jesuit what happened to its other tusk the myth that farrokh had loved best as a child was that lord ganesha broke off his own tusk and threw it at the moon the moon had mocked the elephantheaded god for his portliness and for being clumsy old lowji had liked this story hed told it to farrokh and jamshed when they were small boys only now did dr daruwalla wonder if this was a real myth or if it was only lowjis myth the old man wasnt above making up a myth of his own there were other myths there was more than one story about ganeshs birth too in a south indian version parvati saw the sacred syllable om and her mere glance transformed it into two coupling elephants who gave birth to lord ganesha and then resumed the form of the sacred syllable but in a darker version which attests to the reputed sexual antagonism between parvati and her husband lord shiva a considerable jealousy attended shivas feelings for parvatis son whonot unlike the baby jesuswas never described as being born from parvati in the natural manner in the darker myth it was shivas evil eye that beheaded the newborn ganesh who wasnt born with an elephants head the only way the child could live was if someone elses headsomeone facing northwas found and attached to the headless boy what was found after a great battle was an unfortunate elephant and in the violent course of the elephants beheading one tusk was broken but because hed first heard it as a boy farrokh preferred the myth of the moon excuse medid you hear me martin asked the doctor i was inquiring what happened to that elephants other tusk he broke it himself dr daruwalla replied he got pissed off and threw it at the moon in the rearview mirror the dwarf gave the doctor the evil eye a good hindu vinod wasnt amused by dr daruwallas blasphemy surely lord ganesha was never pissed off which was strictly a mortal weakness the missionarys sigh was intended to convey his longsuffering patience with whatever vexatious mood the doctor was in there you go again the jesuit said still keeping something from me the devil herself getting ready for rahul although deputy commissioner patel had insulted mr sethna the disapproving steward relished his new role as a police informant for selfimportance was mr sethnas middle name also the deputy commissioners stated objective of entrapping the second mrs dogar greatly pleased the old parsi nonetheless mr sethna faulted detective patel for not trusting him more completely it irritated the steward that he was given his instructions without being informed of the overall plan but the extent of the intrigue against rahul was contingent on how rahul responded to john ds sexual overtures in rehearsing inspector dhars seduction of mrs dogar both the real policeman and the actor were forced to consider more than one outcome that was why theyd been waiting for farrokh to come back from the circus not only did they want the screenwriter to provide dhar with some dialoguedhar also needed to know some alternative conversation in case his first advances were rebuffed this was vastly more demanding dialogue than dr daruwalla was accustomed to writing for it was not just that he was required to anticipate the various responses that rahul might make the screenwriter also needed to guess what mrs dogar might likethat is sexually would she be more attracted to john d if he was gentlemanly or if he was crude for flirtation did she favor the discreet approach or the explicit a screenwriter could only suggest certain directions in which the dialogue might roam dhar could charm her tease her tempt her shock her but the particular approach that the actor chose would necessarily be a spontaneous decision john d had to rely on his instincts for what would work after dr daruwallas most revealing conversations with dhars twin the doctor could only wonder what john ds instincts were farrokh wasnt prepared to find detective patel and inspector dhar waiting for him in his marine drive apartment to begin with dr daruwalla wondered why they were so well dressed he still didnt realize it was new years evenot until he saw what julia was wearing then it puzzled him why everyone had dressed for new years eve so early no one ever showed up for the party at the duckworth club before or but no one had wanted to waste time dressing when they could be rehearsing and they couldnt properly rehearse dhars options for dialogue until after the screenwriter was home from the circus and had written the lines farrokh felt flatteredhaving first suffered the keenest disappointment for being left out of the processbut he was also overwhelmed hed been writing for the last three nights and he feared he might be writtenout and he hated new years eve the night seemed to prey on his natural inclination toward nostalgia especially at the duckworth club although julia did enjoy the dancing dr daruwalla expressed his regret that there wasnt time to tell them what had happened at the circus interesting things had transpired there that was when john d said something insensitive by stating that preparing himself for the seduction of the second mrs dogar was no circus those were the disparaging words he usedmeaning that the doctor should save his silly circus stories for another more frivolous time detective patel came to the point even more bluntly the top half of the silver ballpoint pen had not only revealed rahuls fingerprints a speck of dried blood had been removed from the pocket claspit was human blood of mr lals type may i remind you doctor said the deputy commissioner it is still necessary to determine what rahul would have been doing with the top half of the pen during the murder of mr lal its also necessary for mrs dogar to admit that the top half of the pen is hers john d interrupted yes thank you patel said but the top half of the pen isnt incriminating evidenceat least not by itself what we really need to establish is that no one else could have made those drawings im told that drawings like those are as identifiable as a signature but its necessary to induce mrs dogar to draw if there was a way for me to suggest to her that she should show me what it might be like between us dhar told the screenwriter maybe i could ask her to give me just a hint of what she preferredi mean sexually or i could ask her to tease me with somethingi mean something sexually explicit the actor said yes yesi get the picture dr daruwalla said impatiently and then there are the tworupee notes the real policeman said if rahul is thinking of killing anyone else perhaps there exist some notes with the appropriate warnings or messages already typed on the money surely that would be incriminating evidence as you call it farrokh said i would prefer all threea connection to the top half of the pen a drawing and something typed on the money patel replied that would be evidence enough how fast do you want to go farrokh asked in a seduction theres usually the setting upsome kind of mutual sexual spark is ignited then theres the assignationor at least a discussion of the trysting place if not the actual tryst it was of small comfort to the screenwriter when inspector dhar said ambiguously i think id prefer to avoid the actual tryst if its possibleif things dont have to go that far you think you dont know dr daruwalla cried the point is i need dialogue to cover every contingency the actor said precisely said detective patel the deputy commissioner showed me the photographs of those drawings john d said his voice dropped away there must also be private drawingsthings she keeps secret again farrokh was reminded of the boy whod cried out theyre drowning the elephants now the elephants will be angry julia went to help nancy finish dressing nancy had brought a suitcase of her clothes to the daruwallas for she couldnt make up her mind about what to wear to the new years eve partynot without julias help the two women decided on something surprisingly demure it was a gray sleeveless sheath with a mandarin collar with which nancy wore a simple string of pearls dr daruwalla recognized the necklace because it was julias when the doctor retired to his bedroom and his bath he brought a clipboard and a pad of lined paper with him he also brought a bottle of beer he was so tired the hot bath and the cold beer made him instantly sleepy but even with his eyes closed he was seeing the possible options for dialogue between john d and the second mrs dogaror was he writing for rahul and inspector dhar that was a part of the problem the screenwriter felt he didnt know the characters he was writing dialogue for julia told farrokh how nancy had become so agitatedtrying to decide what to wearthat the poor woman had worked herself into a sweat shed had to take a bath in the daruwallas tub a concept that caused the screenwriters mind to wander there was a lingering scent in the bathroomprobably not a perfume or a bath oil but something unfamiliar not juliasand the strangeness of it mingled with the doctors memory of that time in goa the foremost issue to resolve in order to initiate the opening line of inspector dhars dialogue was whether or not to have john d know that mrs dogar was rahul shouldnt he tell her that he knew who she wasthat he knew her former selfand shouldnt this be the first phase of the seduction i always wanted youthat kind of thing the decision to have nancy dress so demurelyshe even wore her hair pulled up off her neckhad sprung from nancys desire not to be recognized by rahul although the deputy commissioner had repeatedly told his wife that he very much doubted rahul would recognize her nancys fear of being recognized persisted the only time rahul had seen her nancy had been naked and her hair was down now nancy wanted her hair up shed told julia that her choice of dress was the opposite of naked but if the gray sheath was severe there was no hiding the heavy womanliness of nancys hips and breasts also her heavy hair which usually rested on her shoulders was too thick and not quite long enough to be held neatly up and kept off her neckespecially if she danced strands of her hair would come loose nancy would soon look uncontained the screenwriter decided that he wanted nancy to dance with dhar after that the possible scenes began to flow farrokh put a towel around his waist and poked his head into the dining room where julia was serving some snacks although it would be a long time before the midnight supper at the duckworth club no one really wanted to eat the doctor decided to send dhar down to the alley where the dwarf was waiting in the ambassador dr daruwalla knew that vinod was acquainted with many of the exotic dancers at the wetness cabaret possibly there was one who owed the dwarf a favor i want to get you a date farrokh told john d with a stripper john d asked tell vinod the more tarted up she is the better the screenwriter replied he guessed that new years eve was an important night at the wetness cabaret whoever the exotic dancer was shed have to leave the duckworth club early that was fine with farrokh he wanted the woman to make something of a production over leaving before midnight whoever she was the screenwriter knew that her choice of dress would be the opposite of demureshe certainly wouldnt look very duckworthian shed be sure to get everyones attention on such short notice vinod wouldnt have a wide range of choices of the women at the wetness cabaret the dwarf picked the one with the exoticdancing name of muriel shed impressed vinod as being more sensitive than the other strippers after all someone in the audience had thrown an orange at her such blatant disrespect had upset her to be hired for a little dancing at the duckworth clubparticularly to be asked to dance with inspector dharwould be quite a step up in the world for muriel short notice or not vinod delivered the exotic dancer to the daruwallas apartment in a hurry when dr daruwalla had finished dressing there was barely time for john d to rehearse the dialogue both nancy and muriel needed coaching and detective patel had to get mr sethna on the phone the detective recited quite a long list of instructions to the steward which doubtless left the old eavesdropper with a surfeit of disapproval vinod would drive dhar and the exotic dancer to the duckworth club farrokh and julia would follow with the patels john d managed to pull dr daruwalla aside the actor steered the screenwriter out on the balcony when they were alone dhar said ive got a question regarding my character farrokh for you seem to have given me some dialogue that is sexually ambiguousat best i was just trying to cover every contingency as you would say the screenwriter replied but i gather that im supposed to be interested in mrs dogar as a womanthat is as a man would be interested in her dhar said while at the same time i seem to be implying that i was once interested in rahul as a manthat is as a man is interested in another man yes farrokh said cautiously im trying to imply that youre sexually curious and sexually aggressivea bit of a bisexual maybe or even strictly a homosexual whose interest in mrs dogar is in part because of how interested i was in rahul john d interrupted is that it something like that said dr daruwalla i mean we think rahul was once attracted to youwe think mrs dogar is still attracted to you beyond that what do we really know but youve made my character a kind of sexual mystery the actor complained youve made me odd its as if youre gambling that the weirder i am the more mrs dogar will go for me is that it actors are truly impossible the screenwriter thought what dr daruwalla wanted to say was this your twin has experienced decidedly homosexual inclinations does this sound familiar to you instead what farrokh said was this i dont know how to shock a serial killer im just trying to attract one and im just asking you for a fix on my character inspector dhar replied its always easier when i know who im supposed to be there was the old dhar dr daruwalla thoughtsarcastic to the core farrokh was relieved to see that the movie star had regained his selfconfidence that was when nancy came out on the balcony im not interrupting anything am i she asked but she went straight to the railing and leaned on it she didnt wait for an answer no no dr daruwalla mumbled thats west isnt it nancy asked she was pointing to the sunset the sun usually sets in the west dhar said and if you went west across the seafrom bombay straight across the arabian seawhat would you come to nancy asked make it west and a little north she added well dr daruwalla said cautiously west and a little north from here is the gulf of oman then the persian gulf then saudi arabia dhar interrupted keep going nancy told him keep going west and a little north that would take you across jordan into israel and into the mediterranean farrokh said or across north africa said inspector dhar well yes dr daruwalla said across egypt whats after egypt he asked john d libya tunisia algeria morocco the actor replied you could pass through the straits of gibraltar or touch the coast of spain if you like yesthats the way i want to go nancy told him i touch the coast of spain then what then youre in the north atlantic dr daruwalla said go west nancy said and a little north new york dr daruwalla guessed i know the way from there nancy said suddenly from there i go straight west both dhar and dr daruwalla didnt know what nancy would come to next they werent familiar with the geography of the united states pennsylvania ohio indiana illinois nancy told them maybe id have to go through new jersey before i got to pennsylvania where are you going dr daruwalla asked home nancy answered home to iowaiowa comes after illinois do you want to go home john d asked her never nancy said i never want to go home the screenwriter saw that the zipper of the gray sheath dress was a straight line down her back it clasped at the top of her high mandarin collar if you wouldnt mind farrokh said to her perhaps you could have your husband unfasten the zipper of your dress if it were unzipped just a littledown to somewhere between your shoulder bladesthat would be better when youre dancing i mean the doctor added wouldnt it be better if i unzipped it the actor asked i mean when were dancing well yes that would be best dr daruwalla said still looking west into the sunset nancy said just dont unzip me too far i dont care what the script saysif you unzip me too far ill let you know it its time said detective patel no one was sure how long hed been on the balcony in departing it was fortunate that none of them really looked at one another their faces conveyed a certain dread of the event like mourners preparing to attend the funeral of a child the deputy commissioner was almost avuncular he affectionately patted dr daruwallas shoulder he warmly shook inspector dhars hand he held his troubled wife at her waisthis fingers familiarly spreading to the small of her back where he knew she felt some occasional pain it was his way of saying im in chargeeverythings going to be okay but there was that interminable period when they had to wait in the policemans car vinod had taken dhar and muriel ahead as the driver the deputy commissioner sat up front with the screenwriter who wanted dhar and muriel to be already dancing when the daruwallas and their guests the patels arrived in the back seat julia sat with nancy the detective avoided his wifes eyes in the rearview mirror patel also tried not to grip the steering wheel too tightlyhe didnt want any of them to see how nervous he was the passing headlights flowed like water along marine drive and when the sun finally dipped into the arabian sea the sea turned quickly from pink to purple to burgundy to black like the phases of a bruise the doctor said they must be dancing by now the detective started the car easing them into the flow of traffic in a misguided effort to sound positive dr daruwalla said lets go get the bitch lets put her away not tonight detective patel said quietly we wont catch her tonight lets just hope she takes the bait shell take it nancy said from the back seat there was nothing the deputy commissioner wanted to say he smiled he hoped he looked confident but the real policeman knew there was really no getting ready for rahul just dancing mr sethna had to wonder what was going on wonderment was not among the few expressions that the old parsi favored to anyone who observed the stewards sour intolerant visage mr sethna was simply expressing his contempt for new years eve he thought the party at the duckworth club was superfluous pateti the parsi new year comes in the late summer or the early fall it is followed a fortnight later by the anniversary of the prophet zarathustras birth by the time of the new years eve party at the duckworth club mr sethna had already celebrated his new year as for the duckworthian version of new years eve mr sethna viewed it as a tradition for anglophiles it was also morbid that new years eve at the duckworth club was doubly special to those many duckworthians who enjoyed the party as an anniversarythis year it was the th anniversaryof lord duckworths suicide the steward also thought that the events of the evening were foolishly ordered duckworthians in general were an older crowd especially at this time of year with a year waiting list for membership one would expect the members to be older but this was also the result of the younger duckworthians being away at schoolfor the most part in england in the summer months when the student generation was back in india duckworthians appeared to be younger but now here were all these older people who should be eating their dinners at a reasonable hour they were expected to drink and dance until the midnight supper was servedan assbackward order of events mr sethna believed feed them early and then let them danceif theyre able the effects of too much champagne on empty stomachs were particularly deleterious to the elderly some couples lacked the stamina to last until the midnight supper and wasnt the point of the silly eveningapparently the only pointto last until midnight from the way he was dancing dhar couldnt last until midnight mr sethna presumed yet the steward was impressed at how the actor had rebounded from his dreadful appearance of the day before on saturday the diseased man had been ghostly pale and dabbing at his penis over the urinala sickening sight now here he was on sunday night tanned and looking positively beefy he was dancing up a storm perhaps the actors sexually transmitted disease was in remission mr sethna speculated as dhar continued to hurl muriel around the dance floor and where had the moviestar slime found a woman like that once thered been a banner draped from the marquee of the bombay eros palace and the woman painted on that banner had looked like muriel mr sethna remembered the woman had actually been muriel of course the wetness cabaret was a step down from the bombay eros palace mr sethna had never seen a duckworthian in such a costume as muriel wore the glitter of her turquoise sequins her plunging neckline her miniskirt at midthigh her dress hugged her bum so tightly mr sethna expected that some of her sequins would pop off and litter the dance floor muriel had maintained the high hard athletic bum of a dancer and although she was certainly a few years older than inspector dhar she looked as if she could both outdance and outsweat him their dancing lacked the element of courtship they were brutally aggressiveastonishingly rough with each otherwhich implied to the disapproving steward that dancing was merely the public forum in which they lewdly hinted at the violence of their more private lovemaking mr sethna also observed that everyone was watching them by design mr sethna knew they kept to that portion of the dance floor which was visible from the main dining room forcing numerous couples to see them perform their gyrations nearest to this view of the ballroom was the table mr sethna had reserved for mr and mrs dogar the steward had followed detective patels instructions to the letter taking care that the second mrs dogar was shown to the chair that offered her the very best view of dhar dancing from the ladies garden the daruwallas table looked in upon the main dining room from where the doctor and the detective were seated they could observe mrs dogar but not the ballroom it wasnt dhar they wanted to see blessedly the big blonde had hidden her unusual navel mr sethna observed nancy was dressed like the headmistress of a schoolor a nanny or a clergymans wifebut the steward nevertheless detected her lawlessness her penchant for unpredictable or inexplicable behavior she sat with her back to mrs dogar staring into the gathering darkness beyond the trellis at this hour the bougainvillea had the luster of velvet the exposed nape of nancys neckthe downy blond hair that looked so soft therereminded mr sethna of her furry navel the doctors sleek tuxedo and black silk tie clashed with the deputy commissioners badly wrinkled nehru suit mr sethna determined that most duckworthians were never in contact with that element of society which could recognize policemen by their clothes the steward approved of julias gown which was a proper gownthe long skirt almost brushing the floor the long sleeves ruffled at the cuffs the neckline not a mandarin choker but a decent distance above any discernible cleavage ah the old days mr sethna mourned as if anticipating his thoughts the band responded with a slower number dhar and muriel breathing hard relaxed a little too languidly into each others arms she hung on his neck his hand resting possessively on the hard beaded sequins at her hip she appeared to be whispering to himactually she was just singing the words to the song for muriel knew every song that this band knew and many more besideswhile inspector dhar smiled knowingly at what she was saying there was his sneer which was almost a smirkthat look of disdain which was at once decadent and bored actually dhar was amused by muriels accent he thought the stripper was very funny but what the second mrs dogar saw did not amuse her she saw john d dancing with a tart a presumably loose womanand one close to mrs dogars age women like that were so easy surely dhar could do better rahul thought on the dance floor the staid duckworthians who dared to dancetheyd been waiting for a slow numberkept their distance from dhar and muriel who was clearly no lady mr sethna the old eavesdropper and lipreader extraordinaire easily caught what mr dogar said to his wife has the actor brought an actual prostitute to the party i must say she looks like a whore i think shes a stripper said mrs dogarrahul had honed a sharp eye for such social details perhaps shes an actress mr dogar said shes acting but shes no actress mrs dogar replied from what farrokh could see of rahul the transsexual had inherited the reptilian scrutiny of her aunt promila it was as if when she looked at you she were seeing a different lifeformcertainly not a fellow human being its hard to tell from here said dr daruwalla i dont know if shes attracted to him or if she wants to kill him maybe with her said the deputy commissioner the feeling is one and the same whatever else she feels shes attracted nancy said her back was the only part of her that rahul could see if rahul had been looking but rahul had eyes for john d only when the band played a faster number dhar and muriel grew even rougher with each other as if invigorated by the slower interlude or by their closer contact a few of the cheap sequins were torn from muriels dress they glittered on the dance floor reflecting the light from the ballroom chandelierwhen dhar or muriel stepped on them they crunched a constant rivulet of sweat ran its course in muriels cleavage and dhar was bleeding slightly from a scratch on his wrist the cuff of his white shirt was dotted with blood because of how tightly he held muriel at her waist a sequin had scratched him he paid the scratch only passing attention but muriel took his wrist in her hands and covered the cut with her mouth in this way with his wrist to her lips they kept dancing mr sethna had seen such things only in the movies the steward didnt realize that this was what he was seeing a screenplay by farrokh daruwalla a movie starring inspector dhar when muriel left the duckworth club she made a fuss over her departure she danced one last dance another slow one with her shawl on she downed a nearly full glass of champagne in the foyer then the exotic dancer leaned on vinods head while the dwarf walked her to the ambassador a todo worthy of a slut said mr dogar i suppose shes going back to the brothel but rahul merely glanced at the time the second mrs dogar was a close observer of bombays low life she knew that the hour for the first show at the eros palace was fast approaching or maybe dhars tart worked at the wetness cabaretthe first show there was minutes later when dhar asked the sorabjees daughter to dance a new tension could be felt throughout the main dining room and the ladies garden even with her back to the action nancy knew that something unscripted had happened hes asked someone else to dance hasnt he she said her face and the nape of her neck were flushed whos that young girl shes not part of our plan said detective patel trust himhes a great improviser the screenwriter said he always understands who he is and what his role is he knows what hes doing nancy was pinching a pearl on her necklace her thumb and index finger were white you bet he knows she said julia turned around but she couldnt see the ballroomonly the look of loathing that was unconcealed on mrs dogars face its little amy sorabjeeshe must be back from school dr daruwalla informed his wife shes only a teenager julia cried i think shes a little older the real policeman replied its a brilliant move the screenwriter said mrs dogar doesnt know what to think i know how she feels nancy told him itll be all right sweetie the deputy commissioner told his wife when he took her hand she pulled it away am i next nancy asked do i wait in line almost every face in the main dining room was turned toward the ballroom they watched the unstoppable sweating movie star with his bulky shoulders and his beer belly he was twirling little amy sorabjee around as if she were no heavier than her clothes although the sorabjees and the daruwallas were old friends dr and mrs sorabjee had been surprised at dhars spurofthemoment invitationand that amy had accepted she was a silly girl in her twenties a former university student who hadnt merely come home for the holiday shed been withdrawn from school granted dhar wasnt mashing her the actor was behaving like a proper gentlemanexcessively charming possibly but the young lady seemed delighted theirs was a different kind of dancing from dhars performance with muriel the friskiness of the youthful girl was appealingly offset by the sure smooth quality of the older mans gestures now hes seducing children mr dogar announced to his wife hes going to dance his way through all the womenim sure hell ask you too promila mrs dogar was visibly upset she excused herself for the ladies room where she was reminded of how she hated this aspect of being a womanwaiting to pee there was too long a line rahul slipped through the foyer and into the closed and darkened administrative offices of the old club there was enough moonlight for her to type by and she rolled a tworupee note into the typewriter that was nearest a window on the money the typed message was as spontaneous as her feelings at the moment a member no more this was a message meant for dhars mouth and mrs dogar slipped it into her purse where it could keep company with the message shed already typed for her husband because dhar is still a member it comforted mrs dogar to have these tworupee notes in place she always felt better when she was prepared for every contingency she slipped back through the foyer and into the ladies room where the line ahead of her wasnt so long when rahul returned to her table in the main dining room dhar was dancing with a new partner mr sethna whod been happily monitoring the conversation between the dogars was thrilled to note mr dogars observation to his coarse wife now dhars dancing with that hefty anglo who came with the daruwallas i think shes the white half of a mixed marriage her husband looks like a pathetic civil servant but mrs dogar was prevented from seeing the new dancers dhar had wheeled nancy into the part of the ballroom that wasnt visible from the main dining room only intermittently did a glimpse of them appear earlier rahul had taken little notice of the big blonde when mrs dogar glanced at the daruwallas table the daruwallas were bent in conversation with the outofplace pathetic civil servant as her husband had described him maybe he was a minor magistrate rahul guessedor some controlling little guru whod met his western wife in an ashram then dhar and the heavy woman danced into view mrs dogar sensed the strength with which they gripped each otherthe womans broad hand held fast to dhars neck and the biceps of his right arm was locked in her armpit as if he were trying to lift her up she was taller than he was from the way she grasped his neck it was impossible for rahul to tell if nancy was pulling dhars face into the side of her throat or if she was struggling to prevent him from nuzzling her what was remarkable was that they were whispering fiercely to each other neither one of them was listening but they were talking urgently and at the same time when they danced out of her sight again rahul couldnt stand it mrs dogar asked her husband to dance hes got her i told you he could do it said dr daruwalla this is only the beginning the deputy commissioner replied this is just the dancing happy new year fortunately for mr dogar it was a slow dance his wife steered him past several faltering couples who were disconcerted that muriels fallen sequins still crunched underfoot mrs dogar had dhar and the big blonde in her sights is this in the script nancy was whispering to the actor this isnt in the script you bastard were supposed to make something of a scenelike an old lovers quarrel dhar whispered youre embracing me nancy told him youre squeezing me back he whispered i wish i was killing you nancy whispered shes here dhar said softly shes following us with a pang rahul observed that the blond wench had gone limp in dhars armsand shed been resisting him that had been obvious now it appeared to mrs dogar that dhar was supporting the heavy woman the blonde might otherwise have fallen to the dance floor so lifelessly was she draped on the actor shed thrown her arms over his shoulders and locked her hands behind his back her face was buried in his neckawkwardly because she was taller rahul could see that nancy was shaking her head while dhar went on whispering to her the blonde had that pleasing air of submission about her as if shed already given up rahul was reminded of the kind of woman whod let you make love to her or let you kill her without a breath of complaintlike someone with a high fever rahul thought does she recognize me nancy was whispering she trembled and then stumbled dhar had to hold her up with all his strength she cant recognize you she doesnt recognize youshes just curious about whats between us the actor replied what is between us nancy whispered where her hands were locked together he felt her dig her knuckles into his spine shes coming closer dhar warned nancy she doesnt recognize you she just wants to look im going to do it now he whispered do what nancy asked shed forgottenshe was so frightened of rahul unzip you dhar said not too far nancy told him the actor turned her suddenly he had to stand on tiptoe to look over her shoulder but he wanted to be sure that mrs dogar saw his face john d looked straight at rahul and smiled he gave the killer a sly wink then he unzipped the back of nancys dress while rahul watched when he felt the clasp of nancys bra he stopped he spread his palm between her bare shoulder bladesshe was sweating and he felt her shudder is she watching nancy whispered i hate you she added shes right on top of us dhar whispered im going to go right at her were changing partners now zip me up first nancy whispered zip me up with his right hand john d zipped nancy up with his left he reached out and took the second mrs dogar by the wristher arm was cool and dry as sinewy as a strong rope lets switch partners for the next number said inspector dhar but it was still the slow dance that played mr dogar staggered briefly nancy who was relieved to be out of dhars arms forcefully drew the old man to her chest a lock of her hair had come undone it hid her cheek no one saw her tears which might have been confused with her sweat hi nancy said before mr dogar could respond she palmed the back of his head his cheek was pressed flat between her shoulder and her collarbone nancy moved the old man resolutely away from dhar and rahul she wondered how long she had to wait until the band changed to a faster number what was left of the slow dance suited dhar and rahul john ds eyes were level with a thin blue vein that ran the length of mrs dogars throat something deepblack and polished like onyxa single stone set in silverrested in the perfect declivity where her throat met her sternum her dress which was an emerald green was cut low but it fit her breasts snugly her hands were smooth and hard her grip surprisingly light she was light on her feet too no matter where john d moved she squared her shoulders to himher eyes locked onto his eyes as if she were reading the first page of a new book that was rather crudeand clumsy too the second mrs dogar said im tired of trying to ignore you the actor told her im sick of pretending that i dont know who you are who you were dhar added but her grip maintained its even soft pressureher body obediently followed his goodness you are provincial mrs dogar said cant a man become a woman if she wants to its certainly an exciting idea said inspector dhar youre not sneering are you mrs dogar asked him certainly not im just remembering the actor replied twenty years ago i couldnt get up the nerve to approach youi didnt know how to begin twenty years ago i wasnt complete rahul reminded him if you had approached me what would you have done frankly i was too young to think of doing dhar replied i think i just wanted to see you i dont suppose that seeing me is all you have in mind today mrs dogar said certainly not said inspector dhar but he couldnt muster the courage to squeeze her hand she was everywhere so dry and cool and light of touch but she was also very hard twenty years ago i tried to approach you rahul admitted it must have been too subtle for meat least i missed it john d remarked at the bardez i was told you slept in the hammock on the balcony rahul told him i went to you the only part of you that was outside the mosquito net was your foot i put your big toe in my mouth i sucked itactually i bit you but it wasnt you it was dr daruwalla i was so disgusted i never tried again this was not the conversation dhar had expected john ds options for dialogue didnt include a response to this interesting story but while he was at a loss for words the band saved him they changed to a faster number people were leaving the dance floor in droves including nancy with mr dogar nancy led the old man to his table he was almost breathless by the time she got him seated who are you dear he managed to ask her mrs patel nancy replied ah the old man said and your husband what mr dogar meant was what does he do he wondered which sort of civilservice employee is he my husband is mr patel nancy told him when she left him she walked as carefully as possible to the daruwallas table i dont think she recognized me nancy told them but i couldnt look at her she looks the same but ancient are they dancing dr daruwalla asked are they talking too theyre dancing and theyre talkingthats all i know nancy told the screenwriter i couldnt look at her she repeated its all right sweetie the deputy commissioner said you dont have to do anything more i want to be there when you catch her vijay nancy told her husband well we may not catch her in a place where you want to be the detective replied please let me be there nancy said am i zipped up she asked suddenly she rotated her shoulders so that julia could see her back youre zipped up perfectly dear julia told her mr dogar alone at his table was gulping champagne and catching his breath while mr sethna plied him with hors doeuvres mrs dogar and dhar were dancing in that part of the ballroom where mr dogar couldnt see them there was a time when i wanted you rahul was telling john d you were a beautiful boy i still want you dhar told her it seems you want everybody mrs dogar said whos the stripper she asked him he had no dialogue for this just a stripper dhar answered and whos the fat blonde rahul asked him this much dr daruwalla had prepared him for shes an old story the actor replied some people cant let go you can have your choice of womenyounger women too mrs dogar told him what do you want with me this introduced a moment in the dialogue that the actor was afraid of this required a quantum leap of faith in farrokhs script the actor had little confidence in his upcoming line i need to know something dhar told rahul is your vagina really made from what used to be your penis dont be crude mrs dogar said then she started laughing i wish there was another way to ask the question john d admitted when she laughed more uncontrollably her hands gripped him harder he could feel the strength of her hands for the first time i suppose i could have been more indirect dhar continued for her laughter encouraged him i could have said what sort of sensitivity do you have in that vagina of yours anyway i mean does it feel sort of like a penis the actor stopped he couldnt make himself continue the screenwriters dialogue wasnt workingfarrokh was frequently hitormiss with dialogue besides mrs dogar had stopped laughing so youre just curiousis that it she asked him youre attracted to the oddity of it along the thin blue vein at rahuls throat there appeared a cloudy drop of sweat it ran quickly between her taut breasts john d thought that they hadnt been dancing that hard he hoped it was the right time he took her around her waist with some force and she followed his lead when they crossed that part of the dance floor which made them visible to mrs dogars husbandand to mr sethnadhar saw that the old steward had understood his signal mr sethna turned quickly from the dining room toward the foyer and the actor again wheeled mrs dogar into the more private part of the ballroom im an actor john d told rahul i can be anyone you want me to bei can do absolutely anything you like you just have to draw me a picture the actor winced he had farrokh to thank for that clunker too what an eccentric presumption mrs dogar said draw you a picture of what just give me an idea of what appeals to you then i can do it dhar told her you said draw me a picturei heard you say it mrs dogar said i meant just tell me what you likei mean sexually the actor said i know what you mean but you said draw rahul replied coldly didnt you used to be an artist werent you going to art school the actor asked what the hell is mr sethna doing dhar was thinking john d was afraid that rahul smelled a rat i didnt learn anything in art school mrs dogar told him in the utility closet off the foyer mr sethna had discovered that he couldnt read the writing in the fuse box without his glasses which he kept in a drawer in the kitchen it took the steward a moment to decide whether or not to kill all the fuses the old fool has probably electrocuted himself dr daruwalla was saying to detective patel lets try to keep calm the policeman said if the lights dont go out let dhar improviseif hes such a great improviser nancy said i want you not as a curiosity dhar said suddenly to mrs dogar i know youre strong i think youre aggressivei believe you can assert yourself it was the worst of dr daruwallas dialogue the actor thoughtit was sheer groping i want you to tell me what you like i want you to tell me what to do i want you to submit to me rahul said you can tie me up if you want to dhar said agreeably i mean more than that mrs dogar said then the ballroom and the entire first floor of the duckworth club were pitched into darkness there was a communal gasp and a fumbling in the band the number they were playing persisted through a few more toots and thumps from the dining room came an artless clapping noises of chaos could be heard from the kitchen then the knives and forks and spoons began their impromptu music against the water glasses dont spill the champagne mr bannerjee called out the girlish laughter probably came from amy sorabjee when john d tried to kiss her in the darkness mrs dogar was too fast his mouth was just touching hers when he felt her seize his lower lip in her teeth while she held him thus by the lip her exaggerated breathing was heavy in his face her cool dry hands unzipped him and fondled him until he was hard dhar put his hands on her buttocks which she instantly tightened still she clamped his lower lip between her teeth her bite was hard enough to hurt him but not quite deep enough to make him bleed as mr sethna had been instructed the lights flashed briefly on and then went out again mrs dogar let go of john dboth with her teeth and with her hands when he took his hands off her to zip up his fly he lost her when the lights came on dhar was no longer in contact with mrs dogar you want a picture ill show you a picture rahul said quietly i could have bitten your lip off i have a suite at both the oberoi and the taj the actor told her noill tell you where mrs dogar said ill tell you at lunch at lunch here dhar asked her tomorrow rahul said i could have bitten your nose off if id wanted to thank you for the dance john d said as he turned to leave her he was uncomfortably aware of his erection and the throbbing in his lower lip careful you dont knock over any chairs or tables mrs dogar said youre as big as an elephant it was the word elephantcoming from rahulthat most affected john ds walk he crossed the dining room still seeing the cloudy drop of her quickly disappearing sweatstill feeling her cool dry hands and the way shed breathed into his open mouth when his lip was trapped john d suspected he would never forget that he was thinking that the thin blue vein in her throat was so very still it was as if she didnt have a pulse or that she knew some way to suspend the normal beating of her heart when dhar sat down at the table nancy couldnt look at him deputy commissioner patel didnt look at him either but that was because the policeman was more interested in watching mr and mrs dogar they were arguingmrs dogar wouldnt sit down mr dogar wouldnt stand upand the detective noticed something extremely simple but peculiar about the two of them they had almost exactly the same haircut mr dogar wore his wonderfully thick hair in a vain pompadour it was cut short at the back of his neck and it was tightly trimmed over his ears but a surprisingly full and cocky wave of his hair was brushed high off his foreheadhis hair was silver with streaks of white mrs dogars hair was black with streaks of silver probably dyed but her hairdo was the same as her husbands albeit more stylish it gave her a slightly spanish appearance a pompadour imagine that thought detective patel he saw that mrs dogar had persuaded her husband to stand mr sethna would later inform the deputy commissioner of what words passed between the dogars but the policeman could have guessed mrs dogar was complaining that her husband had already slurped too much champagne she wouldnt tolerate a minute more of his drunkennessshe would have the servants fix them a midnight supper at home where at least she would not be publicly embarrassed by mr dogars illconsidered behavior theyre leaving dr daruwalla observed what happened did you agitate her the screenwriter asked the actor dhar had a drink of champagne which made his lip sting the sweat was rolling down his faceafter all hed been dancing all nightand his hands were noticeably shaky they watched him exchange the champagne glass for his water glass even a sip of water caused him to wince nancy had had to force herself to look at him now she couldnt look away the deputy commissioner was still thinking about the haircuts the pompadour had a feminizing effect on old mr dogar but the same hairdo conveyed a mannishness to his wife the detective concluded that mrs dogar resembled a bullfighter detective patel had never seen a bullfighter of course farrokh was dying to know which dialogue john d had used the sweating movie star was still fussing with his lip the doctor observed that dhars lower lip was swollen it had the increasingly purplish hue of a contusion the doctor waved his arms for a waiter and asked for a tall glass of icejust ice so she kissed you nancy said it was more like a bite john d replied but what did you say dr daruwalla cried did you arrange a meeting detective patel asked dhar lunch here tomorrow the actor replied lunch the screenwriter said with disappointment so youve made a start the policeman said yes i think so its something anywayim not sure what dhar remarked so she responded farrokh asked he felt frustrated for he wanted to hear the dialogue between themword for word look at his lip nancy told the doctor of course she responded did you ask her to draw you a picture farrokh wanted to know that part was scaryat least it got a little strange dhar said evasively but i think shes going to show me something at lunch dr daruwalla asked john d shrugged he was clearly exasperated with all the questions let him talk farrokh stop putting words in his mouth julia told him but hes not talking the doctor cried she said she wanted me to submit to her dhar told the deputy commissioner she wants to tie him up farrokh shouted she said she meant more than that dhar replied whats more than that dr daruwalla asked the waiter brought the ice and john d held a piece to his lip put the ice in your mouth and suck on it the doctor told him but john d kept applying the ice in his own way she bit me inside and out was all he said did you get to the part about her sexchange operation the screenwriter asked she thought that part was funny john d told them she laughed by now the indentations on the outside of dhars lower lip were easier to see even in the candlelight in the ladies garden the teeth marks had left such deep bruises the discolored lip was turning from a pale purple to a dark magenta as if mrs dogars teeth had left a stain to her husbands surprise nancy helped herself to a second glass of champagne detective patel had been mildly shocked that his wife had accepted the first glass now nancy raised her glass as if she were toasting everyone in the ladies garden happy new year she said but to no one in particular auld lang syne finally they served the midnight supper nancy picked at her food which her husband eventually ate john d couldnt eat anything spicy because of his lip he didnt tell them about the erection mrs dogar had given him or howor about how shed said he was as big as an elephant dhar decided hed tell detective patel later when they were alone when the policeman excused himself from the table john d followed him to the mens room and told him there i didnt like the way she looked when she left here that was all the detective would say back at their table dr daruwalla told them that he had a plan to introduce the top half of the pen mr sethna was involvedit sounded complicated john d repeated that he hoped rahul was going to make him a drawing that would do it wouldnt it nancy asked her husband that would help the deputy commissioner said he had a bad feeling he once again excused himself from the table this time to call crime branch headquarters he ordered a surveillance officer to watch the dogars house all night if mrs dogar left the house he wanted the officer to follow herand he wanted to be told if she left the house whatever the hour in the mens room dhar had said that hed never felt it was rahuls intention to bite his lip off nor even that taking his lip in her teeth was a deliberate decisionit wasnt something shed done merely to scare him either the actor believed that mrs dogar hadnt been able to stop herself and all the while shed held his lip hed felt that the transsexual was unable to let go it wasnt that she wanted to bite me dhar had told the detective it was that she couldnt help it yes i understand the policeman had said hed resisted the temptation to add that only in the movies did every murderer have a clear motive now as he hung up the phone a dreary song reached the deputy commissioner in the foyer the band was playing auld lang syne the drunken duckworthians were murdering the lyrics patel crossed the dining room with difficulty because so many of the maudlin members were leaving their tables and traipsing to the ballroom singing as they staggered forth there went mr bannerjee sandwiched between his wife and the widow lal he appeared to be manfully intent on dancing with them both there went dr and mrs sorabjee leaving little amy alone at their table when the detective returned to the daruwallas table nancy was nagging dhar im sure that little girl is dying to dance with you again and shes all alone why dont you ask her imagine how she feels you started it nancy told him shed had three glasses of champagne her husband calculated this wasnt much but she never drankand shed eaten next to nothing dhar was managing not to sneer he was trying to ignore nancy instead why dont you ask me to dance julia asked john d i think farrokh has forgotten to ask me without a word dhar led julia to the ballroom amy sorabjee watched them all the way i like your idea about the top half of the pen detective patel told dr daruwalla the screenwriter was taken aback by this unexpected praise you do farrokh said the problem is mrs dogars got to think that its been in her pursethat its always been there i agree that if dhar can distract her mr sethna can plant the pen that was all the policeman would say you do dr daruwalla repeated it would be nice if we found other things in her purse the deputy commissioner thought aloud you mean the money with the typewritten warningsor maybe even a drawing the doctor said precisely patel said well i wish i could write that the screenwriter replied suddenly julia was back at the table shed lost john d as a dance partner when amy sorabjee had cut in the shameless girl dr daruwalla said come dance with me liebchen julia told him then the patels were alone at the table in fact they were alone in the ladies garden in the main dining room an unidentified man was sleeping with his head on one of the dinner tables everyone else was dancing or they were standing in the ballroomapparently for the morbid pleasure of singing auld lang syne the waiters were beginning to scavenge the abandoned tables but not a single waiter disturbed detective patel and nancy in the ladies garden mr sethna had instructed them to respect the couples privacy nancys hair had come down and she had trouble unfastening the pearl necklace her husband had to help her with the clasp theyre beautiful pearls arent they nancy asked but if i dont give them back to mrs daruwalla now ill forget and wear them home they might get lost or stolen ill try to find you a necklace like this detective patel told her no its too expensive nancy said you did a good job her husband told her were going to catch her arent we vijay she asked him yes we are sweetie he replied she didnt recognize me nancy cried i told you she wouldnt didnt i the detective said she didnt even see me she looked right through melike i didnt exist all these years and she didnt even remember me nancy said the deputy commissioner held her hand she rested her head on his shoulder she felt so empty she couldnt even cry im sorry vijay but i dont think i can dance i just cant nancy said thats all right sweetie her husband said i dont danceremember he didnt have to unzip meit was unnecessary nancy said it was part of the overall effect patel replied it was unnecessary nancy repeated and i didnt like the way he did it the idea was you werent supposed to like it the policeman told her she must have tried to bite his whole lip off nancy cried i believe she barely managed to stop herself the deputy commissioner said this had the effect of releasing nancy from her emptiness at last she was able to cry on her husbands shoulder it seemed that the band would never stop playing the tiresome old song well drink a cup of kindness yet mr bannerjee was shouting mr sethna observed that julia and dr daruwalla were the most stately dancers on the floor dr and mrs sorabjee danced nervously they didnt dare take their eyes off their daughter poor amy had been brought home from england where she hadnt been doing very well too much partying her parents suspectedand more disturbing a reputed attraction to older men at university she was notoriously opposed to romances with her fellow students rather shed thrown herself at one of her professorsa married chap hed not taken advantage of her thank goodness and now dr and mrs sorabjee were tortured to see the young girl dancing with dhar from the frying pan to the fire mrs sorabjee thought it was awkward for mrs sorabjee being a close friend of the daruwallas and therefore unable to express her opinion of inspector dhar do you know youre available in englandon videocassette amy was telling the actor am i he said once we had a wine tasting and we rented you amy told him people who arent from bombay dont know what to make of you the movies seem terribly odd to them yes said inspector dhar to me too he added this made her laugh she was an easy girl he could tellhe felt a little sorry for her parents all that music mixed in with all the murders amy sorabjee said dont forget the divine intervention the actor remarked yes and all the womenyou do gather up a lot of women amy observed yes i do dhar said well drink a cup of kindness yet for the days of auld lang syne the old dancers brayed they sounded like donkeys i like inspector dhar and the cagegirl killer the bestits the sexiest said little amy sorabjee i dont have a favorite the actor confided to her he guessed she was or he found her a pleasant distraction but it irritated him that she kept staring at his lip what happened to your lip she finally asked him in a whisperher expression still girlish but sly even conspiratorial when the lights went out i danced into a wall dhar told her i think that horrid woman did it to you amy sorabjee dared to say it looks like she bit you john d just kept dancing the way his lip had swollen it hurt to sneer everyone thinks shes a horrid woman you know amy said dhars silence had made her less sure of herself and who was that first woman you were with amy asked him the one who left shes a stripper said inspector dhar go onnot really amy cried yes really john d replied and who is the blond lady amy asked i thought she looked about to cry shes a former friend the actor answered he was tired of the girl now a young girls idea of intimacy was getting answers to all her questions john d was sure that vinod would already be waiting outside surely the dwarf had returned from taking muriel to the wetness cabaret dhar wanted to go to bed alone he wanted to put more ice on his lip and he wanted to apologize to farrokh too it had been unkind of the actor to imply that preparing himself for the seduction of mrs dogar was no circus john d knew what the circus meant to dr daruwallathe actor could have more charitably said that getting ready for rahul was no picnic and now here was the insatiable amy sorabjee trying to get him and herself into some unnecessary trouble time to slip away the actor thought just then amy took a quick look over dhars shoulder she wanted to be exactly sure where her parents were a doddering threesome had blocked dr and mrs sorabjee from amys viewmr bannerjee was struggling to dance with his wife and the widow laland amy seized this moment of privacy for she knew she was only briefly free of her parents scrutiny she brushed her soft lips against john ds cheek then she whispered overbreathlessly in the actors ear i could kiss that lip and make it better she said john d smoothly just kept dancing his unresponsiveness made amy feel insecure and so she whispered more plaintivelyat least more matteroffactlyi prefer older men do you the movie star said why so do i inspector dhar told the silly girl so do i that got rid of her it always worked at last inspector dhar could slip away jubilee day no monkey it was january a monday it was also jubilee day at st ignatius school in mazagaonthe start of the missions th year wellwishers were invited to a high tea which amounted to a light supper in the early evening this was scheduled to follow a special lateafternoon mass this was also the occasion that would formally serve to introduce martin mills to the catholic community in bombay therefore father julian and father cecil regretted that the scholastic had returned from the circus in such mutilated condition the previous night martin had frightened brother gabriel who mistook the mauled figure with his bloodstained and unraveling bandages for the wandering spirit of a previously persecuted jesuitsome poor soul whod been tortured and then put to death earlier that same night the zealot had prevailed upon father cecil to hear his confession father cecil was so tired he fell asleep before he could give martin absolution typically martins confession seemed unendingnor had father cecil caught the gist of it before he nodded off it struck the old priest that martin mills was confessing nothing more serious than a lifelong disposition to complain martin had begun by enumerating his several disappointments with himself beginning with the period of his novitiate at st aloysius in massachusetts father cecil tried to listen closely for there was a tone of urgency in the scholastics voice yet young martins capacity for finding fault with himself was vastthe poor priest soon felt that his participation in martins confession was superfluous for example as a novice at st aloysius martin confessed a significantly holy event had been entirely wasted on him martin had been unimpressed by the visit of the sacred arm of st francis xavier to the massachusetts novitiate father cecil didnt think this was so bad the acolyte bearing the saints severed arm was the famous father terry finney sj father finney had selflessly undertaken the task of carrying the golden reliquary around the world martin confessed that to him the holy arm had been nothing but a skeletal limb under glass like something partially eatenlike a leftover martin mills had observed only now could the scholastic bear to confess having had such blasphemous thoughts by this time father cecil was fast asleep there was more it troubled martin that the issue of divine grace had taken him years to resolve to his satisfaction and sometimes the scholastic felt he was merely making a conscious effort not to think about it old father cecil really should have heard this for martin mills was dangerously full of doubt the confession would eventually lead young martin to his present disappointment with himself which was the way hed behaved on the trip to and from the circus the scholastic said he was guilty of loving the crippled boy more than he loved the child prostitute his abhorrence of prostitution caused him to feel almost resigned to the girls fate and dr daruwalla had provoked the jesuit on the sensitive matter of homosexuality martin was sorry that hed spoken to the doctor in an intellectually arrogant fashion at this point father cecil was sleeping so soundly the poor priest never woke when he slumped forward in the confessional and his nose poked between the latticework where martin mills could see it when martin saw the old priests nose he knew that father cecil was dead to the world he didnt want to embarrass the poor man however it wasnt right to leave him sleeping in such an uncomfortable position that was why the missionary crept away and went looking for brother gabriel that was when poor brother gabriel mistook the wildly bandaged scholastic for a persecuted christian from the past after his fear had subsided brother gabriel went to wake up father cecil who thereafter suffered a sleepless night the priest couldnt remember what martin mills had confessed or whether or not hed given the zealot absolution martin slept blissfully even without absolution it had felt good to say all those things against himself tomorrow was soon enough for someone to hear his full confessionperhaps hed ask father julian this time although father julian was scarier than father cecil the father rector was also a bit younger thus with his conscience clear and no bugs in his bed martin would sleep through the night full of doubt one minute brimming with conviction the next the missionary was a walking contradictionhe was dependably unreliable nancy also slept through the night one couldnt claim that she slept blissfully but at least she slept surely the champagne helped she wouldnt hear the ringing of the phone which detective patel answered in the kitchen it was on the morning of new years day and at first the deputy commissioner was relieved that the call was not from the surveillance officer whod been assigned to watch the dogars house on old ridge road malabar hill it was a homicide report from the redlight district in kamathipuraa prostitute had been murdered in one of the arguably better brothels ordinarily no one would have awakened the deputy commissioner with such a report but both the investigating officer and the medical examiner were certain that the crime was dharrelated once again there was the elephant drawing on the belly of the murdered whore but there was also a fearsome new twist to this killing which the caller was sure detective patel would want to see as for the surveillance officer the subinspector who was watching the dogars house he might as well have slept through the night too he swore that mrs dogar had never left her house only mr dogar had left the subinspector whom the deputy commissioner would later reassign to something harmless like answering letters of complaint declared that he knew it was mr dogar because of the old mans characteristic shuffle also the figure was stooped then there was the matter of the baggy suit which was gray it was a mans suit of an exceedingly loose fitnot what mr dogar had worn to the new years eve party at the duckworth cluband with it mr dogar wore a white shirt open at the throat the old man climbed into a taxi at about am he returned to his house in another taxi at am the surveillance officer whom the deputy commissioner would also later demote from subinspector to constable had smugly assumed that mr dogar was visiting either a mistress or a prostitute definitely a prostitute thought detective patel unfortunately it hadnt been mr dogar the madam at the questionably better brothel in kamathipura told the deputy commissioner that it was her brothels policy to turn out the lights at or am depending on the volume of customers or the lack thereof after the lights were out she accepted only allnight visitors to spend the night with one of her girls the madam charged from rupees on up the old man whod arrived after am when the brothel was dark had offered rupees for the madams smallest girl detective patel first thought the madam must have meant her youngest girl but the madam said she was sure that the gentleman had requested her smallest in any case thats what he got asha was a very small delicate girlabout the madam declared about the deputy commissioner guessed because the lights were out and there were no other girls in the hallway no one but the madam and asha saw the alleged old manhe wasnt that old the madam believed he wasnt at all stooped either the madam recalled but like the soontobedemoted surveillance officer she noted how loosely the suit fit him and that it was gray he was very cleanshaven except for a thin mustachethe latter was false detective patel assumedand an unusual hairdo here the madam held her hands high above her forehead and said but it was cut short in the back and over the ears yes i knowa pompadour patel said he knew that the hair would not have been silver streaked with white but he asked the question anyway no it was black streaked with silver the madam said and no one had seen the old man leave the madam had been awakened by the presence of a nun shed heard what she thought was someone trying to open the door from the street when she went to see there was a nun outside the doorit must have been about in the morning do you see a lot of nuns in this district at that hour the deputy commissioner asked her of course not the madam cried shed asked the nun what she wanted and the nun had replied that she was searching for a christian girl from kerala the madam responded that she had no kerala christians in her house and what color was the nuns habit patel asked although he knew the answer would be gray which it was it wasnt an unusual color for a habit of tropical weight but it was also something that could have been fashioned from the same gray suit that mrs dogar had worn when she came to the brothel the baggy suit had probably fitted over the habit then in turn the habit fit over the suit or parts of the habit and the suit were one and the sameat least the same fabric the white shirt could have various uses maybe it was rolled like a high collar or else it could cover the head like a kind of cowl the detective presumed that the alleged nun didnt have a mustache of course not the madam declared and because the nun had covered her head the madam wouldnt have noticed the pompadour the only reason the madam had found the dead girl so soon was that shed been unable to fall back asleep first one of the allnight customers was shouting and then when it was finally quiet the madam had heard the sound of water boiling although it wasnt time for tea in the dead girls cubicle a pot of water had come to a boil on a heating coil that was how the madam discovered the body otherwise it might have been or in the morning before the other prostitutes would have noticed that tiny asha wasnt up and about the deputy commissioner asked the madam about the sound of someone trying to open the door from the streetthe sound that had awakened her wouldnt the door have made the same sound if it had been opened from the inside and then closed behind the departing nun the madam admitted that this would have made the same sound in short if the madam hadnt heard the door she never would have seen the nun and by the time mrs dogar took a taxi home she was no longer a nun at all detective patel was exceedingly polite in asking the madam a most obvious question would you consider the idea that the notsoold man and the nun were in fact the same person the madam shrugged she doubted she could identify either of them when the deputy commissioner pressed her on this point all the madam would add was that shed been sleepy both the notsoold man and the nun had woken her up nancy was still not awake when detective patel returned to his flat hed already typed a scathing report demoting the surveillance officer and consigning him to the mailroom of grime branch headquarters the deputy commissioner wanted to be home when his wife woke up he also didnt want to call inspector dhar and dr daruwalla from the police station detective patel thought hed let them all sleep a little longer the deputy commissioner determined that ashas neck had been broken so cleanly for two reasons one she was small two shed been completely relaxed rahul must have coaxed her over onto her stomach as if to prepare her for sex in that position but of course thered been no sex the deep fingerprint bruises in the prostitutes eye socketsand on her throat just below her jawsuggested that mrs dogar had grabbed ashas face from behind shed wrenched the small girls head back and to one side until ashas neck snapped then rahul had rolled asha onto her back in order to make the drawing on her belly although the drawing was of the usual kind it was of less than the usual quality it suggested undue haste which was strangethere was no urgency for mrs dogar to leave the brothel yet something had compelled rahul to hurry as for the fearsome new twist to this killing it sickened detective patel the dead girls lower lip was bitten clean through asha could not have been bitten so savagely while she was alive her screams would have awakened the entire brothel no the bite had occurred after the murder and after the drawing the minimal amount of bleeding indicated that asha had been bitten after her heart had stopped it was the idea of biting the girl that had made mrs dogar hurry the policeman thought she couldnt wait to finish the drawing because ashas lower lip was so tempting to her even such slight bleeding had made a mess which was uncharacteristic of rahul it must have been mrs dogar who put the pot of water on the heating coil her own face at least her mouth must have been marked with the prostitutes blood when the water was warm rahul dipped some of the dead girls clothes in the pot and used them to wash the blood off herself then she leftas a nunforgetting that the heating coil was on the boiling water had brought the madam although the nun had been a smart idea this had otherwise been a sloppy job nancy woke up about she had a hangover but detective patel didnt hesitate to tell her what had happened he could hear her being sick in the bathroom he called the actor first then the screenwriter he told dhar about the lip but not the doctor with dr daruwalla the deputy commissioner wanted to emphasize the importance of a good script for dhars lunch with mrs dogar patel told them both that he would have to arrest rahul today he hoped he had enough circumstantial evidence to arrest her whether or not he had enough evidence to keep herthat was another story that was what he was counting on the actor and the screenwriter for they had to make something happen over lunch deputy commissioner patel was encouraged by one thing that the gullible surveillance officer had told him after the disguised mrs dogar had shuffled out of the taxi and into her house the lights were turned on in a groundfloor roomnot a bedroomand these lights remained on well after daybreak the deputy commissioner hoped that rahul had been drawing as for dr daruwalla his first good nights sleepfor five nights and countinghad been interrupted rather early he had no surgeries scheduled for new years day and no office appointments either hed been planning to sleep in but upon hearing from detective patel the screenwriter called john d immediately there was a lot to do before dhars lunch at the duckworth club there would be much rehearsingsome of it would be awkward because mr sethna would have to be involved the deputy commissioner had already notified the old steward it was from john d that farrokh heard about ashas lower lip rahul must have been thinking of you dr daruwalla cried well we know she has a thing about biting dhar told the doctor in all likelihood it started with you what do you mean dr daruwalla asked for john d hadnt told him that mrs dogar had confessed to gnawing on the doctors toe it all started with the big toe of your right foot in goa john d began that was rahul who bit you you were right all alongit was no monkey the wrong madhu that monday well before meatfeeding time at the great blue nile circus in junagadh the elephantfooted boy would wake up to the steady coughs of the lions their low roars rose and fell as regularly as breathing it was a cold morning in that part of gujarat for the first time in his life ganesh could see his own breath the huffs of breath from the lions were like blasts of steam escaping from their cages the muslims delivered the meat in a wooden wagon dotted with flies the entire floor of the wagon was lifted from the cart and placed on the ground between the cooks tent and the big cats cagesthe raw beef was piled on this slab of rough wood which was the approximate size of a double door even in the cold morning air the flies hovered over the meat which chandra sorted sometimes there was mutton mixed in with the beef and the cook wanted to rescue it mutton was too expensive for lions and tigers the big cats were bellowing now they could smell the meat and some of them could see the cook separating the choicer pieces of mutton if the elephant boy was frightened by how savagely the lions and tigers devoured the raw beef dr daruwalla would never learn of it nor would the doctor ever know if the sight of the lions slipping in the meat grease upset the cripple at the circus it was one of the few things that always upset the doctor that same monday someone proposed to marry madhu the proposal as was only proper was first offered to mr and mrs das the ringmaster and his wife were surprised not only had they not begun to train the girl but because madhu was untrained she wasnt in evidence among the performers yet the marriage proposal was offered by a gentleman who claimed to have been in the audience for the lateevening show on sunday here he was the following morning professing his instant devotion the bengali ringmaster and his wife had children of their own their kids had rejected the circus life but mr and mrs das had trained many other children to be circus acrobats they were kind to these adopted kids and especially protective of the girls after all when these girls were properly trained they were of some valuenot only to the circus they had acquired a little glamour theyd even earned some money which theyd had no occasion to spendhence the ringmaster and his wife were used to keeping dowries for them mr and mrs das conscientiously advised the girls whether or not a marriage proposal was worthy of acceptance or negotiation and they routinely gave up these adopted daughtersalways to decent marriages and often making their own contributions to the girls dowries in many cases the ringmaster and his wife had grown so fond of these children that it broke their hearts to see them go almost all the girls would eventually leave the circus the few who stayed became trainers madhu was very young and totally unproven and she had no dowry yet here was a gentleman of means well dressed clearly a city personhe owned property and managed an entertainment business in bombayand he was offering madhu a marriage proposal that mr and mrs das found extremely generous he would take the poor girl without a dowry doubtless in these premarital negotiations there would have been some substantive discussion of the remuneration that the ringmaster and his wife deserved for who knows madhu might have become a star of the great blue nile from mr and mrs dass point of view they were offered a sizable payment for a sullen girl who might never prove herself to be any kind of acrobat at all it wasnt as if they were being asked to part with a young woman theyd grown fond of theyd barely had time to talk with madhu it may have crossed the bengalis minds to consult the doctor or the missionary mr and mrs das at least should have discussed the wouldbe marriage with deepa but the dwarfs wife was still sick so what if deepa was the one whod spotted madhu as a future boneless girl the dwarfs wife was still confined to her tent moreover the ringmaster held a grudge against vinod mr das was envious of the dwarfs cardriving business since vinod had left the great blue nile the dwarf hadnt hesitated to exaggerate his success and the ringmasters wife felt herself to be vastly superior to the dwarfs wife to consult with deepa was beneath mrs daseven if deepa were healthy besides mrs das quickly persuaded her husband that madhus marriage proposal was a good deal it was certainly a good deal for them if madhu wasnt interested theyd keep the silly child in the circus but if the unworthy girl had the wisdom to recognize her good fortune the ringmaster and his wife would let her go with their blessings as for the crippled brother the gentleman from bombay appeared to know nothing about him mr and mrs das felt some responsibility for the fact that the elephantfooted boy would be left on his own they had considered it prudent to promise dr daruwalla and martin mills that ganesh would be given every chance to succeed the ringmaster and his wife saw no reason to discuss ganesh with deepa the cripple hadnt been a discovery of hersshed only claimed to discover the boneless girl and what if the dwarfs wife had something contagious a phone call to the doctor or the missionary would have been an appreciated courtesyif nothing more but there were no telephones at the circus a trip to either the post office or the telegraph office would have been required and madhu surprised the ringmaster and his wife by her immediate and unrestrained acceptance of the marriage proposal she didnt feel that the gentleman was too old for her as mr das had feared nor was madhu repelled by the gentlemans physical appearance which had been the primary concern of mrs das the ringmasters wife was repulsed by the gentlemans disfiguring scarsome sort of burn she supposedbut madhu made no mention of it nor did she otherwise seem to mind such a hideous flaw probably sensing in advance dr daruwallas disapproval the ringmaster would wisely send a telegram to martin mills the missionary had struck mr and mrs das as the more relaxed of the twoby which they meant the more accepting furthermore the jesuit had seemed slightly less concerned for madhus prospectsor else the doctors concern had been more apparent and because it was jubilee day at st ignatius the school offices were closed it would be tuesday before anyone handed the telegram to martin mr garg would already have brought his young wife back to the wetness cabaret naturally it was in the bengalis best interests to make his telegram sound upbeat that girl madhu it is being her lucky day very acceptable matrimonial made by middleaged but most successful businessman it is what she is wanting even if she isnt loving him exactly and in spite of his scar meanwhile the cripple is being afforded every opportunity of working hard here rest being assured das by the time dr daruwalla would hear the news the doctor would be kicking himself he should have known all alongfor why else would mr garg have asked ranjit for the address of the great blue nile surely mr garg like dr daruwalla knew that madhu couldnt read acid man had never intended to send the girl a letter and when ranjit gave farrokh the message that garg had requested the circuss address the faithful secretary failed to inform the doctor that garg had also inquired when the doctor was returning from junagadh that same sunday when dr daruwalla left the circus mr garg went there farrokh wouldnt be persuaded by vinods notionthat garg was so smitten by madhu he couldnt let her go maybe mr garg had been unprepared for how much he would miss madhu the dwarf said deepa insisted on the importance of the fact that acid man had actually married madhu surely garg had no intentions of sending the girl back to a brothelnot after hed married her the dwarfs wife would add that perhaps it was madhus lucky day but this particular news wouldnt find its way to dr daruwalla on jubilee day this news would wait waiting with it was worse news ranjit would hear it first and the medical secretary would elect to spare the doctor such bad tidings they were unsuitable tidings for new years day but the busy office of tata two was in full operation on this holiday mondaythere were no holidays for tata two it was dr tatas ancient secretary mr subhash who informed ranjit of the problem the two old secretaries conversed in the manner of hostile but toothless male dogs i am having information for the doctor only mr subhash began without bothering to identify himself then youll have to wait until tomorrow ranjit informed the fool this is mr subhash in dr tatas office the imperious secretary said youll still have to wait until tomorrow ranjit told him dr daruwalla isnt here today this is being important informationthe doctor is definitely wanting to know it as soon as possible mr subhash said then tell me ranjit replied well she is having it mr subhash announced dramatically youve got to be clearer than that ranjit told him that girl madhushe is testing positive for hiv mr subhash said ranjit knew this contradicted the information hed seen in madhus file tata two had already told dr daruwalla that madhus test was negative if the girl was carrying the aids virus ranjit assumed that dr daruwalla wouldnt have allowed her to go to the circus the elisa is being positive and this is being confirmed by western blot mr subhash was saying but dr tata himself told dr daruwalla that madhus test was negative ranjit said that was definitely the wrong madhu old mr subhash said dismissively your madhu is being hivpositive this is a serious mistake ranjit remarked there is being no mistake mr subhash said indignantly this is merely a matter of there being two madhus but there was nothing merely about the matter ranjit transcribed his phone conversation with mr subhash into a neatly typed report which he placed on dr daruwallas desk from the existing evidence the medical secretary concluded that madhu and mr garg might be sharing something a little more serious than chlamydia what ranjit couldnt have known was that mr garg had gone to junagadh and retrieved madhu from the circus probably garg had made his plans to bring the girl back to bombay only after hed been told that madhu was not hivpositivebut maybe not in the world of the wetness cabaret and throughout the brothels in kamathipura a certain fatalism was the norm the news about the wrong madhu would wait for dr daruwalla too what was the point of hurrying evil tidings after all ranjit believed that madhu was still with the circus in junagadh as for mr garg dr daruwallas secretary wrongly assumed that acid man had never left bombay and when martin mills called dr daruwallas office ranjit saw no reason to inform the missionary that madhu was carrying the aids virus the zealot wanted his bandages changed hed been advised by the father rector that clean bandages would be more suitable for the jubilee day celebration ranjit told martin that hed have to call the doctor at home because farrokh was hard at workrehearsing for rahul with john d and old mr sethnajulia took the message she was surprised to hear that dhars twin had been bitten by a presumedtoberabid chimpanzee martin was surprised and his feelings were hurt to hear that dr daruwalla hadnt informed his wife of the painful episode julia graciously accepted the jesuits invitation to the high tea in honor of jubilee day she promised that shed bring farrokh to st ignatius before the start of the festivities so that the doctor would have plenty of time to change martins bandages the scholastic thanked julia but when he hung up the phone he felt overcome by the sheer foreignness of his situation hed been in india less than a week suddenly everything that was unfamiliar was exacting a toll to begin with the zealot had been taken aback by father julians response to his confession the father rector had been impatient and argumentative his absolution had been grudging and abruptand it had been hastily followed by father julians insistence that martin do something about his soiled and bloody bandages but the priest and the scholastic had encountered a fundamental misunderstanding at that point in his confession when martin mills had admitted to loving the crippled boy more than he could ever love the child prostitute father julian had interrupted him and told him to be less concerned with his own capacity for love by which the father rector meant that martin should be more concerned with gods love and gods willand that he should be more humble about his own merely human role martin was a member of the society of jesus and he should behave accordingly he wasnt just another egocentric social workera dogooder who was constantly evaluating criticizing and congratulating himself the fate of these children isnt in your hands father julian told the scholastic nor will one of them suffer more or less because of your love for themor your lack of love for them try to stop thinking so much about yourself youre an instrument of gods willyoure not your own creation this not only struck the zealot as blunt martin mills was confused that the father rector saw the children as already consigned to their fate seemed remarkably calvinistic for a jesuit martin feared that father julian might also be suffering from the influence of hinduism for this notion of the childrens fate had a karmic ring and what was wrong with being a social worker hadnt st ignatius loyola himself been a social worker of unflagging zeal or did the father rector mean only that martin shouldnt take the fate of the circus children too personally that the scholastic had intervened on the childrens behalf did not mean he was responsible for every little thing that might happen to them it was in such a spiritual fog that martin mills took a walk in mazagaon he hadnt wandered far from the mission before he encountered that slum which dr daruwalla had first shown to himthe former movieset slum where his evil mother had fainted when she was stepped on and licked by a cow martin remembered that hed vomited from the moving car at midmorning on this busy monday the slum was teeming but the missionary found that it was better to focus on such abjectness in a microcosmic fashion rather than look up the length of sophia zuber road for as far as he could see martin kept his eyes cast downat his slowly moving feet he never allowed his gaze to wander above ground level most of the slum dwellers were thus cut off at their ankles he saw only the childrens facesnaturally the children were begging he saw the paws and the inquiring noses of scavenging dogs he saw a moped that had fallen or crashed in the gutter a garland of marigolds was entwined on its handlebars as if the moped were being prepared for cremation he came upon a cowa whole cow not just the hooves because the cow was lying down it was hard to navigate around the cow but when martin mills stopped walking even though hed been walking slowly he found himself quickly surrounded it should be stated clearly in every guidebook for touristsnever stand still in a slum the cows long sad dignified face gazed up at him its eyes were rimmed with flies on the cows tawny flank a patch of the smooth hide was abradedthe raw spot was no bigger than a human fist but it was encrusted with flies this apparent abrasion was actually the entrance to a deep hole that had been made in the cow by a vehicle transporting a ships mast but martin hadnt witnessed the collision nor did the milling crowd permit him a comprehensive view of the cows mortal wound suddenly the crowd parted a procession was passingall martin saw was a lunatic mob of flower throwers when the worshipers had filed by the cow lay sprinkled with rose petals some of the flowers were stuck to the wound alongside the flies one of the cows long legs was extended for the animal was lying on its side the hoof almost reached the curb there in the gutter within inches of the hoof but entirely untouched was unmistakably a human turd beyond the serenely undisturbed turd was a vendors stall they were selling something that looked purposeless to martin mills it was a vivid scarlet powder but the missionary doubted that it was a spice or anything edible some of it spilled into the gutter where its dazzling red particles coated both the cows hoof and the human turd that was martins microcosm of india the mortally wounded animal the religious ritual the incessant flies the unbelievably bright colors the evidence of casual human shitand of course the confusion of smells the missionary had been forewarned if he couldnt see beyond such abjectness he would be of scant use to st ignatiusor to any mission in such a world shaken the scholastic wondered if he had the stomach to be a priest so vulnerable was his state of mind martin mills was fortunate that the news about madhu was still a day away take me home in the ladies garden at the duckworth club the noon sun shimmered above the bower so dense was the bougainvillea the sun shot through the flowers in pinholes these beads of bright light dappled the tablecloths like sprinkled diamonds nancy passed her hands under the needlethin rays she was playing with the sun trying to reflect its light in her wedding ring when detective patel spoke to her you dont have to be here sweetie her husband said you can go home you know i want to be here nancy told him i just want to warn youdont expect this to be satisfying the deputy commissioner said somehow even when you catch them its never quite satisfying dr daruwalla who kept looking at his watch then remarked shes late theyre both late nancy said dhar is supposed to be late the policeman reminded her dhar was waiting in the kitchen when the second mrs dogar arrived mr sethna would observe the increasing degrees of her irritation when the steward saw that she was clearly agitated he would send dhar to her table dr daruwalla was operating on the theory that agitation inspired rahul to act rashly but when she arrived they almost didnt recognize her she was wearing what western women familiarly call a little black dress the skirt was short with a slight flare the waist very long and slimming mrs dogars small high breasts were displayed to good effect if shed worn a blacklinen jacket she would have looked almost businesslike dr daruwalla believed without a jacket the dress was more suitable for a cocktail party in toronto as if intended to offend duckworthians the dress was sleeveless with spaghetti straps the brawniness of rahuls bare shoulders and upper arms not to mention the breadth of her chest hulked ostentatiously she was too muscular for a dress like that farrokh decided then it occurred to him that this was what she thought dhar liked yet mrs dogar didnt move as if she were at all conscious that she was a woman of great strength or noticeable size her entry into the duckworth club dining room wasnt in the least aggressive her attitude was shy and girlish rather than stride to her table she allowed old mr sethna to escort her on his armdr daruwalla had never seen her this way this wasnt a woman who would ever pick up a spoon or a fork and ring it against her water glass this was an extremely feminine womanshe would rather starve at her table than cause herself any unflattering attention she would sit smiling and waiting for dhar until the club closed and someone sent her home apparently detective patel was prepared for this change in her because the deputy commissioner spoke quickly to the screenwriter mrs dogar had barely been seated at her table dont bother to keep her waiting the policeman said shes a different woman today farrokh summoned mr sethnato have john d arrivebut all the while the deputy commissioner was watching what mrs dogar did with her purse it was a table for four as the screenwriter had suggested this had been julias idea when there were only two people at a table for four julia said a woman usually put her purse on one of the empty chairsnot on the floorand farrokh had wanted the purse on a chair she put it on the floor anyway detective patel observed dr daruwalla had been unable to prevent julia from attending this lunch now julia said thats because shes not a real woman dhar will take care of it the deputy commissioner said all farrokh could think was that the change in mrs dogar was terrifying it was the murder wasnt it the doctor asked the policeman i mean the murder has totally calmed herits had a completely soothing effect on her hasnt it it appears to have made her feel like a young girl patel replied she must have a hard time feeling like a young girl nancy remarked what a lot to dojust to feel like a young girl then dhar was there at mrs dogars table he didnt kiss her he approached her unseen from behind and he put both his hands on her bare shoulders perhaps he leaned on her because she appeared to stiffen but he was only trying to kick her purse over when he managed to do this she picked her purse up and put it on an empty chair were forgetting to talk among ourselves the deputy commissioner said we cant simply be staring at them and saying nothing please kill her vijay nancy said im not carrying a gun sweetie the deputy commissioner lied what will the law do to her julia asked the policeman capital punishment exists in india the detective said but the death penalty is rarely enacted death is by hanging dr daruwalla said yes but theres no jury system in india patel said a single judge decides the prisoners fate life imprisonment and hard labor are much more common than the death penalty they wont hang her you should kill her now nancy repeated they could see mr sethna hovering around mrs dogars table like a nervous ghost they couldnt see dhars left handit was under the table speculation was rife that his hand was on rahuls thigh or in her lap lets just keep talking patel told them cheerfully fuck you fuck rahul fuck dhar nancy told patel fuck you too she said to farrokh not youi like you she told julia thank you dear julia replied fuck fuck fuck nancy said your poor lip mrs dogar was saying to john d this much mr sethna understood they would understand this much from the ladies garden too because they saw rahul touch dhars lower lip with her long index fingerit was just a brief featherlight touch dhars lower lip was a luminous navy blue i hope youre not in a biting mood today john d told her im in a very good mood today mrs dogar replied i want to know where youre going to take me and what youre going to do to me she said coquettishly it was embarrassing how young and cute she seemed to think she was her lips were pursed which exaggerated the deep wrinkles at the corners of her savage mouth her smile was small and coy as if she were blotting lipstick in a mirror although her makeup mostly concealed the mark there was a tiny inflamed cut across the greentinted eyelid of one of her eyes it caused her to blink as if the eye itself were sore but it was only a small irritation the tiniest scratch it was all that the prostitute named asha had been able to do to herto flick back one hand to poke at rahuls eyemaybe a second or two before rahul broke her neck youve scratched your eye havent you inspector dhar observed but he felt no stiffening in mrs dogars thighs under the table she gently pressed her thighs together on his hand i must have been thinking of you in my sleep she said dreamily when she closed her eyes her eyelids had the silvergreen iridescence of a lizard when she parted her lips her long teeth were wet and shinyher warm gums were the color of strong tea it made john ds lip throb to look at her but he continued to press his palm against the inside of her thigh he hated this part of the script dhar suddenly said did you draw me a picture of what you want he felt the muscles in both her thighs grip his hand tightlyher mouth was also tightly closedand her eyes opened wide and fixed on his lip you cant expect me to show you here mrs dogar said just a peek john d begged her otherwise ill be in too much of a hurry to eat had he not been so easily offended by vulgarity mr sethna would have been in eavesdropper heaven yet the steward was trembling with disapproval and responsibility it struck the old parsi as an awkward moment to bring them the menus but he knew he needed to be near her purse its disgusting how much people eati loathe eating mrs dogar said dhar felt her thighs go slack it was as if her concentration span were shorter than a childsas if she were losing her sexual interest and for no better reason than the merest mention of food we dont have to eat at allwe havent ordered dhar reminded her we could just gonow he suggested but even as he spoke he was prepared to hold her in her chair if need be with his left hand the thought of being alone with her in a suite at either the oberoi or the taj would have frightened john d except that he knew detective patel would never allow rahul to leave the duckworth club but mrs dogar was almost strong enough to stand up despite the downward pressure of dhars hand just one picture the actor pleaded with her just show me something rahul exhaled thinly through her nose im in too good a mood to be exasperated with you she told him but youre a very naughty boy show me dhar said in her thighs he thought he felt those seemingly involuntary shivers that are visible on the flanks of a horse when she turned to her purse john d raised his eyes to mr sethna but the old parsi appeared to be suffering from stage fright the steward clutched the menus in one hand his silver serving tray in the other how could the old fool upend mrs dogars purse if he didnt have a free hand john d wondered rahul took the purse into her lap dhar could feel the bottom of it for it briefly rested on his wrist there was more than one drawing and mrs dogar appeared to hesitate before she withdrew all three but she still didnt show him any of them she held the drawings protectively in her right hand with her left hand she returned her purse to the empty chairthat was when mr sethna sprang into erratic action he dropped the serving tray there was a resounding silvery clatter upon the dining rooms stone floor then the steward stepped on the trayhe actually appeared to trip over itand the menus flew from his hand into mrs dogars lap instinctively she caught them while the old parsi staggered past her and collided with the allimportant chair there went her purse upside down on the floor but nothing spilled out of it until mr sethna clumsily attempted to pick the purse up then everything was everywhere of the three drawings which rahul had left unattended on the table john d could see only the one on top it was enough the woman in the picture bore a striking resemblance to what mrs dogar might have looked like as a young girl rahul had never exactly been a young girl but this portrait reminded john d of how she had looked in goa years ago an elephant was mounting her but this elephant had two trunks the first trunkit was in the usual place for an elephants trunkwas deeply inside the young womans mouth in fact it had emerged through the back of her head the second trunk which was the elephants preposterous penis had penetrated the womans vagina it was this trunk that had burst between the womans shoulder blades approximately at the back of the womans neck john d could see that the elephants two trunks were touching each other the actor could also see that the elephant was winking dhar would never see the other two drawings he wouldnt want to the movie star stepped quickly behind mrs dogars chair and pushed the fumbling mr sethna out of the way allow me dhar said bending to the spilled contents of her purse mrs dogars mood had been so improved by her recent killing she was remarkably unprovoked by the apparent accident oh purses theyre such a nuisance rahul said flirtatiously she allowed her hand to touch the back of inspector dhars neck he was kneeling between her chair and the empty chair he was gathering the contents of her purse which he then put on the table quite casually the actor pointed to the top half of the silver ballpoint pen which hed placed between a mirror and a jar of moisturizer i dont see the bottom half of this the actor said maybe its still in your purse then he handed her the purse which was easily half full and he pretended to look under the table for the bottom half of the silver ballpoint penthat part which nancy had kept so well polished these years when john d lifted his face to her he was still kneeling as such his face was level with her small wellshaped breasts mrs dogar was holding the top half of the pen a rupee for your thoughts said inspector dhar it was something he said in all his movies rahuls lips were parted she looked quizzically down at dharher scratched eye blinking once and then again her lips softly closed and she once more exhaled thinly through her nose as if such controlled breathing helped her to think i thought id lost this mrs dogar said slowly it appears youve lost the other half john d replied he stayed on his knees because he imagined that she liked looking down on him this is the only half i ever had rahul explained dhar stood up and walked behind her chair he didnt want her to grab the drawings when john d returned to his seat rahul was staring at the halfpen you might as well have lost that half john d told her you cant use it for anything but youre wrong mrs dogar cried its really marvelous as a money clip a money clip the actor repeated look here rahul began there was no money among the spilled contents of her purse which john d had spread on the table she had to search in her purse the problem with money clips mrs dogar told him is that theyre conceived for a big wad of money the sort of wad of money that men are always flashing out of their pockets you know yes i know said inspector dhar he watched her fishing in her purse for some smaller bills she pulled out a rupee note and two s and when the actor saw the two rupee notes with the unnatural typing on them he raised his eyes to mr sethna and the old steward began his hurried shuffle across the dining room to the ladies garden look here rahul repeated when you have just a few small notes which most women must carryfor tipping for the odd beggarthis is the perfect money clip it holds just a few notes but quite snugly her voice trailed away because she saw that dhar had covered the drawings with his hand he was sliding the three drawings across the tablecloth when rahul reached out and grabbed his pinky finger which she sharply lifted breaking it john d still managed to pull the drawings into his lap the pinky finger of his right hand pointed straight up as if it grew out of the back of his hand it was dislocated at the big knuckle joint with his left hand dhar was able to protect the drawings from mrs dogars grasp she was still struggling with himshe was trying to get the drawings away from him with her right handwhen detective patel hooked her neck in the crook of his elbow and pinned her left arm behind her chair youre under arrest the deputy commissioner told her the top half of the pen is a money clip said inspector dhar she uses it for small notes when she put the note in mr lals mouth the makeshift money clip must have fallen by the bodyyou know the rest theres some typing on those tworupee notes dhar told the real policeman read it to me patel said mrs dogar held herself very still her free right hand which had ceased struggling with john d for the drawings floated just above the tablecloth as if she were about to give them all her blessing a member no more dhar read aloud that one was for you the deputy commissioner told him because dhar is still a member dhar read who was that one for the policeman asked rahul but mrs dogar was frozen in her chair her hand still conducting an imaginary orchestra above the tablecloth her eyes had never left inspector dhar the top drawing had become wrinkled in the tussle but john d smoothed all three drawings against the tablecloth he was careful not to look at them youre quite an artist the deputy commissioner told rahul but mrs dogar just kept staring at inspector dhar dr daruwalla regretted that he looked at the drawings the second was worse than the first and the third was the worst of all he knew he would go to his grave still thinking of them julia alone had the sense to remain in the ladies garden she knew there was no good reason to come any closer but nancy must have felt compelled to confront the devil herself it would be uncomfortable for her later to recall the last words between dhar and rahul i really wanted youi wasnt kidding mrs dogar said to the actor to dr daruwallas surprise john d said to mrs dogar i wasnt kidding either it must have been hard for nancy to feel that the focus of her victimization had shifted so far from herself it still galled her that rahul didnt remember who she was i was in goa nancy announced to the killer dont say anything sweetie her husband told her say anything you feel like saying sweetie rahul said i had a fever and you crawled into bed with me nancy said mrs dogar appeared to be thoughtfully surprised she stared at nancy as she had previously stared at the top half of the pen her recognition traveling over time why is it really you dear rahul asked nancy but what on earth has happened to you you should have killed me when you had the chance nancy told her you look already dead to me mrs dogar said please kill her vijay nancy said to her husband i told you this wouldnt be very satisfying sweetie that was all the deputy commissioner would say to her when the uniformed constables and the subinspectors came detective patel told them to put away their weapons rahul was not resisting arrest the deep and unknown satisfactions of the previous nights murder seemed to radiate from mrs dogar she was no more violent on this new years monday than whatever brief impulse had urged her to break john ds pinky finger the serial killers smile was serene understandably the deputy commissioner was worried about his wife he told her hed have to go directly to crime branch headquarters but surely she could get a ride home dhars dwarf driver had already made his presence known vinod was prowling the foyer of the duckworth club detective patel suggested that perhaps dhar wouldnt mind taking nancy home in his private taxi not a good idea that was all nancy would say to her husband julia said that she and dr daruwalla would bring nancy home dhar offered to have vinod drive nancy homejust the dwarf alone that way she wouldnt have to talk to anyone nancy preferred this plan im safe around dwarfs she said i like dwarfs when shed gone with vinod detective patel asked inspector dhar how he liked being a real policeman its better in the movies the actor replied in the movies things happen the way they should happen after the deputy commissioner had departed with rahul john d let dr daruwalla snap his pinky finger into place just look awaylook at julia the doctor recommended then he popped the dislocated finger back where it belonged well take an x ray tomorrow dr daruwalla said maybe well splint it but not until its stopped swelling for now keep putting it in ice at the table in the ladies garden john d responded to this advice by submersing his pinky in his water glass most of the ice in the glass had melted so dr daruwalla summoned mr sethna for more because the old parsi seemed deeply disappointed that no one had congratulated him on his performance dhar said mr sethna that was really brillianthow you fell over your own tray for example the distracting sound of the tray itself your particularly purposeful but graceful awkwardness truly brilliant thank you mr sethna replied i wasnt sure what to do with the menus that was brilliant toothe menus in her lap perfect said inspector dhar thank you the steward repeated he went awayhe was so pleased with himself that he forgot to bring the ice no one had eaten any lunch dr daruwalla was the first to confess to a great hunger julia was so relieved that mrs dogar was gone she admitted to having a considerable appetite herself john d ate with them although he seemed indifferent to the food farrokh reminded mr sethna that hed forgotten to bring the ice which the steward finally delivered to the table in a silver bowl it was a bowl that was normally reserved for chilling tiger prawns and the movie star stuck his swollen pinky finger in it with a vaguely mortified expression although the finger was still swelling especially at the joint of the big knuckle dhars pinky was not nearly as discolored as his lip the actor drank more beer than he usually permitted himself at midday and his conversation was entirely concerned with when he would leave india certainly before the end of the month he thought he questioned whether or not hed bother to do his fair share of publicity for inspector dhar and the towers of silence now that the reallife version of the cagegirl killer was captured dhar commented that there might for once be some favorable publicity attached to his brief presence in bombay the more he mused out loud about it the closer dhar came to deciding that there was really nothing keeping him in india from john ds point of view the sooner he went back to switzerland the better the doctor remarked that he thought he and julia would return to canada earlier than theyd planned dr daruwalla also asserted that he couldnt imagine coming back to bombay in the near future and the longer one stayed away well the harder it would be to ever come back julia let them talk she knew how men hated to feel overwhelmed they were really such babies whenever they werent in control of their surroundingswhenever they felt that they didnt belong where they were also julia had often heard farrokh say that he was never coming back to india she knew he always came back the lateafternoon sun was slanting sideways through the trellis in the ladies garden the light fell in long slashes across the tablecloth where the most famous male movie star in bombay entertained himself by flicking stray crumbs with his fork the ice in the prawn bowl had melted it was time for dr and mrs daruwalla to make an appearance at the celebration at st ignatius julia had to remind the doctor that shed promised martin mills an early arrival understandably the scholastic wanted to wear clean bandages to the hightea jubilee his introduction to the catholic community why does he need bandages john d asked whats the matter with him now your twin was bitten by a chimpanzee farrokh informed the actor probably rabid there was certainly a lot of biting going around dhar thought but the events of the day had sharply curtailed his inclination toward sarcasm his finger throbbed and he knew his lip was ugly inspector dhar didnt say a word when the daruwallas left him sitting in the ladies garden the movie star closed his eyes he looked asleep too much beer the everwatchful mr sethna surmised then the steward reminded himself of his conviction that dhar was stricken with a sexually transmitted disease the old parsi revised his opinionhe determined that dhar was suffering from both the beer and the diseaseand he ordered the busboys to leave the actor undisturbed at his table in the ladies garden mr sethnas disapproval of dhar had softened considerably the steward felt bloated with prideto have had his small supporting role called brilliant and perfect by such a celebrity of the hindi cinema but john d wasnt asleep he was trying to compose himself which is an actors nonstop job he was thinking that it had been years since hed felt the slightest sexual attraction to any woman but nancy had aroused himit seemed to him that it was her anger hed found so appealingand for the second mrs dogar john d had felt an even more disturbing desire with his eyes still closed the actor tried to imagine his own face with an ironic expressionnot quite a sneer he was an age when it was unseemly to have ones sexual identity shaken he concluded that it hadnt been mrs dogar whod stimulated him rather hed been reliving his attraction to the old rahulback in those goa days when rahul was still a sort of man this thought comforted john d watching him mr sethna saw what he thought was a sneer on the sleeping movie stars face then something soothing must have crossed the actors mind for the sneer softened to a smile hes thinking of the old days the steward imagined before he contracted the presumed dread disease but inspector dhar had amused himself with a radical idea shit i hope im not about to become interested in women the actor thought what a mess that would make of things at this same moment dr daruwalla was experiencing another kind of irony his arrival at the mission of st ignatius marked his first occasion in christian company since the doctor had discovered whod bitten his big toe dr daruwallas awareness that the source of his conversion to christianity was the love bite of a transsexual serial killer had further diminished the doctors already declining religious zeal that the toebiter had not been the ghost of the pilgrim who dismembered st francis xavier was more than a little disappointing it was also a vulnerable time for father julian to have greeted farrokh as the father rector did ah dr daruwalla our esteemed alumnus have you had any miracles happen to you lately thus baited the doctor couldnt resist rebandaging martin in an eccentric fashion dr daruwalla padded the puncture wound in the scholastics neck so that the bandage looked as if it were meant to conceal an enormous goiter he then rebound the jesuits slashed hand in such a way that martin had only partial use of his fingers as for the halfeaten earlobe the doctor was expansive with gauze and tape he wrapped up the whole ear the zealot could hear out of only one side of his head but the clean bright bandages only served to heighten the new missionarys heroic appearance even julia was impressed and quickly the story circulated through the courtyard at dusk the american missionary had just rescued two urchins from the streets of bombay hed brought them to the relative safety of a circus where a wild animal had attacked him at the fringes of the high tea where dr daruwalla stood sulking he overheard the story that martin mills had been mauled by a lion it was only the scholastics selfdeprecating nature that made him say the biting had been done by a monkey it further depressed the doctor to see that the source of this fantasy was the pianoplaying miss tanuja shed traded her wingtipped eyeglasses for what appeared to be rosetinted contact lenses which lent to her eyes the glowing red bedazzlement of a laboratory rat she still spilled recklessly beyond the confines of her western clothes a schoolgirl voluptuary wearing her elderly aunts dress and she still sported the spearheaded bra which uplifted and thrust forth her breasts like the sharp spires of a fallen church as before the crucifix that dangled between miss tanujas highly armed bosoms seemed to subject the dying christ to a new agonyor such was dr daruwallas disillusionment with the religion hed adopted when rahul bit him jubilee day was definitely not the doctors sort of celebration he felt a vague loathing for such a hearty gathering of christians in a nonchristian country the atmosphere of religious complicity was uncomfortably claustrophobic julia found him engaged in standoffish if not openly antisocial behavior hed been reading the examination scrolls in the entrance hall and had wandered to that spot at the foot of the courtyard stairs where the statue of christ with the sick child was mounted on the wall alongside the fire extinguisher julia knew why farrokh was loitering there he was hoping that someone would speak to him and he could then comment on the irony of juxtaposing jesus with a firefighting tool im going to take you home julia warned him then she noticed how tired he looked and how utterly out of placehow lost christianity had tricked him india was no longer his country when julia kissed his cheek she realized hed been crying please do take me home farrokh told her goodbye bombay well then danny mills died following a new years eve party in new york it was tuesday january before martin mills and dr daruwalla were notified the delay was attributed to the time differencenew york is hours behind bombaybut the real reason was that vera hadnt spent new years eve with danny danny who was almost died alone vera who was didnt discover dannys body until the evening of new years day when vera returned to their hotel she wasnt fully recovered from a tryst with a rising star of a lightbeer commercialan unbefitting fling for a woman her age she doubtless failed to note the irony that danny had died with the do not disturb sign hanging optimistically from their hotelroom door the medical examiner concluded that danny had choked on his own vomit which was like his blood nearly percent alcohol in her two telegrams vera cited no clinical evidence yet she managed to convey dannys inebriation to martin in pejorative terms your father died drunk in a new york hotel this also communicated to her son the sordidness not to mention the inconvenience vera was going to have to spend nearly all of that tuesday shopping coming from californiatheir visit was intended to be shortneither danny nor vera had packed for an extended stay in the january climate veras telegram to martin continued in a bitter vein being catholic although hardly a model of the species im sure danny would have wanted you to arrange some suitable service or last bit or whatever its called hardly a model of the species was the sort of language vera had learned from the moisturizer commercial of her sons longago and damaged youth the last dig was pure veraeven in what passed for grief she took a swipe at her son will of course understand completely if your vow of poverty makes it impossible for you to assist me in this matter mom there followed only the name of the hotel in new york martins vow of poverty notwithstanding vera wasnt offering to pay for his trip with her money her telegram to dr daruwalla was also pure vera i fail to imagine how dannys death should alter your decision to keep martin from any knowledge of his twin so suddenly its my decision dr daruwalla thought please dont upset poor martin with more bad news so now its poor martin who would be upset farrokh observed since martin has chosen poverty for a profession and danny has left me a woman of insufficient means perhaps youll be so kind as to aid martin with the airfare of course its danny who would have wanted him here vera the only good news which dr daruwalla didnt know at the time was that danny mills had left vera a woman of even less means than she supposed danny had bequeathed what little he had to the catholic churchsecure in the knowledge that if hed given anything to martin thats what martin would have done with the money in the end not even vera would consider the amount worth fighting for in bombay the day after jubilee day was a big one for news dannys death and veras manipulations overlapped with mr dass announcement that madhu had left the great blue nile with her new husband both martin mills and dr daruwalla had little doubt that madhus new husband was mr garg farrokh was so sure of this that his brief telegram to the bengali ringmaster was a statement not a question you said that the man who married madhu had a scar acid i presume both the doctor and the missionary were outraged that mr and mrs das had virtually sold madhu to a man like garg but martin urged farrokh not to take the ringmaster to task in the spirit of encouraging the great blue nile to support the efforts of the elephantfooted cripple dr daruwalla concluded his telegram to mr das in junagadh on a tactful note i trust that the boy ganesh will be well looked after he didnt trust he hoped in the light of ranjits message from mr subhash that tata two had given dr daruwalla the hiv test results for the wrong madhu the doctor had sizably less hope for madhu than for ganesh ranjits account of mr subhashs offhand mannerthe ancient secretarys virtual dismissal of the errorwas infuriating but even a proper apology from dr tata wouldnt have lessened the fact that madhu was hivpositive she didnt have aids yet she was merely carrying the virus how can you even think merely cried martin mills who seemed to be more devastated by madhus medical destiny than by the news of dannys death after all danny had been dying for years it was only midmorning martin had to interrupt their phone conversation in order to teach a class farrokh agreed to keep the missionary informed of the days developments the upperschool boys at st ignatius were about to receive a catholic interpretation of graham greenes the heart of the matter while dr daruwalla attempted to find madhu but the doctor discovered that gargs phone number was no longer in service mr garg was lying low vinod told dr daruwalla that deepa had already talked to garg according to the dwarfs wife the owner of the wetness cabaret had complained about the doctor garg is thinking you are being too moral with him the dwarf explained it was not morality that the doctor wanted to discuss with madhu or with garg the doctors disapproval of garg notwithstanding dr daruwalla wanted the opportunity to tell madhu what it meant to be hivpositive vinod implied that any opportunity for direct communication with madhu was unpromising it is working better another way the dwarf suggested you are telling me i am telling deepa she is telling garg garg is telling the girl it was hard for dr daruwalla to accept this as a better way but the doctor was beginning to understand the essence of the dwarfs good samaritanism rescuing children from the brothels was simply what vinod and deepa did with their spare time they would just keep doing itneeding to succeed at it might have diminished their efforts tell garg he was misinformed dr daruwalla told vinod tell him madhu is hivpositive interestingly if garg was uninfected his odds were good he probably wouldnt contract hiv from madhu the nature of hiv transmission is such that its not that easy for a woman to give it to a man depressingly if garg was infected madhu had probably contracted it from him the dwarf must have sensed the doctors depression vinod knew that a functioning good samaritan cant dwell on every little failure we are only showing them the net vinod tried to explain we are not being their wings their wings what wings farrokh asked not every girl is being able to fly the dwarf said they are not all falling in the net it occurred to dr daruwalla that he should impart this lesson to martin mills but the scholastic was still in the process of watering down graham greene for the upperschool boys instead the doctor called the deputy commissioner patel here said the cold voice the clatter of typewriters resounded in the background rising and then falling out of hearing was the mindless revving of a motorcycle like punctuation to their phone conversation there came and went the sharp barking of the dobermans complaining in the courtyard kennel dr daruwalla imagined that just out of his hearing a prisoner was professing his innocence or else declaring that hed spoken the truth the doctor wondered if rahul was there what would she be wearing i know this isnt exactly a crimebranch matter farrokh apologized in advance then he told the deputy commissioner everything he knew about madhu and mr garg lots of pimps marry their best girls detective patel informed the doctor garg runs the wetness cabaret but hes a pimp on the side i just want a chance to tell her what to expect said dr daruwalla shes another mans wife patel replied you want me to tell another mans wife that she has to talk to you cant you ask her farrokh asked i cant believe im speaking to the creator of inspector dhar the deputy commissioner said how does it go its one of my alltime favorites the police dont askthe police arrest or the police harass isnt that the line yes thats how it goes dr daruwalla confessed so do you want me to harass herand garg too the policeman asked when the doctor didnt answer him the deputy commissioner continued when garg throws her out on the street or when she runs away then i can bring her in for questioning then you can talk to her the problem is if he throws her out or she runs away i wont be able to find her from what you say shes too pretty and smart to be a street prostitute shell go to a brothel and once shes in the brothel she wont be out on the street someone will bring her food the madam will buy her clothes and when she gets sick the doctor asked there are doctors who go to the brothels patel replied when she gets so sick that she cant be a prostitute most madams would put her out on the street but by then shell be immune what do you mean immune dr daruwalla asked when youre on the street and very sick everyone leaves you alone when nobody comes near you youre immune the policeman said and then you could find her farrokh remarked then we might find her patel corrected him but by then it would hardly be necessary for you to tell her what to expect so youre saying forget her is that it the doctor asked in your profession you treat crippled childrenisnt that right the deputy commissioner inquired thats right dr daruwalla replied well i dont know anything about your field said detective patel but i would guess that your odds of success are slightly higher than in the redlight district i get your point farrokh said and what are the odds that rahul will hang for a while the policeman was silent only the typewriters responded to the question they were the constant occasionally interrupted by the revving motorcycle or the cacophony of dobermans do you hear the typewriters the deputy commissioner finally asked of course dr daruwalla answered the report on rahul will be very lengthy patel promised him but not even the sensational number of murders will impress the judge i mean just look at who most of the victims werethey werent important you mean they were prostitutes said dr daruwalla precisely patel replied we will need to develop another argumentnamely that rahul must be confined with other women anatomically she is a woman so the operation was complete the doctor interrupted so im told naturally i didnt examine her myself the deputy commissioner added no of course not dr daruwalla said what i mean is rahul cannot be imprisoned with menrahul is a woman the detective said and solitary confinement is too expensiveimpossible in cases of life imprisonment and yet if rahul is confined with women prisoners theres a problem shes as strong as a man and she has a history of killing womenyou see my point so youre saying that she might receive the death penalty only because of how awkward it will be to imprison her with other women farrokh asked precisely patel said thats our best argument but i still dont believe shell be hanged why not the doctor asked almost no one is hanged the deputy commissioner replied with rahul theyll probably try hard labor and life imprisonment then something will happen maybe shell kill another prisoner or bite her dr daruwalla said they wont hang her for biting the policeman said but something will happen then theyll have to hang her naturally this will take a long time farrokh guessed precisely patel said and it wont be very satisfying the detective added that was a theme with the deputy commissioner dr daruwalla knew it led the doctor to ask a different sort of question and what will you doyou and your wife farrokh inquired what do you mean said detective patel for the first time he sounded surprised i mean will you stay herein bombay in india the doctor asked are you offering me a job the policeman replied farrokh laughed well no he admitted i was just curious if you were staying but this is my country the deputy commissioner told him youre the one whos not at home here this was awkward first from vinod and now from detective patel the doctor had learned something in both cases the subject of the lesson was the acceptance of something unsatisfying if you ever come to canada farrokh blurted out i would be happy to be your hostto show you around it was the deputy commissioners turn to laugh its much more likely that ill see you when youre back in bombay patel said im not coming back to bombay dr daruwalla insisted it wasnt the first time hed spoken his thoughts so unequivocally on this subject although detective patel politely accepted the statement dr daruwalla could tell that the deputy commissioner didnt believe him well then patel said it was all there was to say not goodbye just well then not a word martin mills again confessed to father cecil who this time managed to stay awake the scholastic was guilty of jumping to conclusions martin interpreted dannys death and his mothers request that he come to her assistance in new york as a sign after all jesuits are relentless in seeking gods will and martin was an especially zealous example the scholastic not only sought gods will but he too often believed that hed spontaneously intuited what it was in this case martin confessed his mother was still capable of making him feel guilty for he was inclined to go to new york at her bidding martin also confessed that he didnt want to go the conclusion martin then jumped to was that this weaknesshis inability to stand up to verawas an indication that he lacked the faith to become ordained worse the child prostitute had not only forsaken the circus and returned to her life of sin but she would almost certainly die of aids what had befallen madhu was an even darker sign which martin interpreted as a warning that he would be ineffectual as a priest this is clearly meant to show me that i shall be unable to renew the grace received from god in ordination martin confessed to old father cecil who wished that the father rector were hearing this father julian would have put the presumptuous fool in his place how impertinenthow utterly immodestto be analyzing every moment of selfdoubt as a sign from god whatever gods will was father cecil was sure that martin mills had not been singled out to receive as much of it as hed imagined since hed always been martins defender father cecil surprised himself by saying if you doubt yourself so much martin maybe you shouldnt be a priest oh thank you father martin said it astonished father cecil to hear the nowformer scholastic sound so relieved at the news of martins shocking decisionto leave the life as it is called not to be one of ours as the jesuits call themselvesthe father rector was nonplussed but philosophic india isnt for everybody father julian remarked preferring to give martins abrupt choice a secular interpretation blame it on bombay so to speak father julian after all was english and he credited himself with doubting the fitness of american missionaries even on the slim evidence of martin millss dossier the father rector had expressed his reservations father cecil who was indian said hed be sorry to see young martin leave the scholastics energy as a teacher had been a welcome addition to st ignatius school brother gabriel who quite liked and admired martin nevertheless remembered the bloody socks that the scholastic had been wringing in his handsnot to mention the ill take the turkey prayer the elderly spaniard retreated as he often did to his iconcollection room these countless images of suffering which the russian and byzantine icons afforded brother gabriel were at least traditionalthus reassuring the decapitation of john the baptist the last supper the deposition which was the taking of christs body from the crosseven these terrible moments were preferable to that image of martin mills which poor old brother gabriel was doomed to remember the crazed californian with his bloody bandages awry looking like the composite image of many murdered missionaries past perhaps it was gods will that martin mills should be summoned to new york youre going to do what dr daruwalla cried for in the time it had taken the doctor to talk to vinod and detective patel martin had not only given the st ignatius upperschool boys a catholic interpretation of the heart of the matter he had also interpreted gods will according to martin god didnt want him to be a priestgod wanted him to go to new york let me see if i follow you farrokh said youve decided that madhus tragedy is your own personal failure i know the feelingwere both fools and in addition you doubt the strength of your conviction to be ordained because you can still be manipulated by your mother whos made a career out of manipulating everybody so youre going to new yorkjust to prove her power over youand also for dannys sake although danny wont know if you go to new york or not or do you believe danny will know thats a simplistic way to put it martin said i may lack the necessary will to be a priest but i havent entirely lost my faith your mothers a bitch dr daruwalla told him thats a simplistic way to put it martin repeated besides i already know what she is how the doctor was tempted tell himtell him now dr daruwalla thought naturally ill pay you backi wont take the plane ticket as a gift martin mills explained after all my vow of poverty no longer applies i do have the academic credentials to teach i wont make a lot of money teaching but certainly enough to pay you backif youll just give me a little time its not the money i can afford to buy you a plane ticketi can afford to buy you twenty plane tickets farrokh cried but youre giving up your goalthats whats so crazy about you youre giving up and for such stupid reasons its not the reasonsits my doubt martin said just look at me im thirtynine if i were going to be a priest i should have already become one no one whos still trying to find himself at thirtynine is very reliable you took the words right out of my mouth dr daruwalla thought but all the doctor said was dont worry about the ticketill get you a ticket he hated to see the fool look so defeated martin was a fool but he was an idealistic fool the idiots idealism had grown on dr daruwalla and martin was candidunlike his twin ironically the doctor felt hed learned more about john d from martin millsin less than a weekthan hed learned from john d in years dr daruwalla wondered if john ds remoteness his nottherenesshis iconlike and opaque characterwasnt that part of him which was created not upon his birth but upon his becoming inspector dhar then the doctor reminded himself that john d had been an actor before he became inspector dhar if the identical twin of a gay male had a percent chance of being gay in what other ways did john d and martin mills have a percent chance of being alike it occurred to dr daruwalla that the twins had a percent chance of being unalike too nevertheless the doctor doubted that danny mills could be the twins father moreover farrokh had grown too fond of martin to continue to deceive him tell himtell him now farrokh told himself but the words wouldnt come dr daruwalla could say only to himself what he wanted to say to martin you dont have to deal with dannys remains probably neville eden is your father and nevilles remains were settled many years ago you dont have to assist your mother whos worse than a bitch you dont know what she is or all that she is and theres someone you might like to know you might even be of mutual assistance to each other he could teach you how to relaxmaybe even how to have some fun you might teach him a little candormaybe even how not to be an actor at least not all the time but the doctor didnt say it not a word dr daruwalla decides so hes a quitter said inspector dhar of his twin hes confused anyway dr daruwalla replied a thirtynineyearold man shouldnt still be finding himself john d declared the actor delivered the line with almost perfect indignation never hinting that the matter of finding himself was at all familiar to him i think youd like him farrokh said cautiously well youre the writer dhar remarked with almost perfect ambiguity dr daruwalla wondered does he mean that the matter of whether or not they meet is in my hands or does he mean that only a writer would waste his time fantasizing that the twins should meet they were standing on the daruwallas balcony at sunset the arabian sea was the faded purple of john ds slowly healing lower lip the splint on his broken pinky finger provided the actor with an instrument for pointing dhar liked to point remember how nancy responded to this view the actor asked pointing west all the way to iowa the doctor remarked if youre never coming back to bombay farrokh you might give the deputy commissioner and mrs patel this apartment the line was delivered with almost perfect indifference the screenwriter had to marvel at the hidden character hed created dhar was almost perfectly mysterious i dont mean actually give it to themthe good detective would doubtless construe that as a bribe dhar went on but perhaps you could sell it to them for a ridiculous suma hundred rupees for example of course you could stipulate that the patels would have to maintain the servantsfor as long as nalin and roopa are alive i know you wouldnt want to turn them out on the street as for the residents society im sure they wouldnt object to the patelsevery apartment dweller wants to have a policeman in the building dhar pointed his splint west again i believe this view would do nancy some good the actor added i can see youve been thinking about this farrokh said its just an ideaif youre never coming back to bombay john d replied i mean really never are you ever coming back dr daruwalla asked him not in a million years said inspector dhar that old line farrokh said fondly you wrote it john d reminded him you keep reminding me the doctor said they stayed on the balcony until the arabian sea was the color of an overripe cherry almost black julia had to clear the contents of john ds pockets off the glasstopped table in order for them to have their dinner it was a habit that john d had maintained from childhood he would come into the house or the apartment take off his coat and his shoes or sandals and empty the contents of his pockets on the nearest table this was more than a gesture to make himself feel at home for the source lay with the daruwallas daughters when theyd lived at home they liked nothing better than wrestling with john d he would lie on his back on the rug or the floor or sometimes on the couch and the younger girls would pounce on him he never hurt them just fended them off and so farrokh and julia never chastised him for the contents of his pockets which were messily in evidence on the tabletop of every house or apartment theyd ever lived in although there were no children for john d to wrestle with anymore keys a wallet sometimes a passport and this evening on the glasstopped table of the daruwallas marine drive apartment a plane ticket youre leaving thursday julia asked him thursday dr daruwalla exclaimed thats the day after tomorrow actually i have to go to the airport wednesday nightits such an earlymorning flight you know john d said thats tomorrow night farrokh cried the doctor took dhars wallet keys and plane ticket from julia and put them on the sideboard not there julia told him she was serving one of their dinner dishes from the sideboard therefore dr daruwalla carried the contents of john ds pockets into the foyer and placed them on a low table by the doorthat way the doctor thought john d would be sure to see his things and not forget them when he left why should i stay longer john d was asking julia youre not staying much longer are you but dr daruwalla lingered in the foyer he had a look at dhars plane ticket swissair nonstop to zürich flight departing thursday at am it was first class seat b dhar always chose an aisle seat this was because he was a beer drinker on a ninehour flight he got up to pee a lothe didnt want to keep climbing over someone else that quicklyby the time dr daruwalla had rejoined john d and julia and even before he sat down to dinnerthe doctor had made his decision after all as dhar had told him he was the writer a writer could make things happen they were twins they didnt have to like each other but they didnt have to be lonely farrokh sat happily at his supper as he insisted on calling it smiling lovingly at john d ill teach you to be ambiguous with me the doctor thought but what dr daruwalla said was why should you stay any longer indeed nows as good a time to go as any both julia and john d looked at him as if he were having a seizure well i mean ill miss you of coursebut ill see you soon one place or another canada or switzerland im looking forward to spending more time in the mountains you are julia asked him farrokh hated mountains inspector dhar just stared yes its very healthy the doctor replied all that swiss air he remarked absently he was thinking of the airline of that name and how he would buy a firstclass ticket to zürich for martin mills on swissair departing early thursday morning seat a farrokh hoped that the exmissionary would appreciate the window seat and his interesting traveling companion they had a wonderful dinner a lively time normally when dr daruwalla knew he was parting from john d he was morose but tonight the doctor felt euphoric john d has a terrific ideaabout this apartment farrokh told his wife julia liked the idea very much the three of them talked about it at length detective patel was proud so was nancy they would be sensitive if they felt the apartment was offered to them as charity the trick would be to make them think they were doing the daruwallas a favor by looking after and maintaining the old servants the diners spoke admiringly of the deputy commissioner they could have talked for hours about nancyshe was certainly complex it was always easier with john d when the subject of conversation was someone else it was himself as a subject that the actor avoided and the diners were animated in their discussion of what the deputy commissioner had confided to the doctor about rahul the unlikelihood of her hanging julia and john d had rarely seen farrokh so relaxed the doctor spoke of his great desire to see more of his daughters and grandchildren and he kept repeating that he wanted to see more of john din your swiss life the two men drank a lot of beer and sat up late on the balcony they outlasted the traffic on marine drive julia sat up with them you know farrokh i do appreciate everything youve done for me the actor said its been fun the screenwriter replied farrokh fought back his tearshe was a sentimental man he managed to feel quite happy sitting there in the darkness the smell of the arabian sea the fumes of the cityeven the constantly clogged drains and the persistence of human shitrose almost comfortingly around them dr daruwalla insisted on drinking a toast to danny mills dhar politely drank to dannys memory he wasnt your fatherim quite sure of that farrokh told john d im quite sure of that too the actor replied why are you so happy liebchen julia asked farrokh hes happy because hes leaving india and hes never coming back inspector dhar answered the line was delivered with almost perfect authority this was mildly irritating to farrokh who suspected that leaving india and never coming back was an act of cowardice on his part john d was thinking of him as he thought of his twin as a quitterif john d truly believed that the doctor was never coming back youll see why im happy dr daruwalla told them when he fell asleep on the balcony john d carried him to his bed look at him julia said hes smiling in his sleep there would be time to mourn madhu another day there would be time to worry about ganesh the elephant boy too and on his next birthday the doctor would be but right now dr daruwalla was imagining the twins together on swissair nine hours in the air should be sufficient for starting a relationship the doctor thought julia tried to read in bed but farrokh distracted her he laughed out loud in his sleep he must be drunk she thought then she saw a frown cross his face what a shame it was dr daruwalla was thinking he wanted to be on the same plane with themjust to watch them and to listen which seat is across the aisle from b the doctor wondered seat j farrokh had taken that flight to zürich many times it was a the seat across the aisle from b was j he hoped four j he told the flight attendant julia put down her book and stared at him liebchen she whispered either wake up or go to sleep but her husband was once again smiling serenely dr daruwalla was where he wanted to be it was early thursday morning am to be exactand swissair was taking off from sanar across the aisle the twins were staring at each other neither of them could talk it would take a little time for one of them to break the ice but the doctor felt confident that they couldnt maintain their silence for the full nine hours although the actor had more interesting information farrokh bet that the exmissionary would be the one to start blabbing martin mills would blab all night if john d didnt start talking in selfdefense julia watched her sleeping husband touch his belly with his hands dr daruwalla was checking to be sure that his seat belt was correctly fastened then he settled back ready to enjoy the long flight just close your eyes the next day was wednesday dr daruwalla was watching the sunset from his balcony this time with dhars twin martin was full of questions about his plane tickets the screenwriter evaded these questions with the skill of someone whod already imagined the possible dialogue i fly to zürich thats strangethats not the way i came the exmissionary remarked i have connections with swissair farrokh told him im a frequent flyer so i get a special deal oh i see well im very grateful i hear its a marvelous airline the former scholastic said these are firstclass tickets martin suddenly cried i cant repay you for first class i wont allow you to repay me the doctor said i said i have connectionsi get a special deal for first class i wont let you repay me because the plane tickets cost me practically nothing oh i see ive never flown first class the recent zealot said farrokh could tell that martin was puzzling over the ticket for the connecting flight from zürich to new york he would arrive in zürich at in the morning his plane to new york didnt leave zürich until in the afternoona long layover the onetime jesuit was thinking and there was something different about the new york ticket thats an open ticket to new york farrokh said in an offhand manner its a daily nonstop flight you dont have to fly to new york on the day you arrive in switzerland you have a valid ticket for any day when theres an available seat in first class i thought you might like to spend a day or two in zürichmaybe the weekend youd be better rested when you got to new york well thats awfully kind of you but im not sure what id do in zürich martin was saying then he found the hotel voucher it was with his plane tickets three nights at the hotel zum storchena decent hotel farrokh explained your room overlooks the limmat you can walk in the old town or to the lake have you ever been in europe no i havent said martin mills he kept staring at the hotel voucher it included his meals well then dr daruwalla replied since the deputy commissioner had found this phrase so meaningful the doctor thought hed give it a try it appeared to work on martin mills throughout dinner the reformed jesuit wasnt at all argumentative he seemed subdued julia worried that it might have been the food or that dhars unfortunate twin was ill but dr daruwalla had experienced failure before the doctor knew what was bothering the exmissionary john d was wrong his twin wasnt a quitter martin mills had abandoned a quest but hed given up the priesthood when the priesthood was in sightwhen it was easily obtainable hed not failed to be ordained hed been afraid of the kind of priest he might become his decision to retreat which had appeared to be so whimsical and sudden had not come out of the blue to martin his retreat must have seemed lifelong because the security checks were so extensive martin mills was required to be at sanar two or three hours before his scheduled departure farrokh felt it would be unsafe to let him take a taxi with anyone but vinod and vinod was unavailable the dwarf was driving dhar to the airport dr daruwalla hired an alleged luxury taxi from the fleet of vinods blue nile ltd they were en route to sanar when the doctor first realized how much he would miss the exmissionary im getting used to this martin said they were passing a dead dog in the road and farrokh thought that martin was commenting on his growing familiarity with slain animals martin explained that he meant he was getting used to leaving places in mild disgrace oh theres never anything scandalousim never run out of town on a rail he went on its a sort of slinking away i dont suppose im anything more than a passing embarrassment to those people who put their faith in me i feel the same way about myself really theres never a crushing sense of disappointment or of lossits more like a fleeting dishonor im going to miss this moron dr daruwalla thought but what the doctor said was do me a favorjust close your eyes is there something dead in the road martin asked probably the doctor replied but thats not the reason just close your eyes are they closed yes my eyes are closed the former scholastic said what are you going to do he asked nervously just relax farrokh told him were going to play a game i dont like games martin cried he opened his eyes and looked wildly around close your eyes dr daruwalla shouted although his vow of obedience was behind him martin obeyed i want you to imagine that parking lot with the jesus statue the doctor told him can you see it yes of course martin mills replied is christ still there in the parking lot farrokh asked him the fool opened his eyes well i dont know about thatthey were always expanding the capacity of the parking lot martin said there was always a lot of construction equipment around they may have torn up that section of the lotthey might have had to move the statue thats not what i mean close your eyes dr daruwalla cried what i mean is in your mind can you still see the damn statue jesus christ in the dark parking lotcan you still see him well naturallyyes martin mills admitted he kept his eyes tightly closed as if in pain his mouth was shut too and his nose was wrinkled they were passing a slum encampment lit only by rubbish fires but the stench of human feces overpowered what they could smell of the burning trash is that all martin asked eyes closed isnt that enough the doctor asked him for gods sake open your eyes martin opened them was that the gamethe whole game he inquired you saw jesus christ didnt you what more do you want farrokh asked you must realize that its possible to be a good christian as christians are always saying and at the same time not be a catholic priest oh is that what you mean said martin mills well certainlyi realize that i cant believe im going to miss you but i really am dr daruwalla told him i shall miss you too of course dhars twin replied in particular our little talks at the airport there was the usual lineup for the security checks after theyd said their goodbyes they actually embraced dr daruwalla continued to observe martin from a distance the doctor crossed a police barrier in order to keep watching him it was hard to tell if his bandages drew everyones attention or if it was his resemblance to dhar which leaped out at some observers and was utterly missed by others the doctor had once again changed martins bandages the neck wound was minimally covered with a gauze patch and the mangled earlobe was left uncoveredit was ugly but largely healed the hand was still mittened in gauze to everyone who gawked at him the chimpanzees victim winked and smiled it was a genuine smile not dhars sneer yet farrokh felt that the exmissionary had never looked like such a dead ringer for dhar at the end of every inspector dhar movie dhar is walking away from the camera in this case dr daruwalla was the camera farrokh felt greatly moved he wondered if it was because martin more and more reminded him of john d or if it was because martin himself had touched him john d was nowhere to be seen dr daruwalla knew that the actor was always the first to board a planeany planebut the doctor kept looking for him aesthetically farrokh would have been disappointed if inspector dhar and martin mills met in the security lineup the screenwriter wanted the twins to meet on the plane ideally they should be sitting down dr daruwalla thought as he waited in line and then shuffled forward and then waited again martin looked almost normal there was something pathetic about his wearing the tropicalweight black suit over the hawaiian shirt hed surely have to buy something warmer in zürich the expense of which had prompted dr daruwalla to hand him several hundred swiss francsat the last minute so that martin had no time to refuse the money and there was something barely noticeable but odd about his habit of closing his eyes while he waited in line when the line stopped moving martin closed his eyes and smiled then the line would inch forward martin with it looking like a man refreshed farrokh knew what the fool was doing martin mills was making sure that jesus christ was still in the parking lot not even a mob of indian workers returning from the gulf could distract the former jesuit from the lastest of his spiritual exercises the workers were what farrokhs mother meher used to call the persiareturned crowd but these workers werent coming from iran they were returning from kuwaittheir twoinones or their threeinones were blasting in addition to their boom boxes they carried their foam mattresses their plastic shoulder bags were bursting with whiskey bottles and wristwatches and assorted aftershaves and pocket calculatorssome had even stolen the cutlery from the plane sometimes the workers went to omanor qatar or dubai in mehers day the socalled persiareturned crowd had brought back gold ingots in their handsat least a sovereign or two nowadays farrokh guessed they werent bringing home much gold nevertheless they got drunk on the plane but even as he was jostled by the most unruly of these persiareturned people martin mills kept closing his eyes and smiling as long as jesus was still in that parking lot all was right with martins world for his remaining days in bombay dr daruwalla would regret that when he closed his eyes he saw no such reassuring vision no christnot even a parking lot he told julia that he was suffering the sort of recurring dream that he hadnt had since hed first left india for austria it was a common dream among adolescents old lowji had told himfor one reason or another you find yourself naked in a public place long ago farrokhs opinionated father had offered an unlikely interpretation its a new immigrants dream lowji had declared maybe it was farrokh now believed hed left india many times before but this was the first time he would leave his birthplace with the certain knowledge that he wasnt coming back hed never felt so sure for most of his adult life hed lived with the discomfort especially in india of feeling that he wasnt really indian now how would he feel living in toronto with the discomfort of knowing that hed never truly been assimilated there although he was a citizen of canada dr daruwalla knew he was no canadian he would never feel assimilated old lowjis nasty remark would haunt farrokh forever immigrants are immigrants all their lives once someone makes such a negative pronouncement you might refute it but you never forget it some ideas are so vividly planted they become visible objects actual things for example a racial insultnot forgetting the accompanying loss of selfesteem or one of those more subtle anglosaxon nuances which frequently assailed farrokh in canada and made him feel that he was always standing at the periphery this could be simply a sour glancethat familiar dour expression which attended the most commonplace exchange the way they examined the signature on your credit card as if it couldnt possibly comply with your signature or when they gave you back your change how their looks always lingered on the color of your upturned palmit was a different color from the back of your hand the difference was somehow greater than that difference which they took for grantednamely between their palms and the backs of their hands immigrants are immigrants all their lives the first time he saw suman perform the skywalk at the great royal circus farrokh didnt believe she could fall she looked perfectshe was so beautiful and her steps were so precise then one time he saw her standing in the wing of the main tent before her performance he was surprised that she wasnt stretching her muscles she wasnt even moving her feet she stood completely still maybe she was concentrating dr daruwalla thought he didnt want her to notice him looking at herhe didnt want to distract her when suman turned to him farrokh realized that she really must have been concentrating because she didnt acknowledge him and she was always very polite she looked right past him or through him the fresh puja mark on her forehead was smudged it was the slightest flaw but when dr daruwalla saw the smudge he instantly knew that suman was mortal from that moment farrokh believed she could fall after that he could never relax when he saw her skywalkingshe seemed unbearably vulnerable if someone ever were to tell him that suman had fallen and died dr daruwalla would see her lying in the dirt with her puja mark smeared immigrants are immigrants all their lives was this kind of smudge it might have helped dr daruwalla if he could have left bombay as quickly as the twins had left but retiring movie stars and exmissionaries can leave town faster than doctors surgeons have their operating schedules and their recovering patients as for screenwriters like other writers they have their messy little details to attend to too farrokh knew he would never talk to madhu at best he might communicate with her or learn of her condition through vinod or deepa the doctor wished the child might have had the good luck to die in the circus the death hed created for his pinky characterkilled by a lion who mistakes her for a peacockwas a lot quicker than the one he imagined for madhu similarly the screenwriter entertained little hope that the real ganesh would succeed at the circus at least not to the degree that the fictional ganesh succeeds there would be no skywalking for the elephant boy which was a pityit was such a perfect ending if the real cripple became a successful cooks helper that would be ample satisfaction for farrokh to this end he wrote a friendly letter to mr and mrs das at the great blue nile although the elephantfooted boy could never be trained as an acrobat the doctor wanted the ringmaster and his wife to encourage ganesh to be a good cooks helper dr daruwalla also wrote to mr and mrs bhagwanthe knife thrower and his wifeassistant the skywalker perhaps the skywalker would be so kind as to gently disabuse the elephant boy of his silly idea that he could perform the skywalk possibly mrs bhagwan could show ganesh how hard it was to skywalk she might let the cripple try it using the model of that ladderlike device which hung from the roof of her own troupe tent that would show him how impossible skywalking wasit would also be a safe exercise as for his screenplay farrokh had again titled it limo roulette he came back to this title because escaping maharashtra struck him as overoptimistic if not wholly improbable the screenplay had suffered from even the briefest passage of time the horror of acid man the sensationalism of the lion striking down the star of the circus that innocent little girl farrokh feared that these elements echoed a grand guignol drama which he recognized as the essence of an inspector dhar story maybe the screenwriter hadnt ventured as far from his old genre as hed first imagined yet farrokh disputed that opinion of himself which hed read in so many reviewsnamely that he was a deusexmachina writer always calling on the available gods and other artificial devices to bail himself out of his plot real life itself was a deusexmachina mess dr daruwalla thought look at how hed put dhar and his twin togethersomebody had to do it and hadnt he remembered that shiny something which the shitting crow had held in its beak and then lost it was a deusexmachina world still the screenwriter was insecure before he left bombay farrokh thought hed like to talk to balraj gupta the director limo roulette might be only a small departure for the screenwriter but dr daruwalla wanted guptas advice although farrokh was certain that this wasnt a hindi cinema sort of filma small circus was definitely not a likely venue for balraj guptagupta was the only director the screenwriter knew dr daruwalla should have known better than to talk to balraj gupta about arteven flawed art it didnt take long for gupta to smell out the art in the story farrokh never finished with his synopsis did you say a child dies gupta interrupted him do you bring it back to life no farrokh admitted cant a god save the child or something balraj gupta asked its not that kind of filmthats what im trying to tell you farrokh explained better give it to the bengalis gupta advised if its arty realism that youre up to better make it in calcutta when the screenwriter didnt respond balraj gupta said maybe its a foreign film limo rouletteit sounds french farrokh thought of saying that the part of the missionary would be a wonderful role for john d and the screenwriter might have added that inspector dhar the actual star of the hindi cinema could have a dual role the mistakenidentity theme could be amusing john d could play the missionary and he could make a cameo appearance as dhar but dr daruwalla knew what balraj gupta would say to that idea let the critics mock himhes a movie star but movie stars shouldnt mock themselves farrokh had heard the director say it besides if the europeans or the americans made limo roulette they would never cast john d as the missionary inspector dhar meant nothing to europeans or americans they would insist on casting one of their movie stars in that role dr daruwalla was silent he presumed that balraj gupta was angry with him for putting an end to the inspector dhar series he already knew gupta was angry with john d because john d had left town without doing much to promote inspector dhar and the towers of silence i think youre angry with me farrokh began cautiously oh nonot for a minute gupta cried i never get angry with people who decide theyre tired of making money such people are veritable emblems of humanitydont you agree i knew you were angry with me dr daruwalla replied tell me about the love interest in your art film gupta demanded that will make you or break you despite all this other foolishness dead children why not show it to the south indian socialists they might like it dr daruwalla tried to talk about the love interest in the screenplay as if he believed in it there was the american missionary the wouldbe priest who falls in love with a beautiful circus acrobat suman was an actual acrobat not an actress the screenwriter explained an acrobat cried balraj gupta are you crazy have you seen their thighs women acrobats have terrifying thighs and their thighs are magnified on film im talking to the wrong personi must be crazy farrokh replied anyone whod discuss a serious film with you is truly certifiable the telltale word is serious balraj gupta said i can see youve learned nothing from your success have you lost your bananas are you marbles the director shouted the screenwriter tried to correct the directors difficulties with english the phrases are have you lost your marbles and are you bananasi believe dr daruwalla told him thats what i said gupta shouted like most directors balraj gupta was always right the doctor hung up the phone and packed his screenplay limo roulette was the first thing farrokh put in his suitcase then he covered it with his toronto clothes just india vinod drove dr and mrs daruwalla to the airport the dwarf wept the whole way to sahar and farrokh was afraid theyd have an accident the thug driver had lost inspector dhar as a client now in addition to this tragedy vinod was losing his personal physician it was shortly before midnight on a monday evening as if symbolic of dhars last film the posterwallas were already covering over some of the advertisements for inspector dhar and the towers of silence the new posters werent advertising a movie they were proclamations of a different kindcelebratory announcements of antileprosy day that would be tomorrow tuesday january julia and farrokh would be leaving india on antileprosy day at am on air india bombay to delhi delhi to london london to toronto but you dont have to change planes the daruwallas would break up the long flight by staying a few nights in london in the intervening time since dhar and his twin had departed for switzerland dr daruwalla was disappointed to have heard so little from them at first farrokh had worried that they were angry with him or that their meeting had not gone well then a postcard came from the upper engadine a crosscountry skier a langläufer is crossing a frozen white lake the lake is rimmed with mountains the sky cloudless and blue the message in john ds handwriting was familiar to farrokh because it was another of inspector dhars repeated lines in the movies after the cool detective has slept with a new woman something always interrupts them they never have time to talk perhaps a gunfight breaks out possibly a villain sets fire to their hotel or their bed in the ensuing and breathless action inspector dhar and his lover have scarcely a moment to exchange pleasantries theyre usually fighting for their lives but then there comes the inevitable break in the actiona brief pause before the grenade assault the audience already loathing him is anticipating dhars signature remark to his lover by the way he tells her thanks that was john ds message on the postcard from the upper engadine by the way thanks julia told farrokh it was a touching message because both twins had signed the postcard she said it was what newlyweds did with christmas cards and birthday greetings but dr daruwalla said in his experience it was what people did in doctors offices when there was a group gift the receptionist signed it the secretaries signed it the nurses signed it the other surgeons signed it what was so special or touching about that john d always signed his name as just plain d in unfamiliar handwriting on the same postcard was the name martin so they were somewhere in the mountains farrokh hoped that john d wasnt trying to teach his fool twin how to ski at least theyre together and they appreciate it julia told him but farrokh wanted more it almost killed him not to know every line of the dialogue between them when the daruwallas arrived at the airport vinod weepingly handed the doctor a present maybe you are never seeing me again the dwarf said as for the present it was heavy and hard and rectangular vinod had wrapped it in newspapers through his sniffles the dwarf managed to say that farrokh was not to open the present until he was on the plane later the doctor would think that this was probably what terrorists said to unsuspecting passengers to whom theyd handed a bomb just then the metal detector sounded and dr daruwalla was quickly surrounded by frightened men with guns they asked him what was wrapped up in the newspapers what could he tell them a present from a dwarf they made the doctor unwrap the newspapers while they stood at some distance they looked less ready to shoot than to fleeto abscond as the times of india would report the incident but there was no incident inside the newspapers was a brass plaque a big brass sign dr daruwalla recognized it immediately vinod had removed the offensive message from the elevator of farrokhs apartment building on marine drive servants are not allowed to use the lift unless accompanied by children julia told farrokh that vinods gift was touching but although the security officers were relieved they questioned the doctor about the source of the sign they wanted to be sure that it hadnt been stolen from an historically protected buildingthat it was stolen from somewhere else didnt trouble them perhaps they didnt like the message any better than farrokh and vinod had liked it a souvenir dr daruwalla assured them to the doctors surprise the security officers let him keep the sign it was cumbersome to carry it on board the plane and even in first class the flight attendants were bitchy about stowing it out of everyones way first they made him unwrap it again then he was left with the unwanted newspapers remind me never to fly air india the doctor complained to his wife he announced this loudly enough for the nearest flight attendant to hear him i remind you every time julia replied also loudly enough to any fellow firstclass passenger overhearing them they might have seemed the epitome of a wealthy couple who commonly abuse those lesser people whose chore it is to wait on them but this impression of the daruwallas would be false they were simply of a generation that reacted strongly to rudeness from anyonethey were well enough educated and old enough to be intolerant of intolerance but what hadnt occurred to farrokh or julia was that perhaps the flight attendants were ill mannered about stowing the elevator sign not because of the inconvenience but because of the message possibly the flight attendants were also incensed that servants werent allowed to use the lift unless accompanied by children it was one of those little misunderstandings that no one would ever solve it was a suitably sour note on which to leave ones country for the last time farrokh thought nor was he pleased by the times of india with which vinod had wrapped the stolen sign of great prominence in the news lately was the report of food poisoning in east delhi two children had died and eight others were hospitalized after theyd consumed some stale food from a garbage dump in the shakurpur area dr daruwalla had been following this report with the keenest attention he knew that the children hadnt died from eating stale foodthe stupid newspaper meant rotten or contaminated as far as farrokh was concerned the airplane couldnt take off fast enough like dhar the doctor preferred the aisle seat because he planned to drink beer and he would need to pee julia would sit by the window it would be almost in the morning london time before they landed in england it would be dark all the way to delhi literally before he even left the doctor thought hed already seen the last of india although martin mills might be tempted to say that it was gods will that dr daruwalla was saying goodbye to bombay the doctor wouldnt have agreed it wasnt gods will it was india which wasnt for everybodyas father julian unbeknownst to dr daruwalla had said it was not gods will farrokh felt certain it was just india which was more than enough when air india lifted off the runway in sahar dhars thug taxi driver was again cruising the streets of bombay the dwarf was still cryinghe was too upset to sleep vinod had returned to town too late to catch the last show at the wetness cabaret where hed been hoping to get a glimpse of madhu hed have to look for her another night it depressed the dwarf to keep cruising the redlight district although it was a night like any nightvinod might have found and saved a stray at am the dwarf felt that the brothels resembled a failed circus the exclown imagined the cages of lifeless animalsthe rows of tents full of exhausted and injured acrobats he drove on it was almost in the morning when vinod parked the ambassador in the alley alongside the daruwallas apartment building on marine drive no one saw him slip into the building but the dwarf roamed around the lobby breathing heavily until he had all the firstfloor dogs barking then vinod swaggered back to his taxi he felt only mildly uplifted by the insults of the screaming residents whod earlier been disturbed by the report that their allimportant elevator sign had been stolen wherever the sad dwarf drove the life of the city seemed to be eluding him still he wouldnt go home in the predawn light vinod stopped the ambassador to joke with a traffic policeman in mazagaon where is the traffic being vinod asked the constable the policeman had his baton out as if there were a crowd or a riot to direct no one was anywhere around not another car not a single bicycle not one pedestrian of the sidewalk sleepers the few who were awake hadnt risen beyond a sitting position or from their knees the constable recognized dhars thug driverevery policeman knew vinod the constable said thered been a disturbancea religious procession streaming out of sophia zuber roadbut vinod had missed it the abandoned traffic policeman said hed be obliged to the dwarf if vinod would drive him the length of sophia zuber road just to prove that there was no more trouble and so with the lonely constable in the car vinod cautiously proceeded through one of bombays better slums there wasnt much to see more sidewalk sleepers were waking up but the slum dwellers were still sleeping at that part of sophia zuber road where martin mills almost a month ago had encountered the mortally wounded cow vinod and the traffic policeman saw the tail end of a processiona few sadhus chanting the usual flower flingers there was a huge clotted bloodstain in the gutter of the road where the cow had finally died the earlier disturbance the religious procession had been merely the removal of the dead cows body some zealots had managed to keep the cow alive all this time this zeal was also not gods will dr daruwalla would have said this doomed effort was also just india which was more than enough epilogue the volunteer on a friday in may more than two years after the daruwallas had returned to toronto from bombay farrokh felt an urge to show little india to his friend macfarlane they took macs car it was their lunch hour but the traffic on gerrard was so congested they soon realized they wouldnt have much time for lunch they might barely have time to get to little india and back to the hospital theyd been spending their lunch hour together for the past months ever since macfarlane had tested hivpositive macs boyfrienddr duncan frasier the gay geneticisthad died of aids over a year ago as for debating the merits of his dwarfblood project farrokh had found no one to replace frasier and mac hadnt found a new boyfriend the shorthand nature of the conversation between dr daruwalla and dr macfarlane in regard to macs living with the aids virus was a model of emotional restraint how have you been doing dr daruwalla would ask good dr macfarlane would reply im off aztswitched to ddi didnt i tell you nobut why were your t cells dropping kind of mac would say they dropped below two hundred i was feeling like shit on azt so schwartz decided to switch me to ddi i feel betterim more energetic now and im taking bactrim prophylactically to prevent pcp pneumonia oh farrokh would say it isnt as bad as it sounds i feel great mac would say if the ddi stops working theres ddc and many morei hope im glad you feel that way farrokh would find himself saying meanwhile macfarlane would say ive got this little game going i sit and visualize my healthy t cellsi picture them resisting the virus i see my t cells shooting bullets at the virus and the virus being cut down in a hail of gunfirethats the idea anyway is that schwartzs idea dr daruwalla would ask no its my idea it sounds like schwartz and i go to my support group mac would add support groups seem to be one of the things that correlate with longterm survival really farrokh would say really macfarlane would repeat and of course what they call taking charge of your illnessnot being passive and not necessarily accepting everything your doctor tells you poor schwartz dr daruwalla would reply im glad im not your doctor that makes two of us mac would say this was their twominute drill usually they could cover the subject that quicklyat least they tried to they liked to let their lunch hour be about other things for example dr daruwallas sudden desire to take dr macfarlane to little india it had been in may when the racist goons had driven farrokh to little india against his will that had also been a friday a day when much of little india had appeared to be closedor were only the butcher shops closed dr daruwalla wondered if this was because the friday prayers were faithfully attended by the local muslims it was one of those things he didnt know farrokh knew only that he wanted macfarlane to see little india and he had this sudden feeling that he wanted all the conditions to be the samethe same weather the same shops the same mannequins if not the same saris doubtless dr daruwalla had been inspired by something hed read in the newspapers probably something about the heritage front it greatly upset him to read about the heritage frontthose neonazi louts that white supremacist scum since there were antihate laws in canada dr daruwalla wondered why groups like the heritage front were allowed to foment so much racist hatred macfarlane had no difficulty finding a place to park as before little india was fairly desertedin this respect it wasnt like india at all farrokh stopped walking in front of the ahmad grocers on gerrard at coxwell he pointed diagonally across the street to the boardedup offices of the canadian ethnic immigration servicesit looked closed for good not just because it was friday this is where i was dragged out of the car dr daruwalla explained they continued walking on gerrard pindi embroidery was gone but a clothes rack of kaftans stood lifelessly on the sidewalk there was more wind the day i was here farrokh told mac the kaftans were dancing in the wind at the corner of rhodes and gerrard nirma fashions was still in business they noted the singh farm advertising fresh fruits and vegetables they viewed the façade of the united church which also served as the shri ram hindu temple the reverend lawrence pushee minister of the former had chosen an interesting theme for the coming sunday service a gandhi quotation forewarned the congregation there is enough for everyones need but not enough for everyones greed not only the canadian ethnic immigration services but also the chinese were experiencing hard times the luck city poultry company was closed down at the corner of craven and gerrard the indian cuisine specialists formerly the nirala restaurant were now calling themselves hira moti and the familiar advertisement for kingfisher lager promised that the beer was as always instilled with inner strength a megastars poster advertised the arrival of jeetendra and bali of patel rap sapna mukerjee was also performing i walked along here bleeding farrokh said to mac in the window of either kala kendar or sonalis the same blond mannequin was wearing a sari she still looked out of place among the other mannequins dr daruwalla thought of nancy they passed satyam the store for the whole family they read an old announcement for the miss diwali competition they walked up and down and across gerrard with no purpose farrokh kept repeating the names of the places the kohinoor supermarket the madras durbar the apollo video promising asian movies the india theaternow playing tamil movies at the chaat hut farrokh explained to mac what was meant by all kinds of chaats at the bombay bhel they barely had time to eat their aloo tikki and drink their thunderbolt beer before they went back to the hospital the doctors stopped at j s addison plumbing at the corner of woodfield dr daruwalla was looking for that splendid copper bathtub with the ornate faucets the handles were tiger heads the tigers roaringit was exactly like the tub hed bathed in as a boy on old ridge road malabar hill hed had that bathtub on his mind ever since his last unplanned visit to little india but the tub had been sold what farrokh found instead was another marvel of victorian ornamentation it was that same sink spout with tusks for faucets which had captured rahuls imagination in the ladies room of the duckworth club it was that elephantheaded spigot with the water spraying from the elephants trunk farrokh touched the two tusks one for hot water and the other for cold macfarlane thought it was ghastly but dr daruwalla didnt hesitate to buy it it was the product of a recognizably british imagination but it was made in india does it have a sentimental value mac asked not exactly farrokh replied dr daruwalla wondered what hed do with the ugly thing he knew julia would absolutely hate it those men who drove you here and left you mac suddenly said what about them do you imagine that they bring other people herelike they brought you all the time farrokh said i imagine that theyre bringing people here all the time mac thought farrokh looked mortally depressed and told him so how can i ever feel assimiliated dr daruwalla wondered how am i supposed to feel like a canadian farrokh asked mac indeed if one could believe the newspapers there was a growing resistance to immigration demographers were predicting a racist backlash the resistance to immigration was racist dr daruwalla believed the doctor had become very sensitive to the phrase visible minorities he knew this didnt mean the italians or the germans or the portuguese theyd come to canada in the s until the last decade by far the greatest proportion of immigrants came from britain but not now the new immigrants came from hong kong and china and indiahalf the immigrants whod come to canada in this decade were asians in toronto almost percent of the population was immigrantmore than a million people macfarlane suffered to see farrokh so despondent believe me farrokh mac said i know its no circus to be an immigrant in this country and although i trust that those thugs who dumped you in little india have assaulted other immigrants in the city i dont believe that theyre transporting people all over town all the time as you say dont you mean its no picnic you said no circus farrokh told mac its the same expression macfarlane replied do you know what my father said to me dr daruwalla asked could it be immigrants are immigrants all their lives macfarlane inquired ohive already told you farrokh said too many times to count mac replied but i suppose you go around thinking of it all the time all the time farrokh repeated he felt grateful for what a good friend mac was it had been dr macfarlane whod persuaded dr daruwalla to volunteer his time at the aids hospice in toronto duncan frasier had died there farrokh had worked at the hospice for over a year at first he suspected his own motives which hed confessed to mac on macs advice farrokh had also discussed his special interest in the hospice with the director of nursing it had been awkward for farrokh to tell a stranger the story of his relationship with john dhow this young man who was like an adopted son to dr daruwalla had always been a homosexual but the doctor hadnt known it until john d was almost how even now when john ds sexual orientation was plainly clear farrokh and the notsoyoung young man still didnt speak of the matter at least not in depth dr daruwalla told dr macfarlane and the hospices director of nursing that he wanted to be involved with aids patients because he wanted to know more about the elusive john d farrokh admitted that he was terrified for john d that his beloved almostlikeason might die of aids was farrokhs greatest fear yes he was afraid for martin too emotional restraint which was repeatedly demonstrated in dr daruwallas friendship with dr macfarlanetheir understated conversation regarding the status of macfarlanes hivpositive condition was but one exampleprevented farrokh from admitting to his friend that he was also afraid of watching mac die of aids but it was perfectly well understood by both doctors and by the hospices director of nursing that this was another motive underlying farrokhs desire to familiarize himself with the functions of an aids hospice dr daruwalla believed that the more naturally he could learn to behave in the presence of aids patients not to mention gay men the closer his relationship with john d might become theyd already grown closer together ever since john d had told farrokh that hed always been gay doubtless dr daruwallas friendship with dr macfarlane had helped but what father can ever feel close enough to his sonthat was the issue wasnt it farrokh had asked mac dont try to get too close to john d macfarlane had advised remember youre not his fatherand youre not gay it had been awkwardhow dr daruwalla had first tried to fit in at the hospice as mac had warned him he had to learn that he wasnt their doctorhe was just a volunteer he asked lots of doctortype questions and generally drove the nurses crazy taking orders from nurses was something dr daruwalla had to get used to it was an effort for him to limit his expertise to the issue of bedsores he still couldnt be stopped from prescribing little exercises to combat the muscular wasting of the patients he so freely dispensed tennis balls for squeezing that one of the nurses nicknamed him dr balls after a while the name pleased him he was good at taking care of the catheters and he was capable of giving morphine injections when one of the hospice doctors or nurses asked him to he grew familiar with the feeding tubes he hated seeing the seizures he hoped that he would never watch john d die with fulminant diarrhea with an uncontrolled infection with a spiking fever i hope not too mac told him but if youre not prepared to watch me die youll be worthless to me when the time comes dr daruwalla wanted to be prepared usually his voluntary time was spent in ordinary chores one night he did the laundry just as macfarlane had proudly bragged about doing it years earlierall the bed linens and the towels he also read aloud to patients who couldnt read he wrote letters for them too one night when farrokh was working the switchboard an angry woman called she was indignant because shed just learned that her only son was dying in the hospice and no one had officially informed hernot even her son she was outraged she said she wanted to speak to someone in charge she didnt ask to speak to her son dr daruwalla supposed that although he wasnt in charge the woman might as well speak to him he knew the hospice and its rules well enough to advise her how to visitwhen to come how to show respect for privacy and so forth but the woman wouldnt hear of it youre not in charge she kept shouting i want to speak to a doctor she cried i want to talk to the head of the place dr daruwalla was about to tell her his full name his profession his ageeven the number of his children and his grandchildren if she liked but before he could speak she screamed at him who are you anyway what are you dr daruwalla answered her with such conviction and pride that he surprised himself im a volunteer the doctor said the concept pleased him farrokh wondered if it felt as good to be assimilated as it did to be a volunteer the bottommost drawer after dr daruwalla left bombay there were other departures in one case there was a departure and a return suman the skywalker par excellence left the great royal circus she married a man in the milk business then after various discussions with pratap walawalkar the owner suman came back to the great royal bringing her milkbusiness husband with her only recently the doctor had heard that sumans husband had become one of the managers of the great royal circus and that suman was once again walking on the sky she was still very much the star farrokh also learned that pratap singh had quit the great royal the ringmaster and wildanimal trainer had left with his wife sumi and their troupe of child acrobatsthe real pinky among themto join the new grand circus unlike the pinky character in limo roulette the real pinky wasnt killed by a lion who mistook her for a peacock the real pinky was still performing in one town after another she would be or farrokh guessed dr daruwalla had heard that a girl named ratna was performing the skywalk at the new grand remarkably ratna could skywalk backward the doctor was further informed that by the time the new grand circus performed in changanacheri pinkys name had been changed to choti rani which means little queen possibly pratap had chosen the new name not only because choti rani was suitably theatrical but also because pinky was so special to him pratap always said she was absolutely the best just plain pinky was a little queen now as for deepa and shivaji the dwarfs dwarf son they had escaped the great blue nile shivaji was very much vinods son in respect to the dwarfs determination as for shivajis talent the young man was a better acrobat than his fatherand at worst vinods equal as a clown on the strength of shivajis abilities he and his mother had moved to the great royal circus which was unquestionably a move up from the great blue nileand one that deepa never could have made on the strength of her own or vinods talents farrokh had heard that the subtleties of shivajis farting clown actnot to mention the dwarfs signature item which was called elephant dodgingput indias other farting clowns to shame the fate of those lesser performers who toiled for the great blue nile was altogether less kind there would be no escape for them the elephantfooted boy had never been content to be a cooks helper a higher aspiration afflicted him the knife throwers wife mrs bhagwanthe most mechanical of skywalkershad failed to dissuade ganesh from his delusions of athleticism despite falling many times from that model of the ladderlike device which hung from the roof of the bhagwans troupe tent the cripple would never let go of the idea that he could learn to skywalk the perfect ending to farrokhs screenplay is that the cripple learns to walk without a limp by walking on the sky such an ending would not conclude the real ganeshs story the real ganesh wouldnt rest until hed tried the real thing it was almost as dr daruwalla had imagined it almost as it was written but its unlikely that the real ganesh was as eloquent there would have been no voiceover the elephant boy must have looked down at least onceenough to know that he shouldnt look down again from the apex of the main tent the ground was feet below him with his feet in the loops its doubtful that he even thought as poetically as farrokhs fictional character there is a moment when you must let go with your hands at that moment you are in no ones hands at that moment everyone walks on the sky not likelynot a sentiment that would spontaneously leap to the mind of a cooks helper the elephantfooted boy would probably have made the mistake of counting the loops too whether counting or not counting its farfetched to imagine him coaching himself across the ladder what i tell myself is i am walking without a limp that would be the day dr daruwalla thought judging from where they found the cripples body the real ganesh fell when he was less than halfway across the top of the tent there were loops in the ladder the skywalk was steps it was mrs bhagwans expert opinion that the elephant boy had fallen after only four or five steps hed never managed more than four or five steps across the roof of her tent the skywalker said this news came slowly to toronto mr and mrs das conveyed their regrets by letter to dr daruwalla the letter was lateit was misaddressed the ringmaster and his wife added that mrs bhagwan blamed herself for the accident but she also felt certain that the cripple could never have been taught to skywalk doubtless her distress distracted her the next news from mr and mrs das was that mrs bhagwan had been cut by her knifethrowing husband as she lay spreadeagled on the revolving bullseye it wasnt a serious wound but she gave herself no time to heal the following night she fell from the skywalk she was only as far across the top of the tent as ganesh had been and she fell without a cry her husband said that shed been having trouble with the fourth and fifth steps ever since the elephant boy had fallen mr bhagwan wouldnt throw another knife not even when they offered him a choice of targets all of whom were small girls the widower went into semiretirement performing only the elephant passing item there seemed to be some selfpunishment about this elephant actor so the ringmaster confided to dr daruwalla mr bhagwan would lie down under the elephantat first with fewer and fewer mattresses between his body and the elephantwalking plank and between his body and the ground then he did it with no mattresses at all there were internal injuries the ringmaster and his wife implied mr bhagwan became ill he was sent home later mr and mrs das heard that mr bhagwan had died then dr daruwalla heard that theyd all become ill there were no more letters from mr and mrs das the great blue nile circus had vanished their last place of performance was poona where the prevailing story about the blue nile was that they were brought down by a flood it was a small flood not a major disaster except that the hygiene at the circus became lax an unidentified disease killed several of the big cats and bouts of diarrhea and gastroenteritis were rampant among the acrobats just that quickly the great blue nile was gone had gautams death been a harbinger the old chimpanzee had died of rabies not two weeks after hed bitten martin mills kunals efforts to discipline the ape by beating him had been wasted but among them all dr daruwalla mainly remembered mrs bhagwanher tough feet and her long black shiny hair the death of the elephant boy a cripple no more destroyed a small but important part of farrokh what happened to the real ganesh had an immediate and diminishing effect on the screenwriters already waning confidence in his powers of creation the screenplay of limo roulette had suffered from comparisons to real life in the end the real ganeshs remark rang truest you cant fix what elephants do the cripple had said like mr bhagwan who had retreated into elephant passing which led to his death the screenplay of limo roulette went into radical retirement it occupied the bottommost drawer in dr daruwallas desk at home he wouldnt keep a copy in his office at the hospital if he were to die suddenly he wouldnt have wanted anyone but julia to discover the unproduced screenplay the single copy was in a folder marked property of inspector dhar for it was farrokhs conviction that only john d would one day know what to do with it doubtless there would be compromises required in order for limo roulette to be produced there were always compromises in the movie business someone would say that the voiceover was emotionally distancingthat was the fashionable opinion of voiceover someone would complain about the little girl being killed by the lion couldnt pinky be confined to a wheelchair but happy for the rest of the movie and despite what had happened to the real ganesh the screenwriter loved the ending as it was written someone would want to tamper with that ending which dr daruwalla could never allow the doctor knew that limo roulette would never be as perfect as it was in those days when he was writing it and he imagined that he was a better writer than he was it was a deep drawer for a mere pages as if to keep the abandoned screenplay company farrokh filled the drawer with photographs of chromosomes ever since duncan frasier had died dr daruwallas dwarfblood project had passed beyond languishingthe doctors enthusiasm for drawing blood from dwarfs was as dead as the gay geneticist if anything or anyone were to tempt dr daruwalla to return to india this time the doctor couldnt claim that the dwarfs were bringing him back from time to time dr daruwalla would read that perfect ending to limo roulettewhen the cripple walks on the skyfor only by this artificial means could the doctor keep the real ganesh alive the screenwriter loved that moment after the skywalk when the boy is descending on the dental trapeze spinning in the spotlight as the gleaming sequins on his singlet throw back the light farrokh loved how the cripple never touches the ground how he descends into prataps waiting arms and how pratap holds the boy up to the cheering crowd then pratap runs out of the ring with ganesh in his arms because after a cripple has walked on the sky no one should see him limp it could have worked the screenwriter thought it should have worked dr daruwalla was he was reasonably healthy his weight was a small problem and hed done little to rid his diet of admitted excesses but the doctor nevertheless expected to live for another decade or two john d might well be in his sixties by the time limo roulette was put into the actors hands the former inspector dhar would know for whom the part of the missionary had been intended the actor would also be relatively free of any personal attachments to the story or its characters if certain compromises were necessary in order to produce limo roulette john d would be able to look at the screenplay objectively dr daruwalla had no doubt that the exinspector dhar would know what to do with the material but for nowfor the rest of his life farrokh knewthe story belonged in the bottommost drawer sort of fading now almost three years after he left bombay the retired screenwriter read about the destruction of the mosque of babar the unending hostilities hed once mocked in inspector dhar and the hanging mali had turned uglier still fanatical hindus had destroyed the thcentury babri mosque rioting had left more than deadprime minister rao called for shooting rioters on sight both in bhopal and in bombay hindu fundamentalists werent pleased by mr raos promise to rebuild the mosque these fanatics continued to claim that the mosque had been built on the birthplace of the hindu god ramatheyd already begun building a temple to rama at the site of the destroyed mosque the hostilities would go on and on dr daruwalla knew the violence would endure it was always what lasted longest and although madhu would never be found detective patel would keep inquiring for the girl the child prostitute would be a woman nowif she was still managing to live with the aids virus which was unlikely if we crash do we burn or fly apart in little pieces madhu had asked dr daruwalla something will get me shed told the doctor farrokh couldnt stop imagining her he was always envisioning madhu with mr garg they were traveling together from junagadh to bombay escaping the great blue nile although it would have been considered highly disgraceful they would probably have been touching each other not even secretlysecure in the misinformation that all that was wrong with them was a case of chlamydia and almost as the deputy commissioner had predicted the second mrs dogar would be unable to resist the terrible temptations that presented themselves to her in her confinement with women she bit off a fellow prisoners nose in the course of the subsequent and extremely hard labor to which rahul was then subjected she would rebel it would be unnecessary to hang her for she was beaten to death by her guards in another of lifes little passages ranjit would both retire and remarry dr daruwalla had never met the woman whose matrimonial advertisement in the times of india finally snared his faithful medical secretary however the doctor had read the adranjit sent it to him an attractive woman of indeterminate ageinnocently divorced without issueseeks a mature man preferably a widower neatness and civility still count indeed they do the doctor thought julia joked that ranjit had probably been attracted to the womans punctuation other couples came and went but the nature of couples like violence would endure even little amy sorabjee had married god help her husband and although mrs bannerjee had died mr bannerjee wasnt a widower for long he married the widow lal of these unsavory couplings of course the unchanging mr sethna steadfastly disapproved however set in his ways the old steward still ruled the duckworth club dining room and the ladies garden with a possessiveness that was said to be enhanced by his newly acquired sense of himself as a promising actor dr sorabjee wrote to dr daruwalla that mr sethna had been seen addressing himself in the mensroom mirrorlong monologues of a thespian nature and the old steward was observed to be slavishly devoted to deputy commissioner patel if not to the big blond wife who went everywhere with the esteemed detective apparently the famous teapouring parsi also fancied himself a promising policeman crimebranch investigation was no doubt perceived by mr sethna as a heightened form of eavesdropping astonishingly the old steward appeared to approve of something the unorthodoxy of the deputy commissioner and his american wife becoming members of the duckworth club didnt bother mr sethna it bothered many an orthodox duckworthian clearly the deputy commissioner hadnt waited years for his membership although detective patel satisfied the requirement for community leadership his instant acceptance at the club suggested that someone had bent the rulessomeone had been looking for and had found a loophole to many duckworthians the policemans membership amounted to a miracle it was also considered a scandal it was a minor miracle in detective patels opinion that no one was ever bitten by the escaped cobras in mahalaxmi for according to the deputy commissioner those cobras had been assimilated into the life of bombay without a single reported bite it wasnt even a minor miracle that the phone calls from the woman who tried to sound like a man continuednot only after rahuls imprisonment but also after her death it strangely comforted dr daruwalla to know that the caller had never been rahul every time as if reading from a script the caller would leave nothing out your fathers head was off completely off i saw it sitting on the passenger seat before flames engulfed the car farrokh had learned how to interrupt the unslackening voice i knowi know already dr daruwalla would say and his hands couldnt let go of the steering wheel even though his fingers were on fireis that what youre going to tell me ive already heard it but the voice never relented i did it i blew his head off i watched him burn said the woman who tried to sound like a man and im telling you he deserved it your whole family deserves it oh fuck you farrokh had learned to say although he generally disliked such language sometimes he would watch the video of inspector dhar and the cagegirl killer that was farrokhs favorite or inspector dhar and the towers of silence which the former screenwriter believed was the most underrated of the dhar films but to his best friend mac farrokh would never confide that hed written anythingnot a word inspector dhar was part of the doctors past john d had almost completely let dhar go dr daruwalla had to keep trying for three years the twins had teased him neither john d nor martin mills would tell dr daruwalla what had passed between them on their flight to switzerland while the doctor sought clarification the twins deliberately confused him they must have done it to exasperate himfarrokh was such a lot of fun when he was exasperated the former inspector dhars most irritating and least believable response was i dont remember martin mills claimed to remember everything but martin never told the same story twice and when john d did admit to remembering something the actors version unfailingly contradicted the exmissionarys lets try to begin at the beginning dr daruwalla would say im interested in that moment of recognition the realization that you were facetoface with your second selfso to speak i boarded the plane first both twins would tell him i always do the same thing whenever i leave india the retired inspector dhar insisted i find my seat and get my little complimentary toilet kit from the flight attendant then i go to the lavatory and shave off my mustache while theyre still boarding the plane this much was true it was what john d did to undhar himself this was an established fact one of the few that farrokh could cling to both twins were mustacheless when they met i was sitting in my seat when this man came out of the lavatory and i thought i recognized him martin said you were looking out the window john d declared you didnt turn to look at me until id sat down beside you and had spoken your name you spoke his name dr daruwalla always asked of course i knew who he was instantly the exinspector dhar would reply i thought to myself farrokh must imagine hes awfully cleverwriting a script for everyone he never spoke my name martin told the doctor i remember thinking that he was satan and that satan had chosen to look like me to take my own formwhat a horror i thought you were my dark side my evil half your smarter half you mean john d would invariably reply he was just like the devil he was frighteningly arrogant martin told farrokh i simply told him that i knew who he was john d argued you said nothing of the kind martin interjected you said fasten your fucking seat belt pal because are you ever in for a surprise that sounds like what youd say farrokh told the former dhar i couldnt get a word in edgewise john d complained here i knew all about him but he was the one who wouldnt stop talking all the way to zürich he never shut up dr daruwalla had to admit that this sounded like what martin mills would do i kept thinking this is satan i give up the idea of the priesthood and i meet the devilin first class he had this constant sneer martin said it was a satanic sneeror so i thought he started right out about vera our sainted mother john d related we were still crossing the arabian seautter darkness above and below uswhen he got to the part about the roommates suicide i hadnt said a word thats not truehe kept interrupting me martin told farrokh he kept asking me are you gay or do you just not know it yet honestly i thought he was the rudest man id ever met listen to me the actor said you meet your twin brother on an airplane and you start right out with a list of everyone your mothers slept with and you think im rude you called me a quitter before wed even reached our cruising altitude martin said but you must have started by telling him that you were his twin farrokh said to john d he did nothing of the kind said martin mills he said you already know the bad news your father died now heres the good news he wasnt your father you didnt dr daruwalla said to john d i cant remember the actor would say the word twinjust tell me who said it first the doctor asked i asked the flight attendant if she saw any resemblance between usshe was the first to say the word twin john d replied thats not exactly how it happened martin argued what he said to the flight attendant was we were separated at birth try to guess which one of us has had the better time he simply exhibited all the common symptoms of denial john d would respond he kept asking me if i had proof that we were related he was utterly shameless martin told farrokh he said you cant deny that youve had at least one homosexual infatuationtheres your proof that was bold of you the doctor told john d actually theres only a fiftytwo percent chance i knew he was gay the second i saw him the retired movie star said but when did you realize how much else you had in common dr daruwalla asked when did you begin to recognize the traits you shared when did your obvious similarities emerge oh long before we got to zürich martin answered quickly what similarities john d asked thats what i mean by arroganthes arrogant and rude martin told farrokh and when did you decide not to go to new york the doctor asked the exmissionary dr daruwalla was especially interested in the part of the story where the twins told vera off we were working on our telegram to the bitch before we landed john d replied but what did the telegram say farrokh asked i dont remember john d would always answer of course you remember cried martin mills you wrote it he wouldnt let me write a word of the telegram martin told dr daruwalla he said he was in the business of onelinershe insisted on doing it himself what you wanted to say to her wouldnt have fit in a telegram john d reminded his twin what he said to her was unspeakably cruel i couldnt believe how cruel he could be and he didnt even know her martin mills told the doctor he asked me to send the telegram he had no second thoughts john d told farrokh but what was it that you said what did the damn telegram say dr daruwalla cried it was unspeakably cruel martin repeated she had it coming and you know it said the exinspector dhar whatever the telegram said dr daruwalla knew that vera didnt live very long after she received it there was only her hysterical phone call to farrokh who was still in bombay vera called the doctors office and left a message with ranjit this is veronica rosethe actress she told dr daruwallas secretary ranjit knew who she was he would never forget typing the report on the problem vera had with her knees which turned out to be gynecologicalvaginal itching dr lowji daruwalla had said tell the fucking doctor i know that he betrayed me vera said to ranjit is it your knees again the old secretary had asked her dr daruwalla never returned her call vera never made it back to california before she died her death was related to the sleeping pills she regularly took which shed irregularly mixed with vodka martin would stay in europe switzerland suited him he said and the outings in the alpsalthough the former scholastic had never been athletically inclined these outings with john d were wonderful for martin mills he couldnt be taught to downhillski he was too uncoordinated but he liked crosscountry skiing and hiking he loved being with his brother even john d admitted albeit belatedly that they loved being with each other the exmissionary kept himself busy he taught at city university in the generalstudies program and at the american international school of zürichhe was active at the swiss jesuit centre too occasionally he would travel to other jesuit institutions there were youth centers and students homes in basel and bern and adulteducation centers in fribourg and bad schönbrunnmartin mills was doubtless effective as an inspirational speaker farrokh could only imagine that this meant more christintheparkinglot sermonizing the former zealot hadnt lost his energy for improving the attitudes of others as for john d he continued in his craft the journeyman actor was content with his roles at the schauspielhaus zürich his friends were in the theater or affiliated with the university or with a publishing firm of excellent reputationand of course he saw a great deal of farrokhs brother jamshed and jamsheds wife and julias sister josefine it was to this social circle that john d would introduce his twin an oddity at firsteveryone is interested in a twinsseparatedatbirth storymartin made many friends in this community in three years the exmissionary probably had more friends than the actor in fact martins first lover was an exboyfriend of john ds which dr daruwalla found strange the twins made a joke of itprobably to exasperate him the doctor thought as for lovers matthias frei died the onetime terror of the zürich avantgarde had been john ds longstanding partner it was julia who informed farrokh of this shed known for quite some time that john d and frei were a couple frei didnt die of aids did he the doctor asked his wife she gave him the same sort of look that john d would have given him it was that smile from movie posters of faded memory recalling the cutting sneer of inspector dhar no frei didnt die of aidshe had a heart attack julia told her husband no one ever tells me anything the doctor thought it was just like that twinly conversation on swissair bombay to zürich which would occupy a sizable part of farrokhs imagination largely because john d and martin mills were so secretive about it now listen to me both of you dr daruwalla would tell the twins im not prying i do respect your privacyits just that you know how much dialogue interests me this feeling of closeness between you for its obvious to me that the two of you are close did it come from your very first meeting it must have happened on the plane theres surely something more between you than your mutual hatred of your late motheror did the telegram to vera really bring you together the telegram wasnt dialoguei thought you were interested only in our dialogue john d replied such a telegram would never have occurred to me said martin mills i couldnt get a word in edgewise john d repeated we didnt have any dialogue martin had one monologue after another hes an actor all right martin told farrokh i know he can create a character as they say but im telling you i was convinced he was satani mean the real thing nine hours is a long time to talk with anyone john d was fond of saying the flight was nearly nine hours and fifteen minutes to be more exact martin corrected him the point is i was dying to get off the plane john d told dr daruwalla he kept telling me it was gods will that we met i thought i was going to go mad the only time i could get away from him was when i went to the lavatory you practically lived in the lavatory you drank so much beer and it was gods willyou see that now dont you martin asked john d it was farrokhs will john d replied you really are the devil martin told his twin no both of you are the devil dr daruwalla told them although he would discover that he loved themif never quite equally he looked forward to seeing them and to their letters or their calls martin wrote lengthy letters john d seldom wrote letters but he called frequently sometimes when he called it was hard to know what he wanted occasionally not often it was hard to know who was callingjohn d or the old inspector dhar hi its me he said to farrokh one morning he sounded smashed it would have been early afternoon in zürich john d said hed just had a foolish lunch when the actor called his lunch or dinner foolish it usually meant that hed had something stronger to drink than beer only two glasses of wine made him drunk i hope youre not performing tonight dr daruwalla said regretting that he sounded like an overcritical father its my understudys night to perform the actor told him farrokh knew very little about the theater he hadnt known that there were understudies at the schauspielhausalso he was sure that john d was currently playing a small supporting role its impressive that you have an understudy for such a little part the doctor said cautiously my understudy is martin the twin confessed we thought wed try itjust to see if anyone noticed once again farrokh sounded like an overcritical father you should be more protective of your career than that dr daruwalla chided john d martin can be a clod what if he cant act at all he could completely embarrass you weve been practicing said the old inspector dhar and i suppose youve been posing as him farrokh remarked lectures on graham greene no doubtmartins favorite catholic interpretation and a few inspirational speeches at those jesuit centersa jesus in every parking lot more than enough christs to go around that kind of thing yes john d admitted its been fun you should be ashamedboth of you dr daruwalla cried you put us together john d replied nowadays farrokh knew the twins were much more alike in their appearance john d had lost a little weight martin had put the pounds onincredibly the former jesuit was going to a gym they also cut their hair the same way having been separated for years the twins took being identical somewhat seriously then there was that particularly transatlantic silence with a rhythmic bleepinga sound that seemed to count the time and john d remarked so its probably sunset there when john d said there he meant bombay counting hours dr daruwalla figured that it would be more or less sunset ill bet shes on the balcony just watching john d went on what do you bet dr daruwalla knew that the exinspector dhar was thinking of nancy and her view to the west i guess its about that time the doctor answered carefully its probably too early for the good policeman to be home john d continued shes all alone but ill bet shes on the balconyjust watching yesprobably dr daruwalla said want to bet john d asked why dont you call her and see if shes there you can tell by how long it takes her to get to the phone why dont you call her farrokh asked i never call nancy john d told him shed probably enjoy hearing from you farrokh lied no she wouldnt john d said but ill bet you anything shes on the balcony go on and call her i dont want to call her dr daruwalla cried but i agree with youshes probably on the balcony so you win the bet or theres no bet shes on the balcony just leave it at that where else would nancy be the doctor wondered he was quite sure john d was drunk please call her please do it for me farrokh john d said to him there wasnt much to it dr daruwalla called his former marine drive apartment the phone rang and rang it rang so long the doctor almost hung up then nancy picked up the phone there was her defeated voice expecting nothing the doctor chatted aimlessly for a while he pretended that the call was of no importancejust a whim vijay wasnt yet back from crime branch headquarters nancy informed him they would have dinner at the duckworth club but a bit later than usual she knew thered been another bombing but she didnt know the details is there a nice sunset farrokh asked oh yes sort of fading now nancy told him well ill let you get back to it he told her a little too heartily then he called john d and told him that shed definitely been on the balcony farrokh repeated nancys remark about the sunsetsort of fading now the retired inspector dhar kept saying the line he wouldnt stop practicing the phrase until dr daruwalla assured him that he had it rightthat he was saying it precisely as nancy had said it he really is a good actor the former screenwriter thought it was impressive how closely john d could imitate the exact degree of deadness in nancys voice sort of fading now john d kept saying hows that thats ityouve got it farrokh told him sort of fading now john d repeated is that better yes thats perfect dr daruwalla said sort of fading now said the actor stop it the exscreenwriter said allowed to use the lift at last as a former guest chairman of the membership committee dr daruwalla knew the rules of the duckworth club the year waiting list for applicants was inviolable the death of a duckworthianfor example mr dogars fatal stroke which followed fast upon the news that the second mrs dogar had been beaten to death by her guardsdid not necessarily speed up the process of membership the membership committee never crassly viewed a fellow duckworthians death as a matter of making room not even the death of mr dua would make room for a new member and mr dua was sorely missed his deafness in one ear was legendarythe nevertobeforgotten tennis injury the senseless blow from the flung racket of his doubles partner whod doublefaulted dead at last poor mr dua was deaf in both ears now yet not one new membership came of it however farrokh knew that not even the rules of the duckworth club were safe from a single most interesting loophole it was stated that upon the formal resignation of a duckworthian as distinct from a duckworthians demise a new member could be spontaneously appointed to take the resigning members place such an appointment circumvented the normal process of nomination and election and the year waiting list had this exception to the rules been overused it doubtless would have been criticized and eliminated but duckworthians didnt resign even when they moved away from bombay they paid their dues and retained their membership duckworthians were duckworthians forever three years after he left indiafor good or so hed saiddr daruwalla still faithfully paid his dues to the duckworth club even in toronto the doctor read the clubs monthly newsletter but john d did the unexpected unheardof unduckworthian thing he resigned his membership deputy commissioner patel was spontaneously appointed in the retired inspector dhars stead the former movie star was replaced by the real policeman who all agreed had distinguished himself in community leadership if there were objections to the big blond wife who went everywhere with the esteemed detective these objections were never too openly expressed although mr sethna was committed to remembering nancys furry navel and the day shed stood on a chair and reached into the mechanism of the ceiling fannot to mention the night shed danced with dhar and left the club in tears or the day after when shed left the club in anger with dhars dwarf dr daruwalla would learn that detective patel and nancy were controversial additions to the duckworth club but the old club the doctor knew was just one more oasisa place where nancy might hope to contain herself and where the deputy commissioner could indulge in a brief respite from the labors of his profession this was how farrokh preferred to think of the patelsrelaxing in the ladies garden watching a slower life go by than the life theyd lived they deserved a break didnt they and although it had taken three years the swimming pool was finally finished in the hottest months before the monsoon the pool would be nice for nancy it was never acknowledged that john d had played the role of the patels benefactor or the part of nancys guardian angel but not only had john ds resignation from the duckworth club provided a membership for the patels it had been john ds idea that the view from the daruwallas balcony would do nancy some good without questioning the doctors motives the patels had moved into the marine drive apartmentostensibly to look after the aged servants in one of several flawlessly typed letters deputy commissioner patel wrote to dr daruwalla that although the offensive elevator sign had not been replacedthat is after it was stolen a second timethe daruwallas ancient servants nevertheless continued to struggle up and down the stairs the old rules had penetrated nalin and roopa the rules were permanently in placethey would outlive any sign the servants themselves refused to ride in the lift their tragic preconditioning couldnt be helped the policeman expressed a deeper sympathy for the thief the residents society had assigned the task of catching the culprit to detective patel the deputy commissioner confided to dr daruwalla that he wasnt making much progress in solving the case but that he suspected the second thief was nancynot vinod as for the continued disruption to the building that was caused by the firstfloor dogs this always happened at an ungodly hour of the early morning the firstfloor residents claimed that the dogs were deliberately incited to bark by a familiar violentlooking dwarf taxi driverformerly a chauffeur for dr daruwalla and the retired inspector dharbut detective patel was inclined to lay the blame on various stray beggars off chowpatty beach even after a lock was fashioned for the lobby door the dogs were occasionally driven insane and the firstfloor residents insisted that the dwarf had managed to gain unlawful entrance to the lobby several of them said theyd seen an offwhite ambassador driving away but these allegations were discounted by the deputy commissioner for the firstfloor dogs were barking in may of more than a month after those bombay bombings that killed more than people vinod among them the dogs were still barking detective patel wrote to dr daruwalla it was vinods ghost who was disturbing them farrokh felt certain on the door of the downstairs bathroom in the daruwallas house on russell hill road there hung the sign that the dwarf had stolen for them it was a big hit with their friends in toronto servants are not allowed to use the lift unless accompanied by children in retrospect it seemed cruel that the exclown had survived the terrible teeterboard accident at the great blue nile it appeared that the gods had toyed with vinods fatethat hed been launched by an elephant into the bleachers and had risen to a kind of local stardom in the privatetaxi business seemed trivial and that the dwarf had come to the rescue of martin mills whod fallen among those unusually violent prostitutes seemed merely mockheroic now it struck dr daruwalla as completely unfair that vinod had been blown up in the bombing of the air india building on the afternoon of march a car bomb exploded on the exit ramp of the driveway not far from the offices of the bank of oman people were killed on the street others were killed in the bank which occupied that part of the air india building nearest the site of the explosion the bank of oman was demolished probably vinod was waiting for a passenger who was doing business in the bank the dwarf had been sitting at the wheel of his taxi which was unfortunately parked next to the vehicle containing the car bomb only deputy commissioner patel was capable of explaining why so many squashracquet handles and old tennis balls were scattered all over the street there was a clock on the air india hoarding the billboard above the building for two or three days after the bombing the time was stuck at strangely dr daruwalla would wonder if vinod had noticed the time the deputy commissioner implied that the dwarf had died instantly patel reported that the pitiful assets of vinods blue nile ltd would scarcely provide for the dwarfs wife and son but shivajis success at the great royal circus would take care of the young dwarf and his mother and deepa had earlier been left a sizable inheritance to her surprise shed been more than mentioned in mr gargs will acid man had died of aids within a year of the daruwallas departure from bombay the holdings of the wetness cabaret had been huge in comparison to those of vinods blue nile ltd the size of deepas share of the strip joint had been sufficient to close the cabaret down exotic dancing had never meant actual strippingreal strip joints werent allowed in bombay what passed for exotic dancing at the wetness cabaret had never amounted to more than stripteasing the clientele as muriel had once observed was truly vile but the reason someone had thrown an orange at her was that the exotic dancer wouldnt take off her clothes muriel was a stripper who wouldnt strip just as garg had been a good samaritan who wasnt a good samaritanor so dr daruwalla supposed there was a photograph of vinod that john d had framed the actor kept it on his desk in his zürich apartment it wasnt a picture of the dwarf in his cardriving days when the former inspector dhar had known vinod best it was an old circus photo it had always been john ds favorite photograph of vinod in the picture the dwarf is wearing his clown costume the baggy polkadotted pants are so short vinod appears to be standing on his knees hes wearing a tank top a muscle shirtwith spiraling stripes like the stripes on a barbers poleand hes grinning at the camera his smile enhanced by the larger smile thats painted on his face the edges of his painted smile extend to the corners of the dwarfs bright eyes standing directly beside vinod in profile to the camera is an openmouthed hippopotamus whats shocking about the photograph is that the whole dwarf standing up straight would easily fit in the hippos yawning mouth the oddly opposed lower teeth are within vinods reach the hippos teeth are as long as the dwarfs arms at the time the little clown must have felt the heat from the hippos mouththe breath of rotting vegetables the result of the lettuce that vinod recalled feeding to the hippo who swallowed the heads whole like grapes the dwarf had said not even deepa could remember how long ago the great blue nile had had a hippo by the time the dwarfs wife joined the circus the hippopotamus had died after the dwarfs death john d typed an epitaph for vinod on the bottom of the hippo picture clearly the epitaph was composed in memory of the forbidden elevatorthat elite lift which the dwarf had never officially been allowed to use presently accompanied by children the commemoration read it wasnt a bad epitaph the retired screenwriter thought farrokh had acquired quite a collection of photographs of vinod most of which the dwarf had given him over the years when dr daruwalla wrote his condolences to deepa the doctor wanted to include a photo that he hoped the dwarfs wife and son would like it was hard to select only one the doctor had so many pictures of vinodmany more were in his mind of course while farrokh was trying to find the perfect picture of vinod to send to deepa the dwarfs wife wrote to him it was just a postcard from ahmedabad where the great royal was performing but the thought was what mattered to dr daruwalla deepa had wanted the doctor to know that she and shivaji were all right still falling in the net the dwarfs wife wrote that helped farrokh find the photo he was looking for it was a picture of vinod in the dwarfs ward at the hospital for crippled children the dwarf is recovering from surgery following the results of the elephant on a teeterboard item this time theres no clownish smile painted over vinods grin the dwarfs natural smile is sufficient in his stubbyfingered trident hand vinod is clutching that list of his talents which featured car driving the dwarf is holding his future in one hand dr daruwalla only vaguely remembered taking the picture under the circumstances farrokh felt it was necessary for him to inscribe some endearment on the back of the photograph deepa wouldnt need to be reminded of the occasion of the photoat the time shed been occupying a bed in the womens ward of the same hospital recovering from the doctors surgery on her hip inspired by john ds epitaph for vinod the doctor continued with the forbiddenelevator theme allowed to use the lift at last the former screenwriter wrote for although vinod had missed the net the dwarf had finally escaped the rules of the residents society not the dwarfs one day how would dr daruwalla be remembered as a good doctor of course as a good husband a good fathera good man by all counts though not a great writer but whether he was walking on bloor street or stepping into a taxi on avenue road almost no one seeing him would have thought twice about him he was so seemingly assimilated a welldressed immigrant perhaps a nice naturalized canadianmaybe a welltodo tourist although he was small one could quibble about his weight for a man in the late afternoon of his life he would be wise to be thinner nevertheless he was distinguishedlooking sometimes he seemed a little tiredchiefly in the area of his eyesor else there was something faraway about his thoughts which for the most part he kept to himself no one could have fathomed what a life hed led for it was chiefly a life lived in his mind possibly what passed for his tiredness was nothing more than the cost of his considerable imagination which had never found the outlet that it sought at the aids hospice farrokh would forever be remembered as dr balls but this was largely out of fondness the one patient whod bounced his tennis ball instead of squeezing it hadnt irritated the nurses or the other staff for very long when a patient died that patients tennis ball would be returned to dr daruwalla the doctor had been only briefly bitten by religion he wasnt religious anymore yet these tennis balls of former patients were almost holy objects to farrokh at first he would be at a loss with what to do with the old balls he could never bring himself to throw them away nor did he approve of giving them to new patients eventually he disposed of thembut in an oddly ritualistic fashion he buried them in julias herb garden where dogs would occasionally dig them up dr daruwalla didnt mind that the dogs got to play with the tennis balls the doctor found this a suitable conclusion to the life of these old ballsa pleasing cycle as for the damage to the herb garden julia put up with it after all it wasnt her husbands only eccentricity she respected his rich and hidden interior life which she thoroughly expected to yield a puzzling exterior she knew farrokh was an interior man he had always been a daydreamer now that he didnt write he seemed to daydream a little more once farrokh told julia that he wondered if he was an avatar in hindu mythology an avatar is a deity descended to earth in an incarnate form or some manifest shape did dr daruwalla really believe he was the incarnation of a god which god julia asked him i dont know farrokh humbly told her certainly he was no lord krishna the dark onean avatar of vishnu just whom did he imagine he was an avatar of the doctor was no more the incarnation of a god than he was a writer he was like most men principally a dreamer its best to picture him on a snowy evening when darkness has fallen early in toronto snow always made him melancholic for it snowed all night the night his mother died on snowy mornings farrokh would go sit in the guest bedroom where meher had drifted away some of her clothes were in the closetsomething of her scent which was the scent of a foreign country and its cooking still lingered in her hanging saris but picture dr daruwalla in the streetlight standing directly under a lamppost in the falling snow picture him at the northeast corner of lonsdale and russell hill road this forest hill intersection was familiar and comforting to farrokh not only because it was within a block of where he lived but because from this junction he could view the route hed taken those many days when hed walked his children to school in the opposite direction there was grace church onthehill where hed passed a few reflective hours in the safety of his former faith from this street corner dr daruwalla could also see the chapel and the bishop strachan school where the doctors daughters had ably demonstrated their intelligence and farrokh wasnt far from upper canada college where his sons might have gone to schoolif hed had sons but the doctor reconsidered hed had two sonscounting john d and the retired inspector dhar farrokh tipped his face up to the falling snow he felt the snow wet his eyelashes although christmas was long past dr daruwalla was pleased to see that some of his neighbors houses still displayed their yuletide ornamentation which gave them unusual color and cheer the snow falling in the streetlight gave the doctor such a purewhite lonely feeling farrokh almost forgot why he was standing on this street corner on a winter evening but he was waiting for his wife the former julia zilk was due to pick him up julia was driving from one of her womens groups shed phoned and told farrokh to wait at the corner the daruwallas were dining at a new restaurant not far from harbourfront farrokh and julia were a faithful audience for the authors readings at harbourfront as for the restaurant dr daruwalla would find it ordinary also they were eating too early for the doctors taste as for the authors readings farrokh detested readings so few writers knew how to read aloud when you were reading a book to yourself you could close the cover without shame and try something else or watch a video which the exscreenwriter was more and more apt to do his usual beerand he often had wine with his dinnermade him too sleepy to read at harbourfront he feared hed start snoring in the audience and embarrass julia she loved the readings which the doctor increasingly viewed as an endurance sport often too many writers read in a single night as if to make a public demonstration of canadas esteemed subsidy of the arts usually there was an intermission which was dr daruwallas principal reason for loathing the theater and at the harbourfront intermission theyd be surrounded by julias wellread friends her friends were more literary than farrokh and they knew it on this particular evening julia had warned him there was an indian author reading from his or her work that always presented problems for dr daruwalla there was the palpable expectation that the doctor should relate to this author in some meaningful way as if there were that recognizable it which the author would either get right or get wrong in the case of an indian writer even julia and her literary friends would defer to farrokhs opinion therefore he would be pressed to have an opinion and to state his views often he had no views and would hide during the intermission on occasion to his shame the retired screenwriter had hidden in the mens room recently quite a celebrated parsi writer had read at harbourfront dr daruwalla had the feeling that julia and her friends expected the doctor to be aggressive enough to speak to the author for farrokh had read the justly acclaimed novelhed much admired it the story concerned a small but sturdy pillar of a parsi community in bombayadecent compassionate family man was severely tested by the political corruption and deceit of that time when india and pakistan were at war how could julia and her friends imagine that farrokh could talk with this author what did dr daruwalla know of a real parsi communityeither in bombay or in toronto what community could the doctor presume to talk about farrokh could only tell tales of the duckworth clublady duckworth exposing herself flashing her famous breasts one didnt have to be a duckworthian to have already heard that story but what other stories did dr daruwalla know only the doctors own story which was decidedly unsuitable for first acquaintances sex change and serial slaying a conversion by love bite the lost children who were not saved by the circus farrokhs father blown to smithereens and how could he talk about the twins to a total stranger it seemed to dr daruwalla that his story was the opposite of universal his story was simply strangethe doctor himself was singularly foreign what farrokh came in contact with everywhere he went was a perpetual foreignnessa reflection of that foreignness he carried with him in the peculiarities of his heart and so in the falling snow in forest hill a bombayite stood waiting for his viennese wife to take him into downtown toronto where they would listen to an unknown indian readerperhaps a sikh possibly a hindu maybe a muslim or even another parsi it was likely that there would be other readers too across russell hill road the wet snow clung to the shoulders and hair of a mother and her small son like dr daruwalla they stood under a lamppost where the radiant streetlight brightened the snow and sharpened the features of their watchful facesthey appeared to be waiting for someone too the young boy seemed far less impatient than his mother the child had his head tilted back with his tongue stuck out to catch the falling snow and he swung himself dreamily from his mothers armwhereas she kept clutching at his hand as if he were slipping from her grasp she would occasionally jerk his arm to make him stop swinging but this never worked for long and nothing could compel the boy to withdraw his tongue it remained sticking out catching the snow as an orthopedist dr daruwalla disapproved of the way the mother jerked on her sons arm which was totally relaxedthe boy was almost limp the doctor feared for the childs elbow or his shoulder but the mother had no intention of hurting her son she was just impatient and it was tedious for herhow the boy hung on her arm for a moment dr daruwalla smiled openly at this madonna and child they were so clearly illuminated under their lamppost the doctor should have known that they could see him standing under his lamppostjust as clearly but farrokh had forgotten where he wasnot in indiaand hed overlooked the racial wariness he might provoke in the woman who now regarded his unfamiliar face in the streetlight and in the whiteness of the falling snow as she might have regarded the sudden appearance of a large unleashed dog why was this foreigner smiling at her the womans obvious fear both offended and shamed dr daruwalla he quickly stopped smiling and looked away then the doctor realized that he was standing on the wrong corner of the intersection julia had plainly instructed him to stand on the northwest corner of lonsdale and russell hill road which was exactly where the mother and her son were standing farrokh knew that by crossing the street and standing beside them he would probably create mayhem in the womans mindat best extreme apprehension at worst she might scream for help there would be accusations that could rouse the neighborsconceivably summon the police therefore dr daruwalla crossed russell hill road awkwardly sidling headdown and furtively which doubtless gave the woman all the more cause to suspect him of criminal behavior slinking across the street farrokh looked full of felonious intentions he passed the woman and child quickly scuttling by without a greetingfor a greeting the doctor was sure would startle the woman to such a degree that she might bolt into the traffic there was no traffic dr daruwalla took up a position that was yards away from where julia was expecting to spot him there the doctor stood like a pervert getting up his nerve for a cowardly assault he was aware that the streetlight barely reached to the curb where he waited the mother who was of medium height and figureand now thoroughly frightenedbegan to pace dragging her small son with her she was a welldressed young woman in her twenties but neither her attire nor her youth could conceal her struggle to combat her rising terror from her expression it was clear to dr daruwalla that she believed she understood his heinous intentions under his seemingly tasteful topcoat which was black wool with a black velvet collar and black velvet lapels there surely lurked a naked man who was dying to expose himself to her and her child the mother turned her trembling back on the doctors reprehensible figure but her small son had also noticed the stranger the boy was unafraidjust curious he kept tugging on his distraught mothers arm with his little tongue still sticking straight out into the snow the child couldnt take his eyes off the exotic foreigner dr daruwalla tried to concentrate on the snow impulsively the doctor stuck out his tongue it was a reflex imitation of what hed seen the small boy doit hadnt occurred to dr daruwalla to stick out his tongue for years but now in the falling snow the young mother could see that the foreigner was radically deranged his mouth lolled open with his tongue sticking out and his eyes blinked as the snowflakes fell on his lashes as for his eyelids farrokh felt they were heavy to the casual observer his eyelids were puffyhis age his tiredness the years of beer and wine but to this young mother in her growing panic they must have struck her as the eyelids of the demonic east slightly beyond illumination in the streetlight dr daruwallas eyes appeared to be hoodedlike a serpents however her son had no fear of the foreigner their tongues in the snow seemed to connect them the kinship of their extended tongues took immediate effect on the small boy farrokhs childish unconscious gesture must have overridden the boys natural reluctance to speak to strangers for he suddenly broke free of his mothers grasp and ran with outstretched arms toward the astonished indian the mother was too terrified to give clear utterance to her sons name she managed only a gargling sound a strangled gasp she hesitated before stumbling after her son as if her legs had turned to ice or stone she was resigned to her fate how well she knew what would happen next the black topcoat would open as she approached the stranger and she would be confronted with the male genitalia of the truly inscrutable east in order not to frighten her further dr daruwalla pretended not to notice that the child was running to him he could imagine the mother thinking ohthese perverts are sly particularly those of us who are of color the doctor thought bitterly this was precisely the situation that foreigners especially those of color are taught to dread absolutely nothing was happening yet the young woman was sure that she and her son teetered on the brink of a shocking possibly even a scarring episode farrokh nearly cried out excuse me pretty lady but there is no episode here he would have run away from the child except that he suspected the boy could run faster also julia was coming to pick him up and there he would berunning away from a mother and her small son that would be too absurd that was when the small boy touched him it was a firm but gentle tug on his sleevethen the miniature mittened hand grasped the doctors gloved index finger and pulled dr daruwalla had no choice but to look down into the wideeyed face that was peering up at him the whiteness of the boys cheeks was rosetinted against the purer whiteness of the snow excuse me the little gentleman said where are you from well thats the question isnt it thought dr daruwalla it was always the question for his whole adult life it was the question he usually answered with the literal truth which in his heart felt like a lie im from india the doctor would say but he didnt feel it it didnt ring true im from toronto he sometimes said but with more mischief than authority or else he would be clever im from toronto via bombay he would say if he really wanted to be cute he would answer im from toronto via vienna and bombay he could go on elaborating the lienamely that he was from anywhere he could always enhance the european qualities of his education if he chose he could create a spicy masala mixture for his childhood in bombay giving his accent that hindi flavor he could also kill the conversation with his merciless deadpan torontonian reserve as you may know there are many indians in toronto he could say when he felt like it dr daruwalla could seem as comfortable with the places hed lived as he was truly uncomfortable but suddenly the boys innocence demanded of the doctor a different kind of truth in the childs face dr daruwalla could discern only frank curiosityonly the most genuine desire to know it also moved the doctor that the boy had not let go of his index finger farrokh was aware that he had no time in which to formulate a witty answer or an ambiguous remark the terrified mother would any second interrupt the moment which would never return where are you from the child had asked him dr daruwalla wished he knew never had he so much wanted to tell the truth and more important to feel that his response was as pure and natural as the currently falling snow bending close to the boy so that the child could not mistake a word of his answer and giving the boys trusting hand a reflexive squeeze the doctor spoke clearly in the sharp winter air im from the circus farrokh said without thinkingit was utterly spontaneousbut by the instant delight that was apparent in the childs broad smile and in his bright admiring eyes dr daruwalla could tell that hed answered the question correctly what he saw in the boys happy face was something hed never felt before in his cold adopted country such uncritical acceptance was the most satisfying pleasure that dr daruwalla or any immigrant of color would ever know then a car horn was blowing and the woman pulled her son away the boys father the womans husbandwhoever he waswas helping them into his car if farrokh heard nothing of what the mother said he would remember what the child told the man the circus is in town the boy said then they drove away leaving dr daruwalla there the doctor had the street corner to himself julia was late farrokh fretted that they wouldnt have time to eat before the interminable harbourfront readings then he neednt worry that hed fall asleep and snore instead the audience and the unfortunate authors would be treated to his growling stomach the snow kept falling no cars passed in a distant window the lights on a christmas tree were blinking dr daruwalla tried to count the colors the colored lights through the window glass were reminiscent of that light which is reflected in sequinsthat glitter which is sewn into the singlets of the circus acrobats was there anything as wonderful as that reflected light farrokh wondered a car was passing it threatened to break the spell that the doctor was under for dr daruwalla was halfway around the world from the corner of lonsdale and russell hill road go home someone shouted to him from the window of the passing car it was an irony that the doctor didnt hear this for he was in a position to inform the person that going home was easier said than done more sounds torn from the window of the moving car were muffled by the snowreceding laughter possibly a racial slur but dr daruwalla heard none of it his eyes had risen from the christmas tree in the window at first hed blinked at the falling snow but then he allowed his eyes to closethe snow coolly covered his eyelids farrokh saw the elephantfooted boy in his singlet with the bluegreen sequinsas the little beggar was never dressed in real life farrokh saw ganesh descending in the spotlight twirling downthe cripples teeth clamped tightly on the dental trapeze this was the completion of another successful skywalk which in reality had never happened and never would the real cripple was dead it was only in the retired screenwriters mind that ganesh was a skywalker probably the movie would never be made yet in his minds eye farrokh saw the elephant boy walk without a limp across the sky to dr daruwalla this existed it was as real as the india the doctor thought hed left behind now he saw that he was destined to see bombay again farrokh knew there was no escaping maharashtra which was no circus that was when he knew he was going backagain and again he would keep returning it was india that kept bringing him back this time the dwarfs would have nothing to do with it farrokh knew this as distinctly as he could hear the applause for the skywalker dr daruwalla heard them clapping as the elephant boy descended on the dental trapeze the doctor could hear them cheering for the cripple julia whod stopped the car and was waiting for her distracted husband honked the horn but dr daruwalla didnt hear her farrokh was listening to the applausehe was still at the circus
