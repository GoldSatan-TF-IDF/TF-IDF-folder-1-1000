harry turtledove every inch a king i im otto of schlepsig ah youve heard the name i see yes im that otto of schlepsig some other people claim to be but im the real one by the two prophets im the one who was king of shqiperi i ruled the land of the eagle for five whole days no i wasnt born blueblooded by my hope of heaven i wasnt as a matter of fact i was born in a barn truly literally it was either that or make a mess of my parents traveling caravan and my mothera trouper among trouperswould never have done such a thing i could lie to you and make out that mother and father were more famous than they really were why not youd never know the difference but whats the point of telling a story if you dont tell a true story sothey were sideshow performers and thats the long and short of it i grew up among more or less trained monkeys and bearded ladies and sea snakes and drunken downattheheels sorcerers and flea circuses and demons and all the other strange odds and ends that might make a mark want to part with some silveror a lot of the places where we played with some copper i daresay it warped me for life but ive had fun in the fortyodd yearssome of them odder than otherssince my mother waddled off to lie down in the hay ive done a lot of things ive been an actor people still talk about the way i played king clodweg in the maiden with seven boots sometimes they dont even throw things when they do ive climbed all steps on the way to the top of the temple of siwaand i met another traveler from schlepsig when i got there ive been an acrobat ive rescued a princess that she didnt particularly want to be rescued wasnt my fault ive served not one but two hitches in the army of the hassockian empire whether that says more about how desperate i was or how desperate the hassocki were i leave for you to decide and ive been king of shqiperi thats what i want to tell you about no i didnt set out to be a king who does except a crown prince i was in a thirdrate circus rattling around the nekemte peninsula in the middle of the nekemte wars firstrate outfits never go down there not enough money to be made they stay up in schlepsig and albion and narbonensis and torino and the more civilized parts of the dual monarchy the secondrate companies had cleared out when they heard dragons shrieking and crossbows being cranked that leftoutfits like mine im afraid dooger and carks traveling emporium of marvels was just as bad just as pathetic just as hopeless as the name would make you guess the roustabouts drank when the tent went up it went up sideways as often as not the fortuneteller couldnt have seen a roc falling out of the sky the swordswallower coughed that wasnt max of wittes fault but it sure didnt help his act we were in thasos the night everything got started thasos most of the time isnt a bad town its a bigger place a fancier place than dooger and carks miserable little outfit usually gets to play but after belonging to the hassockian empire for something close to five hundred years it had changed hands quite suddenly in the nekemte wars frankly it looked like a place that had just been sacked the walls were battered about every third building had a chunk bitten out of it and fires had burned here and there it smelled like a place that had just been sacked too once you get a whiff of the smell of death you never forget it mix it with old smoke and fear and thats what a sack smells like and thasos felt like a place that had just been sacked a lot of the hassocki pashas and beys had got out of town when their army ran off to the west but most ordinary hassockitinsmiths and ropemakers and butchers and what have youhadnt had the chance to flee the ones who were left alive sat glumly in their coffeeshops robes drawn tight around them turbans perhaps a bit askew long faces somber they drank tiny cups of sweet mud and sucked on the mouthpieces to their water pipes and tried to pretend the whole thing never happened meanwhile the lokrians in thasos were out of their minds with joy thasos has always been a mostly lokrian town even though lokris lost it all those years ago now it was back under the green dragon and men in short skirts and women in long ones danced in the streets if youre not a lokrian the kind of music they play sounds like skinning a live cat with a dull knife if you areyou dance when they werent dancing they jeered at the surviving hassocki after the sun went down lokrian warships in the harbor junk schlepsig and albion didnt need any more shot off fireworks i hoped they were fireworks anyway youre wondering why anybody in his right mind would want to bring a circus into a mess like that youve never met dooger and cark have you one of them is from the wilder parts of the dual monarchy the other speaks every language under the sun and all with the same weird accent if they had any idea what the demon they were doing they wouldnt have touched the traveling emporium of marvels with a tenfoot pole since they owned it since they owned it we got to thasos a bare handful of days after the lokrian and plovdivian armies did hassocki wizards should have planted salamanders under the roadbed and in the fields that would have slowed down the lokrians and probably the plovdivians who are wild men and would have stopped civilian traffic in its tracks although only eliphalet and zibeon know what dooger and cark would have done it didnt happen by then the nekemte wars were going so badly for the hassocki that they didnt think about much except running the only places where they still held out and held on were in the fortress of edirne which guarded the approaches to vyzance and off in wild shqiperi where nobody was trying very hard to push them but thats another story i hadnt even thought of the land of the eagle yet to tell you the truth i wouldnt swear id heard of the land of the eagle yet id been a lot of places in my time but nobody in his right mind went to shqiperi so i thought then anyhow our wagons rattled and thumped down that unsalamanderedi hopedbut potholedi knewhighway to thasos i sat next to the roustabout driving mine in my spangled shirt and tight trousers i wanted to be seen i combed my mustaches trying to make them as splendid as i could behind me in the wagon max of witte coughed hes had a cough for as long as ive known him and we go back a ways sometimes i ignore it sometimes it starts to drive me crazy this was one of those times stop that max i said id love to he said in his foghorn bass poking his head out to look around max is a lot taller and a little skinnier than people have any business being his joints show more than your usual fellows too so watching him is like watching a not very graceful marionette he coughed again one of these days youll do that while youre performing i warned him only way ill ever make the journals he said dolefully first person in the history of the world to cut his own throat from the inside out something to look forward to if you say so i answered max isnt max unless hes complaining about something we pitched our tent in a vacant lot not far from the grand temple of thasos that temple is all lokrian it was there for a thousand years before the hassocki took the city you could see the two spires piercing the sky whenever you turned your head that way the lokrians of course are zibeonites and built his spire taller than eliphalets being a modern tolerant man i pass over in silence the ignorant heretics errors the hassocki had built a fane to their quadrate god next to the grand temple it gave them a place to worship in thasos other than that i have to say it wasnt a success the four low domes on its roof arent so much of a much compared to those two spires even if the wrong one was taller no i was going to pass over that in silence wasnt i my apologies kindly reader i got the feeling the lot hadnt been vacant very long whoeverd cleared the rubble from it had plainly won the contract on lowest bid and made up for that by not clearing a good bit of it bricks broken bottles of arrack if thered been any unbroken bottles the rubble haulers had taken care of thoseoh you bet they had and roof slates argued a building had lived there not very long ago crumpled papers might have come from it too or from anywhere else in thasos they blew by now in flurries now in blizzards and we added our own papers as if thasos didnt have enough we pasted flyers for dooger and cark on anything that didnt have a mouth and ears there are at least half a dozen languages in the nekemte peninsula dooger and cark being too cheap to have wizards use the law of similarity to reproduce them in every relevant speech solved the problem by not using any probably carks idea hes the one who was born speaking no known tongue so our flyers showed a pretty girl wearing not very much have you ever known a circus without one or more than one to give the marks something to stare at turning cartwheels a lion and a unicorn on their hind legs like the supporters of the arms of albion a twoheaded man actually josйdiego quit a while ago after he got into an argument with himself a clown brawling with a wellhung demon and soaring above them all an acrobat doing an obviously deathdefying flip me yours truly otto of schlepsig star of dooger and carks prophets help me i lugged a pastepot while ilona carried flyers shes the pretty girl on the postera redhead from the dual monarchy with a temper like dragons breath hurry up she snapped at me as if i were her slave well ive heard ideas i liked less youre carrying paper i pointed out ive got this bloody heavy bucket and my arms will be as long as a forest apes by the time we get this job done ilona said something in yagmar the language she grew up speaking that should have set the flyers on fire wed been using schlepsigian up till then its my birthspeech and ilona knows it because the dual monarchy crams it down everybodys throat in school like it or not almost everybody in the circus business picks up some of itexcept the albionese they think other people ought to speak their language ilona wasnt in costume she would have caused a riot if shed gone out on the street wearing what she almost wore when she performedand not a friendly kind of riot either hassocki can have harems but they start pitching fits if they see more of a woman in public than her hands and her face you figure it outive given up and lokrians probably because theyve had the hassocki next door for so long are almost as straitlaced costume or not she still got stares shes a damn goodlooking womani already said that and she has red hair down to about the small of her back in a place like thasos where just about everybodys swarthy she stood out like an honest man in parliament a fellow in a skirt and tights said something in lokrian seeing us look blank he tried again in hassocki yourecircus people hassocki i speaka lot better than he did in fact they beat it into you when you join their army of course not sir i answered politely adding my best bow were in the chickengiblet business i can give you a fine bargain on gizzards it didnt faze him nothing much fazes lokrianseither that or they start pitching fits he jerked a thumb at ilona sell me her giblets what does he say she demanded without waiting for an answer she called the lokrian something that made what shed said before sound like love poetry that didnt faze him either he swept off his broadbrimmed straw hat and bowed almost double she turned her back on him considering some lokrians tastes that might have been illadvised but this fellow just sighed and went on his way such is the glamorous romantic life of a circus performer makes you want to run away and join doesnt it actually going out and performing is always a relief you may hate traveling you may hate shilling although nobody in his right mind hates albionese shillingstheyre the soundest money in the world but if you hate performing you wouldnt be out there in the first place with the usual jitters i watched the crowd filter into the tent if the house is lousy the owners have an excuse for stiffing the crew of course the owners will try to stiff the crew if the house is full tooespecially if theyre dooger and carkbut at least then you know youre getting screwed things looked pretty good the portable stands on either side of the ring were filling up roustabouts steered lokrians to one side hassocki to the other why borrow trouble you get plenty even when you dont borrow it hassocki complained they couldnt see the lions as well as they wanted to lokrians complained they couldnt see the clowns as well as they wanted to everybody complained about how much we charged for wine and pistachios hassocki arent supposed to drink even a drop of wine that doesnt stop them or not very often they flick out a drop from a cup as if to say there i didnt drink that one and then they go on sometimes i think they enjoy wine more because they dont just get drunkthey get to feel guilty too out swaggered the ringmaster in an outfit that would have made an albionese duke at a coronation feel underdressed top hat tailcoat white tie knee breeches with silver buckles shining white hose and patentleather cambridges with even bigger silver buckles and ludovic had a whiphow can you be a ringmaster without a whipand he had waxed mustachios just as black and just about as long ludovic is a piece of work all right he cracked the whip to draw everybodys eyes to him good thing the locals didnt decide the war had started up again thats all i can tell you ladies and gentlemen welcome to dooger and carks traveling emporium of marvels he said first in lokrian and then in hassocki at least i assume the lokrian was the same as what i could understand people applauded they really did like ive said we hadnt played thasos before for all the locals knew we really were marvelous unfortunately theyd find out pretty soon and now ludovic called in a voice that filled the big tent without seeming strained i give you the famous madame ilona and the unicorn madame ilona ladies and gentlemen direct from the court of the dual monarchy the only court in the dual monarchy ilona had ever seen was the one that gave her a sentence for vagrancy nobody from the royal and imperial court at vindobon royal and imperial mind not just one was likely to show up and give us the lie though so why not out she came doing flips across the unicorns back and cartwheels and somersaults all around the beast everybody stared at her well ilona is worth staring at anywhere she goes but all she had on was skintight emerald satin that covered her from just above those to right around that and women in thasos dont dress that way not where anybody can see them they dont hassocki and lokrians all gaped as if theyd never set eyes on a woman before the shock value probably made ilona look even better to them than she would have someplace where people dont have a stroke when they look at a leg ilona knew what she was doing to them too theres a littleor more than a littledemon in ilona in between the tumbling runs she threw in some wiggles that werent gymnastic but sure were entertaining you never saw such anattentive audience in all your born days and the unicorn only made it that much more agonizing for the poor prudish locals everybody knows about unicorns and virgins now ilona may possibly be virgin in her left ear but i wouldnt bet more than a hemidemisemilepta even on that she didnt try to ride the unicorn of course she just did flips on it the unicorn put up with that the other give me leave to doubt it she was good not only that she was riveting the marks couldnt take their eyes off her ive seen plenty of acts with amazing talent that nobody wanted to watch if youve got a choice between good and riveting take riveting every time youll go further our liontamer was good he could get the big cats to do thingswell if their mothers asked them to do some of that stuff they would have bitten them but poor cadogan wasnt riveting not even close he made it all look too easy working with lions is supposed to seem dangerous curse it working with lions is dangerous a lot of trainers end up slightly dead because one mistake is all you need the crowd is supposed to sweat when youre out there if it doesntif it doesnt you end up playing with an outfit like dooger and carks traveling emporium of marvels and eliphalet and zibeon have pity on you if you do ilona came out again this time doing flips on a mammoths back maybe the mammoth got as many oohs and ahhs as she didthey dont live anywhere close to thasosbut maybe it didnt too clowns tumbled and brawled all around the parading beast some of the thumping and pounding that was part of the act probably wasnt just part of the act if you know what i mean two of the men in whiteface and oddcolored wigs had fallen out over one of the women when they slugged each other in the stomach and walloped each other with brickbats they bloody well meant it it made the act go over better there was an edge they wouldnt have had if they were just going through the motions people can tell even marks as long as one of them didnt stick a salamander in the other ones drawers backstage the show was fine and they were both troupers the show mattered to them ludovic reappeared one of the clowns larruped him with a brickbat collapsing his topper the clown scooted away but not fast enough the ringmasters whip lashed out it snatched the clowns green wig right off his head under the green wig he had on a firered one thats always good for a laugh and now ladies and gentlemen ludovic speaks more languages than i do and speaks most of them better than i do now the amazing the astounding the magnificent grand duke maximilian of witte that was max i happen to know his father was a brewer from an early age max showed himself much more enthusiastic about drinking ale than about making itwhich is no doubt part of the reason he was making a poor but not too honest living with dooger and carks out he came to more silence than i would have liked most places his tall thin shambling frame stuffed into a generals uniform with twenty pounds of epaulets and medals and clothofgold threadwork and crisscrossing scarlet sashes also goldtrimmed and the gaudiest scabbard in the world is good for a belly laugh all by itself i knew right away what was wrong in lokris and the hassockian empire generals really do wear outfits like that the locals couldnt see the joke maxs face is one of those long skinny ones that look sad even when the fellow whos wearing it is happy and go downhill from there he looked out to the audience to the lokrians on one side to the hassocki on the other the more he looked the more lugubrious he got if not for his other talent he would have made quite a clown he made an extravagant gesture of farewellso extravagant he almost fell over then he made as if to cut his throat but stopped halfway with another gesture one that said that wasnt good enough and then throwing his head back he swallowed the sword instead ive seen a lot of swordswallowers but max of witte is the best i know or know of being so long and lean hes got a lot of space between his mouth and vital points south so he can swallow more blade than anybody ive ever seen he outdid himself this time too he was just about ready to swallow the hilt thats what it looked like anyhow then he coughed that cursed cough is one of the reasons max performs for dooger and carks and not a circus really worthy of his talents and those talents really are formidable by then people in both sets of stands were staring and pointing and shoutingand clapping like maniacs too whats the other reason well i dont exactly know max tells it different ways on different days depending on whether hes drunk or sober or on which way the wind is blowing most of the time it involves the wife of a prominent promoter sometimes its his mistress sometimes its his daughter once it had something to do with the promoters dogbut max was very drunk then he coughed again hed joked about cutting his throat from the inside out with that much steel still inside him it wasnt a joke any more he drew out the bladeprobably a lot faster than hed had in mind at firstand brandished it like a professional duelist he bowed almost double as the crowd went wild then for good measure ilona came out again she was carrying a long thin loaf of bread max bowed to her even more deeply than he had to the crowd he kissed her hand and kissed his way up her arm the farther he got the louder the audience squealed no you dont do those things in public not in thasos you dont at last when the squeals were turning to screams ilona clouted him over the head with the loaf of bread using it like a clowns brickbat that seemed to make poor max remember what he was supposed to be doing he bowed to her again she held out the loaf at arms length and max sliced it flash flash flash went the sword slice after neat slice every slice of bread flew off the loaf till the blade paused about an inch from ilonas hand more cheers from the crowdloud ones there are always your halfsmart marks who go oh but that blade hasnt got an edge on it anyway oh but that blade bloody well had they cheered him then hed earned it and he got it he bowed himself almost double again and had to make a wild grab to keep his hat from falling off his hat i havent said anything about his hat well what would you say about something so garish it made the rest of his outfit look normal by comparison it didnt glow in the dark but im switched if i know why not his ears stuck out from under it too and now ladies and gentlemen for your entertainment and amazement the king of acrobats ludovic bawled ladies and gentlemen the one the only the magnificentotto of schlepsig i was on i bounded out there into the center of the ring and bowed every which way at once i got polite applause i hadnt expected anything morei hadnt done anything yet after all but even that little spatter of handclapping gave me what the drunk gets from his brandy and the opium smoker from his pipe i was out there i was in front of people they saw me they liked me i was alive i waved again i bowed again i ran up to one of the two big poles that supported the tent canopy and hurried up the rope ladder attached to itbig tents are rigged as elaborately as menofwar about twothirds of the way up theres a tiny platform a tightrope stretches from it to the one just like it on the far tent pole as soon as i stepped out onto the rope i heard the gasps some came from womens throats some from mens i teetered deliberately just to hear them again and make them louder hes going to fall somebody exclaimed in hassocki yeah several voices said that they sounded eagerhungry even there are always people who want to see the swordswallower cut his throat who want to see the acrobat fall down and smash himself to strawberry jam who want to see the demon get loose who want to see the lion maul the tamer it happens everywhere you go you cant do a thing about itand if you could and you did what you wanted to do wouldnt you be just like them better not even to think about that and better not to think about falling down too if its in your mind its liable to be in your muscles too actually though a tightrope is more forgiving than a slack one and i wasnt trying anything new only the same old things id done ten thousand times in practice dont think just do anyone whos known me for a while will tell you im pretty good at not thinking ask either of my exwives for instance trudi and jane dont agree on much but they wouldnt argue with that so leap right foot forward leap left foot forward handstand rolling into a somersault coming down on my feet the rope was good and tight id made sure of that beforehand you dont trust the roustabouts when its your own personal private irreplaceable neck not more than once you dont assuming you live through the once out to the middle of the tightrope bounce up and down once or twice listen to them ooh and ahh down below listen to them scream when you spring out into nothing but empty air then listen to them ooh and ahh again three times as loud when you catch the glass trapeze rod i live for that from down below they cant see the trapeze at all magic kills the reflections magic also strengthens ithaving it snap from my weight could be downright embarrassing the first time i hit it in any show always worries me the wizards dooger and cark use have the same sorts of troubles as everybody else in the troupe one of them drinks one of them built a bridge that didnt stand up one of themwell never mind about him i dont let him have anything to do with the trapeze rod thats all and you can take it to the bank once i was on the first trapeze swinging and twirling from it to the next to the next was easy in the sense that anything is easy if youve practiced it long enough if i do say so myselfand i doi showed the locals some moves they wouldnt have seen anywhere else this side of a forest ape my last flip was from the last trapeze to the tightrope i caught the rope used my momentum to swing up into another handstand and went from that back to the upright some people would have cut more capers on the rope then me i figured enough was enough i went across to the far pole took one bow on the little platform up there and then came back down to the ground the hand i got as i descended and when i finished my bows in the center of the ring said id gauged it right that was the magnificent otto of schlepsig ludovic boomed i took one more bow who wouldnt feel magnificent with applause washing over him like sweet pure rain the ringmaster went on and now ibrahim the wise conjures spirits from the vasty deep ibrahim the wise is the twit i wont let near my trapeze rod hes a fat little torinan his real name is giuseppe backstage we mostly call him joe he dresses in robes that look vaguely hassockian to go with his alias he does look wise or at least impressive when he wears them which proves clothes really do make the man if only hed stick to the handful of things he knows how to do hed be fine but hes one of those mages who never saw a new spell they didnt like he half learns them and trots them out before hes got them under control one of these days hell summon up a water elemental and drown us all did i tell you he smokes hashish that doesnt do anything to make him think hes less powerful believe you me it doesnt today though everything went all right i recognized his spell right away hes called up that goldenwinged monkeygriffin fairly oftenoften enough to get the hang of it anyway the green smoke that flared when the demon appeared was new but it wasnt a bad effect and the monkeygriffin put on a show rearing up on its hind legs till it was twice as tall as a man and roaring like a lost soul its tongue was long and green tooso long that it almost stole the hat from a fat lokrian in the first row who looked like an oliveoil merchant the fat man let out a yelp even louder than the monkeygriffins roars his fellow lokrians were sympathetic the hassocki in the other set of stands laughed at him to close things out of course ibrahim the allegedly wise had to demanifest his demon he did it to my relief and even threw in another cloud of smoke this time red he bowed people cheered i got a better hand though youd better believe it afterwards we did what people do afterwards we unwound and while we unwound we kept a wary eye on dooger and cark as they counted the take if they said we didnt bring in much theyd be setting us up to cheat us like i said it wasnt anything they hadnt done before we were all a little more nervous than usual this time if we squawked they were liable to sack the noisy ones and leave us stuck in thasos with the nekemte wars still sputtering behind us with soldiers and brigands and pirates prowling the routes back to civilization this wasnt really a place where we wanted to get stuck and the real pisser is dooger and cark are rich they dont worry about where their next coppers coming from screwing the people who work for them is like a game as far as theyre concerned or maybe theyve been doing it so long they cant not do it there are always signs when they start muttering and sighing and shaking their heads when they look like a coal wagon just ran over poor old aunt griselda thats the time to start worrying for real when they didnt start doing any of that stuff we all breathed easier when cark actually smiled we broke out the arrack and the slivovitz and the schnapps and the genever and the cognac and the water of life joeexcuse me ibrahim the wisegot a pipe going and probably doesnt remember any of the next three days dooger dooger didnt smile but that didnt bother us because dooger never smiles never i dont want him to either im not ready for the world to end i washed off most of my makeup i left a little on so people would know im a performer that always impresses local girls or some of them anyhow a bottle of arrack came by i took a swig and passed it on pretty good show somebody said eliphalets holy whiskers that was max hes usually as cheerful as the hassockian atabegs strangler he must have been pleasedeither that or hed sucked in some smoke from joes pipe trying to make the moment stretch i said you did a nice job playing up the gloom when the people didnt laugh at your getup oh thanks max looked surprised he also looked ridiculous he still had on his grand high supreme exalted marshals tunic and under it his skinny hairy legs stuck out from drafty drawers that needed mending most of the marks theyre too dumb to laugh at funny give em something pathetic and theyll laugh themselves sick isnt that the truth i said and told him my thought about the ghouls in the crowd max gravely considered it max considers everything gravely at last he gave me a nod well im not going to tell you youre wrong he said some of those people after i swallow the sword they want to see it come out my a bottle of slivovitz interrupted him after a show a bottle of slivovitz will interrupt almost anybody he gulped and sent it my way after he gulped he coughed this time i didnt fret about him for one thing he didnt have a foot and a half of honed steel down his throat for another a good slug of slivovitz will make anybody cough ilona let out a screech like a cat with its tail in a pencil sharpener a moment later i heard running feet one of the locals must have been peeking into the wagon while she changed her window scraped open what sounded like a bottle shattered on the groundor possibly on the locals head the window slammed shut ilona said something in yagmar that had to mean thatll teach him ludovic brought in a copy of the thasos chronicle the journal for foreigners in town its written in narbonese not because more foreigners in thasos know narbonese but because narbonensis used to have closer ties to the hassockian empire than any of the other great powers did now that thasos belongs to lokris unless plovdiv takes it away who knows how long the arrangementor the journalwill last any news about the show three people asked at the same time a natural questionand a dumb one i dont care how fast the law of similarity lets you turn out copies a scribe wouldnt have had time to write his piece get back to the office or send it by crystal ball and get it to the wizards not only that the newssellers wouldnt have had time to get it on the street magic is one thing miracles are something else altogether the ringmaster shook his beefy head i was looking for war news for when we leave town its still sputtering to the north and west the hassocki arent giving up there he paused and turned to an inside page and it says essad pasha and the shqipetari have asked the hassockian empire to send them prince halim eddin to be their new king he paused again theres a picture of the prince copied by crystal from the original portrait in vyzance he held out the journal so we could all see it was my face ii oh the resemblance wasnt exact halim eddin waxed his mustachios into points where i let mine stay bushy he plucked his eyebrows the way hassocki nobles do id never let tweezers get near mine in my life my hairline receded a little more than his when i went up for a closer look i saw that his eyes were bright blue where mine are gray but we were about the same age we both had brown hair we both had long faces with strong chins and formidable noses we both had high proud cheekbones and wide mouths we certainly could have been brothers we might well have been twins they say every man has his double i never expected to meet mine staring at me off a journal page with a pound and a half of hassocki medals on his chest everybody in dooger and carks traveling emporium of marvels hurried up to gape at the pictureand at me now i know how the freaks and demons in the sideshow feel everybody started talking at once using several different languages ilonaby then shed come out of her wagonlooked at me sidelong and said there were things you werent telling me darling there were things i wasnt telling me darling i answered max bowed deeply he looks like a carpenters rule with big ears when he does that what is your command your highness he asked sounding more like an undertaker than a courtier why dont you go soak your head i told him he bowed again with pleasure your highness he grabbed another bottleit was genever this time i thinkand got a long start on soaking anyway all the rest of the night the troupe called me your highness and your majesty they wouldnt let it alone even after the joke got stale for a while it annoyed me and made me angry then i started to accept it as nothing less than my due that put some new life in the jokeexcept by that time i wasnt joking any more no im not ashamed to admit it that was how the idea caught fire in me there at a drunken party for thirdrate circus performers in a secondrate town that had just changed hands between a senile empire and a kingdom that wanted to revive an empire not just senile but centuries dead strokes of genius are where you find them ive acted on the stage as i say ive won applause in cities far grander than thasos ever dreamt of being why i wasnt still doing that thenis a long story and not altogether my fault you can ask anyone who was there when things went sour youll hear the same thingor perhaps you wont some people are nothing but naturalborn liars but never mind that now a role onstage is one thing a role on the stage of the world on the stage of historythats something else again the role of a lifetime liable not to be a very long lifetime if something went wrong but nothing ventured nothing gained if only i could bring it off id drink out on it for the rest of my days if i couldnt do anything about it that evening i couldnt do anything about anything not as drunk as i got an acrobat with a hangover is the most pitiful thing the two prophets ever saw the only problem being that no one will pity him try doing flips and spinning through the air high above the ground when your head wants to fall off try not losing your lunch on the audienceit will get you talked about if you do trynever mind try drawing your own unpleasant pictures yes i knew it was going to happen if i drank much more and i drank much more anyhow it was my own fault i knew that too come the next morning knowing didnt help i staggered out of my wagon wishing i were dead my mouth tasted the way the gutters in thasos smell a demon drummer twenty feet tall pounded the top of my head every time my heart beat if i opened my eyes too wide i was sure i would bleed to death through them it might have been a relief right at that moment i probably didnt look much like prince halim eddin as i say followers of the quadrate god dont drink or at least theyre not supposed to there are exceptionsoh indeed there arebut i couldnt have told you if the prince was one of them thinking of him though helped steady me on my feet i ate some raw cabbage the lokrian hangover cure i ate some tripe soup the hassocki hangover cure i had the hair of the dog that bit me my personal hangover cure put them all together and i was at least within screaming distance of my old selfif a bit on the flatulent sideby the time max emerged he looked as bad as id felt a little earlier he had his head in his hands as if afraid hed lose it he didnt just have the hair of the dog he had the tail and the ears and one of the hind legs and a little tripe soup to go with it everybody has to find his own cure for the morning after max of wittes worked for him and faster than mine worked for me one of the things that proved is his liver is made of sterner stuff than mine he gave me a sepulchral smilealmost the only kind he ownsand said and how are you this morning your majesty he was joking the way everybody had been the night before i took a deep breath max i said how would you like to be the aidedecamp to the new king of shqiperi he looked at me as if he thought id gone smack out of my mind i think youve gone smack out of your mind he said why i grabbed the copy of the thasos chronicle ludovic had brought in i opened it to the story about how the shqipetari were looking for a new king sure as sure that wasor might as well have beenmy face looking out from the page i tapped it with my forefinger then i tapped the end of my own nose theyre looking for prince halim eddin the hassockian atabegs nephew and by the two prophets well give them halim eddin i tapped my nose again actually the two prophets had very little to do with becoming king of shqiperi except in the negative sense like the hassocki most shqipetari follow the quadrate god that was why they were interested in halim eddin and not one of the nine million unemployed princelings from schlepsig or narbonensis or torino i didnt think the other kingdoms in the nekemte peninsula would be particularly thrilled at that like the lokrians vlachia and belagora and plovdiv and dacia all reverence the two prophets even if they are zibeonite heretics max looked from me to the journal and back again all right you look the part he admitted but how much hassocki do you speak enough to assure thee that thou art the bastard child of a poxed cameldriver and an innocent sheep he deceived and debauched i answered in that tongue one hitch in the hassocki army was enough to make me fluently obscene by the time i finished the second term i was just plain fluent languages have always come easy for meeasier than steady work his eyebrows leaped thats pretty goodthou shriveled and flyblown horse turd max knew some hassocki too i thought id remembered that it would help are you game i pushed him if you turn yellow on me now youll never forgive yourself and you know it if we pull this off people will still be talking about it a hundred years from now and if we dont the shqipetari will murder us or maybe the hassockian soldiers still in their country will beat them to the punch max was not an optimist but then as ive found since nobody whos ever had much to do with the land of the eagle is an optimist taken all in all the nekemte peninsula is a backwater well shqiperi is a backwater even by the standards of the nekemte peninsula its mountainous its isolated the hassocki garrison there was long since cut off from any hope of relief or rescue the national sport as far as anyone can tell is the blood feud but i could be a king i looked down my nose so much like prince halim eddins nose at max well actually i looked up it at him since hes about six feet eight in my toploftiest tones i said i dont think youve got the nerve if hed had only the hair of the dog he probably would have laughed and told me i was right with a good deal more than that aboard though his pinched sallow cheeks turned red who hasnt he growled ill go anywhere you go otto and you know it cursed well and i did wed been some strange places together max and i and who was watching whose back wasnt always obvious all right i said roaring as gently as any sucking dove all right the first place we need to go is a public crystal why max asked so we can tell the world were sticking our head in the dragons mouth he opened his mouth very wide and bit down the effect would have been more dramatic if he didnt have a missing front tooth it somehow impaired his ferocity no no no i said what are the shqipetari and essad pasha going to need before they think halim eddin is on his way essad pasha was the hassocki general in command of the garrison there before the war hed been the hassocki governor of shqiperi he had fingers in so many pies he probably had about four hands max looked at me i was going to say a hunting license but i dont suppose they bother with them there funny man you should do vaudeville and musichall turns instead of this i said what theyll need is a crystal message from vyzance saying hes on his way and how do you propose to get them to send one thou great lion of the perfumиd bedchamber thou running rabbit on the bloodfilled field max dropped into hassocki again its a good language for beingcharming in i just grinned i hadnt served those two hitches in the hassocki army for nothingthough with what the hassocki pay it often seemed that way at the time it so happens that im friends with a certain murad bey he was a lieutenant when i was a sergeant these days hes a major in the hassockian ministry of war and hed send a message like that max shook his head he does dubious very well wouldnt he sooner send one ordering us arrested and handed over to the torturers i know this man i tell you its possible hell say no if he thinks the empires honor is touched i said but if he says hell send the message i need hell send it he likes practical jokes did i ever tell you about the time when he had three different officers thinking theyd got the colonels courtesan pregnant the jokell be on us if the torturers are waiting max pointed out but itll be a bigger joke if its on essad pasha and the shqipetari i said torturing foreigners is easy it happens all the time making one of your own generals look like a fool though max didnt answer right away instead he went to work on the dogs other hind leg after he set down the jug he got to his feet this had better work he said if it doesnt ill never forgive you if it didnt hed probably be too dead to forgive me of course id probably be too dead to need forgiving i stood up too lets get moving i said lokrian soldiers swaggered through the streets of thasos they were little dark men in green uniforms they had kepis and neatly trimmed mustaches there were also soldiers from plovdiv off to the northwest in the streets they were bigger and fairer and wore tobaccobrown uniforms they had floppy hats and big bushy mustaches they didnt look as if they much cared for lokrians the lokrians didnt look as if they much cared for them either lokris and plovdiv had been allies against the hassocki of course everybody in the nekemte peninsulaexcept the shqipetari mind youhad been allies against the hassocki now here in thasos you could watch the thieves fall out that round of fighting didnt start till later though so im not going to talk about it now if you talk about all the wars youll never get around to anything else both the soldiers from lokris and the soldiers from plovdiv looked as if they didnt much care for max and me i did my best not to notice or not to be noticed noticing blithe ignorance tends to fray though when somebody aims a crossbow at your brisket after a moment when max and i just kept walking the lokrian lowered the cursed thing and grinned as if hed been joking maybe he had but not even dooger and cark would hire a clown with a sense of humor like that nice fellow i remarked in schlepsigian if the lokrian soldier spoke my languagenot likely but not impossiblehe couldnt have proved by my tone that i was being sarcastic sure is max said just as heartily neither one of us is usually such a good liar so early in the morning the dual monarchy has a post office in thasos narbonensis has one so does albion so does schlepsig and so did the hassocki it was their city after all now thats a lokrian post office the green dragon flies above it not the red lightning bolt on gold right next to whats now the lokrian post office is the local consolidated crystal headquarters consolidated crystal doesnt belong to any one kingdom they say their services belong to people from all the kingdomspeople with the money to pay for them of course actually in a lot of ways theyre above all the kingdoms because what they do is so important any kingdom that tried to interfere with them would end up in trouble with all its neighbors nobody talks about that but everybody knows it we went in max held the door open for me your majesty he murmuredand then let go of the door so it swung shut and got me in the seat of the pants some aidedecamp you turned out to be i said i should have asked ilona theres a difference between aidedecamp and camp follower max said loftily he was lucky ilona wasnt there to hear that she would have followed him all rightwith a knife inside the cc headquarters you never would have known that thasos had changed hands not long before or that fighting still sputtered not far away everything was peaceful and orderly peoplelokrians hassocki an albionese merchant in baggy tweeds uswaited in line for the next available crystallographer lots of places in thasos lines just sit there they dont move not at cc headquarters perish the thought those people know what efficiency means we got to the front of the line pretty quick good morning gentlemen the clerk said in fluent schlepsigian id already heard him use lokrian and hassocki a man of parts plainly and smart parts at that i look like halim eddinand i had the picture to prove itwhile max could be anything under the sun except handsome but this clever young fellow pegged us the crystallographer he sent us to also spoke schlepsigian though with a hassocki accent to whom do you wish to send your message gentlemen he asked to major murad bey at the ministry of war in vyzance i answered he blinked i hope the lokrians sorcerers will pass it he said lokris and the hassockian empire are still at war you know really i hadnt noticed i said he was a swarthy man but his cheeks went pink anyhow i went on i suppose theyll use the intent test theyre welcome to for i mean no harm to lokris ah good excellent in fact he blinked again you know something of this business a little something maybeno more i knew a good deal more but that wasnt the crystallographers affair its a long story in fact i wasnt even there when they thought i was if i was there i didnt do it if i did do it i didnt mean it and if i did mean it the bastard had it coming but i digress back to it here is the message i gave it to him finishing please acknowledge at cc office thasos ill send it they will vet it the crystallographer warned i shrugged he bent low over the crystal on his desk in places like albion and narbonensis crystallographers wear turbans to look mystical in thasos ordinary people wear turbans the crystallographer probably wore one himself when he went off duty here he had on a homburg to look modern he murmured the necessary charms and the eightdigit number that made sure he reached a particular crystal in vyzance and not one in say lutetia nobody in the capital of narbonensis needed to know anything about this no not yet light flared in the heart of the transparent crystal sphere as it faded i saw the tiny image of another crystallographer he too had a homburg on his head vyzance sure enough our crystallographer recited the message the other crystallographer read it back his voice sounded as if it came from very far away as a matter of fact it did come from very far away even if the crystal sat right there in front of it when the men on both sides of the connection agreed they had the message straight they broke the arcane link the crystal on the crystallographers desk went back to being a bocci ball for ghosts you told the truthi had no interference from the lokrians our crystallographer said if there is a reply to thiscommunication it will be delivered to you at the carnival circus i said indignantly eliphalet help mezibeon toothere is another step down from dooger and carks ive played in carnivals i hope i never have to do it again its not honest work and thats the best i can say for it the crystallographer would have had to cheer up to seem unimpressed go in peace he murmured north and south east and west go in peace yes he followed the quadrate god north and south east and west peace to you as well i said in hassocki his big dark eyes widened he didnt hear that every day from an obvious follower of the two prophets max and i had to stand in another line to settle the tab for the message anywhere in thasos but here we could have dickered to our hearts content we could have drawn up chairs ordered some thick sweet hassockistyle coffee taken a few puffs from the mouthpiece of a water pipe and told the clerk what a thief he was lokrians are as mad for haggling as hassocki but not at consolidated crystal one price per word all over the civilized world and in as many of the barbarous parts as they reach they dont even charge extra in tver and if that doesnt prove my point nothing ever would now what max asked as we left the cc offices we wait to find out whether this murad bey is as daft as you are i wouldnt have put it precisely like that since max had though i swept off my hat and gave him my grandest bow what else i said we could make our funeral arrangements now he suggested well probably be too busy dying to do it later before i could find something suitably devastating to say to that he shook his head nowouldnt help no undertaker here is going to have a branch office in shqiperi think on the bright side for heavens sake i said youre going to be aidedecamp to a king youll help make decisions of state and youll brag about it afterwards as long as you live twenty minutes worth of bragging oh joy max is a good fellow in a great many ways but hes convinced every silver lining has a cloud we stopped on the way back to the circus and bought sausages skewered on sticks and then dipped in maize batter and fried a local delicacy indigestible enough to satisfy the most ambitious dyspeptic the sausageseller was a lokrianprobably not named kleon worse luck he tried to charge us some outrageous price because we were foreigners i couldnt tell him what i thought of him in his own language but figured he was likely to understand hassocki thou dog and son of a dog thou wouldst steal the silver set on the eyes of thy mothers corpse may the fleas of a thousand camels afflict thy scrotum he returned amiably we haggled in hassocki though some of the gestures we used had nothing to do with numbers i finally argued him down to something approaching reason max bit into his sausage the batter crunched grease ran down his chin he nodded approval not bad theyd go good with a seidel or two of beer now what passes for beer in thasos is a far cry from what we brew in schlepsig much of it indeed tastes as if it has passedthrough the kidneys of a diabetic donkey still as they say any beer is better than none and the food had plenty of flavor to make up for what the drink lacked we found a beer cellar we found its productadequate having swallowed the last bite of sausage max swallowed the stick tooafter his sword it hardly made an hors doeuvre the tapmans eyes almost bugged out of his head i hopedand so no doubt did maxhed be astonished enough to give us our next seidel free he wasnt he didnt bit by bit naпvetй leaks out of the world i was looking forward to shqiperi i was sure naпvetй lingered there it must have or the shqipetari wouldnt have believed a king would solve their problems or maybe essad pasha being a hassocki general thought a king of his own blood would solve his problems when we got back to the circus tent we started practicing for the evening show max had no trouble i discovered doing trapeze flips with one of those sausages in my stomach was every bit as enjoyable as if id swallowed a thirtypound catapult stone instead if i had a weak stomach i never would have turned acrobat in the first place but i dont think i ever put it to a sterner test i was upside down in midair when i spotted the messenger boy in the blue cc uniform are you looking for otto of schlepsig i called in hassocki as soon as i was right side up again thats right sir are you he the kid spoke with a lokrian accent but we could understand each other i am no one else but the king of acrobats otto himself hard to strike a pose while hanging from a trapeze but i managed if a man will not blow a blast from his own horn it shall remain unblown forever i cut the rehearsal short to see what murad bey had to say no one else was likely to send me a crystal message not unless some of my stubborner creditors had finally found out what show i was playing in i gave the messenger boy a couple of coppers and sent him on his way my thumbnail cracked the wax seal on the message i unrolled the paper and read the transcription it was from murad bey that which you asked me to accomplish my brother it is accomplished he wrote go then and may good fortune attend you ha i said and ha again i turned a couple of backflips suddenly the sausage seemed to weigh nothing at all i carried the message over to max here take a look at this he made a gurgling noise he had some considerable length of steel down his throat in due course it came out again he wiped off the bladeswallowing a rusty sword is probably not something he wanted to do then he took the message and scowled at it whats it say he asked i speak some hassocki but i dont read it some aidedecamp youll make i muttered and translated what murad bey had said right about now another messenger boy in a blue consolidated crystal uniform would be delivering not one but two messages to essad pasha in shqiperi one of them would purport to come from the hassockian atabeg himself and would say prince halim eddin is coming he has supreme command over all troops present in shqiperi the other would pretend to come from the high command of the hassocki army in vyzance and would say prince halim eddin is coming immediately turn over supreme command in shqiperi to him max clapped a hand to his forehead it happened to be the hand holding the sword but he didnt cut himself you are out of your mind he said yes my dear but i have fun i pulled him down to my height and kissed him on both cheeks he said something in hassocki i wont repeat even in translation i laughed why not the plota really pretty little plot if i do say so myselfhad started to move another show down like most shows it was measured more by what didnt happen than by what did ilona didnt come out of her costume the lions didnt eat cadogan or even sharpen their claws on him the mammoth didnt squash ilona or any of the clowns max didnt cut his throat from the inside out or otherwise and i didnt splatter myself in the middle of the ring the marks ate it up anyway maybe we were better than usual maybe what with everything that had happened to thasos lately they were starved for anything that might be amusing i know which way id bet after the performance i caught maxs eye he tried to pretend he didnt see me he made an elaborate production of lighting up a stogie that would do his cough a world of good i walked over to him come on i said the time has come youre not going to back out on me are you he looked as if he would have liked nothing better but then if you wait for max to look enthusiastic youll wait till the final prophecy comes true and twenty minutes longer puffing a cloud of noxious smoke he unfolded himself from his stool he towered over me and im not short lets get it over with he said as if about to call on the toothdrawer side by side we went up to dooger and cark they were side by side too behind the table where they counted the take as far as they were concerned money counted for more than a couple of performers eventually though since we didnt go away they had to notice us or to admit they did dooger looked over at cark were at he said yes cark agreed in that nameless accent of his they both wrote the figure down the important business temporarily suspended they could deal with the likes of us what is it dooger demanded of me it had better be interesting his tone warned i dont think he sleeps in a coffin but i wouldnt swear i know bloody well he doesnt sleep with meand a good thing too says i max coughed it had nothing to do with the stinking cigar it just gave him an excuse not to talk me i never need an excuse to talk bossbosseswe quit i said we want our pay up through tonight you cant do that cark said if what he gave us wasnt the evil eye ive never seen it hes a squat little toadlike fellow who doesnt blink much at the best of times when hes angry he doesnt blink at all its unnerving it really is you start wondering when you last paid a temple a proper visit i stood there and waited max stood there with me eliphalet bless him obviously we could walk out whenever we cursed well pleased whether we could get paidthat was a more intricate question dooger tilted his head back so he could look down his nose at me even though i was standing up what are you going to do he asked run off and be a king he laughed at his own joke even cark let out a couple of dry little croaks that might have stood for amusement i bowed to each of them in turn how did you guess i answered and since youre making free with the royal treasury we ought to throw you out on your arse your majesty dooger turned it into a title of scorn as if by real sorcery a couple of hulking roustabouts appeared behind him wheep maxs sword slid out of the scabbard the blade glittered in the torchlight i was so used to thinking of it as a prop for his act id almost forgotten about it as a weapon so plainly had dooger and cark but any sword that would slice bread would do a pretty fair job of slicing circus proprietor too i think perhaps you might want to reconsider as usual max sounded as if he couldnt care less whether he lived or died that made him more scary not less dooger and cark went back and forth in a nameless tongue possibly carks birthspeech cark gestured to the roustabouts they vanished into the shadows as fast as theyd shown up maybe dooger really had conjured them out of thin air i wouldnt put it past him he glared at us now well pay you he said heavily well pay you all right and well blacken your names from vyzance to baile atha cliath i laughed in his face as if telling anybody we had to work for dooger and carks wouldnt do the job dooger said something in yagmar off behind us ilona let out a yip of surprise and possibly horror so it must have been choice without a word cark slammed coins down on the table they came from all over the known world lokrian leptas and fractions hassocki piasters dinars from from vlachia dinars from belagora which are heavier a thaler or two out of the dual monarchy a couple of livres from narbonensis some schlepsigian krams and a few shillings from albion happy now dooger growled when cark stopped doling out silver let me use your scale i told him that made him growl some more and cark too but they passed it over when i got everything balanced the alleged pay was light not by a lot mind you but light i didnt say anything the scales spoke for themselves muttering cark tossed a big silver cartwheel onto the left pan the shekel from faroff vespucciland almost made the scales balance a sixthdinar piecesilver so thin you could almost see through itevened things out happy now cark croaked delighted i told him and i was too we had money we had a plan and the worst that could happen to us was death by torture what was there to worry about i used the scales again this time to make sure max and i came out even that sixthdinar piece and a couple of others nearly as light proved handy for getting things right youre really leaving ludovic said when wed settled our business with the proprietors i dont know whether to be angry or jealous cadogan looked glum enough to let his lions eat him i wish i could go too he said sounding almost as somber as max why dont you i asked he stared at me the way people always stare when youve asked a really stupid question dont be silly otto whod take me if i left this outfit it wasnt that he was wrong either poor bastard ilona came up to me like ludovic she asked youre really leaving when i nodded she kissed me hard enough to make every hair in my mustacheamong other thingsstand on end once i could see straight again i wheezed eliphalet why didnt you ever do that before she batted her eyelashes at me but darling you might have thought i meant it before i could either grab her or slug herilona usually made you want to do both at onceshe adhered to max i dont know how else to describe it she kissed him even more thoroughly than she had me his eyes lit up he wiggled his ears he really didthe mammoth couldnt have done it better colorveritable pinkcame into his sallow cheeks all things considered he looked amazingly lifelike when the clinch finally brokeand he milked it for all it was worth and then somehe leered down at ilona and murmured well sweetheart are you a swordswallower too she slapped him just as hard as shed kissed him the party went on from there it got drunk out though not quite as drunk as it had the night we played our first show in thasos a good thing too im getting too old to do that as often as i used to i dont like to believe that i dont want to believe it but my carcass reminds me of it more forcefully with each year that goes by even dooger and cark having finished counting their more or less illgotten gains came over to hoist a few dooger put an arm around my shoulder i kept my eye on his other hand to make sure he didnt try filching what cark had been so pleased to pay me he affected not to notice ah my boy he said sounding tiddlier than he was i love you like my own son do you i said is that the one you sold to the tzigany he laughed though i hadnt been upwards of twosevenths kidding a funny man too he said you should put on a clown suit and go on with the rest of that troupe otto the impossible youd have star billing no thanks i said which is what anyone in his right mind should say when dooger starts scheming if saying no thanks doesnt do the job running away quickly may still save you since i was going to run away anyhowfor once in my life not running away to join the circusi went on id hate cleaning white greasepaint out of my mustache every night shave it off as usual dooger had all the answers also as usual most of them were to the wrong questions he and cark tried to raise a stink about letting max and me sleep in our wagons one more night after wed left the company everybody else screamed at them even some of the roustabouts sided with us and so with poor grace the proprietors backed down i had the feeling theyd take it out on the rest of the company first chance they got the wagons springs creaked when i settled myself in my cot i expected id wake up with a headache in the morning but not with the galloping horrors id had not long before most headaches are soluble in hassocki coffee i dont know how long id been asleep when the springs creaked again and the wagon shifted somebody besides me was in there roustabouts were dooger and cark going to throw me out after the rest of the company had gone to bed not without a fight they werent i reached outand touched warm smooth bare flesh ilona giggled if id done this before darling she whispered you might have thought i meant it the springs did considerable creaking after that let me tell you i didnt have a headache the next morning either did she visit max too before me or afterwards to this day i dont know im sorry for him if she didnt though iii max and i even got breakfast the next morning if dooger and cark didnt deduct the cost of our rolls and honey and coffee from the companys share they were missing a trick and they dont miss many tricks like that and speaking of a roll with honey ilona was sweetly impersonal to me and to max both her manner said nothing had happened in the nighttimeand even if it had it hadnt she did kiss us goodbye on the cheek she stood on tiptoe and max bent down so she could reach his then duffels slung over our shoulders we were on our own max looked as if his rowboat had just sunk in seaserpentinfested waters i felt a little rocky myself to tell you the truth not having the troupe at my back was daunting these were the people who were always ready when things seemed bad to tell you why they were really worse they were also the people who would try to pitch in and make them better and now wed turned our backs on them well max said lugubriously what next your majesty he didnt make that as noxious as dooger had the night before from him it felt more like you sap id been thinking about what next in the odd moments when i wasnt thinking about ilona or about almost getting skinned by dooger and cark were playing roles right i said roles yes except on the stage of life not the one where they throw cabbages if you blow your lines theyll do worse than that if we blow our lines max said ignoring him i went on if were playing roles what do we need better sense he suggested he was getting harder to ignore but i managed i am a man of many talents we need costumes i said if i remember rightly prince halim eddin is a colonel in the hassocki army and if youre going to be my aidedecamp you should be a captain or something if im going to be your aidedecamp i should have my head examined max said did anyone candle thy skull hed doubtless find it empty i said in hassocki better empty than full of thy madness the which is worse than a dogs and more assuredly fatal max replied in the same language his accent was improving with practice he didnt ask me where we would come by hassocki officers uniforms the atabegs officersand menhad done everything they could to escape when forces from lokris and plovdiv converged on thasos everything included shedding their uniforms and sneaking away in civilian clothesor for all i knew naked all the tailors shops in threadneedle street displayed discarded dustybrown hassocki military togs we could pick and choose or i could anyway i am a goodsized man but neither enormously tall nor enormously wide the second tailor we visited had exactly what i needed right down to the boots and the belt buckle and the epaulets we haggled for a while he even knocked off another piaster and a half when i noticed a very neatly repaired tear in the back of the jacket it was about what a rapier would have made going in no sign of a bloodstain around it even on the inside of the material cold water will soak them out if youre patient and who ever heard of an impatient tailor but when i asked about a captains uniform for max this fellow bowed and shook his head my liver is wrung o most noble one he said in hassocki which wed been using but i have none fit for a man of his ah altitude no no max shook his head otto is his highness here the tailor scratched his head i made as if to kick max without moving a muscle he let me know that wouldnt be a good idea i turned back to the tailor know you my good man if any of your colleagues might have attire suitable to his stature i know not i fear me it is written seek and ye may find id always heard it as seek and ye shall find considering how max is put together the tailors version made better sense verily it is so written or if it be not written so so should it be written i said he was chewing on that as max and i left his shop max looked as if he was also chewing on that or possibly on his cud by the time wed walked into the next tailors shop i was chewing on it myself it certainly sounded as if it ought to mean something whether it did or not we ended up walking into every tailors establishment on threadneedle street every tailor without exception took one dismayed look at max rolled his eyes shook his head and threw up his hands im not cut out to be an aidedecamp max said maybe i should go as your stepladder instead did eliphalet lose heart when he faced the tharpian king of kings i demanded keep your chin up man he did it made him look even taller he must have known as much too for he said eliphalet wasnt six feet eight not on the outside i said and cribbed from a hymn in spirit he was ten feet tall nobody ever tries to put your spirit in a uniform max said which was true but so resolutely unhelpful that i pretended not to hear it right next to threadneedle street is copperbottom alley thats not where the tinkers and potmakers work their establishments are along the street of the boiled second stomacha hassocki delicacy that loses something in the translation and even more i assure you in the ingestion no copperbottom alley houses secondhand shops and houses of the three gold globes and other not quite shady not quite sunny enterprises i was sure we could buy hassocki captains uniforms there i was fairly sure we could buy ourselves a couple of hassocki captains if for some reason we happened to need them whether we could find a uniform to fit maxwell i wasnt so sure about that but i wasnt about to admit i wasnt so sure either when we walked into the first secondhand shop the proprietor a round little hassocki shook his head i am wounded to the very heart of me that i find myself unable to aid my masters he said but perhaps they will seek the place of business of manolis the lokrian north and south east and west by the strength of my bowels no one else in thasos is more likely to possess that which should you acquire it would make your spirits sing manolis the lokrian proved to run a house of the three gold globes halfway along copperbottom alley luckily he wrote his name on the window in hassocki characters as well as his own a bell above his door jangled when max and i went in gentlemen i am at your service ask of me what you would he said he bowed and straightened and bowed again i didnt ask him anything at once i was too busy staring i saw at once why the rolypoly hassocki had sent us to him he had to be an inch or two taller even than max the two of them were also staring at each other very tall men arent used to running into people their own size they need to decide whos bigger and how surprised theyre going to be about it have you by any chance a hassocki captains uniform to fit my friend i asked he broke out laughing i do he said i do by zibeons forelock i do i have the very thing i reminded myself he was a lokrian and so unlikely to know better i also reminded myself how big he was taller than max who would have believed it he went on during the ah late unpleasantness i purchased this from an officer desirous of decamping in such secrecy as he mightthough when a man is of his stature or mine or your friends secrecy is hard to come by laterhe preened his mustaches between thumb and forefingeri had occasion to wear it to personate the fled hassocki and lure his comrades out of a strong and safe position this i accomplished he stood even straighter than usual so the uniform had already been used in one masquerade had it a paltry scheme next to minebut still i took it for a good omen i said may we see this famous outfit manolis bowed once more certainly my master certainly but what ails your friend can he not speak for himself no max croaked i never learned how the lokrian broker scratched his head tugged at his mustaches again and disappeared into a back room he returned with a neatly folded dustbrown uniform unfolded it did indeed prove suitable for a man of maxs inches the sleeves and trouser legs were slightly too short but only slightly it fit max a good deal better than it would have manolis who was not only taller but wider through the shoulders and had the beginnings of a paunch imagining max with a paunch is like imagining a nightingale with a bagpipe i doubted the hassocki who saw manolis in disguise were inclined to be critical anyone who could wear that uniform without turning it into a tent had to carry conviction i spoke next with a certain amount of worry ah how much might you want for such an item o most heroic and valiant one well i had not really purposed selling it at all manolis replied my thought was to save it for my grandchildren a token of the time when thasos passed out of slavery and into freedom half the citys populace would have juggled nouns and prepositions there but never mind he continued if i were to sell it i should need to be suitably compensated for the future loss to my heirs and assigns what do you reckon suitable compensation i inquired more cautiously yet he named a price i did not faint i do not know why i did not faint i merely state the fact he added i suspect you may encounter a certain amount of difficulty finding such a uniform here or elsewhere i suspected he was right no i knew too well he was right nevertheless i said and i suspect you are a saucy robber dustbrown cloth is cheap as pistachios in thasos right now i could have a tailor make me a uniform for half what you ask that would still cost too much and take too long something manolis did not need to know he scowled down at me a fearsome scowl from such a giant would have put most men of ordinary size in fear for their lives i however am bold beyond the meanand used to max scowling down at me again the hair of the dog that now could not bite me seeing me unafraid and unabashed manolis named a more reasonable figure i named one in return why thou brazen son of a poisontongued serpent he cried impute to me not thy parentage i said sweetly thou admittest thy brazenness i see which is as well for thou wouldst prove thyself liar as well as cheat didst thou seek to disclaim it manolis scowled again and clenched his big fists when i still failed to wilt he came down some more we haggled through the morning just after he called me something too infamous even to repeat he poured coffee for max and me with his own hands both the insult and the coffee were politenesses of the trade as noon approached we struck a bargain it was more than i wanted to pay but less than a tailor would have cost me not perfect but good enough in this sorry world of ours good enough isgood enough manolis sigh would have sailed a schooner halfway to vyzance thus vanishes a part of thasos history and a grand part too my silver also vanished into a stout cashbox he kept under the counter so much for history at least to the lokrian as for me i had all i could do to keep from jumping in the air and clicking my heels together as we left the house of the three gold globes manolis might have thought he was making history with the tall hassockis uniform but max would really do it of course he would be but a footnote to my reign but even so his own view of all this was rather less exalted nice to know ill be properly dressed for my execution he remarked if you get any more cheerful i dont know how ill be able to stand the joy i said he raised an eyebrow is that what they call sarcasm i wouldnt know ive never heard the word before what does it mean i said max pondered that it seemed to satisfy him for he nodded where now he asked why the port i said unless youd rather go to shqiperi by land that is i dont much want to go to shqiperi at all he said normally this is a sentiment with a great deal to recommend it in fact almost the entire world has wanted to avoid the land of the eagle throughout its history which is how the shqipetari have ended up living there nevertheless going by land through the sputtering remains of the nekemte wars struck me as an idea singularly bad even by the standards associated with shqiperi the port i said again and set off toward the sea max max followed me people write poems about the open sea the waves and the wind and the soaring gulls and i dont know what all else im a showman not a poet but i do know one thing nobody in his right mind pens poems about a harbor for one thing its hard to wax poetic about stinks the open sea smells fresh and well oceanic at least till you go belowdecks the port of thasos on the other hand smells like the darvar river which runs into it and the darvar river not to put too fine a point on it smells like sewage along with this ruling theme there are grace notes bilgewater from the ships tied up at the quays essence of unwashed sailor cheap perfume from the joy girls the unwashed sailors seek the occasional dead dog or dead body and other stenches reeks and miasmas my asthma would have been very bad there if id had any to begin with shqiperis chief portindeed for all practical purposes shqiperis only portis the grand metropolis of fushekuqe which is every bit as famous and magnificent as the fact that youve never heard of it would suggest the harbormaster was a lean weathered hassocki named bayezid he looked like a recentlyperhaps too recentlyretired pirate a big gold hoop glittered in his left ear his right earlobe was oddly scarred and shriveled as if a big gold hoop had been removed from it by force he unlike you had heard of fushekuqe his job involved knowing the ports around the middle sea even the sleepy and obscure ones when i said we wanted to go there he raised an elegantly plucked eyebrow you do he said north and south east and west my masters why to put on a performancea special performance i replied which was true enough all the same max choked slightly bayezid affected not to notice you will know your own business best i am sure he murmured and ive never been called an idiot more politely he gathered himself there is i fear no way to book passage straight from thasos to fushekuqe commerce between the two citieswell to be candid there is no commerce between the two cities max brightened no doubt hoping he was off the hook i contrived to tread on his toes not too hard there is bound to be a direct route from thasos to lakedaimon i said oh yes the harbormaster nodded and looked pained at the same time i might have known he would lakedaimon is the capital of lokris and he could not have felt too kindly toward lokrians just then he proved as much in fact continuing had you come here a week later i daresay you would have found a man from that other kingdomhe wouldnt even dignify lokris by naming itin my place he might have been able to find fushekuqe on a map assuming he could read but as for getting you there that elegant eyebrow climbed again since we are lucky enough to have you in his stead your excellency perhaps in your sagacity you will be able to assist us hassocki is almost as good for flowery compliments as it is for insults bayezid bowed i am your slave he pointed to a pier a furlong or so to the west of his cramped and tiny office yonder lies the keraunos the name means thunderbolt in that kingdoms tongue she sails for lakedaimon at the fourth hour of the afternoon and is due there at the same time tomorrow his eyebrow went up once more she will be late i hope she will not be too late to keep you from catching the halcyon which sails for fushekuqe at midnight from the quay of the redfigure winecup he checked no references no schedules or almanacs or anything of the sort he knew i didnt envy the lokrian who would replace him even if the man was good bayezid was a lot better than merely good what if were too late to catch the halcyon i asked north and south east and west all is as the quadrate god wills the harbormaster said which told me less than it might have but he went on three days after that my master the gamemeno sails out of lakedaimon from the quay of the poxed trollop after ah several stops she too will put in at fushekuqe again no books but he knew that sounded inauspicious max summed up just how inauspicious it sounded by asking is she a smuggler or a pirate the gamemeno yes bayezid answered well i said as brightly as i could well just have to hope the uh keraunos wont be late good luck my friend bayezid said plainly meaning youll need it he added one word more lokrians from everything ive ever seen lokrians are not the most punctual people in the worldand as a man of schlepsig i ought to know a thing or two about punctuality from everything ive seen though hassocki are the one folk who might outdelay lokrians i somehow doubted the curse of tardiness hovered over bayezids head but it does afflict his countrymen when i tried to tip the harbormaster for his trouble and his help he turned me down flat truly he was a man in a thousand i dont think id ever met a hassocki who wouldnt pocket a little baksheesh before come to that plenty of schlepsigians wouldnt have been sorry to listen to a few extra coins jingle in their pockets but he told me noeliphalet be my witness if the lokrians sacked him their new man would have made them sorry in short order max and i walked up the quay to the thunderbolt bird droppings dappled the planks under our feet a pelican glided by overhead looking like a gull apprenticed to a dragon seeing something that size on the wing made me glad i had a hat ahoy i called when we got to the ship i must say its appearance didnt live up to its name it was beamy and wearylooking with untidy rigging and a crew who couldnt have been more than two steps up from pirates half of them wore earrings to put bayezids to shame the skipper however had on a uniform with more plumes and epaulets and tassels andrather tarnishedgold braid than the grand high admiral of schlepsigs old forkbeard of course commands ships of the line and frigates by the score whereas this fellow had the keraunos prophets help him he looked down at us with no great liking from under the brim of his threecornered hat and asked what you want in fair narbonese passage to lakedaimon sir i answered in the same language he sized us up i did the same with him he was a sour pinchfaced fellow heading into middle age and no happier about it than anyone else calculation glittered in his eyes which were set too close together judging what the traffic will bear i decided the fare he named showed hed misjudged iteither that or greed had got the better of him i bowed good day to you sir and may your voyage be prosperous i said we are not murderers on the run to take passage regardless of the price lets go max we started back toward the harbormasters office thou wouldst suck seeds from a sick sows turds he said in hassocki before adding do not go in narbonese i spoke in hassocki too an i did id kiss thy mother i did wait to see what would happen next those closeset eyes widened for a moment i thought hed turn his cutthroats loose on max and me but he decided it was funny instead and laughed his head off the foreign gentleman took me by surprise knowing this language so well he said speaking hassocki far more fluently than he did narbonese he added something in gurgling lokrian that probably meant do you understand my language too i just dipped my head the way lokrians will when they mean yes and looked wise he could make whatever he wanted of that he didnt haggle so hard in hassocki as he would have in narbonese my knowing one of the local languages made me seem less foreign to him i wasnt someone who existed only to be gouged we got a cabin for a pretty good rate the sailor who led us to the cabin spoke some hassocki is crowded space you two fit he sounded genuinely anxious for our comfort no matter how villainous he looked i dont know if he was but he sounded that way if i dont break my skull on these cursed beams beforehand max grumbled the keraunos corridors and passageways were not made for a man of his inches in fact they werent made for a man of my inches and i own fewer than max he had to walk stooped over whenever he was belowdecks and the crossbeams or whatever you call them were a special hazard no matter how careful he tried to be he banged his head two or three times before we got to the cabin is all right the sailor opened the door we ducked inside it was crowded no room to swing a cat ive heard sailors say why anyone would want to do that to a poor harmless cat is beyond me but never mind next to the room we dont have in a circus wagon though that little cabin might have been a palace as a matter of fact it was nearly as grand as the shqipetari royal palace but i didnt know that yet i reached into my pocket and gave the sailor the two coins i pulled out a piaster and a semilepta he bowed like a folding jackknife zibeons blessings upon you my master he said and scurried away i would rather have had eliphalets but in that part of the world you take what you can get you also do your best to make sure other people dont take what they can getor rather that they cant get it i had the lock that kept lightfingered strangers and no doubt lightfingered acquaintances too out of my wagon when i wasnt around i wasnt worried about taking it whoever dooger and cark hired to replace me would have a lock of his own i put it on the cabin door now it was cold iron so i hoped it would be proof against wizardry as well as lockpicks do you suppose its the fourth hour of the afternoon yet i asked max he looked out the little round windowall right the porthole im no sailor and i dont pretend to be oneto gauge the sun getting close anyhow he answered does it seem were about to leave the harbor he shook his head a ships crew always goes a little mad when they set sail or weigh anchor or do whatever they need to do to start i dont know why they need to weigh the anchor isnt knowing the bloody things heavy enough but when they do it people run every which way and shout like men possessed if the wind isnt favorable and it usually isnt the weatherworker stands at the stern to call it into the sails in the old days you just sat there if the wind wasnt favorable you could sit there for weeks if luck went against you and if the wind died while you were at sea at sea youd stay weatherworking is one of the marvels of the modern age but most people take it for granted its a good thing the two prophets lived long ago nowadays everyone would yawn at the miracles they worked no weather was being worked at the stern sailors werent running back and forth above our heads i know the soundit puts me in mind of a herd of shoes nobody was shouting as if to prove the point a tern a gull had robbed of a fish screeched furiously maybe we ought to see whats going on i said i can see whats going on max said nothing thats what sometimes max can be annoyingly literal maybe we should find out why nothings going on i said max only shrugged i asked him do you really want to get stuck in lakedaimon for days he jumped to his feetand banged his head after rubbing the latest bruise he said lead oncarefully if you please i carefully locked the cabin door behind us we made our way to the steep stair that led us up on deck max hit his head once more but only once considering how low the ceiling was that amounted to a triumph of sorts by then though max was thoroughly out of sorts he breathed a sigh of relief when he could unfold himself on deck the captain was drinking coffee and smoking a pipe with a long stem and a bowl carved into the shape of a leaping dolphin it looked very nautical anyone who didnt know better would think hed got it from some clever grizzled lokrian craftsman whod taken weeks to shape it especially for him unfortunately i did know better any schlepsigian would we use the law of similarity to turn out those pipes by the tens of thousands for home use and the export trade about every fourth man in schlepsig smokes one so it goes he seemed surprised to see us is something amiss my masters your cabin does not suit you it is the best we had left i daresay it was too a judgment on the keraunos i fear but that for the moment was beside the point our cabin will serve i said is it not yet the fourth hour of the afternoon however he set a languid glance toward the hourglass set in front of the wheel as languidly he dipped his head in agreement why yes i do believe it is and is not this ship scheduled to sail at the fourth hour of the afternoon i asked with such patience as i could muster a schlepsigian ship would have sailed when scheduled come what may to my people schedules are as sacred as if eliphalet and zibeon wrote each and every one the wagons roll on time in schlepsig let me assure you other folk i fear have other notions oh the schedule the skipper said as if hed forgotten such a thing existed he probably had too he shrugged one of those elaborate shrugs that are only too common all over the nekemte peninsula what those shrugs say is youre cursed well stuck sucker and you cant do a thing about it so scream as much as you pleaseit wont do you any bloody good he waited no doubt hoping i would start screaming but ive seen those shrugs before indeed i have i waited too he sighed balked of his sport well my master we will sailpretty soon pretty soon in those parts can mean anything from a couple of hours to a couple of months what seems to be the trouble i asked oh this and that he gave me another shrug even more melodramatic than the first you are so anxious to be gone from thasos i knew what that meant too he wanted to know if soldiers or gendarmes or an outraged husband with a blood feud were on our trail if he could soak us for more silver to make a quick getaway he would but he couldnt not this time no by no means i said truthfully i have paid for a quick getaway or two in my time but not that day max and i were honestor no one could prove we werent i went on i just wanted to make sure you understood his bushy eyebrows came down and together in a frown understood what youre going to be late he didnt laugh in my face but the look on his said he was about to around a yawn whose studied insolence he must have spent a long time practicing he asked and so well if youre late im afraid youll make my friend here very unhappy i nodded toward max he was standing extraordinarily straight no doubt in relief from being doubled over belowdecks like a pair of trousers in a small carpetbag it made him seem even taller than usualan obelisk with ears you might say the captain of the keraunos looked him up and down and then up again and so he repeatedhe had style in a reptilian way max drew his sword the captain stiffened so did i murdering the man before we set sail might get us talked about but max didnt slice chunks off him however richly he deserved it instead he examined the blade and then took two steps over to the rail he began carving strips from the wood the strips were very long and very thinso thin you could almost see through them they came off effortlessly one after another the captain eyed them as they fluttered down to the deck one by one so did several sailors you could almost hear the wheels going round in their heads here was an uncommonly large man with an uncommonly sharp sword if they were lucky they might bring him down without getting hurt themselves if they werent so luckywhich seemed a better betone or more of them would end up skewered shashlik they say in that part of the world one of the sailors said something in lokrian i know what i would have said in his sandals assuming he had said it i nodded pleasantly to the captain and spoke in hassocki yes i think we ought to sail about now too he started to tell me something with a bit of flavor to it but then his eyes went back to max who was still slicing strips from the rail he seemed ready to cut right through itor anything else that got in his way the skipper coughed a couple of times swallowing whatever hed been about to say what came out instead was well perhaps we should i bowed always be polite after youve won many thanks kind sir i knew when i first set eyes on you that you were a reasonable man like anybody else i defined a reasonable man as a man who does what i want when i first set eyes on the keraunos weatherworker what crossed my mind was be careful what you ask foryou may get it had he been a circus performer instead of a wizard he would have worked for an outfit like dooger and carks since he was what he was he sailed on the keraunos the captain of any better ship would have booted him off the stern man and tub they deserved each other he might have been a good man once or he might have been one of those dissolute wrecks whom trouble shadows even before they have fuzz on their upper lip hed been pickling in his own juicesand the ones he poured downfor a lot of years since then the whites of his eyes were almost as yellow as the yolks of poached eggs he swayed in the slight natural breeze as if it would blow him away his hands shook so badly he couldnt light a cigar one of the sailors finally did it for him he puffed on the cheroota nasty weed flavored with anise a lokrian viceand then coughed like a dying consumptive at a gesture from the captain another sailor fetched him a flask he tilted his head back the flask gurgled so did his stomach when the nasty stuff in the flask hit it ahh he saida pungent exclamation because the rotgut was flavored with anise too his eyes crossed for a moment but when they focused again you had a better picture of the wizard he used to be then he took another pull at the flask and you knew why he wasnt that wizard any more the captain shouted to his crew as if there was no time to lose and there probably wasnt they raced up the masts like monkeys could the weatherworker get us out of thasos harbor while the popskull still fueled him and before it knocked him for a loop wed find out down came the sails from the yards the weatherworker gathered himself he began the chant that would call the wind into the sails to my surprise the words were in schlepsigian that probably showed where hed studied magic where hed studied looking up at the bottom of an empty bottle i cant tell you hed got full marks in it wherever it was for the moment though he stood precariously balanced between a hangover so devastating as to make any ive had seem a mild annoyance by comparison and drunkenness complete and absolute enough to make him forget his own name or even that he had one poor bastard max murmured recognizing the signs i nodded no it wasnt hard to see how this weatherworker had wound up on the thunderbolt for the moment the balance held i could feel the power flowing into him and then flowing out through him when he pointed to the sails with a commanding gesture his hands hardly trembled at all and that gesture by what would serve for a miracle till a real one came along did what it was supposed to do a weatherworker operating alone cant change much weather one manor womanisnt strong enough it takes great teams of them for that teams usually put together only in time of war but one weatherworker can raise enough wind to fill a ships sails and from a direction that will take the ship where the skipper wants to go at first flapping and then taut as the silk over a wellbuilt womans bosom the keraunos sails filled with wind the masts and yards creaked taking up the strain the weatherworker didnt creak but he was pretty plainly feeling the strain too he swigged from the flask yet again that might help him for a little while now but heand maybe we as wellwould pay for it later still later was later for now we began to move in the beginning so slowly that i wasnt even sure the motion was real but then faster and faster the quay disappeared behind us the captain stood at the wheel guiding the ship away from thasos the weatherworker kept on chanting our wind kept on blowing the keraunos sails kept on billowing thasosindeed dry land itselffaded and shrank in the distance were on our way i said to max were well and truly started talk to me when were on our way out of shqiperi with our heads still attached to our shoulders he said then ill be impressed if poetry were wine there wouldnt be enough in maxs soul to sozzle a squirrel and what there is has mostly soured to vinegar he has his virtues max does but his flights of fancy stubbornly refuse to grow feathers thasos sits between two long fingerlike southfacing peninsulas that shield its harbor from most storms by the time the weatherworker began to sway as if he were in a high breeze wed cleared them both we were out in the open seaor as open as the mykonian sea gets its full of rocky jagged islands as if one of the ancient lokrian gods had pissed out the ocean and passed a swarm of godsized kidney stones while he was doing it little fishing boats bobbed on the winedark water or scudded this way and that with their lateen sails they went by the real breeze the true breeze and if it died they would lie becalmed fishing boats cant afford weatherworkers by all i can tell most fishing boats cant afford a bloody thing fishing has to be a harder way to make a living than performing in a circus and i know of nothing worse i can say about it for a while the thunderbolt cracked along all sails set all sails full the weatherworker raising enough wind to keep even max from being too gloomy it seemed too good to be trueand it was the weatherworker had been gulping that aniseflavored swill every few minutes to fuel his wizardry i dont care how long youve been calcifying your liver you can only do that for so long and after a couple of hours of it it was so long for him he nodded in vague surprise broke wind instead of raising it and bonelessly crumpled to the deck the breeze died i wished the weatherworker would die too but that was bound to be too much to hope for the sails went as limp as a granddads try for a third round the keraunos stopped creaking and started crawling her skipper stirred the weatherworker with his foot the man never moved oh thou hellbound swinish sot the captain sighed in hassocki as resigned a curse as ive ever heard then he started shouting in lokrian his crew hopped to it i will say that they must have been through this many times before they shortened sail and swung the yards to take what advantage they could of the worlds wind but we were going to be late late late to lakedaimon iv once upon a time the lokrians were the most civilized people in the world all the history books insist on it and if that isnt proof weve made progress over the past couple of thousand years eliphalet curse me if i know what would be scholars go on and on about the purity of ancient lokrian sculpture the magnificence of ancient lokrian poetry the innovation and insights of ancient lokrian drama for some reason or other no one talks a whole lot about the ancient lokrians themselves and ill bet i know why they must have been just as annoying and insufferable as modern lokrians are that was what i was thinking when the keraunos finally got into lakedaimon most of a day later than the miserable ship should have we sailed into the harbor in fine style the weatherworker was working again hed come out of his stupor and hed had enough aniseflavored firewater afterwards to remind him life might still be worth living in between his spells of consciousness wed had to make do with fitful true breezes but did he care about that care he didnt even know even now lakedaimon is a pretty town the ruins on what they call fortress hill remind you of what a splendid place it was in the glory days of lokris back then of course lakedaimon tried to lord it over all its neighbors and the other lokrian citystates responded by trying to stick a stiletto in its back typical lokrian politics i fear two lokrians will have three opinions and four faction fights lokrians will ally with an enemys enemy even if they know that fellow will turn on them as soon as hes settled the first enemys hash they think well i lasted two days longer than he did and i got to gloat while he suffered so who cares what happens next charming people and theyve always been like that take a look at ancient history if you dont believe me no not the pretty storiesthe history behind them yes they held off the sassanids all those years ago yes they were heroes some of them were anyhow but an awful lot of citystates went over to the great king they fought on his side and some of them were heroes too if hed won nobody would remember lakedaimon when lakedaimon fought pallas for all those years didnt she have a couple of civil wars too wouldnt she have had a better chance of winning if she hadnt hated herself worse than she hated her enemies seems that way to me one more when the aeneans conquered lokris how did they do it werent the lokrians squabbling among themselves and with the kingdom of fyrom to the north the lokrians claim the fyromians were really lokrian toojust country cousins you might say these days fyrom is split among lokris vlachia and plovdiv factions again which argues that the lokrians might be right didnt some lokrians invite the aeneans in to help their side and didnt the aeneans pay them back by gobbling up all of lokris one citystate at a time if you look at it the right way didnt the lokrians have it coming i asked our peerless skipper where the quay of the redfigure winecup was he shrugged which made the gilded fringe on his epaulets bounce up and down i asked a couple of sailors who spoke hassocki one pointed east the other west it didnt matter the halcyon was bound to have sailed since it was crewed by lokrians too normally i would have assumed it was also running late but that would have been convenient for us so i didnt believe it for a minute then i asked the captain how to find the quay of the poxed trollop he gave me excellent precise detailed instructions somehow i was less than astonished if anyone was likely to know all there was to know about poxed trollops our captain was the man the gamemeno isnt supposed to go out for a while max said you should ask him to recommend a hostel i didnt care for that no thanks i said i want to go to a place where i wont need a mage to kill bedbugs and fleasand maybe crabs tooafterwards i remembered the trollop one more time and what might go with her we took our duffels off the keraunos and got away from the misnamed ship as fast and as far as we could two large menand max is almost two large men all by himselfare safe enough by daylight almost anywhere we waved down a cab the hackman spoke some narbonese best hostel he said when i inquired the narbo without a doubt but you pay there siryou pay whats pretty good and costs a third as much was my next question we ended up at a place called papa ioannakis it was three blocks away from the narbo the big fancy hostel blocked its view of fortress hill but it was clean it was comfortable and you didnt feel a vampire sinking its fangs into your purse and sucking out your silver the real papa ioannakis was a priest who fought the hassocki and ended up dead before his time for his troubles i neglected to point this out to max if he stayed ignorant of the fine points of lokrian historywell he did thats all i preferred ignorance to babbling about evil omens which is what i would have got if he knew that not bad i said sprawling out on my bed it would be better if we had some money coming in max said weve got enough odds are i sounded irritable i felt irritable if you want to go stand on a street corner and swallow your sword in front of an upsidedown hat go right ahead i dont feel like turning backflips just so i can buy myself an extra mug of winethanks all the same if this goes off the way i hope it will ill never have to turn another backflip as long as i live if this doesnt go off the way you hope it will youll never turn another backflip either max pointed out but you wont live long i didnt argue with him life was too short as a matter of fact i wished that phrase hadnt occurred to me so soon after his ravens croak of doom i wasnt about to admit that though either to him or to myself and i was glad all the way down to my toes that i hadnt told him the story of papa ioannakis the hostel named for the late lamented lokrian priest had a pretty fair eatery across the lobby from the front desk the waiter a fussy little man in an illfitting formal jacket and a cravat that looked as if a strangler had knotted it spoke enough narbonese to get by he beamed when we ordered local specialties max chose capon cooked with lemon while i had grape leaves stuffed with ground lamb and rice mine were quite tasty and max turned his capon into bones fast enough to persuade me that he enjoyed his the menu offered foreign dishes too but the native fare was half as expensive and probably twice as good the cook knew what he was doing with it he wasnt trying to imitate some other kingdoms style after a much better night than the two wed spent aboard the keraunos we climbed fortress hill to look at the famous ruins there yes its something everybody does yes practically everybody we saw up there was from schlepsig or the dual monarchy or narbonensis or albion the lokrians take their ruins for granted theyd have a lot more of them if they hadnt torn some down to reuse the building stone but when were we going to be in lakedaimon again if the two prophets were kind never and even if everybody goes to see the ruins theres a good reason theyre worth seeing take cythereas temple for instance you cant see the thirtyfivefoot goldandivory statue of the love goddess the lakedaimonians put in it one gang of barbarians or another stole it a long time ago but the temple itself still isand deserves to befamous for its lines youve all looked at woodcuts or those clever little spells that make a pair of pictures join together in your sight so you see not two pictures but one with real depth well the difference between those and the real thing is about the same as the difference between a journal story about a porkandcabbage casserole and a big helping of the casserole itself would you give a dog a woodcut of a bone the famous lokrian sun and sky dont translate well in descriptions either all i can tell you is they dont make weather like that in schlepsig and i wish they did it was warm without being sticky the sky was a deeper purer blue than my home kingdom ever knows up at the top of fortress hill you thought you could see all the way to the edge of the world yes i know the world hasnt got an edge you thought you could see it anyway even max was moved he took off his hat fanned himself with it and said nice view he really did and yet like i told you you hardly see any lokrians up there oh they have a few guards to keep you from sticking a temple in your hip pocket and taking it back to your hotel but thats about all waiti take it back there was also a lokrian woman up there her lines were almost as fine as the temples and she dressed to emphasize them her eyes were dark as two sloes but it was obvious she was fast is it that you speak narbonese one of my fellow foreigners asked her tipping his hat after seeing so much marble he was after something livelier he got it too she gave him a slow sidelong smile sir my mouth will do anything you like she purred in the same language after that he couldnt take her down off fortress hill fast enough i only wished id spoken to her first by the way maxs eyes followed her he was wishing the same thing no he wasnt wishing that id spoken to her first oh you know what i mean now we both looked around for something of more recent vintage and softer curves than the famous stonework we were out of luck though that miserable narbonese seemed to have snagged the only woman of ah enterprise whod gone up there that morning no wonder were hereditary foes with narbonensis by eliphalets whiskers since max and i had no pleasant excuse to go back to papa ioannakis we tramped every inch of fortress hill i got a little piece of classical marble in my shoe and had to park my fundament on a bigger one so i could take off the shoe and shake out the pebble it fell to the ground with a tiny clicka bit of ancient history returning to anonymity max meanwhile was peering down into the city somethings going on down there he said well so what i said lakedaimons a fairsized town why shouldnt something be going on no not something like that he said something nasty now maxs imagination can turn a wedding parade into a funeral procession ive seen him do it actually its impressive if you like that kind of thing so before i believed him i stood up and had a look for myself damned if he wasnt right when people start chasing one another through the streets with clubs and spears and crossbows somethings come unglued somewhere yes wed landed in lakedaimon just in time for the scriptural riots thank you so much thunderbolt everybody in the civilized world knows the scriptures were first written in ancient lokrian some sarcastic sage said a few years ago that the goddess learned lokrian just so she could write the scripturesand learned it very badly too but while everybody knows this nobodynobody normal i mean leaving priests and sages out of the bargainthinks about it more than once every five years if that often if you want to read the scriptures you read them in your own language if youre feeling especially holy and youve got more schooling than is good for you youll look at them in aenean but if you happen to be a lokrianif you happen to be a lokrian you read the scriptures in ancient lokrian theres only one problem with that modern lokrian is closer to ancient lokrian than torinan say is to aenean but its not a whole lot closer if you know modern lokrian you can sorta kinda read the ancient language with the accent on sorta kinda so somebody got the bright idea of finallylokris kicked out the hassocki a long lifetime agotranslating the scriptures into modern lokrian and he published his book on the day we were there he published his miserable book if wed sailed away in the halcyon we never would have had to worry about it if the keraunos weatherworkerd been sober we never would have had to worry about it the weatherworker was drunk we didnt get to sail we had to worry about it i have no idea whether this fellows translation was good bad or indifferent mind you i read even less lokrian than i speak and i dont speak any what i do know is that half the people in lakedaimon seemed to think he was a hero and the other half wanted to dip him in boiling butteror being lokrians possibly in olive oil instead i know all this now you understand ive pieced it together from journal articles and such what i knew then was that way too many people in long skirts and short ones were running around assaulting one another with intent to maim or maybe to dip in boiling butter somehow i didnt think they would refrain from mayhem on my person just because my clothes said i was no lokrian if anything both factions might decide that kicking in a foreigners ribs was the one pleasure they had in common how are we going to get back to the hostel max asked they already seem pretty hostile down there in lieu of braining him with a chunk of classical marble i nodded dont they just i said i suggest we gocautiously good luck max said and we would need it we were obvious foreigners im a goodsized man and i seem bigger next to lokrians who run short max is enormous next to anything this side of a temple steeple the only way we could have made ourselves more conspicuous was by going naked the idea did not appeal we might have got by with it in ancient lakedaimon but not now not now the idea of staying up on fortress hill didnt appeal either fortress hill has some of the most glorious stonework in the world and thats all it has no beds no cafes no nothing unless you felt like chewing rocks i didnt lets try it i said max made a horrible face but he didnt say no we had no trouble going down the steps to the bottom of the hill i knew why toothe lokrians didnt feel like climbing them there have to be more than there are at the temple of siwa even if those are a lot steeper but when we got to the bottomthe first thing we saw was a womans body someone had smashed in her head flies buzzed around the pool of blood max and i have both been through warsbut there wasnt supposed to be a war here fine that poor woman got killed in peacetime it didnt make her any less dead my nostrils twitched then i coughed you always smell a lot of smoke in a city from cookfires and hearthfires and what have you but you dont get a gust of wind with smoke as thick as if you were smoking six pipes at once theyre trying to burn the place down max observed thats clever of them isnt it brilliant i said if the hassocki had set fire to lakedaimon it would have been a fearsome atrocity everybody would have screamed and made them stop since the lokrians were doing it to themselves everybody would yawnexcept for the people who got roasted theyd scream all right a band of a dozen or so rioters came tearing around a corner and started to rush right at us they slowed down in a hurry i must say the sight of somebody maxs size will do that to the most riotous rioter max bowed to them since hes so long and lean he folds up amazingly as he straightened to show them that yes he really was as tall as they thought he was i bowed in turn and i kept right on going turning the bow into a handstand if id been wearing a short skirt like most of the lokrians that might have played hob with my modesty or it might notdo they have drawers under those things trust me i never tried to find out as things were i had on ordinary civilized clothes tunic cravat jacket trousers my hat fell off but that was about it i walked around on my hands and waved to the lokrians with one foot if they were confused enough i figured they might go on leaving us alone after id stopped wavingand it isnt easy to do if youve got shoesmax grabbed my feet we impersonated a drunken wheelbarrow and its even more pixilated operator ive never played a drunken wheelbarrow before putting your shoulder to the wheel is hard when your shoulder is the wheel or at least the brace that holds the wheel on but whats the point of performing if you cant improvise as well as a drunken wheelbarrow could i kept an eye on the lokrians i knew i might have to play an all too sober sprinter any moment now some of the rioters were really fricaseed but the sozzled ones stared with the others whatever theyd expected a street show wasnt it after eight or ten of the longest heartbeats ive ever had they decided they liked us they crowded closer laughing and clapping their hands some of them even tossed coins into my hat which had landed crown down i bet they thought i planned it that way if i were as smart as thatif i were as smart as that wouldnt i have been on my way to shqiperi hang around max for a while and he starts to rub off on you because they liked us we had to play our parts longer than wed planned onnot that wed done much in the way of planning max took some liberties with me that a real wheelbarrow would have slapped his face for i would have slapped him myself except our audience thought he was the funniest thing in the world and they would have done worse than slap us if they hadnt the customer is always right especially when hes armed and dangerous at last the wheelbarrow got rebellious and started kicking in the traces like a restive mule one of those kicks almost made a mule out of maxtrifle with my dignity would he the crowd ate it up i wiggled myself free of him and flipped to my feet and we both took our bows instead of mutilating us the lokrians pounded our backs clasped our hands and gave us nips of what had inflamed them not only that when i picked up my hat i found wed made damn near five leptas in silver one of the rioters spoke fragments of schlepsigian when i made him understand we were staying at papa ioannakis he and his pals undertook to escort us back there the hostel was closed up tight with shutters over the groundfloor windows and an enormous padlock on the front door riots are a fact of life in lakedaimon people get ready for them the way they get ready for earthquakes they do less damage that way a clerk came out on a secondstory balcony he shouted down at the crowd they shouted up at him so did ihe spoke narbonese he came down the fire escape to the firstfloor balcony then lowered a castiron stairway to the ground max and i went up the stairs none of our riotous friends followed i dont know what the clerk told themmaybe that hed turn them into prawns if they tried he would have needed something interesting and memorable to keep them down on the sidewalk whatever it was it worked as soon as we got up to the first balcony he hauled up the fire escape after us only then did he allow himself a sigh of relief cadogan the liontamer would have been proud of him he hadnt shown fear in front of the wild animals theyll turn on you every time if you do thank you i told him not at all he answered politely we would lose our reputation if we lost our customers around the corner a woman screamed and kept on screaming the hostel clerk winced this uproar it is a misfortune in narbonese things dont sound so bad as they really are max knows several languages but that isnt one of them it doesnt fit in with the way he thinks a misfortune yes i admired the understatement and the cool way he brought it out what will you do about the ah uproar myself try to stay safe in aid of which shall we go up the clerk led max and me to the secondstory balcony and then in through the window to the room it adjoined as he did he went on my kingdom my kingdom will wait till things subside then catch a few ringleaders and plunderers and hang them and after that he shrugged a resigned shrug after that we shall start getting ready for the next time things turnlively i nodded to the stout middleaged woman whose room that happened to be max gave her one of his deep and startling bows then we were out in the hall for all the world as if nothing out of the ordinary had happened and so it seemedexcept even there the air smelled of smoke tonights supper specialtythe clerk took a certain somber pride in making five full syllables out of thatis lamb with garlic and rosemary i trust you will find it to your liking he was working hard to pretend everything was normal too im sure we will i said and i wasnothing wrong with papa ioannakis kitchens but i couldnt ignore the riots however much i wanted to for one thing that poor woman was still screaming loud enough for me to hear her in the hallway through a closed door and by now probably a closed window too for anotherhow long do you expect the ah uproar to last we have a ship to catch in a couple of days as for the uproar one never knows it could peter out tonight or it could go on for a week such is life he shrugged again as for the shipwhich is it and from which quay does it sail when i told him he did more than wince he blanched the quay of the poxed trollop sir even without the disturbances you would do better to stay away that is no place for honest men in that case max and i were better suited to the quay than he suspected with a shrug of my own i said we have to get to shqiperi and that seems to be the fastest way to shqiperi lokrians dont like shqipetari i mean they really dont like shqipetari id just put us beyond the pale on your heads be itand it will the clerk stalked off what was that all about max asked i didnt much want to give him the gist but i didnt see what choice i had after i translated he gave me one of those looks you should only get from a wife you didnt listen to me when i told you we were putting our heads on the block will you listen to him if i didnt listen to you why should i listen to some clerk at a hostel because he knows what hes talking about max is full of uncouth and unlikely suggestions if he knew what he was talking about hed have too much money to be a clerk at a hostel i said firmly in fact if he says something like that its a pretty good sign he doesnt know what hes talking about my logic impressed me for some unaccountable reason it failed to impress max hmm he said and just what do you know about the shqipetari that makes you such an expert i know they need a king i answered and i know their king needs an aidedecamp are you coming or arent you oh ill come he said doleful as usual if i didnt youd just drag somebody off the streetthough where youd find anyone this side of that manolis fellow to fit into that captains uniform is beyond me he shook his head if you went and got someone who didnt know youre a maniac killed id feel bad about it afterwards how about if i went and got myself killed well that tooa little the riots eased off before we had to go looking for the good ship gamemeno from everything ive learned since this was more luck than design the constabulary didnt help much because half of them were on one side and half on the other and the king of lokris didnt dare call out the army because half of it was on one side and half on the other like i say lokrians form factions the way schlepsigians form drinking clubs the only difference being that schlepsigian drinking clubs dont usually go after one another with cutlery so if the charming people of lakedaimon wanted to go on murdering and raping and burning down chunks of their town eliphalet only knows what would have stopped them something else caught their fancya scandalous new dancer i think it wasand they quit that clerk was on duty when we checked out he rolled his eyespartly i suppose at our getup i hope i dont read about your case in one of our journals he said ive had more encouraging goodbyes all things considered it was lucky he and max couldnt talk to each other they would have got on much too well our getupif the quay of the poxed trollop was as charming a place as everybody said it was we had two ways to approach it we could try to blend in with the local lowlifes and seem invisible or we could be so gaudy and ostentatious that nobodyi dared hopewould presume to bother us max blended in with the lokrians the way oil blends with water come to that i look about as much like a lokrian as a camel looks like a unicorner as a unicorn looks like a camel you get the idea since we couldnt blend we had gaudy forced on us i put on my acrobats rig while max wore the super grand high panjandrums uniform that was so much more effective in places where real generals didnt dress like escapees from comic opera the uniform did help us flag a cab by the way the hackman bowed and scraped as he opened the door he probably thought we were the schlepsigian minister to lokris and his military attachй he was apologetic for knowing only a bit of narbonesethat and albionese are the foreign languages a lokrian is most likely to speak quite all right my good man i said in narbonese and he brightened then i told him please be so kind as to take us to the quay of the poxed trollop have you ever tossed a big chunk of ice into hot fat to congeal it on the instant if you havent you wont understand what the hackmans face did when i said that thequay of the poxed trollop sir he wheezed by the way he sounded an invisible man was doing a pretty good job of strangling him we have a ship to catch i said wondering what kind of horrible scow the gamemeno would turn out to be the hackman was thinking along the same lines a garbage barge he muttered he slammed the door shut with what i thought quite unnecessary force climbed up to his seat and cracked the whip over the horses back springs creaking and big irontired wheels clanging and bouncing over cobblestones we set out next to no one was on the sidewalk street traffic was drastically down too the riots had ended but the locals feared they might pick up again any minute now that was how it felt to me too when i said as much max looked at me and said i suppose youll tell me theres a bright spot to all this too well there may be i said his expression could have frozen the ice to congeal the fat i was talking about before there may i insisted if anything will keep footpads at home beating their children its the chance of getting caught in a riot youre reaching max said and said no more some of the people who were out and about didnt have homes or flats any more i say that partly because they looked as if theyd been wearing the same clothes for daysand they hadand partly because the cab rattled past the burntout ruins of quite a few homes and flats maybe the arsonists who started those fires hadnt managed to turn all of lakedaimon into a roasting pit but nobody could say they hadnt tried the sour smell of old smoke hung in the air like an unwelcome guest who couldnt figure out it was time to leave shops had gone up in flames too here and there shopkeepers or hired guards patrolled the ruins to make sure nobody greedy went digging through the ashes the cradle of civilization max remarkedand if that isnt a judgment on a lot of things that have happened since the glory days of lakedaimon it will do till a nastier one comes along as we went down toward the waterfront the neighborhood got worse back in ancient times lakedaimons port was a separate city nowadays its just a slum even the good partslike the quay from which the halcyon had sailedwerent very good and the bad parts were horrid i would have taken the three gold globes for the harborside emblem if not for the profusion of wine jars and jugs of spirits over the taverns and the similar profusion of housesif thats the word i wantwith red lanterns out front it was the sort of place where cats didnt eat rats they got fat off protection money instead the hackman had the accursed gall to charge us three times as much for going from papa ioannakis to the harbor as the other fellow had charged for going from the harbor to the hostel when i squawked he suddenly stopped understanding narbonese whats going on max asked wheep out came his sword the way it had when dooger and cark tried to cheat us maybe wheep is a word in lokrian maybe the sight of the blade glittering in the famous lokrian sunshine jogged the hackmans memory all of a sudden narbonese made sense to him again so did the notion that he mightby unfortunate accident of coursehave tried to charge us too much he was glad to accept the fare i proposed he was even gladder to hop back up onto his cab and get out of there as fast as he could if i were a hackman i would have been glad to get out of there too i dont think max noticed but three or four men who if they werent ruffians and robbers could certainly have played them on the stage sidled towards us while i had my littleconversation with the driver when his sword left the scabbard they discovered they had business elsewhere coshing a very big man isnt much harder than bopping anybody else over the head coshing a very big man whos liable to run steel through your liver is a different sort of affair one for which they had less appetite when max started to sheath the sword i set a hand on his arm maybe you should leave that out i said it ah persuades people he looked down at it coughed and shrugged however you like he said i didnt like much about the quay of the poxed trollop i didnt say anything about not liking it we had to be where we were to get where we were going that didnt make it a garden spot if id grumbled though think what max would have said i thought of it and decided i didnt want to hear it after the wouldbe highwaymen hit the highway actually a foulsmelling muddy alley where better than half the cobblestones were only memories several poxed trollops came up to us well i dont know they were poxed but the odds seemed good trollops they definitely were in tawdry tightfitting finery and with painted faces more mercenary than any mercenarys they greeted us with endearments and obscenitiesdid they know the difference or carein everything from hassocki to albionese i swept off my hat and bowed to them after i nudged max he did the same as always his deep bow produced stares of astonishment at least from the soiled doves who werent eyeing his crotch come to that they looked more than a little astonished too the trousers on that ridiculous uniform fit snugly my ladies i said two lies in two wordscant do much better than that can you tell me how to find the gamemeno i stuck to narbonese more of them seemed to use it than any other er tongue maybe i was wrong the question sent them into gales of laughter right here pal one of them said striking a pose that almost made my eyeballs catch fire no try me another one twisted even more lewdly now what max said though he could scarcely have had much doubt i did im not quite sure i muttered and went back to narbonese the ship called the gamemeno oh the ship the trulls chorused and they giggled some more that was when i found out what gamemeno means in lokrian why anyone would want to call a ship thatwell you find peculiar people everywhere i used to know a schlepsigian who named his sailboat the rottweiler because he wrote doggerel aboard it he had other troubles too believe me one of the strumpets pointed down to the end of the quay thats it that was the only ship tied up at the quay of the poxed trollop i had feared that would be it and hoped that wouldnt be as usual fear had more weight in the real world the gamemeno made the keraunos look like a potentates pleasure yacht if youd ever seen the keraunos you would know how badly i just insulted the ship max and i now approached a few sailors eyed us as we came up you know the romantic tales of pirates on the high seas they used to tell well forget them these fellows looked like pirates and like the sort of men who gave piracy a bad name in the first place they hadnt shaved they hadnt bathed they looked at us the way a dog eyes the meat in a butchers window the gangplank was down i went up it max right behind me and i felt like a man who was walking the plank too up close the gamemeno looked even grimmer even more illcaredfor than she had at a distance she took after her crew by the look of them someone should have taken after themwith a club you sail for shqiperi soon is it not so i asked in hassocki the language i knew that i thought these cutthroats most likely to speak who wants to know asked the biggest and ugliest of thema dubious distinction indeed he wore the ugliest hat too before i could say anything max brandished his sword max was bigger than the sailor though not uglier he still had both ears for instance and he had a great load of righteous indignation in his voice as he exclaimed have a care how you speak to the king the king the sailorhe turned out to be the captainmust have thought max was a madman telling someone six feet eight with a sword in his hand that hes a madman however requires that you be a madman yourself what he did say was why thou most credulous fool the land of the eagle has no king a horses cock up thine arse thou loggerheaded and unpolished wretch for assuredly it has one now max replied behold him the fellow beheld me if i seemed royal to him he concealed it remarkably well laughing a laugh hed surely bought secondhand from a carrion crow he said hes no more king than he can kick the hat off my head max bowed to me your majesty i bowed to him then i walked up to the sailor measured him with my eyeshe was an inch or two taller than i wasand bowed to him as well at your service i saidand threw myself into a backflip when my feet were over my head i kicked out with one of them caught the brim of the hat without kicking him in the face too bad and sent it flying to the filthy deck i landed on both feet straightened up and bowed to him again at your service i repeated and you i trust at mine he stared at me he stared at max he stared at maxs sword and he stared at his disreputable hat he picked it up and jammed it back down onto his equally disreputable head i dont know what your game is your majestyhe freighted that with enough irony to sink itbut ill play along aye we sail for shqiperi would you honor us with your company i would i said grandlyeven royally and so i set forth for my kingdom v i expected the gamemeno to have a weatherworker who made the poor drunken blundering idiot aboard the keraunos look like a genius of thaumaturgy i wondered what would be wrong with him mere drunkenness didnt seem nearly enough would he smoke hashish would he be haunted by a parrots ghost that sat on his shoulder invisible except by the light of the full moon and croaked words of evil omen into his unwashed ear would he decide he was a dolphin and had to swim in the sea instead of standing on the poop deck only a fluke or the lack of two would save us from being stuck with the worlds wind i turned out to be as right as a blizzard is black which is one of the things we say in schlepsig they dont know much about blizzards down in lokris though they do in the mountains of shqiperi to give myself what due i can i realized id made a mistake as soon as i set eyes on this fellow except for being swarthy and sharpfeatured he reminded me of nothing so much as the officer candidates at the royal military academy in donnerwetter he was all business i dont think id ever seen a lokrian who was all business before i didnt know such a breed existed he nodded to max and me said good morning in perfect schlepsigian and started talking with the captain whose name id found out was tasos tasos might have been as snotty as a twoyearold with a cold to us but he bent over backward or maybe lokrians bend over forwardi dont know to stay friendly with his weatherworker well we were just passengers hed have to work with the other man again and again and there was more to it than that i saw why pretty cursed quick too speaking of cursed tasos swore in half a dozen languages when he ordered his bandits to cast off the lines that held the gamemeno to the quay of the poxed trollop and set sail i understood most of the bad language the lokrian i had to figure out from what the sailors did as soon as the lines were coiled on deck and the sails unfurled the weatherworkerhis name i learned a little later was stagirosgot down to that business of his i thought the sailors had spread too much canvas not just for the size of their tub but for the likely powers of their weatherworker well shows what i know doesnt it eliphalet and zibeon doesnt it just stagiros summoned up a mighty wind a wind that could have taken a schlepsigian ship of the line into battle against albion the sails here didnt sag and belly and slowly fill no not this time they went taut all at onceboomand the gamemeno left the quay of the poxed trollop behind as fast as youd want to leave a poxed trollop behind or even a poxed trollops behind the pace we set there were lokrian navy ships in lakedaimon harbor frigates and schooners and sloops built for speed naturally those ships are going to have good weatherworkers aboard them to get the most from their sleek lines we showed em our probably poxed behind and i mean with ease the way things looked from our deck somebody might have nailed them to the water id never seen such weatherworking in my whole life what was a weatherworker like that doing on a ship like this i couldnt ask tasos in quite those words not unless i wanted him to pitch me over the side so i asked how did you find such a fine man and pointed toward the busily incanting stagiros i paid him more than anyone else he answered without the least hesitation was that sarcasm i examined it up down and sideways and decided it wasnt no he meant every word all right this from a man who plainly clung limpetlike to every hemidemilepta he saw why more often than youd think asking the question makes the answer come why would tasos and the gamemeno want a weatherworker who had to be one of the best in the world because they needed to go from hither to yon and to get out of ports like a scalded cat why else would you want a weatherworker like that and why would you need to be able to run and scoot to need it so badly that you had a firstrate man on a fifthrate ship i almost asked tasos what he was smuggling but that was a question i could ask myself not one that would make me loved by our swashbuckling captain ha and his jolly crew ha ha i could legitimately notice we were sailing along to the southwest not eastward as a lot of ships heading for shqiperi from lakedaimon would have done you care not for the canal i asked the transpeninsular canal is one of those places that almost have an ancient history behind them the ancient lokrians not being blind noticed that the secondary peninsula where a lot of them lived was connected to the rest of the much bigger nekemte peninsula only by a skinny little neck of landa neck rather like that belonging to the present hassockian atabeg as a matter of fact they also noticed they would have themselves a demon of a shortcut if they cut through it one small problem they couldnt that was partly because the project needed cooperation and the lokrians gave the world examples of how not to cooperate as they did of so many other important things and it was partly because the ancient lokrians while brilliant in any number of ways were when you get right down to it pretty lousy wizards and so were the aeneans when it came to sorcery as with most things the aeneans learned everything they didnt know from the lokrians even so emperor otho had a crack at it he assembled half the wizards in the empire and about a quarter of the men who could carry a shovel and they all converged on the little neck that separated the small peninsula from the bigger one and they got started and they went along for a couple of furlongs and otho got bored otho was good at getting bored he was better at that than at most other things though he did love his mother which is another story one you can look up for yourself and so he went off and decided he was going to be a sprinter or a boxer or a god or whatever he felt like being instead of a fellow in charge of a canal or rather part of a canal a small part of a canal the money stopped coming in so did the food the wizards went home some of the diggers did too quite a few of them starved nobody knows just how many because otho was too bored to count them for almost the next two thousand years nobody bothered with the canal the aeneans had tried and failed so other people said it couldnt be done then about thirty years ago a narbonese company had a go of it with modern magery they got about halfway and ran out of money a lokrian firm bought them out and finished the job it took two modern companies twelve years to dig that canal with proper wizardry to placate the local earth elementals and stabilize the bedrock elementals the aeneans had never even heard of or from them no wonder otho couldnt hack itthrough tasos im sure cared as much for the history of the transpeninsular canal as he did for the history of the rutabaga whether he went through it or not was the only thing that mattered to him no we will round lokris instead he told me we have certainstops to make along the way uhhuh i see i said and i did i wondered what hed be loading and unloading at those stops spirits flavored with anise tobacco flavored with anise hemp flavored with anise wanted criminals criminals looking to do something wicked enough to make them wanted a black wizard or two crossbow quarrels copies of the scriptures done into modern lokrian anything that was expensive but didnt take up much room fit his bill just fine like max and me for instance considering what hed gouged us for a cabin to fushekuqe we had to be at least as valuable as a few jugs of dragon spit that was about how tasos treated us tooas cargo i mean as long as we didnt rattle around and cause him extra work we were fine if we didwell that might not be so much fun i just stood by the rail and watched the land and sea flash by fishing boats that worked by the worlds wind bobbed in the water men with bushy eyebrows under shortbrimmed black wool caps stared at us as we shot past they were almost no sooner seen than gone stagiros really was amazing did he know how much he was worth could a shabby smuggler like tasos possibly pay him that much i found it hard to believe but here he was the gamemenos skipper posted a man at the bow to sing out warnings when we neared other vessels those fishing boats couldnt move fast enough to get out of our way some of them with their sails furled and with nets in the water couldnt move at all we had to do the dodging as for tasos himself he kept a weather eyei think thats the proper seagoing phrase isnt iton the coast to our left to port i should say shouldnt i what are you looking for i asked innocently pirates he jerked he twitched he grabbed my arm where he demanded what do you know what have you heard i didnt know anything not about pirates i didnt even suspect anything and i certainly hadnt heard anything well noall that wasnt quite true now i knew one thing about pirates anyway our magnificent captain was scared green of them why are you worrying i asked him with your wonderful weatherworker there you can outrun any pirate ship ever hatched would that zibeon and eliphalet gave me a pile of stones of conformation like unto thy brainpan that i might build me of them a rock garden in the courtyard of my home he sneered go to kennel thou who wast born betwixt two stockfishes i replied why revilest me so should a fool not be reproved for his folly tasos said we may outfly any pirate ship aye but catapult darts or stones fireballs arrows should one smite the weatherworker his hand twisted in a gesture designed to turn aside the evil omen oh i did feel the fool if any of those misfortunes befell stagiros the gamemeno was well gamemenod i rallied as best i could surely you will have another man aboard who can call the wind surely i will surely i do tasos said but while many men can work the weather how many can work it like stagiros he spread his hands waiting for my answer i had no answer to give and i knew it tasos secondbest weatherworker wouldnt match some pirates best and sohe watched the jagged coast every time we darted past a headland or the valley where some stream came down to the sea he muttered and played with worry beads while sweat ran down his face so much for honor among thieves i wondered what a lokrian navy cutter would do if it came across the gamemenos crew battling it out with cutlasses and crossbows and cantrips and counterspells against pirates i know what i would have done if i were the skipper of a lokrian navy cutter i would have laughed and closed my eyes and sailed away hoping they slaughtered each other till not a man survived on either side the more who fell the better off the kingdom would be but i wasnt a lokrian navy cutter captain i was eliphalet help me a passenger on this miserable lokrian smuggler and so whenever we passed a headland or a little valley i muttered while sweat ran down my face too i had no worry beads but found i was able to worry quite well without them we put in for the night at a village called skilitsi ive looked for it since on a map ive looked for it on several maps as a matter of fact as far as mapmakers know it isnt there i wonder if the king of lokris knows anybody lives in skilitsi or even that there is such a place what you dont know about you cant tax the folk of skilitsi struck me as being less than enthusiastic about contributing to their kingdoms general welfare if you blink while youre going by youll miss the place thats what the people who live there have in mind a big rock in the sea and groves of olives and almonds screen it off from the casual eye if you dont already know where it is you wont find it and if you dont nobody in skilitsi will care tasos knew it as soon as we skimmed between that big rock and the mainland stagiros let his wind die the gamemeno glided to a stop tasos shouted orders the anchor splashed into the sea rowboats approached from the shore tasos turned to max and me why dont the two of you go below he said pleasantly what you dont see you cant testify to and no wizard can pull it out of you either it sounded like a polite request it was a polite order tasos had several burly sailors behind him none of them was as large as i am let alone max but they made up in numbers what they lacked in beef i think well go below i said sounding cheerier than i felt dont you max just what i always wanted to do max agreed as excited as if hed got an invitation to his own funeral down to our cabin we went belowdecks on the gamemeno left all sorts of things to be desired the ceilings werent tall enough for me let alone poor max several nasty odors filled the air some had to do with cooking others with foul heads and unbathed men still othersi dont know what all the gamemeno was smuggling but some of it smelled bad poor captain tasos was a busy man i didnt want to upset him by reminding him that our cabin while it didnt have much did boast a porthole and since we were on the right side of the ship oh fine the starboard side which happened to be the correct side too we could watch what was going on as well as if wed stayed on deck we could and we did poor captain tasos it was a lot less exciting than one of ilonas tumbling routines believe me lokrians rowed out from skilitsi with crates and jugs and barrels they rowed back with barrels and crates and jugs i presume they sent the ship this and took away that but i couldnt prove it as it got darker we had a harder time seeing what was going on we would have quit if tasos hadnt wanted to keep us from watching and how many times have you done something because somebody told you not to oh more than that you must have for whatever it was worth we finally got our reward we saw something more interesting or at least more unusual than jugs and barrels and crates i stared as a bigger boat than most came up to the gamemeno is that what i think it is i whispered i dont know what do you think it is a coffin well it could be he said cryptically and it was the obscenity and blasphemy from the deck came in eight or ten tongues and would have fried the beards off both prophets if theyd been alive to hear it the oarsmen in that big rowboat added their fair share too i wouldnt have been surprised if the corpse sat up and tossed in his hemileptas worth at last once the shouting died down to aftershock levels they rigged a block and tackle on deck and hauled the coffin up from the boat thud it made a dreadfully final sound when it came down on the plankingright over our heads by the sound of things max cocked a wary eye at our ceiling which went on creaking if that comes through he began i shrugged if it does well be too flat to worry about it you always did know how to relieve my mind he said we looked out the porthole again but the coffin proved to be the grand finale the boat that had brought it took back a load of illegal immoral untaxedstuff it grounded on the beach the rowers unloaded it and dragged it ashore no more boats came out max closed the porthole there were mosquitoes outside as soon as he closed it we discovered there were mosquitoes inside too but there were more of them outside so much for the exciting life of a smuggler he said its like watching grass dry or paint grow i agreed what have we got for supper he rummaged through his kit and pulled out what looked like a flexible billy club mutton sausage better than nothing i said giving it the benefit of the doubt and it turned out to be quite a bit better than nothing say what you will about the lokriansand im one of their most sincere unadmirersthey do make good sausage another tradition going back to the golden age of lakedaimon if you remember your comic poets full darkness fell fast as a drunk tumbling down a flight of stairs twilight lingers romantically in schlepsig the sky goes through every deepening shade of blue and purple toward black stars come out one by one you can count them if you like and you dont have any trouble keeping up nightfall in lokris isnt like that the sun goes down it gets dark and wastes no time doing it you look at the sky and you dont see any stars ten minutes later billions and billions of them are up there where were they hiding how did they all come out at once you can see more of them in lokris than you can in schlepsig too the air isnt so mistyand except when theyre having a riot it isnt so smoky either but i think our stars are more intriguing you have to earn them they arent just there the way they are in lokris youd think the moon seen through a porthole would fill that round window with its round self youd think so but youd be wrong the moon looks so big hanging there in the sky especially when its just rising or about to set but if you hold a kram or a livre out at arms length between your thumb and forefinger you can make the moon disappear behind it i was surprised when i found that out you will be too well actually you wont be because now ive told you but you would be if i hadnt of course if i hadnt you wouldnt have tried such a silly thing in the first place would you up on deck one of the sailors waspraying i wished i understood lokrian but it might not have mattered here with the porthole closed the rhythm of his speech came through better than the actual words i did think i heard zibeons name a few times that wasinteresting a pious smuggler i murmured probably asking for blind customs inspectors max said if i were a smugglerand i have been on a small scale a time or threei would ask for something like that too and if customs inspectors arent blind silver has been known to weight down their eyelids but a prayer like that is a businessmans prayer not one that comes from the heart or the belly somehow the lokrian sounded more as if he meant it i dont know the language but the tone came through when i said so max only shrugged maybe hes slept with someones wife here or since its lokris maybe hes slept with someones husband do that and youll pray like you mean it he yawned whatever hes praying for its got nothing to do with me im nobodys husbandand nobodys wife either what i am is somebody whos about to go to sleep he yawned again wider than before we got out of our fancy duds put on our nightshirts and made ourselves as comfortable as we could in the short narrow berths mine wasnt big enough for me maxs was much too small for him most beds are he has two choices he can fold himself up like an inchworm or he can let big chunks of himself part company with the mattress he twisted and wiggled after a while i heard a foot thump on the deck so i knew he wasnt imitating an inchworm tonight along with being short and narrow my mattress was lumpy that was of a piece with everything else id seen on the gamemenoeverything except stagiros who was in a class by himself but i didnt want to sleep on the weatherworker or even with him my tastes along those lines are boringly normal after some little while i was able to keep my eyes closed without having their lids jump and twitch the way a childs will when hes pretending to be asleep max still wiggled not far away but id heard him do that before ive fallen asleep in the middle of a barracks hall full of hassocki soldiers whod had a supper of beans after that one oversized swordswallower with a cough wasnt so much of a much before long i stopped hearing him or anything else i dont know how long id been asleep when someone knocked on the cabin door i did my best not to hear that too for a moment or two i turned the noise into a dream about woodpeckers one of them was pecking on my wooden leg which would make better sense if i had a wooden leg like most circuses dooger and carks has a wise woman who will take your money and tell you what your dreams mean ask yourself this if shes so wise whats she doing at dooger and carks if you really need to find out about your dreams pay a little more and go to a mage who might actually know then the woodpecker said otto wake up you bloody bonehead i didnt think a woodpecker ought to say something like that even in a dream wouldnt an angry woodpecker call me blockhead instead i opened my eyes that wasnt a woodpecker looming over me there in the darknessthat was max breathing sausage breath into my face and somebody was knocking i breathed back at him do we ignore that or do we open it and break something over the stinking whoresons head if i could have ignored it id still be sleeping he said if i could have ignored it id still have had a woodpecker drumming on the wooden leg i dont own there are worse things i suppose but lots more better ones with a sigh i got out of bed and advanced on the door some advanceit must have been a good pace and a half even on ships a lot fancier than the gamemeno which is to say most of them cabins are cramped ours there had more room than a coffin built for twoi had to be thinking about the one that came aboard a few hours earlierbut not much even as i reached for the latch the knocking stopped whoever was on the other side he knew i was reaching how did he know that i opened the door and i found out there he stood in the narrow little passageway he was perfectbut then he would be ruffled shirt cravat tailcoathe might have been about to sit down at the harpsichord he might have been but he wasnt becausebloodless face red glowing eyes oh yes and the obligatory fangs too vampire i should have known so should max the nekemte peninsula has more undead than just about anywhere else vlachian vampires yagmar vampires not ilona a warmblooded wench if ever there was one dacian vampires including the famous petru the piercer not so many lokrian vampires lucky us those terrible eyes grabbed me and wouldnt let go may i come in he asked in some language i could understandi didnt so much hear his words as feel them in the middle of my head they have to be invited in they cant cross the threshold unless they are yes max and i breathed together under the spell of those glowing eyes what else could we have said nothing at all a vampire needs an invitation to come in sure but that doesnt mean he wont cheat to get one yes we breathed again but the vampire didnt come in the light in his eyes went out he gagged and hacked and coughed if youve ever seen someone whos never smoked before take an enormous puff on a strong cigar you have some small idea of how the vampire acted he fled down the corridor as fast as he could go silent as the ghost of a cat i wondered if hed make it back to his coffin or fall over somewhere and lie there till the sun came up the next morning i knew what i hoped i turned to max at the same time as he was turning to me we both started to laugh up in schlepsig we flavor lamb and mutton with mint i think i said that once before the lokrians use garlic the lokrians use garlic lots of garlic in almost everything theyd put garlic in apple strudel if they made apple strudel well i said shall we go back to bed just a minute he rummaged in his wallet took out some silver coins and stuck them in the crack between the door and its frame i thought silver kept werewolves away i said it cant hurt max answered and how do you know this miserable scow isnt smuggling werewolves too i scratched my head he was right i wouldnt have put smuggling anything at all past tasos just by way of example he was smuggling the king of shqiperi and his aidedecamp into the land of the eagle wasnt he maybe the silver worked maybe the vampire had just had a noseful of us either way he didnt bother us again if he drained the rest of the crew drywell wed have to figure out some other way to get to shqiperi thats all when we came up on deck the next morning we were chewing on more sausagejust in case you might say captain tasos seemed surprised to see us then he got a whiff of our breakfast and he didnt any more i trust you had a pleasant night he said a certain gleam in his eye after the vampires glowing gaze tasos gleam wasnt anything special youre a trusting soul then arent you i pointed to the coffin chain that up put roses and garlic on it we want no more visits in the nighttime he is a paying passenger tasos said he pays better than you do in facthe pays in gold so maybe there was something to maxs silver coins after all whether there was or not was something i could worry about later whatever hes paying its not enough to let him suck the blood out of your live customers tasos stirred as if he wasnt so sure about that whatever he might have said though he didnt max was wearing his sword i wasnt sure hed ever sliced anything more dangerous than bread with it but tasos wasnt sure he hadnt for an overgrown bread knife and theatrical prop it was proving mighty persuasive chain it up till he gets where hes going i repeated and pointed to the coffin again then i took a step towards it if you dont chain it up ill open it why should you care youve already got his passage money tasos tossed his head where someone from another kingdom would have shaken it i dont dare open it he said if i did they would know and they would have their revenge he sounded as if vampires were some sort of secret society like what they call our thing in torino he also sounded as if he knew what he was talking about we dont have vampires in schlepsig except for the few whove settled there to take advantage of the longer winter nights we have werewolves and unicorns and trolls and dwarves and elves and gnomes and cobolds and all sorts of other wildunlife but not vampires i cant say we feel the lack either even though ive traveled around a good deal in kingdoms where they dont live i dont know them the way somebody like tasos wouldhe grew up with them you might say all right if you wont open it you wont but chain it up and ward it i said adding if you dont and if anything happens to me and my aidedecamp the shqipetari will find out and theyll have their revenge that was inspiration nothing less tasos flinched lokrians think shqipetari are passionate factionridden feudists bushwhackers and bandits and thieves grifters and liars and cheatspretty much what the rest of the world thinks of lokrians from everything i saw in lokris id say the rest of the world has a point from everything i saw later in shqiperi id say the lokrians have a point too max smiled his most sepulchral smile would you rather have your throat punctured or just slit would you rather have your blood drunk or just spilled zibeon tasos muttered i would have called on eliphalet myself but theyre both holy holy enough to ward against vampires of course if you believe enough but then if you believe enough almost anything turns holy he shouted for his crew when they gathered he harangued them in lokrian i dont know just what he said whatever it was it turned the trick at first they stared at him as if they couldnt believe their ears when they decided he meant it they whooped they hollered they danced in a circle around the coffin they kissed him on his stubbly cheek men do that a lot in the nekemte peninsula i think its to keep the kissee from noticing the kisser is about to stick a knife in his back after the sailors finished celebrating they went to work i dont know where they found so many chains aboard the gamemeno maybe tasos sold slaves when other business was slow maybe someone had peculiar tastes in bed if so his lady friend must have been an octopus otherwise he never would have needed so many wherever the sailors found them they used them and once theyd used them they covered the coffin with so many roses and so much garlic it looked like a collision between a florists and a lokrian kitchen the only thing missing was the olive oil im sure the garlic came from the gamemenos galley the roses i asked a sailor who spoke some hassocki he looked at me as if i were even dumber than hed thought and hed already pegged me for an idiot thou hast not so much brain as earwax plainly he said we brought them back from skilitsi yesternight they knew what they had on board all right i remembered the one sailor praying did they tell their passengers it is to laugh if we lived all right if we didnt well tasos had our fare too once the coffin was warded the sailors swarmed into the rigging with higher spirits than id ever seen from them stagiros stood on the poop deck and whistled up the wind the sails filled with wind faster than a politician on the stump the gamemeno left skilitsi behind so fast you almost forgot it was ever there im sure the people who lived there were just as happy to keep it forgotten too off to the west islands poked out of the sea some of them had little towns and fields and olive groves you could live out your days in a place like that and never go more than ten miles from where you were born some people think thats a life not me by eliphalets windwhipped whiskers here i was on a fast ship heading for my kingdom i made the mistake of saying something along those lines to max one of his eyebrows acted as if hed pulled on a string attached to his hairline here you are on a sneaking smuggler with a vampires coffin on the main deck heading for a place where theyll either assassinate you because youre the king or execute you because youre not some people havent got the right attitude ive tried explaining that to max he has an easier time swallowing cold iron than common sense arguing one more time seemed pointless instead i reached up as far as i could draped my arm around his shoulder and crooned and here you are with me well someone has to do the worrying he shook me off like a unicorn whisking away flies some of the islands out there on the blue blue sea were too small or too dry to keep a town alive they had goats and a herdsman or two to keep track of them you could live out your days in a place like that too it would make a hamlet on one of the bigger islands look like lakedaimon but you could do it not many of your goats would be much smarter than you were and some of the islands were just rocks like the one in front of skilitsi but farther out to sea maybe a tree or bush would find enough soil in a crack to take root maybe a pelican or a gull would perch and look out at the sea all around maybe the rock would bea rock grayish or golden useless for anything except smashing a ship that didnt see it soon enough in fog or storm then there were the almostislands rocks that would have been islands if only theyd finished their suppers and drunk their milk when they were young instead of running out to play they cant quite poke their noses out of the water now and they resent it and they get even by using those noses to rip the guts out of ships that try to sail over them thanks to stagiros we were going at quite a clip i hoped tasos knew exactly where we were discovering he didnt might proveembarrassing the gamemeno made a couple of small swerves one was around a place where waves boiled even though you couldnt see anything that would make them do it the other stretch of sea looked ordinary enough but he dodged it anyway we didnt hit anything i approved of not hitting anything the wind of our passage ruffled my hair i patted it back into place as i did i glanced back toward the coffin if that wind was making my hair blow what was it doing to the roses and garlic that helped hold the vampire inside as a matter of fact it wasnt doing anything the sailors had thought of that before i did theyd stuck the stems and the strungtogether cloves through the links of the chain the wards against the vampire werent going anywhere at all which i couldnt say about us the gamemeno was as unsavory a ship as ever soiled the sea but she didnt waste any time whatever tasos was paying stagiros he got his moneys worth we hustled along we would have hustled faster yet if we hadnt stopped at small islands and in little hidden coves to unload this and take on that most of the time i couldnt tell what this and that were once though that was a pair of veritable klephts lokrians sing songs about klephts they think theyre romantic heroesthe ones whove never run into them that is klepht means thief in lokrian which tells you more than you wanted to know about what lokris is like these two looked the part they had fierce hawklike faceslines somewhat blurred by bushy beardsand wore big knives in their belts and bandoleers of crossbow quarrels crisscrossing their chests i didnt care to quarrel with them with crossbows or without even if they also had on those silly little skirts lokrian men wear instead of pants they didnt seem to want any part of us either that didnt break my heart maxs sword could have had their cutlery for breakfast and still been hungry for spoons which probably had a little somethingjust a little mind youto do with their restraint they edged warily around the vampires coffin they knew what it was and they didnt like it a bit i wondered what theyd done to need to go somewhere else in such a tearing hurry better not to know maybe wed just left the little inlet where we picked them up when a lookout screamed most sincerely and pointed out to sea my gaze followed his finger i felt like screaming too id never seenid never imagineda sea serpent that big vi now dont get me wrong we have sea serpents in the suebic gulf too but the northern seas the seas i grew up with are cold that stunts the serpents growth theyll eat the occasional fisherman sure but they hardly ever eat his boat too this onewell ive spent a lot of time down in southern climes who wouldnt once he finds out it doesnt have to be cold and nasty and miserable half the year in schlepsig most people dont believe snow can come as a surprise poor bastards ive spent a lot of time in southern climes like i say and ive crossed the middle sea often enough and then some i know the nice warm water grows nice big well bigthey arent nice sea serpents but theres big and then theres big and then there was this one when it stuck its head out of the water the tip of its snout was up about as far as the top of the gamemenos mainmast now the smuggler wasnt the biggest ship in the world and that mainmast wasnt one of the tall firs or spruces that do mainmast duty for all the menofwar in the world neverthenonethelessif that much sea serpent was above the water think how much had to be below to hold it up i did and i got seasick or near enough tasos turned green as an unripe olive so i have to believe he was making the same unhappy calculation he said something to stagiros the weatherworker was minding his own business which was making the gamemeno go as if somebodyd goosed her i dont even think he noticed the sea serpent till tasos told him about it then it hissed that would have got anybodys attention the lookout screamed again cant say i blame him not many live people have ever heard that noise the ones who did hear it mostly didnt stay alive long anyhow take a bronze statuea heroic bronze statue twice as tall as a man heat it redhot use some specialand very stupidsorcery to fly it out over the ocean drop it in the sea serpent sounded a lot like that only more so it was in its own way a beautiful creature its belly was pale yellow its back a darker greenish gold those back scales were softly iridescent and the sun also sparkled off the seawater that dripped from it like most of its kind it had a crest of long scalesalmost feathers really as if serpents were somehow related to birdsalong the top of its head that crest was raised which meant the sea serpent was interested in something probably us worse luck how old was a sea serpent that size when it was young had it watched lakedaimonian and palladian galleys ram one another in the unpronounceable war that ruined both lokrian citystates and set up the rise of fyrom had it feasted on philosophers dined on dramatists snacked on scholars i had no way of knowing and neither does anyone else what i did know was that those eyes as big as dinner plates or maybe shields were more knowing than a serpents eyes had any business being out shot its tongue long as a pennant it was tasting the air wondering what sort of dainties it might find unfortunately i had a pretty good notion where the closest available seaserpent dainties were even more unfortunately i was one of them that enormous head graceful as a spearpoint and ever so much more deadly swung towards us tasos said something else to stagiros no let me put that down exactly as it happened tasos shrieked at the weatherworker stagiros said something in return tasos shrieked again even louder i dont speak lokrian but i didnt need to be philosopher dramatist or scholar to translate this dialogue make us go faster im already doing everything i can make us go faster anyway lots faster if i were tasos thats what i would have said to stagiros and you can take it to the bank the weatherworker went right on raising his wind the gamemeno skimmed along faster than anything ive ever seen on sails but were sails faster than scales i had the feeling we were going to find out i also had the feeling i might not like the answer and if i didnt like it i wouldnt like any that came afterwards either the sea serpents tongue shot out again long and pink and questing when it did i got a glimpsejust a glimpse mind youof the serpents fangs i could have done without that really thank you very much max must have got a glimpse too for he said nice to know were not in a little bit of trouble isnt it max is always so reassuring then the great beast lowered its head so that about half the upthrust neck maybe more went back down into the sea it started swimming after the gamemeno it started gaining on the gamemeno too as soon as we were sure about thatwhich didnt take long curse ittasos wasnt the only one shrieking at poor stagiros he was one of the best in the world so what if he wasnt good enough to keep us ahead of this mother of all sea serpents which given its size and likely age it might have been he wasnt good enough period exclamation point even and he wasnt he did everything he knew how to do and he knew how to do more than any other weatherworker ive ever seen the serpent kept on sliding closer anyhow the effort stagiros was putting out he looked on the point of falling over dead if he did wed all die in short order and if he didntwed all die in short order anyway that was sure how it looked the sea serpents head came up again its tongue flicked in and out in and out it was tasting dinner before it even got a bite the two klephts started to take out their crossbows and load them with bolts from their bandoliers the sailors persuaded them not to by sitting on their heads i would have done more than thati would have cleft them in twain if i had to the most they could do i thought was annoy the sea serpent which was just what we needed then i wondered if it would come up astern of us and snatch stagiros off the poop deck that would have left the gamemeno with nothing but the worlds wind of which there wasnt much just then the serpent could have snacked on the rest of us at its leisure but however many ancient philosophers the sea serpent had digested it hadnt digested their wisdom or maybe its tongue told it that what it wanted most wasnt back at the poop so it swam alongside us instead of taking us from behind perhaps it wasnt a lokrian sea serpent after all out went that tongue in out in they say small serpents can charm birds so theyll just sit still and be swallowed watching that tongue almost charmed me if id had any sense i would have run below then the serpent would have had to smash the ship to get me not that it couldnt mind you not that it wouldnt but it would have taken longer those enormous eyes lit with a cold reptilian satisfaction fast as a striking serpentwell yes exactly that fastthe great head darted forward that terrible mouth gaped wide wider widest i can testify that sea serpents have never heard of mouthwash and the serpent seizedthe vampires coffin down that maw it went wooden box chains roses garlic and all garlic maybe that was what the titanic tongue tasted on the air if it was i owed the sea serpent an apology for thinking it wasnt lokrian i also spent a moment wondering what would happen to the vampire when the serpents stomach juices ate through the coffin how much did being undead matter if you were being dissolved i didnt have the faintest idea and id bet nobody else does either not even the maddest most intrepid natural philosopher could arrange an experiment like that the vampire would know pretty soon how long it would know was another questionthe other question how long i would be able to go on worrying about it was another question too one vampire even with coffin chains and condiments was only a bonbon to a sea serpent like that its tongue did some more flicking then its horrible head descendedtoward max maybe he was just the biggest man on the gamemenos deck or maybe the sea serpent scented the garlic from our mutton sausage never having been a sea serpent i cant say but that tongue flicked out right in front of maxs face he wasnt charmed and you can take the word in any of its senses i must have seen him draw his sword half a dozen times since we set out for the land of the eagle he hadnt done anything but draw it not up till now but a sea serpent is even less inclined to see reason than dooger and cark which is saying something when the serpents tongue shot out again max swung the sword the sailors didnt have time to sit on his head the blade sliced right through one of those forked tonguetips blood spurted the sea serpent let out a giganticseaserpentsized hiss of astonishment and pain what could be worse than an uppity breakfast imagine youve bitten down on your roll all nicely spread with honeyand discovered the hard way that a bee was as interested in the honey as you were no ive never done that either i said imagine if you have trouble with that use some transcendental floss to clean some of the grime from your mind then try again i wondered whether the sea serpent would smash the gamemeno to pieces with its thrashing it was annoyedyes just a bit but eliphalet and zibeon be praised it didnt it swam off instead looking for food less inclined to stand up for its rights max turned to the closest sailor who was staring at him all goggleeyed may i please have a rag max asked in hassocki i want to clean the blade before the blood makes it rust moving like a man in a tranceand not one caused by the sea serpentthe man handed max his pocket handkerchief but max didnt have the chance to use it not right away captain tasos had been standing there on deck as astonished as any of his sailors now he suddenly came back to life he bellowed like a bull that was suddenly made into a steer and folded max into an embrace that proved the difficulties of bathing at sea he almost spitted himself on maxs sword but he didnt notice that i dont think max noticed either or he might have made the accident real not potential tasos bubbled and squeaked in lokrian which neither one of us understood it sounds like sticky wine pouring out of a jug glub glub glub after a few paragraphslike most lokrians he liked to hear himself talkthe skipper realized his mistake he switched to hassocki you are heroic you are magnificent you should have been born a lokrian maxs editorial eyebrow said two out of three wasnt bad i wondered how long it would be once captain tasos had dropped us off at fushekuqe before he started claiming hed wounded or more likely killed the fearsome sea serpent if he needed more than ten days he had more character than i gave him credit for he was a character but not the kind of character whose chief characteristic is character i went back to stagiros you did everything you could i said quietly in hassocki everyone knows it the weatherworker shrugged it would not have been enough he answered in his fluent schlepsigian he was a man of parts was stagiros everyone also knows that your friend was very brave or very foolish i glanced up the deck toward max hed finally managed to disentangle himself from tasos with luck without getting his pocket picked in the process even the klephts were congratulating him this once in honor of the moment i gave him the benefit of the doubt lokris southern peninsula is shaped like a hand or a planetree leaf or anything else with a broad base and several projections sticking out from it a few islands only mildly meddle with the simile down and around went the gamemeno we saw no other sea serpents even more to the point no other sea serpents saw us we did see every little cove and inlet along the way or so it seemed something would go off the shipthe klephts got off at one little inlet something would come on some silver would stick in tasos pockets i had no doubts one thingno more coffins came aboard i dont know whether other lokrian vampires had some sharp one might even say pointed questions for our intrepid skipper i would guess not for they might have found an answer on the order of well look inside a sea serpent somewhat less than satisfying but this is only a guess all i do know is no vampires bothered me or max that we ate garlic whenever we could that we festooned our cabin door and porthole with it that we carried a couple of peeled cloves wherever we wentall this could be merely a coincidence that we were not inclined to take chancesis nothing but the truth and can you blame us we rounded the last stubby finger or leaf lobe or whatever you please and started up the east coast of the peninsula we did all this sailing around remember instead of just sailing through the canal if wed sailed through the canal tasos wouldnt have been able to scatter contraband all over the lokrian coastline max and i wouldnt have had the chance to meet the vampire or the sea serpent and we wouldnt have run into the pirates either the pirates i was just coming to them i really was now the mykonian sea has islands the way a dog has fleas theyre all over everywhere the tiberian sea between lokris and shqiperi and belagora and the dual monarchy on the one hand and torino on the other isnt like that it has islands yes but they all cling to the coastline that runs north from lokris hardly any at all on the torinan side i have no answer for why thats so till i started talking about it i didnt even know i had a question i will say one thing for the islands in the tiberian sea theyre shaggier than the ones farther west they havent had all the trees chopped down so their mountains have bearded cheeks laertes son came off one of those islands aiaia it was back in the ancient daysyou know the fellow whose wanderings were an odyssey in themselves he was a man who could work wood remember the bed back in his palace and remember the boat he built with not much more than an axe and an adze some people say he was a pirate too to tell you the truth i wouldnt be surprised the men who live on those islands nowadays can still work wood with the best of them and the whoresons are still pirates too oh the lokrian navy tries why there must be three or four sloops and frigates along the east coast of lokris that do nothing but hunt piratesand go after smugglers and keep shqipetari and torinan fishing boats out of lokrian coastal waters and help lokrian fishermen who get in trouble and go after sea serpents and do a little fishing themselves the tunny in those waters are very fine and run cattle and sheep from the islands to the mainland and survey the rocks around the islands and show the lokrian flag and look impressive so there we were coming up alongside one of those islandsaiaia itself as a matter of fact and making kind of heavy going of it because the worlds wind lay dead against us stagiros was doing everything he could but when the wind he called up had to fight something not far from a gale the gamemeno lost a lot of the speed shed shown up till then we might have been the only ship on the tiberian sea trying to make headway against the worlds wind some fishing boats sat more or less in one place their anchors out to hold them there others scudded south using the wind instead of working against it if they wanted to go north again they could either tack into the teeth of the galewhich was even slower than what we were doingor wait till the weather got better tasos didnt seem altogether displeased no one can chase us down he said the lokrian navy has no ship that could chase us down the lokrian navy certainly had none in those waters but saying that the lokrian navy couldnt do this or that was like saying a mouse couldnt have built the wonderful buildings on lakedaimons fortress hill it was true but so what and tasos who had such a fine weatherworker was spoiled by having him hed forgotten there were other ways to win a race than by speed alone hed forgotten cheating as a matter of fact which is an odd thing to have to say about a smuggler but then i could say a lot of odd things about tasos most of them much less complimentary than that i was up at the gamemenos bow looking ahead toward what would be my kingdom oh i couldnt see shqiperi yet but the lokrian coastline i could see wouldnt be a whole lot different it would have lokrians and not shqipetari living on it but i couldnt see that from however far out to sea we were the winds howled and swirled i stood right where stagiros wizardly wind faded and the worlds wind grew strong they fought each other there now one having the advantage now the other now a small twister forming as neither would give way i hung on to the rail a southbound fishing boat darted past us the four or five men in her staring at us as if amazed we could move in the opposite direction one of the fishermen pointed back to the north and shouted something the worlds wind blew his words away it might almost have been jealous of stagiros and his skill when i looked north i saw another vessel speeding along with the worlds wind this one was bigger than a fishing boat though a little smaller than the gamemeno she seemed to be coming right down on us swelling alarmingly as she closed tasos shouted at her through cupped hands he shouted at her through a megaphone he could have shouted at her with eliphalets great voice the worlds wind would have flung his words back in his face all the same the worlds wind didnt like us that day he shouted again this time to his sailors the rudder and the sails took the gamemeno out of the oncoming ships path an instant later that other ship swerved so we were back in her path again i thought her skipper must have been a clumsy bungling oaf even i can be naive tasos who always infested these waters should have known better we should have turned away from the other vessel long since with the worlds wind and stagiros working together we could have run away from anything but we didnt and then when she was almost within crossbow range of us that other ship ran up the white flag with the black hand i dont know how long pirates have been flying that flag if the black hand would grab them all by the throat and choke them id be a lot happier and so would every honest sailor in the world i do know that tasos let out a bleat like a sheep that just found out where mutton comes from he shouted to his sailors one more time we couldnt just turn around and run away that takes time and room and we had neither all we could do was twist aside if once we could get the pirate ship downwind of us wed be safe her weatherworker wouldnt be able to beat back against the worlds wind the way stagiros could but she had the weather gage on us and she wasnt about to let go on us we zigged she zigged with us we zagged so did she her captain made his not too poor but not too honest living outguessing other skippers tasos was a pretty good sailor at least as long as he had stagiros with him nobody though would ever have accused him of being long on brainsand there were good and cogent reasons why nobody would have accused him of it too he did have the sense to send crossbowmen forward and to serve out a variety of lethal hardware to the rest of the sailors my sword was belowdecks so for my very own i got an iron rod about three feet long not an elegant weapon but one good for a few fractures here and there max was already armed and presumed dangerous dont swallow anybody elses sword mind you i told him he made as if to bow let me write that down eliphalet pickle me if he didnt pull out a little notebook and do it too crossbow quarrels started to fly the pirates opened up on us before they should have the first few shafts fell in the sea then they thunked into our planking then one of them thunked into a man he made the most appalling noises people arent made to be pierced by sharp steel points traveling much too fast it happens all the time but it really shouldnt something should be done id seen fighting with the hassocki army i knew what battle was like even then since those days of course weve seen the war of the kingdoms which made what id seenand the nekemte wars tooseem like playground games by comparison maybe that was enough to teach us all a lesson on the other hand maybe it wasnt i wouldnt bet anything i could afford to lose we started shooting back since we couldnt run away we bloody well had to fight pirates are not nice people if they took us they wouldnt invite us aboard for tea the chivalrous rogues of romance are murderous bastards for real i cheered like a madman when one of them took a quarrel right between his beady eyes much too soon they lay right alongside us grappling hooks flew out and bit into our rail and our deck locking the two ships in an unwelcome embrace our sailors cut a couple of ropes but they got shot doing it too more hooks stuck fast pirates began leaping from their ship to ours gangplanks thrust out across the narrow strip of sea between us more pirates crossed on them i even wished the klephts were still on board the pirates had the same motley assortment of ironmongery as we did but there were more of them and they looked meaner they reckoned without stagiros there by eliphalets windy homilies was a weatherworker in a million he turned the gale that had been in the gamemenos sails on the pirates sails are made to withstand such a storm pirates arent some of them went to their knees some of them got blown over the side since the gamemeno and the pirate ship were smashing together and then pulling apart in the drink between them was not a good place to be i heard shrieks a couple of them abruptly cut off as the ships came together again i was too busy to waste much pity on the poor uninnocents the weatherworkers gale affected his shipmates not a bit he even remembered to include max and me in that protection i brought my iron bar down smartly on the head of a pirate whod been blown to the deck he groaned and let go of the cutlass he was carrying since he didnt seem to need it any more i picked it up myself with it in my right hand and the bar in my left doing duty for a shield i was a fairly formidable fellow someones head rolled along the pitching deck i wasnt sorry to see it didnt belong to anyone i knew whoever he was he was making a mess on the timbers i would have complained but i didnt think he was in a mood to listen max examined his blade which was red all the way to the hilt i really will have to clean this before i swallow it again he said and then went back to the fight that didnt last much longer the pirates abruptly lost their enthusiasm for it instead of pushing forward all of a sudden they were scrambling to get back aboard their own ship they pulled the gangplanks away from the gamemeno they might have feared we would follow them they cut the lines that bound their ship to ours in fact they cut them while a couple of their friends were still on our ship those friends didnt stay there long at least not in any state to complain about the accommodations we offered the pirate ship put on a full spread of canvas and sped off to the south before the worlds wind their weatherworker added whatever he could to it they wanted to get away from us as fast as they could we held in our grief at the parting two or three of the pirates on our deck were still writhing and moaning we put an end to that nonsense in short order after a few whacks with an iron bar no one moans any more we threw the bodies into the sea there were nine of them not counting the ones whod gone overboard wed lost two of our own plus another three wounded tasos scraped my face with his unshaven chin as he kissed me on both cheeks a pleasantry i could have done without thou art a lion he cried in hassocki thou art an eagle thou art a very dragon of bravery and might my withers are wrung with sorrow that i might have lived my days without the boon of seeing thy valor on display then he pulled max down to somewhere close to his level and delivered another set of kisses he gave max a set of endearments not the same as mine but cut from the same bolt of fabric as max turned away he spoke in schlepsigian well that was fun i dont know whether he meant the fight or tasos congratulations either way i thought i might have scented a whiff of irony in the air along with the iron stink of blood and the latrine reek of bowels loosed in death i went back to the poop deck whether tasos knew it or not stagiros was the one who really deserved all the praise he could get i thought we were dead men i said and we would have been too if not for you he shrugged i got the idea praise made him nervous which only proved him no ordinary lokrian i did what i could he said i am no swordsman or archer i used the only weapon i know you saved all of us i said and i think thats true whatever captain tasos is paying you it isnt enough would i have talked like that to somebody i was paying i have my doubts but it wasnt my money and quite a bit of it evidently was the weatherworkers with a smile he said i could buy and sell you from most lokrians that would have been bragging the way he made it sound he was sorry it was true but it was anyhow he was something special all right yes well look what youd have once you did i noticed i still had the pirates cutlass in my right fist i had to do some serious talking to that hand before it would let go want a souvenir i asked thank you but no stagiros tossed his head the way lokrians will i wouldnt have been surprised had he shaken it the way most people would he was the most cosmopolitan lokrian i ever met yes a smugglers weatherworker and he eyed me the way a natural philosopher will eye a nondescript beetle why on earth are you going to shqiperi why would anyone in his right mind go to shqiperi i struck a pose the cutlass came in handy after all to become king of the land of the eagle i said grandly the shqipetari will kill you he could have been taking lessons from max except he didnt sound quite doleful enough ill have fun till they do i declared he looked at me he looked through me he might have been the sensible staid man of schlepsig i the wild excitable lokrian madness he murmured i bowed but a great madness i said we put in at vravron the next day vravron is the lokrian port nearest the border to shqiperi it has other things wrong with it too it isnt one of tasos regular stops he went into the harbor for a couple of reasonsto pick up sailors to replace the men hed lost and because max and i asked him to if it hadnt been the day after the fight with the pirates im sure this strange fit of gratitude would have worn off tasos was not a man much afflicted by such sentiments but he folded both of us into a sweaty embrace and said my valiant ones i can deny you nothing to prove he could deny us nothing he swigged from a flask of aniseflavored spirits and handed it to me i would like to know which foundry copperplated tasos gullet and stomach id give them my business any timethey do good work my own innards being mere flesh and blood commenced to smolder when i poured that poison down them delicious i wheezed amazed i hadnt incinerated my vocal cords i passed max the flask hed lit a cigar that alarmed me i feared hed turn into a human blowtorch but he survived and gave the flask back to tasos later i found out hed held his tongue against the mouth of the flask and hadnt drunk at all i wish i would have thought of that it would have saved my plumbing some serious abuse when we came into vravron harbor customs men started buzzing around the gamemeno like flies around a five days dead rabbit like the flies they scented a feast none of them ever came aboard though and i never saw tasos hand out even a hemidemilepta his hand may have been quicker than my eye of course my eye saw shqipetarimy subjects though they knew it not most of the longshoremen at vravron harbor and all of the sweepers and trash haulers were men whod come down from the north after more work and better than they could find in their mountains more work they got better not likely in schlepsig quite a few miners and quarrymen and busboys and barbers and the like are lokrians they do work few schlepsigians care to do and they do it for less money than most schlepsigians would take theyre convenient even if hotheads do rant about dirty foreigners in this corner of lokris the shqipetari were doing work few lokrians cared to do and i had no doubt they were doing it for less money than most lokrians would take they wereconvenient i dont speak lokrian but the looks and the tone of voice the locals gave them said they thought the shqipetari were a bunch of dirty foreigners they stood out eliphalet knows thats so they were tall men most of them long and leanhalf a head taller than the lokrians more or less some had faces like falcons narrow and fierce others looked more like horses they let their mustaches droop down past the corners of their mouths which made them look like brigands even if by some chance they werent they wore white headwrapsnot quite turbans because their hair stuck out in the middle an odd effect i found out later that they shaved part or all of the scalp that didnt show which made them look even odder without the wraps their shirts had all started out white too over them they wore short fringed cloaks tight black breeches embroidered in red and rawhide sandals completed the outfits well almost shqipetari wouldnt be shqipetari without weapons on their home grounds they festooned themselves with swordscurved and straightand crossbows and boar spears and pikes and morningstars and whatever other charming tools their imagination and their smiths could come up with they tricked themselves out with silver chains too those who could afford them so they jingled when they walked to my mind that made them seem less bloodthirsty but they didnt seem to care lokrian law frowned on flaunting murder quite so openly in vravron they were limited to one knife apiece somemostof those knives could have done duty for ancient aenean shortswords their hilts and scabbards were chaised chased with silver if a shqipetar was somebody he wanted you to know it they eyed max and me as we got off the gamemeno i could flatter myself and say it was my good looks but more likely it was maxs inches they were big men yes but not many overtopped me and none came close to max you should have worn your sword i told him even if wearing it would have been illegal then they would think you were one of them just what i always wanted he said finding out where vravrons crystallography office was proved a trial none of the lokrians we ran into admitted to speaking any language but his own which did us no good when the shqipetari talked among themselves it sounded as if they were trying to choke to death no country that calls itself something like shqiperi can be all good but i discovered that some of the men from the mountains knew hassocki while others spoke bits and pieces of vlachian since vlachians border them where lokrians dont that wasnt too surprising thanks to my stints in the hassocki army i had hassocki and bits and pieces of vlachian myself we managed i spread around a few coins too to encourage memories that also helped and they didnt have to be very big coins shqipetari come to lokris because theyre hungry as in thasos the consolidated crystal office in vravron was an island of efficiency in a sea of well lokrianity max and i got in line to send our message and the line moved the clerks werent sitting around drinking little cups of strong syrupysweet coffee or smoking cigars or gabbing about women or the rowing races or whatever they do for fun in vravron they must do something there i suppose they didnt act all high and mighty either if cc gets complaints about its clerks it gets new clerks and in a hurry too the people who work in those offices know it it keeps them on their toes the clerk we got spoke decent schlepsigian but better narbonese so we used that i filled out forms and paid the fee and he took me back to a crystallographer the sorcererlike the one in thasos he wore a homburgspoke schlepsigian at least as well as i do though his olive skin broad forehead large dark liquid eyes and narrow delicate chin said he was a lokrian to whom are you sending your message he asked to essad pasha in peshkepiia in shqiperi i answered his eyebrows were a ravens wings they fluttered in surprise essad pasha serves a kingdom at war with this one he said he couldnt have been listening to the crystallographer in thasos i know that we danced around the same barn even so he warned that lokrian wizards would examine the message i promised it held no hostile intent this time unlike in thasos i knew the steps to the dance i wasnt making them up as i went along when the mage was satisfied he poised a pen over a pad and asked and the message is you speak hassocki i asked in that tongue certainly sir he replied also in hassocki im good with languages but he was better you have to be sharp to work for consolidated crystal even in a place like vravron still in hassocki he went on please go ahead here is the message then i said arriving soon at fushekuqe looking forward halim eddin those ravens wings fluttered again well well he murmured i hoped he wouldnt gossip cc discourages that and not many people have the nerve to do anything cc discourages i dared hope anyhow i also dared hope that by keeping my message simple i wouldnt make any errors to draw suspicion my way he had to use a spell to find the eightdigit number that uniquely identified essad pashas crystalbeing a prominent official the hassocki commandant in shqiperi had a personal crystallographer attached to him the man in vravron murmured the charm and the number to connect his crystal to that one light flared inside the crystal on the cc mans desk i got a glimpse of essad pashas crystallographer in the depths of the sphere a plump hassocki in a fez with only one client he didnt need to dress to impress it is accomplished my crystallographer said i thank you very much i told him you dont know what youve done for shqiperi to shqiperi max said i glared at him but the crystallographer seemed to like his version better than mine vii ah fushekuqe fushekuqe some ancient aenean poet sang of its beauty all those years ago i presume he had the advantage of not approaching the place in a smuggler actually it is pretty it sits in a little sapphireblue bay punched out of the rim of shqiperi the only decent harbor the country has all around the edge of the bay and running a few miles to either side are beautiful beaches of white and golden sand the rest of shqiperis coast consists of an unappetizing mix of rocks boulders crags cliffs and outandout mountains leaping straight up from the tiberian sea as if their shoelaces were on fire some of this terrain is thickly wooded most of it is too steep for trees they would have to grow sideways if they grew at all the land rises steeply back of the bay too but half a mile to a mile back of it fushekuqe runs up from the sea to the ridge line the ancient dalmatiansthe ancestors of the shqipetarifirst fortified the place but they did a spotty job of it so lokrian freebooters were able to capture it in due course the dalmatians took it back with the usual massacre to celebrate the change of ownership the aeneans took it away from them and celebrated with a bigger massacre each new owner added new fortifications figuring he would be there forever forever usually worked out to about a lifetime over the past thousand years fushekuqe has changed hands thirteen times when tasos told that to max he said how lucky that left tasos scratching his heador maybe he did have dandruff with legs after all but the lokrians dont suffer from triskaidekaphobia even if the name comes from pieces of classical lokrian by then max was wearing the enormous hassocki captains uniform hed got from manolis in thasos i had on the colonels outfit id bought there some of tasos smugglers looked askance at us id never seen a skance before but lots of skances were flying around as we came into the harbor if we hadnt fought the pirates alongside them if max hadnt curbed the sea serpents tongue we might have gone into the harbor all right with rocks tied around our feet but we had and so while the skances flew they didnt light on us stagiros got us up alongside a wharf with his usual elegance he was the best thing aboard the gamemeno if not for him we likely wouldnt have got to fushekuqe at all he looked from max to me and back again good luckyour majesty he said in flawless hassocki north and south east and west may good come to you from every direction i replied i had to remember all the time from now on that i was a hassocki a follower of the quadrate god what a role and what a risk that started to sink in now when it was too late to do anything about it if even once i absentmindedly swore by eliphalets whiskers or made the sign of the two with index and middle fingers i was a dead man and so was max stagiros gave me a small bow and an even smaller smile id passed the first tiny test down went the gangplank with a thud my head would make a thud like that if something went wrong i glanced over at max he was smiling which is not something you see every day i wondered if our spirits had got up in the wrong bodies this morning me worrying max cheerful the cosmic order of things was definitely out of order we stepped onto the pier my worries fell away like fireballs from a dragon maybe as stagiros said it was madness or maybe i realized it was too late to turn back and i had to go on or maybe those two were one and the same however it was i knew i was in the ring again i had my audience out there and i had to perform here comes trouble max murmuredin hassocki he sounded like his old self too but his old self in character i saw the trouble as soon as he did two hassocki soldiersa young lieutenant with a neat hairline mustache and an older sergeant with an enormous soupstrainerwalked toward the base of the pier the lieutenant wore only a ceremonial sword the sergeant carried a pike had a much more businesslike sword and a knife on his belt and no doubt kept some other lethal implements secreted here and there about his person lets go i said to max and started down the pier toward them he followed a pace behind me and a pace to my left just where a princes aidedecamp should walk yes hed thought i was crazy for a lot longer than stagiros had but he wasnt about to give me away of course it was his neck too if they decided to kill me they werent what youd call likely to leave him alone the lieutenant looked down at something in the palm of his left hand up toward me then down at his hand again i couldnt see what he had there but i could make a pretty good guess if that wasnt another sorcerous reproduction of the portrait that had run in the thasos chronicle and started me off on this adventure then i wasnt prince halim eddin which i bloody well wasnt except i had to be that lieutenant looked up at me one more time i stopped so did max he stopped breathing too your highness the lieutenant said and max exhaled again now that you mention it i did too if i was going to do this i was going to do it to the hilt i looked down my nose at him and said i expected to be met by essad pasha himself in tones that should have frozen the sun the lieutenant was swarthy but i could see him turn red anyhow the look on the sergeants face said i told you so it also said i wonder how much trouble were in one thing it didnt say was he speaks funny hassocki the way i sounded seemed to satisfy the lieutenant too he bowed to me and said please excuse us your highness we were ordered to escort you to him we were ordered meant its not our fault it was cleverly phrased so much so that the sergeant smiled at him and you dont see an underofficer smiling at an officer every day oh very well by the way i said it id been planning to take their heads but i supposedjust barely supposed mind youit wasnt worth the mess it would make the sergeants smile flickered and blew out i went on escort us then bowing againmore deeply this timethe lieutenant said yes your highness just as you say your highness please come with us your highness his knees werent knocking together but they werent far from it i glanced back at max my face said i could get used to this without moving a muscle his face said you are used to this and youd better remember it hes even more annoying than usual when hes right we followed essad pashas soldiers my soldiers now into fushekuqe our guides stopped at an elegant torinanstyle building next to a temple to the quadrate god torino of course is just on the other side of the tiberian sea its been interested in grabbing fushekuqe and all of shqiperi for years this proves only one thing the torinans havent taken a very good look at the country they say they want if they had they wouldnt several grimfaced guards stood outside the arched doorway they looked ready to shoot anything that moved if it didnt move they looked ready to shoot it anyway just to see if putting a couple of holes in it might get it movingat which point they would shoot it again when they saw me they stiffened to attention they banged their heels togethera schlepsigian style thats caught on in the hassocki army your highness they bawled more or less in unison that done they goggled at max who towered head and shoulders above the tallest of them he affected not to notice they existed they were only soldiers after all while he was an officer in his own surly way he was playing his role to the hilt too i however was a prince i had to notice all my people even if i knew they were beneath me at ease i told the guards and they relaxed their braceabout a hairs worth i turned back to my escorts take me to essad pasha yes your highness they said together the sergeant opened the door the lieutenant bowed and gestured followed by my aidedecampwho had to duck to get under the linteli preceded him into essad pashas headquarters the sergeant came last and closed the door behind us that sort of thing was what soldiers were for stepping lively the lieutenant got out in front of me and led me down a corridor to an airy aerie that gave a good view of the harbor hes here your excellency he said his voice throbbing with excitement well then hed better come in here hadnt he a gruff voice answered if it held any excitement it held it very close indeed max coughed max coughs too much for his own good but i knew what he meant this timesomething on the order of you wont impress this fellow with your high and mighty manners i didnt see it that way if anything would impress someone like essad pasha it was a prince acting like a prince i strode into the office and stood waiting expectantly essad pasha sat behind a businesslike desk i might have seen in an office in schlepsig two ordinary chairs sat in front of it but so did piles of fringed and tasseled velvet cushions for those who preferred to recline hassockistyle like his aerie essad pasha himself was a mixture of modern east and ancient unchanging west he wore a dustbrown hassocki uniform like my own his had a major generals two golden stars on each shoulder strap he was about sixty and built like a brick i wouldnt have cared to tangle with him even if i had twenty years on him his face was broad and square with deep lines and a fierce mustache only now going gray his pouchy hooded eyes said hed seen everything and done everything and most of it hadnt been worth seeing or doing they said i wasnt worth seeing either max hadnt been far wrong by his military grade essad pasha outranked me but i was of the blood royalor he thought i wasand he wasnt he should have treated me the way he thought i deserved when he just sat there my blood royal or not started to boil the emotion was ersatz but it felt real would prince halim eddin let an underling disrespect him so not likely if i was halim eddin would i on thy feet dog and son of a dog i roared truly thy mother was a bitch and thou knowest what that makes thee thinkest thou thy head shall not answer for thine accursed insolence now essad pasha could have been rid of us with a snap of the fingers all he had to do was say to the lieutenant kill them and we were dead men he could have but he didnt it never once crossed his mind as soon as i started shouting at him the color drained from his ruddy face i guess he hadnt counted on getting a king who intended to be a king truly they say the hassocki is either at your throat or at your feet his chair went over with a crash he sprang upright probably moving faster than he had in years youryour highness he gabbled forgive me your highness north and south east and west i meant no harm i meant no insult let the god look into my heart and see if i lie north and south east and west essad pasha thou hast been too long in this far land i said thou hast been a warrior thou hast been a governor but thou art not a king wert thou a king didst thou purpose becoming a king wouldst thou have summoned me even though i wasnt flinging direct insults at him any more i kept on using the secondperson intimate which was insulting all by itself to one who was neither a close friend nor a small child i did it as if i had the right to do it and because i did it that way i won the right to do it i turned to max yildirim i said giving him a hassocki name on the spur of the moment maybe i was thinking of the first ship we rode for it means thunderbolt your sword yildirim out it came the edge glittering once again it did the trick mercy your highness essad pasha wailed i abase myself before you your highness and may eliphalet turn his back on me if the old bandit chief didnt going down first on his knees and then on his belly bending his head and baring the nape of his neck let your man strike now by the god if i mean to do you harm max took one loud thumping step forward your highness he inquired as if to say my will was the only thing in the world holding him back executing the man whod invited meor rather my doublehere might have caused talk especially when it would be for no more reason than that he stood up more slowly than he should have on the other hand the hassocki respected shows of willful fury i really could get used to this i thought put up yildirim i said with a sigh and his sword slid back into its sheath i turned back to essad pasha rise i told him you are forgiventhis time there had better not be another when he got to his feet his face was the color of yogurt cold sweat beaded his forehead he breathed in great hitching gasps he was used to putting others in fear it must have been a long time since anyone turned the tables on him trulyyour highnessis a lionof righteousness he got out a few words at each gasp id been lyin every inch of the way to get this far but righteousness brother be so good as to remember it henceforward i said i hadnt even been crowned yet but i felt every inch a king i suggested to essad pasha that i review the hassocki soldiers in fushekuqe i didnt suggest that i would turn max loose on him if he said no i let him figure that out for himself he was a clever fellow he could do all kinds of figuring for himself gathering the troops together took a couple of hours it shouldnt have essad pasha should have had them ready for me as soon as i stepped off the gamemeno i let him hear about that too he went pale again not quite yogurt color but about the shade of a mans teeth after hes smoked a pipe for fifty years as long as i kept him worrying about things like his alleged discourtesy and unpreparedness he wouldnt think to worry about me i hoped like blazes he wouldnt anyhow while we were waiting he remarked i did not look for your highness to be a man of such ah impetuous spirit life is full of surprises i said while max suffered a coughing fit of truly epic proportions what sort of man was the real halim eddin a placid fool someone essad pasha had expected to lead around by the nose someone who would reign over shqiperi while essad pasha went right on ruling the land of the eagle whatever hed expected hed reckoned without otto of schlepsig and if eliphalet and zibeon were kind hed go right on reckoning without me too after what seemed much too long the lieutenant whod led me here came back to essad pashas office to report that the men were drawn up in a square not far away about time i muttered and essad pasha squirmed i gave the lieutenant my fishiest most carping stare take me there and be quick about it yyyes your highness the junior officer needed three tries before he got it out hed watched his ferocious boss crumble before me and that was plenty to turn him from rock to sand as he led us toward this square max bent to murmur in my ear do you know what the demon youre doing trust me i whispered back which for some reason only set him coughing again i fear your aidedecamp may be consumptive your highness essad pasha said looking up and up and up at max oh he consumes a good deal being the size he is but hes worth it i answered blandly essad pasha lifted his fez to scratch his head confusing him was almost as good as intimidating him row upon row of soldiers in dustbrown uniforms all stiff and straight all with eyes front a bugle blared out a flatulent note salute the illustrious nephew of his majesty the hassockian atabeg essad pasha cried his voice held a certain urgency do a good job or youll watch my head bounce in the dirt someone once said nothing so concentrates the mind as the prospect of a sixfooteight swordsman with an eviltempered master perhaps i paraphrase just a little highness the soldiers roared all together a great blast of sound not even halim eddin could have found anything to complain about there and so i didnt i strode forward and started the review max started coughing again but here for the first time since i got to fushekuqe i really did know what i was doing no id never reviewed troops before but id been reviewed standing in those rigormortised ranks some of my reviews were less than flattering too this is bad in the theater its worse in the army say what you will of the theater but it has no dragonish platoon sergeants now things were different now i was the one who went through the ranks making sure buttons were shiny and crossbow quarrels sharp when i stopped in front of one man i saw the poor fellows sergeants neck bulge almost as if he were a cobra spreading its hood and getting ready to strike and he would have struck too if id found anything wrong with the mans gear or person but i didnt all i asked was where are you from soldier from outside a little town called adapzari highness he answered blinking to find that the likes of me could speak to the likes of him you wont have heard of it im sure i know adapzari i said and i didid been stationed there even by hassocki standards the place is a dreadful hole and hassocki standards in such matters are exacting i didnt say that to this poor youngster how could i when he came from there and now found himself stuck in another dreadful hole what i did do was wink and poke him in the ribs and ask did you ever visit the green panther his eyes lit up north and south east and west your highness you do know adapzari he exclaimed then he went on ive been by the place but i was never in it that didnt surprise me the green panther is the best joyhouse in adapzarinot that that says muchand you need piasters in your pocket to get past the door this poor fellow likely wouldnt have had two coppers to rub together before he got sucked into the army i clapped him on the back when you go home again youll have plenty to spend there then i turned to that venomouslooking sergeant this man is a good soldier yes i hoped he was he looked too ordinary to be a shirker or a thief but sometimes looks will let you down to my relief the underofficer nodded he is highness he replied and his neck shrank till it was hardly more than half again as thick as an ordinary mortals he wouldnt want to admit he had a shirker or a thief in his squad either good im glad to hear it im sure part of the reason is that he has solid men set above him i said the sergeants neck swelled again but this time from pride rather than fury i could tell because it didnt turn so red continuing on through the ranks i stopped and talked with two or three other men i didnt find anything wrong with any of them a reviewer who does that kind of thing has a cruel streak in him that i lack essad pasha would have done it in a heartbeat for sport i nodded to him when my inspection was done theyre fine men i said im sure ill get good use from them your highness he said doubtfully good use from them i repeated i think essad pasha would have scratched his head again if he hadnt been out there in front of the garrison i looked at the soldiersyes at my soldiers some of them still stared straight ahead at nothing but others had a gleam in their eye that hadnt been there before prince halim eddin made a leader they would sooner follow than essad pasha yes i know this is like saying tastier than an oyster stew thats gone bad but think how downcast i would have been if theyd found me less inspiring than their current commander essad pasha sighed well your highness i am glad the soldiers are to your liking he said you may be rightyou may get use from them after all considering vlachia to the west considering belagora to the north considering the wild shqipetari of the mountainsyes you may indeed more slowly than i should have i realized he hadnt just bought his wrinkles and lines in a shop in fushekuqe hed come by them as honestly as you can from cares and worries and hed had plenty to worry aboutand still did for the nekemte wars dragged on here and belagoran troops were laying siege to tremist up in the north they actually wanted a chunk of shqiperi which made them all but unique among the kingdoms of the earth not even the shqipetari were enthusiastic about shqiperi or there wouldnt have been so many of them living in lokris but such as it was it was mine and i aimed to keep it soldiers seemed a good start once the review was over essad pasha had his revenge on me he proved himself a cruel implacable hassocki after all no he didnt stake me out in the hot sun with trails of honey leading ants to my tender places he didnt sharpen a stake and stick it up mysince he didnt do that i wont go into detail about what he might have done i dont care to dwell on it no his vengeance was subtler more refinedand more vicious after the review essad pasha threw me to the scribes i wouldnt have thought that particular breed of pest thrived in shqiperis rugged bracing climate few shqipetari can read or write anything let alone journals considering the way or rather ways for there is no one standard schoolyet another proof of lack of civilization they spell their own barbarous jargon its a wonder any of them can read or write at all but the vermin to whose tender mercies i was now exposed were foreigners embedded on the countrysiderather like ticks as a matter of fact some had come to write stories proving the hassocki were villains and monsters in the nekemte wars and that the belagorans vlachs lokrians plovdivians and even shqipetari were valiant righteous heroes othersa smaller numberhad come to write stories proving that the belagorans vlachs lokrians plovdivians and shqipetari were villains and monsters and that the hassocki were valiant righteous heroes a few freelancers had come to write stories that could go either way depending on which journal decided to buy them a plump albionese named bob wore one of the most pathetic excuses for a wig ive ever had the misfortune to see and on the stage and in the circus ive seen some astonishing specimens he asked me whether i wasnt ashamed to belong to such a bloodthirsty pack of murderers as the hassocki i was glad he gave me so much trouble figuring out which camp he belonged to he asked me of course in albionese the islanders expect everyone to speak their language and never bother learning anyone elses now i do speak albionese but i had no reason to believe essad pasha did i bought a little time by asking bob to translate his question into schlepsigian if a hassocki will speak any foreign language that is the one but he couldnt to my not very great surprise someone did it for him ah i said as if understanding him for the first time no i am proud to be what i am any man should be proud of his kingdom i hope the shqipetari will be proud of their kingdom once it finally comes into beingand of their king too once that was translated into albionese bob said how can they be proud of their king when you arent of their people again waiting for his words to be turned into schlepsigian gave me time to think your king of albion comes from a line that springs from a schlepsigian principality doesnt he i answered i dont hear of people rioting in the streets because of it when bob was made to understand he exclaimed oh but thats different by which he meant thats albion he had a point of sorts albionese will put up with a good deal of nonsense that would cause street fighting in narbonensis revolution in tver and civil war in lokris may i ask you a question i said to him in schlepsigian once he had that rendered into his language he nodded his jowls wobbled so did his wig he made as if to tug at his hair to settle it back in place i had to betray a little knowledge of albionese to ask how is it that you have your name i thought a bob was the float they use in these newfangled privies bob the scribe turned very red i had the feeling that question would not appear in whichever journal he worked for his colleagues laughed loud and long they hunt in packs scribes do but you can tell them from wolves because theyre the ones who will also turn and devour their own kind how will the new kingdom look toward torino a torinan scribe asked in schlepsigian the two languages are as different as wine and sauerkraut so his accent was fierce but he made himself understood which was more than blundering blustering bob could do i gave back my blandest smile why sir i expect we will look east across the tiberian sea and there it will be that got me another laugh if you can make scribes like you half your battle is wonmore than half in fact i learned that early on they usually write what they feel not what they thinkjust as well since most of them are none too good at thinking anyhow an evening telling jokes over coffee or brandyover coffee and brandy usuallywill win you more good reviews than a sterling performance but when you look across to torino what will you see this fellow persisted a neighbor a good neighbor i hope i answered bland still shqiperi stands between vlachia and the sea a schlepsigian scribe said proving he could read a map how do you feel about keeping vlachia from gaining ports good i thought but that might have proved impolitica pity but true what i did say was shqipetari live in shqiperi vlachs dont that was mostly true i added quite a few shqipetari live in vlachia though that was most definitely true the province of polje in southern vlachia holds more shqipetari than vlachs this is curious because the province of polje is the next thing to sacred ground to the vlachs there more than five hundred years ago the hassockian atabeg crushed their army and brought them under hassocki rule if hed slaughtered that army to the last man instead of leaving a few survivors they would probably still reverence him instead of eliphalet and zibeon vlachs are peculiar people how do you like being king that same scribe asked im not king yeti havent been crowned im sure essad pasha having kindly invited me here is making arrangements for that now i said essad pasha hastily nodded his jowls wobbled when he did but not nearly so much as those of bob the albionese i went on besides if id stayed in vyzance i never would have become the hassockian atabeg i get to start my own dynasty here what was it like for the real halim eddin there he was in that ancient city with his fathers older brother with a crown on his head one of his first cousins would have it next the only thing he would ever have was a mantle of suspicion he was lucky he still had his father quite a few hassockian atabegs had massacred their brothers as soon as they claimed the throne this was called not taking unnecessary chances maybe the present atabeg was milder than some of his predecessorsthough from what i knew of the old reptile i doubted it maybe halim eddins father was too much of a rabbit to be dangerous maybe i was spinning stories out of moonshine i didnt know the real halim eddin and i hoped i never made his acquaintance that schlepsigian scribe was persistent he must have thought getting each days trivia down on paper mattered in the bigger scheme of things we all have our illusions who could get through life without them after you are crowned what do you intend to do he inquired live happily ever after and try to see that my subjects do too i said that got me yet another laugh scribes are jaded they mostly make their living off other peoples misfortunes someone living a long quiet prosperous lifewho could get a story out of that but when theres a battle or a flood or a scandal you can talk about it for daysand then spend more days talking about what youve just talked about and the wizards in the press room use the laws of similarity and contagion to run off sheets by the tens of thousands sometimes till they fall over from weariness and people in the street buy those copies as fast as they can i wonder if scribes arent related to vampires they suck sorrows the way vampires suck blood but garlic and roses wont keep them away and you can never drive a stake through a lying storys heart you will rule a small kingdom in a troubled part of the world another scribe saidhe was looking for disaster even before it happened how will you keep your kingdom free north and south east and west the world is full of troubles i said and the sorry old world has done nothing to prove me wrong in the years since however much i wish it would i also reminded themand myselfthat i followed the quadrate god if troubles come here ill do my best to drive them away the shqipetari love freedom they will stand beside me most of the shqipetari are entirely indifferent to freedom save perhaps the freedom to plunder their neighbors the hassocki had ruled the region by holding the towns and killing anybody who got out of line not subtle maybe but more effective than any other way thats been tried in those parts long ago the aeneans found the same recipe it worked for them too for a while thank you very much gentlemen i said two thousand years ago some aenean emperor was probably telling his scribes the same thing no doubt it meant then what it means now go away you nuisances youve bothered me long enough the aenean emperor could have made heads roll if his scribes hadnt listened to him all at once i realized i could do the same but my pack did go away life is full of disappointments there are i suppose bigger ones i suppose where i watched the scribes go with a certain bloodthirsty regret essad pasha knew nothing but relief as they headed down toward the consolidated crystal office you handled them very well your highness he said better than i expected in fact oh i said and the air around me got ten degrees colder maybe fifteen up went my left eyebrow that expression looks like ive practiced it in the mirror theres a reason for that i have ive practiced it for a reason too it works and why is it better than you expected your excellency he went pale again nice to know he was convinced i meant business mememeaning no offense he finally got out but theythey are infidels and foreigners out to trip you up he wasnt wrong though they would have been just as ghoulishly gleeful to trip up a follower of the two prophets i said if we hassocki are not more clever than foreign infidels the quadrate god will not smile upon the four corners of our land by the way the hassockian empire has been shrinking for the past years the quadrate god hasnt smiled much lately i forbore from mentioning that and essad pasha out here in what had been the remotest corner of the empire and now would have to sink or swim on its own nodded till his jowlwobbling really did rival bobs every word a truth worthy to be inscribed in letters of gold he said when the compliments turn flowery you know youve got your man just where you want him knowing that i changed the subject when had you planned to hold the coronation ceremony behind me max inhaled sharply and started to cough not being acquainted with my comrade save as someone who almost took his head a limited and onesided relationship essad pasha didnt know that meant max thought i was getting onto thin ice your highness i had thought to bring you into peshkepiia in two or three days time for the ceremony with perhaps a dragon hunt in the hills beforehand if that should please you he said a dragon hunt would please me well enough i saidnot the smallest understatement of my career there arent many places outside the nekemte peninsulaand not so many in it not in these modern timeswhere you can hunt dragons in the wild that the dragons are also hunting you adds a certain spice to the sport but i couldnt let essad pasha off easily and so i asked why the delay now he coughed with a delicacy max couldnt have matched please forgive me your highness but it was only yesterday when i learned you were arriving i confess to not yet having fully recruited the requisite royal harem theroyal harem i echoed and essad pasha nodded a pace behind me and a pace to my left max didnt cough but his breathing picked up i said well in that case your excellency i think the small delay may be excused essad pasha bowed you are gracious his smile had a certain idontknowwhat about it well actually i do know what it was a leer now harems are right out as far as followers of the two prophets go eliphalet had only one wife zibeon had only one wife the goddess is only one wife i dont see how the rule could be any plainer than that rule or no rule though my coreligionists have been doing what they wanted to do and what they thought they could get away with doing for a good many yearsor should i say a good many centuries if id spoken to a prelate i think i could have got a dispensation i was after all impersonating a personage who followed the quadrate god his followers have silly cumbersome rules of their own but not about wives their only rule there is if they can afford it they can do itand do it and do it and do it to this very day the hassockian atabegs harem is legendary for the beauty and variety of its inhabitants every so often some madman inflamed by lust will try to sneak in the hassocki dont kill such adventurers when they catch them no indeed they let them gominus a few important bits nobody tries to sneak into the harem more than once i didnt suppose essad pasha could find me that sort of quality in this backwoods excuse for a kingdom but i did want to make sure he would be diligent i look forward to ah evaluating the recruits i said i shall do everything i can to give satisfaction your highness and so will the girls i assure you yes essad pasha definitely leered you lucky bastard max hissed when the erstwhile governor of shqiperi turned away my mother and father were married to each other in fact except for that i wasnt inclined to argue with him viii along with a suitable escort i rode out of fushekuqe with max and essad pasha the next morning the shqipetari in the port seemed remarkably indifferent to their new sovereigns departure well one sweeper did wave as i rode by i think he waved he might just have had something in his eye the land of the eagle has some stunningly majestic scenery shqiperi is not a very large kingdom the landscape is large though large enough to dwarf mere mortals and their works roads seem nothing more than thin lines drawn across that immensity well the fanciest roads in shqiperi are narrow rutted dirt tracks which has something to do with it but the fanciest modern schlepsigian carriageway would seem lost and tiny amongst those mountains they rise row on row tier on tier climbing halfway up the sky and more till their midsections they are the pale green of meadows and grainfields then the dark green of pines and firs takes over then the gray of bare rock and then dazzling white snow that that snow on those jagged peaks reminds onethis one at leastof a sharks teeth is perhaps better not dwelt upon i certainly tried not to dwell on it but i didnt have much luck no wonder dragons live in those mountains the country is made for them the wonder is that people live there north and south east and west men with crossbows were watching us i couldnt see them but i could feel their eyes on the back of my neck you must not be sorry to walk away from rule over a land like this i remarked to essad pasha he gave me an odd look of course he was sorry to walk away from rule to his way of thinking only an idiot wouldnt be he would cheerfully have thrown me in that group if i hadnt cowed him after a couple of heartbeats he took the meaning id intended yes the shqipetari can be difficult he said they would have stuck more knives in our backs if they werent so busy stabbing one another his wave encompassed that aweinspiring landscape despite the sunfire flash off the jewels in his rings he made me see the mountains and here and there in the distance the villages that perched on them like scabs on a mangy hound every house was a fortress not to ward the men and women from the ravages of the hassockian empireof which there were plentybut to protect them from their own kind shqiperi is the land of the blood feud lokrians have things they call blood feuds so do torinans the hassocki claim them too but theyre all amateurs the shqipetari nowthe shqipetari mean it if someone from your clan has killed someone from my clan my whole clan has an obligation to kill someone from your clan for the sake of vengeance it can beit often issomeone who hasnt the least idea some hotheaded distant cousin of his has landed him in a smallscale war that doesnt make him any less dead when my clansmate happens to come upon him on a road or lies in wait for him behind a rock and then of course his clan being the most recently injured party my kinsmen go in fear by day or night till one of them lies bleedingor sometimes two or three these feuds go on for years for generations for centuries i wouldnt be surprised if some of them go back to the days before the ancient aeneans brought the dalmatians to heel conquerors come and conquerors go but feuds drag on forever i should do something about that i said essad pasha laughed out loud i glowered at him max coughed and touched the hilt of his sword essad pasha stopped laughing more abruptly than hed started i crave your pardon your highness he said and i wish you good luck the blood feud flourishes in shqiperi to this day but then ialasam king there no more who knows what a golden age the land of the eagle lost in me after a couple of hours in the saddlelong enough for me to begin to feel how little riding id done latelyessad pasha waved again blinking against the refulgent glitter of those gemstones i needed a moment to realize the castle toward which he pointed wasnt one of the many the shqipetari had built to protect themselves from themselves this one was of rather better design and had evidently gone up to protect foreigners from them my shooting box essad pasha said with becoming immodesty i raised an eyebrow i waited max didnt even have to cough essad pasha made haste to correct himself your shooting box your highness thank you i replied as if id expected nothing less i look forward to shooting dragons max coughed then looking back on it i suppose he had just a bit of reason for coughing too yes just a bit as those things go the shooting box was comfortable enough despite the albionese name it did not have an albionese cook for which i thanked the two prophets and the quadrate god impartially any kingdom that will boil bacon doesnt deserve to be allowed anywhere near a fire instead of an albionese the cook was an elderly shqipetari woman with i regret to report a mustache not much smaller than mine her methods had peculiarities of their own the salad she gave us with olives and crumbled white cheese was not much different from what we might have got in lokris though the dressing with pungent wine vinegar and a strong infusion of mint had a tang id never met anywhere else after thatwell how do i explain it where an albionese will throw anything this side of his mother into boiling water a shqipetar will fling it into bubbling oil maybe this has to do with how the two folk fought off besiegers in years gone by or maybe the shqipetari try to imitate the wild dragons of their mountains i dont know why they do it no one can doubt that they do it its not all bad fried capon such as we had that night can be quite tasty it can also come dripping enough grease to keep a carriage from squeaking for a year fried beefsteak on the other hand is the first step toward making leather and the less said of fried mutton the better no one will complain of fried potatoes with plenty of salt the shqipetari prefer bread made from coarsely ground maize flour to the usual sort made of wheat they fry that too after baking it the result would ballast a threemasted ship of the line it stays with a mere mortal for days if not for weeks they fry okra having said that i draw a merciful veil of silence our supper came with a bottle of brandy made from mountain plums and by the potency a good helping of mountain lightning too essad pasha ceremoniously poured glasses of the stuff for himself max and me i waited to see if he would take care of that the usual way followers of the quadrate god may have as many women as they please but they arent supposed to drink to my mind this demonstrates the fundamental falsity of their faith name me a man with as many women as he thinks he wants who doesnt need to drink now and again of course some who reverence the quadrate god are no better than they have to be i might say the same of some who reverence the two prophets i might but i wont essad pasha handled things with catlike aplomb he crooked the little finger of his right hand like an albionese taking hold of a teacup then he dipped the crooked finger into his glass he brought up one sparkling drop of brandy on the end of his finger and ceremoniously flicked it away no he wouldnt drink that drop the rest well the rest was between him and the quadrate god you dont always see that ritual in the lower ranks of the hassocki army as in the lower ranks of any army soldiers drink first and worryor more likely dont worryabout it later my own pinkie and maxs also bent also dipped we flicked we drank after the first sip my eyes crossed lightning in a bottle indeed i eyed the glass respectfully wondering why the brandy hadnt charred through it max however sent essad pasha a reproachful stare you ought to fire your cellarer he remarked in his usual sepulchral tones oh for what reason captain essad pasha sounded wary why for watering the spirits of course max drained his glass without so much as a blink it was not a small glass no not at all he wasnt pretending here the way he had with tasos essad pasha goggled then he tried to do the same thing he choked he spluttered he sprayed brandy down the front of his uniform tunic max took it all in stride why not he pours swords down his throat by the prophets curly whiskers pretending not to notice essad pashas problem he poured himself another glass and drank that down too i love max whenever i can stand him i love him i also know better than to get into a onedownsmanship contest with him aside from his scarred gullet theres more of him to soak up the spirits than there is of me theres more of max than there is of almost anyone a glance will tell you this a glance should have told essad pasha but no somethingperverse pride i supposemade him try to drink along he did stop spraying spirits down his front in short order though he started spilling them down his front instead i hoped he would change his tunic before we went hunting the next morning any dragonfire within miles would send him up like a torch if he didnt for that matter i was glad he didnt choose to smoke he tried to tell me something he raised his right hand index finger extended as if to make a point but his eyes glazed over and he started to snore i wondered what to do with him he wouldnt be happy if he woke up in the dining room then again after what hed poured down he wouldnt be happy no matter where he woke up while i was still wondering three stalwart shqipetari silently slipped into the room one took each booted foot the third dealt with essad pashas forward end they lugged him away with an ease that bespoke considerable practice maybe he didnt need max for an excuse to drink himself into a stupor one of the shqipetari returned if the noble lords will please come with me he said in oddly accented hassocki i had no trouble getting up and walking id been at least moderately moderate max ambled down the corridor without eight or twelve shqipetari hauling him along too we shared a bedchamber as he was my aidedecamp and presumably bodyguard i wasnt surprised that the servants at the hunting box had arranged things so i was surprised theyd found him a bed without a footboard that saved him the trouble of sleeping curled up or diagonally which he usually has to do well between us weve put essad pasha in his place i remarked as we undressed for the night ah but will he remember in the morning max replied he wont remember anything in the morning i said and what he does remember hell want to forget max scratched his head at that after a moment i scratched my head too not even the still uncrowned king of shqiperi could make meaning appear out of nothingness i could make sleep appear though i lay downand there it was essad pasha poured down cup after cup of thick sweet strong muddy hassockistyle coffee it did wake him up which only made him more poignantly aware of his state of crapulent decrepitude his hand shook he didnt spill coffee on his tunic thoughhe had a napkin draped over it this morning max also seemed somewhat the worse for wear but did manage to eat hisinevitablyfried eggs i enjoyed mine essad pashas sat on his plate staring up at him the whites of his eyes were almost as yellow as their yokes he belched softly sometimes among the hassocki a belch shows youve enjoyed a meal essad pashas showed that his insides were as rebellious as the kingdoms of the nekemte peninsula north and south east and west he began and belched again he shuddered in any direction in every direction i am unwell perhaps the hair of the dog that bit you max said after a moment he added perhaps the hair of the dog that bit me too twas no dog bit metwas a viper essad pasha said but then he brightened all the way up to suicidal perhaps the scale of the snake would serve he shouted to the servant whod brought in breakfast but flinched from the sound of his own voice more quietly he put his request to the man in due course a bottle and three glasses appeared after flicking away the ritual drop essad pasha and max proceeded to have several scales apiece i drank a bit toojust to be sociable you understand and as a digestive aid essad pashas cheeks regained some color up till then hed looked as if hed been staked out for vampires he even toyed with his eggs though he didnt actually eat much he said now when we hunt the dragons i may hope we catch them and not the other way round maybe he really had been suicidal then if a dragon caught him he might not go out in a blaze of glory but he would certainly make an ash of himself after breakfast he showed us our weapons no clockwork mechanism on these crossbowsthey were handcranked the way they all were till fifty years ago with these if we all shot our bolts and missed it would be the dragons turn for quite a while after that on the other hand the quarrels we shot would take the quarrel out of a dragon or anything else if they struck home they were large and stout and heavy rather like shooting essad pasha out of a crossbow as a matter of fact though they werent so blunt he sent me a sidelong glance as i picked up my crossbow and rather dubiously stared along it your highness marksmanship is renowned all through the empire he remarked we shall rely on you today of course we will max said what he didnt say was now look at the mess youve got me intoand yourself by the way his eyebrows and the corners of his mouth were uncommonly eloquent however if you can keep your head while all around you are losing theirs you probably dont understand the situation here i at least thought i did id never shot this particular heavyweight monstrosity but i did know what to do with a standard military crossbowand the hassocki army had taught me my marksmanship might not have been renowned all through the empire but i generally managed to frighten what i aimed at then again aiming at a dragon frightened me essad pasha pointed northward do you see your highness dragons in their courting flight by the way they spun and skipped and tumbled through the air i had taken them for ravens if they were that much bigger then they were that much farther awaywhere that much meant a demon of a lot and they were for i saw one of them swoop behind a mountain peak i could make a pretty fair guess about how far away that peak was that made the dragons even bigger than id thought oh joy as max would say out tottered a whitemustached shqipetari shepherd a man whod seen a better decade or six leading a sheep with very little to look forward to he tied it to an iron stake set securely in the ground gave it a couple of tender pats on the head and then cut its throat somehow that spoke volumes to me about the way shqiperi works the shepherd stumped away the sheep lay there twitching and bleeding i suppose things could have been worse if they hadnt left it out for dragon bait they probably would have fried its wool and served it up to max and me as a delicacy of the countryside another shqipetar came out this one a good deal younger and sprier he bowed to me then to essad pasha and then to max that done he began a chant of a sort id run into before the language was different but the rhythms were the same as the ones i heard whenever i put to sea eliphalet fry me for sheeps wool if he wasnt a weatherworker he knew his trade too he wasnt as good as stagiros but who is he was plenty good enough to send a strong breeze wafting northward why he was wafting a strong breeze northward i couldnt have said essad pasha could and did wed better take cover your highness the dragons will scent blood soon oh i said after a pause that if not pregnant was certainly out long past its bedtime everyone hears stories about how keen dragons noses are in the days when knighthood was in flower knights would have smelled even more like fertilizer than they did anyway if they hadnt bathed before they hunted dragons their ladies no doubt would have appreciated that more if theyd bathed very often themselves but foul hide seldom won fierce dragon as someone probably didnt say stillthose dragons fluttering around that peak had to be miles away could a weatherworker send the scent of one sheeps blood that far now that you mention it yes watching i could tell exactly when thoughts of courtship ended and thoughts of breakfast began it was when the dragons started flying straight toward me i really think we ought to take cover your highness max said in lieu of screaming if we run for our lives now maybe the dragon will eat the sheep instead of us a lot of what gets called courage is fear of looking like a coward in front of other people soldiers mostly dont go forward because theyre wild to slaughter the bastards on the other side they know the bastards on the other side are getting it in the neck from their generals the same as they are themselves but they dont want to let their pals down and they dont want to be seen letting their pals down death before embarrassment may not sound like an earthshaking motto but its won more battles than eliphalet and no quarter i ought to know im no braver than i have to be the proof is i never had the nerve to run away and so instead of doing what any sensible human being would do with several dragons bearing down on himwhich is to say vacating the premises as fast as ever i couldi hunkered down behind some boulders that would have done fine as cover against crossbowmen but were essentially useless against anything that could flame from above they call this sport i have another name for itseveral other names in fact the mild ones are hotter than dragonfire they go up from there you have the privilege of the first shot your highness essad pasha murmured i was proud of myself all i said was thanks one thing did go right in the next few minutes between their mountain and ours the dragons had a disagreement about who would eat the sheep theyd scented being dragons they settled it by fighting people would have formed committees and alliances and taken much longer to come to the same conclusion the largest meanest one got to do what he wanted while the rest flew off dreaming of being the largest meanest one the next time they smelled something good to eat the winner was an impressive beast silvery below and a metallic bluegreen above his wings were the wings a bat might have if a bat were the size of a dragon the size of a big dragon i should saythis fellow was to dragons as max is to ordinary mortals i wished i hadnt thought of it quite that way it made me feel much too ordinarily mortal myself as the dragon drew closer i got a good look at his red glowing eyes what i saw there was a nasty blend of raw hunger and old sin i looked over to my left to make sure essad pasha hadnt suddenly sprouted wings but no there he sprawled beside me what i saw in his eyes was a nasty blend of raw nerves and old sin we could kill the dragon oh yes but the dragon could kill us too and the closer it got the more forcefully it reminded me of that soon your highness essad pasha murmured much too soon i thought but no help for it if i didnt try to shoot the great worm i would be reckoned a coward till i got flamed and eatena brief but unpleasant interval if i shot and missed i would be reckoned a thumbfingered dunderhead till i got flamed and eatena brief interval that also left something to be desired there was one other possibilityif i could bring it off when i popped up from behind the boulders the wind from the dragons wings all but knocked me off my feet he was a weatherworker of sorts himself he was also wise in the ways of men he wouldnt have grown to that size without being hunted before his head swung toward me his great jaws fell open he was going to flame he was going to but i squeezed the trigger first that cursed crossbow came closer to knocking me off my feet than the dragonwind had any crossbow worth the name will kick you dont shoot a bolt without its pushing back at you this miserable weapon shot an extra heavy bolt and shot it especially hard i felt as if a mule or a shqipetar or some other stubborn creature with hard feet had booted me in the shoulder as i staggered back essad pasha and max sprang to their feet they were going to do what they could to keep me breathing so they could call me a thumbfingered dunderhead at their leisure when i didnt hear their crossbows snap i thought we were all doomed then essad pasha cried well shot your highness oh well shot he threw himself into my arms and kissed me on both cheeks i recovered my balance and tried to recover from essad pasha the dragon was thrashing its life away on the mountainside it never even got a taste of the sheep i hadnt seen where my quarrel hit i still couldnt see where it had hit right down the throat max said sounding more than suitably impressed considering what he knew of right down the throat i liked his accolade better than essad pashas kisses in my time i have seen many marvelous things essad pasha said though his eyes denied it he went on i dont believe i have ever seen anything to match a dragon slain so people will talk of this for the next hundred years north and south east and west they will id come to shqiperi to give people things more interesting to talk about than any mere dragon telling essad pasha as much though struck me asinexpedient instead i waved toward the dragon as if id practiced that shot for years and brought it off twice a day in vyzance lets wait till it stops wiggling and then well see what weve got just as you say your highness so shall it be essad pasha was eating out of my hand now a less attractive picture would be hard to imagine i surreptitiously wiped my palm against my trouser leg waiting for a dragon to die takes almost as much patience as waiting for dooger and cark to smile while they pay back wages i wondered whether the other flying worms would pay us a call while this one perished but they kept their distance maybe the scent of its death agonies reached them and persuaded them they might do well to shop at another meat market slowly slowly the fire in the dragons eyes went out i hoped the same held true for the fire in its belly its blood smoked on the ground when at last it lay still i stepped out from behind the sheltering boulders essad pasha and max followed my lead as i walked past one of those smoking patches i stooped and dipped my finger in the dragons blood what are you doing your highness essad pasha asked curiously but respectfully maxs cough was anything but respectful witte is a schlepsigian grand duchy hed grown up on the same legends i had who doesnt remember the story of whatshisname the fellow they made the opera about who tasted dragons blood and could suddenly understand the speech of birds and beasts the dragons blood was burning my finger justwondering i told essad pasha whod grown up on a different set of legends i brushed my finger against my mouth the dragons blood burned my lips and tongue too i didnt hear any squeaky or hissy or chirpy voices ill never go to that opera again a vole or a starling probably hasnt got anything interesting to say anyhow take a trophy your highness essad pasha urged as we walked up to the enormous twisted corpse a trophy i wondered in leon they fight bulls they dont give the bulls swords so the fights arent what youd call even but they do fight them and if the human fighter the killer hes called in leonese an uncommonly honest language does well they award him the bulls ears and its tail those being its most useless parts i dont know what they give a bull that kills its manhis brains probably dragons have no ears this one did have a tail of course but it was about three times as long as max i drew my belt knife and worried off one of the metallic bluegreen upper scales it was not quite the size of the hand essad pasha was eating out of i wished that hadnt occurred to me i held it out to him saying have a mount set in the back of this i will wear it over my heart henceforward in memory of the day insults arent the only place where hassocki overwrite their dialogue he bowed as low as his years and his belly would let him it shall be as you say your highness he told me id heard things like that more often since coming to shqiperi than in my whole life before then i knew exactly what that meant it meant i should have decided to become a king a long time ago instead of feeding the dragon that sheep gave us supper fried mutton again with fried parsnips to go with it they didnt fry the wool i will say that for them they didnt fry the coffee either i wonder why not because they hadnt thought of it i suppose if a copy of my tale ever gets back to shqiperi it may give them ideas just what they need we didnt drink so deep as we had the night before two debauches like that in a row and i think essad pasha could have donated his liver to medical magecraft as things were he kept praising me ive never seen a shot like that he said never not in all my hunts never heard of one like that either north and south east and west i dont think anybodys ever heard of one like that i was modest nothing to it i said he choked on his liquid fire max almost did but not quite but then max has heard me before essad pasha was still getting used to his new sovereign tomorrow he said we go on to peshkepiia for your coronation the harem is arranged then i hoped i didnt sound too eager your highness it is essad pasha assured me and i apologize again for the delay in a way its almost a pity id like to see that shot again so would i i thought one more thing essad pasha didnt need to know i was getting out of my clothes and into my nightshirt when a scrawny cat wandered into the bedroom the shooting box was full of mice several cats ambled through it if they didnt catch mice they didnt eat they were all on the skinny side as if to say id rather be free than work hard cats are cats all over the world this one gave me a greeneyed stare and said call you a king ha not likely i heaved a boot at it even a cat may look at a king but the proverb doesnt say one thing about badmouthing him we rode for peshkepiia all five syllables of it the next morning the horses didnt have a thing to say maybe id imagined the snide crack from the cat the night before maybe i hadexcept i hadnt i could still feel the sting of the dragons blood on my lips and tongue when the fellow in the legends heard animals talk they told him things he needed to hear what did i get some mousebreathed mangy feline with an overblown sense of its own importance is there any other kind of cat give me leave to doubt it just my luck if the horses were quiet essad pasha wasnt he kept going on about what a splendid coronation it would be and how many diplomats would be there from the great powers and the powers that wished they were great listening to that was a lot more pleasant than getting the glove from a creamstealing tabby we rode into a village at midmorning essad pasha shouted to the locals in hassocki do you speak shqipetari i asked him he looked at me as if id asked him if he ate with his fingers nohe looked at me as if id asked him if he picked his nose and then ate with his fingers those barbarous gruntings and mooings and fartings i should hope not he said sounding as insulted as the cat about my becoming king stillif im to rule them i suppose i ought to learn to talk with them in their own language i said suit yourself your highness ive ruled them for years and i never did pride clanged in essad pashas voice i rule they are ruled let them learn my speech these shqipetari at least understood hassocki and spoke it well enough one of them led us to the village square that was a lovely little place shaded by plum and pear trees with a fountain laughing in the middle of it and one of the quadrate gods low modest shrines off to one side men with bushy mustaches and spotless white headscarves sat on backless benches and drank coffee from a shop by the templeyou could smell the roasting beansand passed the amber mouthpieces of water pipes from one to the next unsanitary yes but charming our guide found a bench for us then he shouted in shqipetari a woman fetched us black bread and honey and yogurt with fruit stirred into it a hassocki dish originally now its popular all through the nekemte peninsula and small cups of hassockistyle coffee and even smaller cups of brandy distilled from plums and lightning nothing fried i could hardly believe it the locals already in the square let us eat in peace proving theyd never had anything to do with scribes only after the woman had taken away the tray on which shed brought our lunch did one of them approach us he looked like a bandit whod done well enough at his trade to retire from it at a fairly early age and stood waiting with dignity for me to acknowledge him i nodded i hoped politely you wish i asked you will be king king of all shqiperi by the way he said it all shqiperi might have been a great and grand place not a couple of wrinkles on the nekemte peninsulas hairy backside max coughed i knew what that meant the villager fortunately didnt i nodded again thats so yes he looked me up and down his eyes were as hard and shiny and unwinking as a bird of preys by what right should you be king max coughed again this time in some alarm essad pasha growled like an angry bear i held up a hand and murmured to him he raised an elegantly pruned eyebrow then reached into his belt pouch and handed me the dragon scale i held it up so the shqipetar could see exactly what it was he still didnt blink but those hard dark eyes widened a hairs breadth by this right i told him as i rose from the bench and by this right as well i flipped forward and started walking on my hands he hadnt expected that he said something harsh in his own language then went back to hassocki north and south east and west why do you do such an undignified thing to show you i will turn shqiperi upside down if i have to to make this kingdom go the way it should from my own upsidedown vantage point i saw all the men in the square gawking at me a man who would be king sitting around drinking coffee and brandy was one thing a man who would be king waving his boots in the air was something else entirely i bounced to my feet again this takes a push with the arms and a snap of the legsand a deal of practice as well with luck on a soft mat you will fall the first time you try it and the fifth and probably the tenth too but once you have it down its a striking effect i brushed my dirty palms on my trouser legs you arenot an ordinary prince the shqipetar said indeed not i struck a pose i am an extraordinary prince a much superior type max coughed again but i cant for the life of me fathom why in all the history of the world has there ever been a prince more extraordinary than i if i hadnt convinced the shqipetar id confused him which often serves just as well he bowed and withdrew as one might withdraw from the presence of a large and possibly dangerous animal i smiled after him for some reason that only made him withdraw faster in a low voice essad pasha said i didnt know you could do that your highness i smiled at him too well your excellency now you do i said let him make whatever he pleased of that he didnt make anything of it which pleased me the prosperous ruffian whod come up to take my measure sat down with his cronies and started talking every so often he would look over toward me i always knew when he did and was never looking in his direction then there is a knack to keeping an eye on people without letting them know youre doing it i had the knack he didnt the more he talked the more impressed he seemed i smiled once more this time only to myself after that my party rode on toward peshkepiia the capital from which i would rule shqiperi more than one traveler from peshkepiia to fushekuqe seeing so many armed men riding toward him took us for a bandit troop and fled more than one herdsman in the fields and meadows did the same that made essad pasha smile already fear of your might goes before you your highness he said only evildoers should fear me i said and glared so hard at max that he didnt let out a peep i puzzled essad pasha who said but your highness anyone who opposes you is an evildoer by the very nature of things anyone who opposes you is an evildoernot because i was always right but because i was always king no wonder kings get an exaggerated sense of their own importance anyone who opposes you yes i liked that as much as any other king would have with the sun setting ahead of us essad pasha pointed to the city its golden rays illuminated there is peshkepiia your highness may your rule be long and glorious may it be so i answered at last at last i was coming into my own ix yes i was coming into my own and once i had come into it i found it was my owndump oh the site is pleasant enough peshkepiia sits at the foot of the dajti mountains near the edge of the most fertile plain in shqiperi it sits there yes rather like something your horse might leave behind peshkepiia may boast ten thousand souls then again it may not an inauspicious beginning for a town aspiring to be the capital of the free and independent kingdom to make up for its small size it is very ugly most of the houses are onestory boxes of mud brick the shops are built of mud brick and sticks and stones and whatever else the proprietor found to throw together and hope it would stand the goods they sell are every bit as fine as the shops themselves the main streetshqyri berxholi its calledis cobbled quite badly when i rode into town with max and essad pasha and my retinue we splashed through puddles nearly deep enough to drown our horses a dead cat floated in one of them without a word it said as much to me as that snooty beast back at essad pashas shooting box and what it said was what the demon are you doing here peshkepiia does boast one fourdomed fane to the quadrate god that is said to be rather fine i suppose it is still to anyone used to the skyleaping grandeur of temples dedicated to the two prophets any fane belonging to the quadrate god will seemwell squashed i shouldnt complain about this one though not when i was crowned in it but as the writers of cliffhanger stories are fond of saying i anticipate when i rode in peshkepiia gave me a typical shqipetari greeting it yawned of course what it saw was a troop of hassocki horsemen riding inonly that and nothing more hassocki horsemen peshkepiia was used to a large fort with thick walls of dun mud brick stood across the square from the quadrate gods fane hassocki sentries paced along the top of the wall ive seen sentries pace where pacing is just routine ive been a sentry on that kind of duty you might as well be asleep even though you walk their beat anybody could sneak past you not these fellows they were on their toes they knew that for half a counterfeit copper some shqipetar would knock them over the head and steal everything they owned right down to their bootlaces if essad pasha thought he was going to stow me in that fortress till he plopped a crown on my head he would have to do some fresh thinking id spent more time in hassocki fortresses than i ever wanted to amazing what a hungry man will do to keep eating isnt it but i was spared that quarrel anyhow he took me to the metropolis purportedly a hostel in any town in schlepsig the municipal board of health would close the place at once in thasos or lakedaimon it would be a dreadful dump in peshkepiia its the fanciest place in town for all i know it might be the only place in town you will want to make the acquaintance of the diplomatic community eh your highness essad pasha said i was surprised he thought i would want to do any such thing i was even more surprised to learn there was a diplomatic community in peshkepiia service in shqiperi has to be the diplomatic worlds equivalent of performing in dooger and carks traveling emporium of marvels since id been doing exactly that i decided these socalled diplomats deserved me after i met them i wondered what id done to deserve them but again i anticipate at the time all i said was id be happy to your excellency as happy as a blizzard is blackyou can use that proverb several ways max looked back over his shoulder bythe four directionsa hasty save he must have barely swallowed something like by eliphalets beardweve been followed i looked back over my shoulder too with a certain amount of apprehension there have been times in my life when hearing a sentence like that would send me diving headlong out the nearest window there have been times when hearing a sentence like that did send me diving out a windowand a good thing too i needed a moment to realize nobody in shqiperi knew me well enough to follow me for reasons like that it had to be something much less important it was the pack of scribes from fushekuqe which proved me right bob the albionese called out how does it feel now that the crown of shqiperi is about to descend on your head id never heard anyone this side of max make a coronation sound so much like an execution bob called out the question in albionese forgetting i was pretending not to speak that language fortunately i didnt forget i was pretending what does he say i asked in schlepsigian maybe i will be able to understand him better once he gets his hair on straight the other journalistic jackals smiled some of them snickered a man with an illfitting toupee should not ride hard beneath that disarrayed mop of improbably black hair gleamed a wide expanse of improbably pink scalp bob himself was blissfully unaware hed come undone which only made it sweeter i had the feeling bob was blissfully unaware of quite a few things someone translated his foolish question into schlepsigian which i admitted to speakingi spoke it like a native in fact it didnt sound any less foolish than it had before it feels good i told him i wouldnt have come to shqiperi if i didnt want to go through with this coronation ceremony that should have been obvious but nothing is obvious to scribes if things were obvious to them they would have chosen a different line of work when my reply was rendered into albionese bob asked still in that language what will you do after you are coronated yes he said that in his own allegedly native tongue it was i suppose logical as scribes reckon logic what happens at a coronation ceremony why someone is coronated of course someone is i should say if you dont bother to think before you open your mouth however much i felt like crowning bobalbionese can be a noble tongue when spoken welli couldnt even react till somebody turned his foolishness into schlepsigian the translation actually made sense any time a translation improves things you have a pretty good notion how bad the original is what will i do the best i can i answered i wasnt quite so foolish as bob but i did seem to be making an effort what will your policy be toward vlachia and belagora another scribe asked i looked out at the swarm of them why are you asking me the same questions you asked me in fushekuqe because youre in peshkepiia now they chorused the frightening thing was they meant it well i hope to be in the bathtub soon i said i probably wont change my mind between now and then but i promise youll be the first to know if i do essad pasha smiled he enjoyed irony especially when the sharp iron in it wasnt piercing him max coughed which could have meant anything and the scribes both prophets pray for them wrote it down to the bathtub i told essad pasha if the place has one max said there was a cheery thought well find out i said we found out the metropolis didnt have a bathtub the metropolis for that matter didnt even have a lobby when we walked inside we walked into the dining roomand into what seemed like a street fight waiters were screaming at one another in shqipetari when people start screaming in shqipetari you always have the feeling knives will come out any minute most of the time youre right a fat man with an enormous mustache was screaming at a customer in narbonese the customer was screaming back in schlepsigian that by itself might have been enough to make knives come out narbonensis keeps trying to strangle schlepsigs legitimate political and territorial aspirations any good schlepsigian patriot will tell you the same ignore narbonese fanatics lies a little farther back behind a low counter that could double as a breastwork the cooks were screaming too they already had knives out they also had serving forks big enough to skewer max redhot frying pans full of sizzling oil and if all else failed burning brands from their cookfires i rather hoped they would start throwing those around burning down the metropolis would have been the best thing that could happen to it for some little while everyone was so busy shrieking at everyone else nobody bothered to notice us i began to feel affrontedwhen would we get our fair share of abuse well we didnt have long to wait the fat man must have got tired of screaming in narbonese for he came over to us and started screaming at me in hassocki who art thou who pollutest the peace with thy presence i am thy king thou roasted ox with a pudding in thy belly i roared into his startled face down on thy knees wretch and see if thou hast the strength to rise again thereafter he did go down on his knees and got up brushing at his breeches among the other amenities the metropolis lacked was any flooring fancier than rammed earth when he arose he was a different man one who might possibly know something about keeping a hostel oh yeahheard you were coming he said his voice casual if still much too loud im hoxha i run this joint somebody yelled at his broad back in torinan he answered hotly in the same tongue by all appearances a hosteler in peshkepiia must be able to revile anyone in any language at any time in that respect at least hoxha seemed perfectly suited to his job could i trouble you to take me to my room please and to get me some hot water for washing i asked i didnt bother inquiring if the metropolis boasted running water the smell of sewage in peshkepiia told me the only running water in town lived in the belly of a running man hoxha went right on yelling abuse in torinan i might have disappeared something told me politeness won few friends in shqiperi very well then the direct approach i grabbed him by the shoulder and spun him back toward me thou poxed and scrofulous knave i screamed at him from a distance of perhaps two inches thou unlicked whelp of a rabid jackal bitch a room hot water or thy head answers for it all right already he said as if id asked him the way i had the first time then he yelled enver enver looked like hoxha back in the days when hoxha was half as old and half as wide hoxha crackled out something in shqipetari since i dont speak shqipetari i cant prove it was inflammatory but i wouldnt have wanted anybody saying anything that sounded like that to me enver took it in stride hed surely heard worse you come with me please your highness he said in passable hassocki before i could the schlepsigian gentleman whod been shouting at hoxha came over to me so did another man a dapper cleanshaven fellow with a hairline black mustache surely a narbonese they eyed each other with perfect mutual loathing the narbonese spoke first narbonese in my experience generally speak first in nasally accented hassocki he said your highness i am sousvicomte jeanjacquespierreroland he had more names and titles than ruffles on his shirt which is saying something i have the distinct honor and high privilege to be the kingdom of narbonensis commissioner in shqiperi i look forward with great eagerness to your coronation of course he did there would be a feast afterwards to which he would be invited and he would be able to write a report that said something besides sat here today gathering dust again please let me come home whatever i did i promise not to do it againor if i do i promise not to get caught i gave him my secondbest bow honored to meet you your excellency i extended my hand he took it a corpse has a limper handclasp but not much when jeanjacquespierreroland started to say something more as narbonese will and will and will the schlepsigian whod been waiting there with exemplary patience got leave to speak with an expedient elbow to the pit of the sousvicomtes stomach clicking his heels he said hail victory i am told you speak schlepsigian your highness in his own language which also happened to be mine i nodded i do i said good then we will continue to use it he declared with the decisiveness typical of our countrymen i am untergraf horstgustav of wolfram the mighty king of schlepsigs representative to thisplace i present myself he bowed stiffly from the waist and clicked his heels again honored your excellency i said with schlepsigian exuberance horstgustav tried to crush my hand you will please note your highness that the schlepsigian son of a sow is too ignorant to speak hassocki jeanpierrejacquesroland said you will also notice that the mighty king of schlepsig did not think it worthwhile to send a man here who understood either hassocki or shqipetari to show he spoke the latter he said something to hoxha i wouldnt have wanted anyone saying anything that sounded like that to me by the gesture the gracious hosteler used he didnt want anyone saying it to him either untergraf horstgustavs scarred face reddened as the narbonese and i conversed in a language he couldnt followthe sousvicomte was right about that we must make alliance schlepsig and shqiperi he burst out in schlepsigian each of our kingdoms will gain room to live and will take its natural place in the sun when a schlepsigian says he will take his natural place in the sun he means he will take yours too and then blame you for mislaying it jeanjacquespierreroland wasnt shy about slandering my birthkingdom horstgustav looked more and more worried that all this talk in what he thought was my native tongue would seduce me had it really been my native tongue he might even have been right narbonensis is vlachias patron he burst out the vlachs in vlachia and belagora oppress shqipetari every chance they get you can never trust narbonensisnever jeanjacquespierreroland yawned this man does not speak he merely breaks wind with his mouth the king of schlepsigs representative really didnt know any hassocki or he would have broken the narbonese commissioner in half i should like to rest and to bathe i said matters of state can wait until i wear the crown enver please take me to my room hoxhas probable son seemed not to hear me enver i shrieked and that got his notice another man came into the dining room at the same time as max and i were leaving he had slickedback hair a mustache waxed into spikes and a shirtfront covered with enough medals to make a pretty fair set of scalemail as soon as i saw that blinding refulgence i knew he had to come from the dual monarchy they pin a medal for steadfastness on you if you get out of bed on time three days running a medal for valor on you if you swat a fly and a medal for heroism on you if you cut yourself shaving what with all the brasswork and glass paste and ribbons on the fellows chest i almost didnt notice that he had the coldest gray eyes ive ever seen he looked at me as if hed just found me on the sole of his patent leather boot yes a man of the dual monarchy sure as sure take no notice of count rappaport your highness essad pasha said you may rest assured no one else does but that wasnt quite true when count rappaport shouted at hoxha he like jeanjacquespierreroland shouted at him in shqipetari and the hosteler though he shouted back didnt scream back which i thought betokened a certain unusual respect your room your highness enver said after wed walked down the hall a bit it had a door with enough bars and locks and bolts to keep out a horde of invading kalmuks of course there were no kalmuks for several hundred miles theyve finally been bundled back onto the steppes of tver and a good thing too says i whether the door would keep out your average ordinary everyday burglar was liable to be a different question enver had enough keys on his belt to make a pretty fair pianoforte he used six or eight of them and had another in his hand when the door swung open seemingly of its own accord he sidestepped smartly so it didnt clout him in the head and turned the sidestep into a gesture of invitation enver would go far probably with the gendarmerie in hot pursuit before stepping in i held out my hand he set those six or eight keys in my hand when max coughed and dropped his own large hand to the hilt of his sword enver added the key hed been about to use that struck me as a good idea you never could tell oh yes the room well it had that door a window with stout iron bars across it four walls and a ceiling it also had the same rammedearth floor as the dining room though a profusion of brightly patterned hassocki rugs and cushions covered most of it hoxha no doubt saved on furniture that way since i was playing a hassockistyle prince however i could scarcely object to hassockistyle quarters the only nonhassocki article in plain sight was the homely thundermug in one corner that like most such from caledonia to vyzance and beyond was of albionese manufacture one family has made what must be a sizable fortune from our earthiest needs and tied its name to them forever or havent you used a chambers pot any time lately i hope all is well enver turned to go hot water and towels i said when he took a step away from me without replying i seized an arm to prevent his escape and bellowed in his ear hot water and towels i was learning just as you say your highness he promised and i let him go he took it in good part that is simply how people do business in peshkepiia imagine the most charming characteristics of lokrians and torinans blended together now make everyone carry knivesand swords and crossbowsand revel in using them now multiply by a dozen or two you commence to have the beginning of a start of an inkling of a notion of what shqiperi is like my very own kingdom i shall leave you to your own devices here for the time being your highness essad pasha said towards evening i shall escort you to the fortress for a reception and the coronation ceremony should be tomorrow it had better be tomorrow i thought but the best way to hatch anxiety in others is to show you feel it yourself ask a liontamer if you dont believe me not that youre likely to be able to ask a liontamer who let his beasts know he was nervous i inclined my head to essad pasha regally i hoped until evening then your excellency i said essad bowed and took his leave a moment later two elderly attendants came into the room one carried an enormous cotton hassocki towellarge enough for an ancient aenean to have wrapped himself in it for a mantle the other bore a tiny basin of water ever so slightly warmer than its surroundings more water hotter water i told him in hassocki he looked blank i tried schlepsigian nothing i didnt want to admit to speaking any other tongues and the attendant probably wouldnt either so i turned to max and said captain yildirim by eliphalets holy toenails the sweet wheep of maxs sword leaving its scabbard was a sound i was coming to know and trust a sound that promised all in the world would soon be made right the world is sometimes a peculiar place i grant had max not been the putative aidedecamp to a putative sovereign and crowned head that wheep would have been the sound of a man about to be arrested for assault with intent to maim but things are as they are not as they might be so i smiled when the sword sprang free i felt confident good things were about to happen and they did thou max snarled at the waterbearer thou shalt fetch us more of thy stock in trade and quickly lest we use it to seethe thy worthless bones for stew he rounded on the other graymustached lout the one with the towel thy partner in sloth shall be hostage against thy speedy return twill do you no good for he likes me not the towelbearer said apparently despairing of his life thou speakest our tongue i exclaimed the towelbearer bit his lip in shame and mortification this was something he should never have admitted yet fear of death unmans the best of us i went on put our words into shqipetari then tell thine accomplice and partner in crime what we require of him he spoke in shqipetari the waterbearer replied volubly and with considerable warmth giving a guest in the hostel what he actually wanted and required must have violated some basic shqipetari commandment sometimes though there is no help for a situation with a sigh that spoke volumes about the abomination he was committing the waterbearer withdrew to return only a little more slowly than he should have with only a little less water than we needed water only a little less hot than it might have been having done so he hung about with an expectant look on his face how now i inquired hoping against hope that but no my tip he said in perfectly intelligible hassocki oh of course i told him and turned to max captain yildirim if you would be so kind the waterbearer left in some haste after that so he didnt get the tip of maxs sword after all too bad not even a king i discovered can have everything he wants all the time in the confusion the towelbearer also made good his escape well i said lets wash and we did evening approached someone knocked on the door when i opened it essad pasha stood in the hallway his uniform almost gaudy enough to have come from the dual monarchy your highness he gave me a most proper bow your excellency i returned it not quite so deeply i hear from the good hoxha that you have shown yourself to be every bit as ah masterful here as you ah did in fushekuqe he said the good hoxha i raised an eyebrow the only man by that name i know is the villain who runs this hostel essad pasha wheezed laughter north and south east and west you will find worse he said which was probably true will you accompany me to the reception in your honor i wouldnt miss it i replied the last reception in my honor i remembered was arranged by the father of a nicely curved little blond girl id been seeing that one involved a horsewhip among other tokens of his esteem i hoped this occasion would prove more ah festive when we first left the metropolis i must confess i wondered in peshkepiia evening is the time when the flies go in and the mosquitoes come out now i have met a good many mosquitoes in a good many miserable places shqipetari mosquitoes however are in a class by themselves i think some of their grandmothers must have cavorted with the dragons of the mountain peaks if they didnt breathe fire when they bit it wasnt from lack of effort max must have been thinking the same thing i wasrather an alarming notion most of the timefor he said i wish i had a teenytiny crossbow no sooner were the words out of his mouth than he slapped at the back of his neck i did some slapping of my own then wiped the palm of my hand on my trouser leg it wouldnt help i said mournfully they can bite faster than you can reload the buzzes and whines all around us were nearly as frightening as those from near misses by crossbow bolts essad pasha stolidly stumped along ahead of us the mosquitoes didnt seem to bother him at all at the time i put this down to professional courtesy now i wonder if the odor of camphor that wafted from him might not have had something to do with it most shqipetari were off the streets and out of the square whatever their flaws they had sense enough to stay behind netting after it got dark as for me id set out from the hostel a prince but i wondered if id get to the fortress as anything more than a perambulating lump of raw bloody meat torches blazed by the entrance hassocki sentries came to stiff attention as we approached your excellency they called to essad pasha your highness they called to me they didnt call anything to max but their staring eyes took his measureand quite a lot of it there was to take too as befit a princes aidedecamp he looked through them rather than at them they smelled of camphor too that might explain how they could stand out there without being reduced to boots and uniforms by the time the morning came something had to otherwise essad pasha would have used up an uncommon number of sentries enough for the duty to have become even less popular than it usually is this way your highness essad pasha said pointing toward the only brightly lit building inside the fortress i thinki hopei would have figured out all by myself that that was where the reception would take place but essad pasha counted on no mans intelligence but his own we passed through seven veils on our way into the reception hall some mosquitoes passed through them with us but not too many inside people could mostly talk without leaping into the air with a curse or rubbing their ears as if those had begun to ring mostly i have the high honor and distinct privilege essad pasha said in a booming voice of presenting his highness prince halim eddin of the hassockian empire soon to become his majesty king halim eddin of shqiperi long may he reign i took a bow i dont know how else to describe it everyone applaudedwell almost everyone count rappaport sent me another of his cold gray stares the dual monarchy does like to dress its functionaries in comicopera uniforms they often have comicopera manners too bowing and smirking till youre tempted to think they couldnt possibly conceal a working brain anywhere about their person this is a mistake as the other powers have often found to their sorrow with so many people cheering me though i could afford to ignore the ironfaced countor so i thought anyhow afford it or not ignore him i did and so did essad pasha who waved for the small band in one corner of the room to strike up a sprightly tune over the years ive grown used to hassocki music to those accustomed to the styles of schlepsig and torinoor even to those of narbonensis and albionhassocki music sounds like what happens when you throw two cats a chicken with a head cold and a small yappy dog into a sack tumble the sack down a flight of stairs and then set it on fire as a matter of fact it sounds that way to me too but ive learned to distinguish the notes each tormented animaler musicianmakes if not always to appreciate them this however was hassocki music as played by shqipetarii suppose in honor of my impending coronation far more than count rappaports menacing gaze it made me wonder just how big a mistake id made in coming here i had never heard sounds like that before nor except once when a crowded coach overturned on an icy road have i since one of the song butchers thumped irregularly on a drum one sawed and scraped at a fiddle one plucked away on what might have been a lute if it hadnt had too many strings and too long a neckit looked like a lute the way a camel looks like a horse in other words and if the mustachioed villain cradling it in his lap had been plucking a camel instead more melodious noises might have emerged from it a small chorus accompanied the alleged instrumentalists the mens voices were too high the womens voices on the other hand were too low no two of them seemed to my untrained and startled ear to be perpetrating the same tune at the same time each one was trying to outshout all the others too essad pasha beamed is it not marvelous he said thats one word i more or less agreed i will remember it forever and so i have most often in the small hours of the morning usually though the nightmare doesnt come back when i fall asleep again a man in a wolfskin jacket suddenly appeared beside essad pasha the newcomers face might have been a wolf s too with its hungry mouth sharp muzzle golden eyes and roughtrimmed gray hair beaming no more essad pasha said your highness here is the grand boyar vuk nedic vlachias representative in peshkepiia your excellency i bowed your highness so did he all the while eyeing me as a wolf might eye a juicy joint of beef in a butchers window but it wasnt me he was hungry for it was my kingdom in throatily accented schlepsigian he went on fushekuqe should be vlachian vlachia should havevlachia must havea port on the tiberian sea i bowed i have two things to say to that the first one is the powers have agreed that there is to be a kingdom of shqiperi with fushekuqe as its port and i am going to be king of shqiperi of all of it to be plain vuk nedic had teeth almost as sharp as a wolf s too he bared them now as if to prove it a small strain of lycanthropy not unknown among vlachsno indeed i wondered how charming he would be when the moon came full that agreement was not justis not just he growled no vlach will ever be persuaded that anything giving him less than his wildest desires is just and since vlachs desires are often wild indeedthey are a people whose charm is perhaps best appreciated at some distance i bowed again the second thing i have to say is i suggest you take that up with count rappaport over there vuk nedics eyes blazed so you could have lit a cigar at them one of the reasons the agreement made sure vlachia came away without a seaport was that the dual monarchy insisted on it since the dual monarchy has vlachia on its southern border it doesnt enjoy the luxury of appreciating vlachs at a distance as a matter of fact the dual monarchy doesnt appreciate vlachs at all its mutual it would have made an interesting confrontation the fop in the gaudy uniform and the hemidemisemiwerewolf but vuk nedic was the one who had no stomach for it vlachia could huff and puff till it blew the nekemte peninsula down but it would never be more than a thirdrate kingdom the dual monarchy was a power a power that had seen better centuries true but a power nevertheless if reminded of that forcibly enough it could make vlachia very very unhappy and vuk nedic knew it he stomped away stomping isnt easy on a rammedearth floor but he managed he poured a tumbler full of brandy and knocked it back at a gulp vlachs follow the two prophets even if they are benighted zibeonites so he didnt have to not drink even a single drop nicely handled your highness essad pasha murmured that buggerll scrag you if he gets even half a chance your highness max murmured thank you i murmured to both of them why not as far as i could see they were both right i got some brandy of my own and some fried meat i had just begun to eat and drink when essad pasha introduced me to a certain barisha the royal commissioner from belagora belagora has its own king but its another kingdom full of vlachs barisha fit the part even if his outfit didnt if you can imagine a werewolf in a getup that probably made count rappaport jealous you have him to perfection he was every bit as friendly as vuk nedic too the borderline in the north of shqiperi is mistaken he said without preamble that is really southern belagora i intend to stick to the agreement as it is down on paper i said the agreement may be down on paper he replied but belagoran soldiers are on the ground they will stay there and they will take tremist and the rest of the ground we claim not if i have anything to do with it i told him if you go looking for trouble in the north i promise you will find it barisha said and i promise it will find you i switched from schlepsigian to hassocki thou art as false as water may thy pernicious soul rot half a grain a day he understood me id thought he would nearly everyone in the nekemte peninsula knows enough hassocki to curse with as thine uncle was beaten so shalt thou be thou pusfilled carbuncle on the arse of mankind i bowed please to give my kindest compliments to thy father should thy mother chance to know which of her customers he was after the exchange of compliments we parted company you have shown him you are not to be trifled with essad pasha said he will remember it as i do he sent max a furtive glance my aidedecamp had a different prediction hell give you one in the ballocks the second he figures he can not if i give him one first i replied this sentiment met essad pashas approval i met sir owsley owlswick of albion who couldnt possibly have been as clever as he looked and wasnt baron corvo of torino who couldnt possibly have been as effeminate as he seemed and again wasnt his numerous bastards prove it and count potemkin of vast and frozen tver who couldnt possibly have got that drunk that fast every night but from everything i saw did and i formally met count rappaport his schlepsigian had a whippedcreaminyourcoffee strudelontheside juiciness that went with his uniform but not with his eyes he looked me up and down not once but twice by the prophets he said i dont believe youre halim eddin at all x have you ever stood too close to a lightning strike so that your heart forgets to beat for a moment and every hair on your headand in more intimate places than thatstands out at full length if you have you will know some small part of what i felt just then whatever i felt i showed none of it i was born in a carnival wagon and ive been exhibiting myself to make my living ever since i got big enough not to piddle on the stage if max coughed a couple of times then he coughed that was all count rappaport didnt know what it meant even if i did go tell it to the scribes i told him they always need something new to write about and i dont think any of them has come up with that yet by eliphalets curly whiskers i hoped not scribes are donkeys count rappaport said in three words proving himself a man of uncommon common sense he raked me with those eyes again chill and sharp as the edge of an iceberg what you are on the other hand what you are on the other hand your highness i prompted i do believe rappaports waxed and spiky mustaches gave his sneer a certain superciliosity it wouldnt have had without them be that as it may ive seldom seen one that could approach let alone match it if you were halim eddin he began north and south east and west he is none other essad pasha broke in before the man from the dual monarchy could go furtherand before i had to say a word on this your excellency i will take my oath count rappaports arctic stare swung his way why by his looks first of all i have met his highness before as he doubtless will recall essad pasha raised an eyebrow in my direction i inclined my head as royally as i could he went on further did my memory falter he is the spit and image of the portrait of the veritable halim eddin or will you doubt that too your excellency a tolerable resemblancebut only tolerable in my view rappaport replied and to my ear he speaks schlepsigian like a native and speaks hassocki like a nativeschlepsigian thou art a fool an empty purse i said in my very best and sweetest hassocki not a catapult made could knock out thy brains for thou assuredly hast none the liar paints the honest man with his own brush which is his chiefest shield against the truth the count seemed to dislike speaking to me at all and was plainly glad to turn back to essad pasha you said his looks were your first reason for accepting this man at the value of his face a first reason implies a second which is before answering essad pasha fortified himself with a glass of spirits after disposing of the one drop he was not allowed to drink he gulped the rest it was a goodsized glass he went rednot altogether from drink as it proved in a low furious embarrassed voice he said he mastered me your excellency do you hear do you understand he mastered me he came to me in fushekuqe set his will against mine and prevailed i obey him i can do nothing else sir for he is a veritable hassocki prince and soon to be a king north and south east and west did i reckon him some low schlepsigian mountebank i should have fed him to a dragon instead i watched him slay one with as fine a feat of archery as ever i have been privileged to see max coughed again to tell you the truth i felt like coughing myself i wondered how long i would have lasted inside a dragon not as long as that vampire lasted inside the sea serpent i suspected of course under those circumstances not lasting seemed preferable essad pasha bowed to me here your highness set in silver and on a silver chain is the scale of the great worm you slew i bowed in return and slid it down under my tunic i wear it to this day count rappaport made a noise down deep in his throat a low growl i would have thought to hear from vuk nedic rappaports silly uniform and sugary voice said one thing his eyes and his manner something else again it is often so with officials of the dual monarchy if they were as foolish as they seemed their kingdom empire would have crumbled to dust long long ago i shall have to make out a full report for my government the count said in the tones of a judge passing sentence when you do make sure you write in it that i will be crowned tomorrow i said by all means come to the ceremony your excellency i would not miss it count rappaport bowed stiffly he clicked his heels he did a much smoother job of it than untergraf horstgustav too and then he did the best thing he could have done he went away i am sorry you were subjected to that your highness essad pasha said please accept my apologies your excellency you did nothing wrong i told him as for the narboa word the hassocki will use for anyone who follows the two prophets and believes eliphalet more sacred than zibeon whether actually narbonese or noti will tread the unbolted villain into mortar and daub the wall of a jakes with him may it be so north and south east and west may all his plans stumble and fall essad pashas fuming could hardly have been more visible if hed puffed on a pipe you a schlepsigian the very idea he threw back his head and laughed a ridiculous notion max agreed he wouldnt unbend far enough to seem relieved essad pasha thought so but he did sound less ironic than usual it is indeed most valiant yildirim essad pasha said one might as well suspect you of coming from schlepsig eh me i would sooner cut my throat max drew his sword instead of slicing it across his neck he swallowed a goodly length of the blade essad pashas pouchy eyes bulged all around the chamber talk dried up as people turned to stare max might have created a bigger sensation by dropping his pants on the other hand he might not have with all eyes on him max withdrew the blade conscientiously dried it on a napkin and sheathed it once more then he took a skewer of chunks of fried meat everyone in the large room inhaled at once i was glad to be quick otherwise there might not have been any air left he pulled off the first gobbet with his fingers and popped it into his mouth everyone exhaled a bit regretfully the show was overfor the moment anyhow truly your highness your aidedecamp is a man of parts essad pasha remarked in the much too calm tones a man will use only when trying his best not to show how shaken or impressed he is i would not deny it for a moment your excellency some of those parts however are wont to be more useful than others if the slightest of edges came into my own voice well who could blame me for that max bowed low first to me and then to essad pasha as if wed paid him undoubted compliments i seek to show what any who oppose his highness may expect he said essad pasha bowed almost as low as max had which considering the belly hindering him wasnt easy that is well said he boomed north and south east and west that is very well said he turned to me you are fortunate in your servants yes i know i said blandly max coughed i hadnt expected anything else good thing you didnt do that with the sword in there i murmured not like i havent done it before he answered and i knew that was true i spit red when it happens so i dont spit for a while then thats all such a gentleman i told him his bow was even deeper than the last one count potemkin came shambling up to me then a glass in each hand his eyes glittering his earthapple of a nose as red as if it grew on a tree you gave the lout from the dual monarchy his comeuppance he said in elegant accentless narbonese most tverski nobles are fluent in it which is fortunate for it saves other people the bother of learning their language tverski has more cases than caledonia yard and a battery of choking and gargling noises that make a man speaking it sound as if hes trying to strangle himself i speak good narbonese myself so i understood him halim eddin however was more limited do you speak schlepsigian i asked count potemkin in that language only if i must he answered grumpily in schlepsigian he had a tverski accent and a strong one he translated his comment it sounded much ruder than it had before maybe it lostor gainedsomething in the translation or maybe narbonese puts a veneer of false politeness on almost anything not by accident is it the language of diplomacyfor now as a good schlepsigian patriot i dare hope a change is coming but that is by the way i had to find some diplomatic oh well way to respond i am who i am i said with which not even the bibulous potemkin could disagree i have the duty to defend myself and what is to be my kingdom your kingdom pah count potemkin said some tverskis make a sport of being rude maybe potemkin was one of those or maybe he was drunk then again maybe hed seen more of shqiperi than i thought and was giving his honest opinion you never can tell whatever the answer to that riddle he went on leave vlachia and belagora alone and tver will not trouble you how generous i exclaimed wondering if he could recognize sarcasm at that moment i wasnt altogether convinced he could recognize himself but that sounded like something the poglavnik of tvers representative would say tver thinks of itself as the big brother of the plovdivians the vlachs in both vlachia and belagora and the vlachs close cousins the hrvats they all speak related languages and theyre all zibeonites except the hrvats who have the good sense to accept eliphalets primacy using this big brotherdom as an excuse tver has fought a lot of wars with the hassockian empire and won most of them since tver would have to charge all the way across the nekemte peninsula to get at shqiperi i wasnt too worried about potemkins threat if that was what it was count rappaport probably wouldnt take such a relaxed view of it there is no kingdom of hrvatsk there hasnt been one for centuries ever since the hrvats suffered through their disastrous vowel famine the hrvats live in the dual monarchy so do some vlachs so do some torinans so do the yagmars so do most of the schlepsigians who dont live in schlepsig so do the voslaks and the voslenes who are not the same though only they care so do the prahans who arent quite the same as the voslaks or is it the voslenes either so do some dacians and all the gdanskers who dont live in schlepsig or tver no more kingdom of gdansk either which is what you get for ending up stuck between schlepsig and tver and the dual monarchy so doi could go on its a complicated placeor if youd rather just a bloody mess so when tver appoints itself the hrvats big brother the kingemperor of the dual monarchy is just as not amused as the late queen of albion i dont mean she was not amused at the hrvats id bet money she never once heard of them but i suppose she had other things not to amuse her potemkin was thinking it took a while you could watch the wheels turn like the ones on a milk wagon pulled by a lazy horse in due course he said you trouble our friends we trouble you i put my hand on the blue velvet sleeve of his jacket i wouldnt dream of it my dear fellow i said i might do it but i had better things to dream about dont touch the coat he shook me off you listen and you listen good or you be sorry yes he was what tver calls a diplomat im all ears i assured him north and south east and west i am nothing but ears even my eyes are ears even my toenails are ears those wheels inside count potemkins head slowly started turning once more this time i watched them stop potemkin gave up thinking as a bad job you listen he said again maybe you lucky coming out here to middle of nowhere when tver takes vyzance no room for hassocki princes there no more he could have said it better in narbonese im sure bad grammar aside what he meant was plain enough tver has always lusted after the capital of the hassockian empire the way a callow boy lusts after a stage actress she might be a clappedout old whoreeliphalet will testify vyzance isbut he doesnt know that or care all he knows is he wants her i yawned in count potemkins face the tverski who will lay hold of vyzance has not been born nor has his grandfathers grandfather switching to hassocki i went on so take thyself off thou infinite and endless liar thou hourly promisebreaker thou owner of no one good quality whoreson mandrake thy pisspot kingdom is the canker of a calm world and a long peace and thou provest thyself fit to rule it he retorted in the same language and lumbered away you just cant tell with some people thats all taken as a whole i suppose the evening at the fortress was a success nobody challenged anyone else to a duel and no one except barisha and the delightful potemkin threatened to go to war as if anyone who didnt have the influence to escape being consigned to peshkepiia would have the influence to send his kingdom to war even more to the point as far as i was concerned no one except count rappaport doubted i was who i said i was and no one seemed to take him seriously when i went to the metropolis dining room for breakfast a pack of ministers semiplenipotentiary and another pack of scribes set upon me i wished they would have found satisfaction in one another jeanjacquespierreroland for instance talked enough to keep any four men or eight scribes happy but no i was the man of the hour and they all were either mad to talk to me or to hear me talk just what you always wanted our highness max said with a sour smirk in his voice that would have stung had it held less truth being the man of the hour was what id always wanted be careful what you want thenyou may get it you may also eventually get breakfast none of hoxhas cooks challenged any of the others to a duel either though they constantly seemed on the edge of it coffee fried fowl fried eggs fried bread which surprised me by proving tasty fried sausage which surprised me by proving even nastier than i expected and i thought i was braced for the wurst everyone kept on telling me things or shouting questions at me while i ate i wasnt king yet so i couldnt even order people beheaded for that matter i didnt know where i would be crowned or even coronatedyes bob was there i didnt know where my palace was either peshkepiia didnt seem the sort of place that had palaces hidden away up back alleys i headed for the fortress to find essad pasha and i did he was heading for the hostel to find me your highness he said bowing low your excellency i bowed back essad pashas bodyguards and max bowed to one another it was all very polite when men carrying a variety of lethal hardware meet on the street politeness is to be admired and desired i went on i was coming to ask you about the coronation ceremony well good because i was coming to tell you about it essad pasha looked as affable as a senior officer in the army of the hassockian empire was likely to look unless he was plotting something really nefarious what would you like to know where will it be to begin with i said and where will i dwell once i wear the crown and will his majestys harem dwell there as well max added he is too much a gentleman to speak of such things on his own but naturally it is a matter rousing some curiosity on his part rousing indeed if it didnt rouse some curiosity on maxs part and if i didnt know which part of max was roused i would have been very surprised none of which meant my swordswallowing aidedecamp was mistaken those questions did rouse my curiosity among other things and essad pasha seemed to find all the questions reasonable enough you will be crowned naturally in the quadrate gods fane he replied that way your mystical affinity with the land you are to rule will spread north and south east and west over the entire kingdom so may it be so may it be i echoed after two terms in the hassockian army i thought i knew enough about the quadrate gods rituals so i wouldnt give myself away as for your residence essad pasha went on if you would be so kind as to come with me off we went into the back alleys of peshkepiia we strode through a market square that had some of the sorriest meat and vegetables and leather goods and well everything else too that id ever seen it also had the largest assortment of coins passing current that id ever seenprobably that anyone has ever seen most likely because shqiperi doesnt coin for itself everyones money is good here you see everything from hassocki piasters to albionese shillings and even shekels from vespucciland across the sea if someone came out of the mountains after digging up a hoard of aenean silver that wouldnt have fazed the merchants they all had scalesand no doubt all had their thumbs on them whenever they thought they could get away with it peshkepiias sewage system is largely a matter of rumor i was repeatedly glad hassockian army uniform includes kneehigh boots we did considerable squelching some of the things we walked throughwell i didnt get a good look at them and i cant say im sorry i didnt essad pasha paused behold your highnessyour majesty very soon to beyour palace i hope it pleases you may eliphalets curse smite me with boils if it didnt there it was a real palacea little one but without a doubt a palaceright where id never dreamt there could be any such thing it was charming even elegant in the sinuous hassocki style and if there was a wigmakers shop across the muddy street and a horseleechs establishment next doorsomehow that added to the charm instead of taking away from it how did it get here i asked i probably would have asked the same question the same way if id seen a daffodil sprouting from a cow flop given peshkepiias general atmosphere that was more likely than this i believe a governor built it some years ago for his lady love essad pasha answered so i was told when i came to shqiperi anyhow why were you living in the fortress and not here your excellency max asked a much more bluntly sensible query than the one id come up with max is a useful fellow you never need to think the worst of anyone while hes around since hell do it for you essad pasha coughed once or twice himselfhe doesnt do it as well as maxand sent me what might have been a look of appeal i pretended either not to notice it or to misunderstand it yes why were you i asked as if that were simply the most interesting question id ever heard in my life he thought about telling some spunsugar fairy tale then of themselves his eyes went to maxs sword maxs hand wasnt on the hilt but it wasnt far away conscience doth make cowards of us all as an albionese poet once said conscience being the still small voice that tells us someone may call us a damned liar that last definition comes from a schlepsigian actor acrobat showman soldier of fortune andbrieflyking instead of spinning the fairy tale essad pasha said i judged the fortress more secure but with a proper guard contingent and with popular goodwill your highnessyour majesty soon as i sayshould be more than safe enough here more than safe enough for whom i wondered the only thing essad pasha knew about popular goodwill was that hed never had any the harem is already installed here i asked him he brightened oh yes your highness the quarters are admirable for the purpose that governor may have built this palace for one favorite but he entertained the possibility of entertaining more here he sent me a manly smirk i also pretended not to notice that for once i found a relevant question ahead of max the royal treasury is already installed here essad pasha looked as if my intrepid aidedecamp had just sliced off the first two inches of his manhood and was poised to take more assuming he had more again he seemed poised to lie again he decided lying wasnt a good idea i would have no trouble checking ah not yet he said in slightly strangled tones you will attend to that at once your excellency wont you i bore down on the last two words i didnt say what would happen if essad pasha failed to attend to it at once sometimes its better to let a man use his imagination even someone like essad pasha seemingly born without any such thing can when pressed form the most remarkable pictures in his mind yes your highness he sounded resigned if not transported with delight good i said for if i am to be king here i shall be king here north and south east and west this land and all in it are mine and it will have a proper coinage i scratched at my mustaches i rather fancied my face on silver and gold i did instead of saying so i went on a proper shqipetari coinage would go a long way towards insuring popular goodwill eh and towards insuring a proper guard contingent here i shouldnt wonder erso it may now essad pasha sounded distinctly less than overjoyed he must have got used to the idea that shqiperis treasury was his treasury to have a stranger announce that the kingdom was going to use itand that the stranger wanted to get his own hands on itcouldnt have sat well i pondered if i said he could keep some he would hold on to more than i said he could he would also think me weak for yielding to him in any way that was dangerous if i tried to cut him off without a piaster i ran the risk of a knife in the kidneys or ground glass in the breading of whatever the shqipetari cooks fried next that was also dangerous more dangerous less how could i judge audacity audacity again always audacity some narbonese politician said that if memory serves he got his head bitten off a couple of years later but if youre going to fret about every little thing besides he was just a fool of a narbonese but i repeat myself if i hadnt had more audacity than i knew what to do with i wouldnt have been moments away from becoming one of the crowned heads of the world and soon with it besides i had a really demonic thought i will tell the scribes youre making the transfer i said im sure theyll be interested in watching it and writing about it arent you theyll probably want to peek into the chests to see all the gold and silver you should let them to make sure nobody has any doubts about anything i waited the longer i waited the less patient my face got the longer the silence stretched the closer maxs hand drew to the hilt of his swordin a polite sort of way of course why certainly essad pasha looked at me he took another long look at maxs right hand and then he surprised me he threw back his head and laughed like a loon or perhaps like a scribe your highnessyour majestyi think serving under you will be a real privilege and i would like to see the face of the first fellow fool enough to try to cross you north and south east and west there will be no escaping your wrath he laughed again even more raucously and that whoreson malthorse drudge who styles himself a count of the dual monarchy that poor inch of nature proves himself of no account whenever he opens his mouth to speak fond witling to imagine you some sort of mad narbo no infidel schlepsigian dog would have the wit to stymie memeat every turn see i speak frankly and openly i own myself stymied max coughed i smiled doing my best to make my teeth seem sharper than they were audacity audacity again always audacity any man who admits to being stymiedwho brags of being stymiedsurely has some scheme to stymie the stymier when i come back to the palace after my coronation the first thing i aim to do is examine the treasury if anything seems wrong in even the slightest way essad pasha north and south east and west there will be no escaping my wrath is that plain enough or shall i speak more clearly that is very plain essad pasha answered and i have no such scheme of that you may rest assured may my head answer if i lie hed just put his scheme back on the shelf of that i might rest assured if he came up with another one he thought he could get away with he would use it of that i might rest assured too shall we go back down to the hostel and the fane i said it should be about time for the ceremony to begin and i do need a moment to tell those scribes about the transfer of the treasury watching all the sparkly things move is bound to fascinate them no doubt it will as with any jackdaws essad pasha said with a martyred sigh well your highnessyour majestyyou are right it is time to return to the hostel and the holy fane and of course you may tell the scribes whatever brings your heart delight he sighed again after all if i tried to stop you you would anyhow i did tell the pack about the treasury that yielded even more chaos and commotion and entertainment than i hoped it would all the scribes tried to figure out how to be two places at once since even demons have trouble with this to say nothing of the greatest sorcerers of our age and every other it handily defeated the gaggle of second and thirdrate scribes whod come to this fourthrate town hoping for a firstrate story my story some of them rushed off to the consolidated crystal office yes even a fourthrate town like peshkepiia has onecc is everywhere to file both stories before either one of them happened this would have been a miracle if not necessarily one of rare device other scribes proved perfectly suited for the nekemte peninsula where perhaps the commonest sound in the land is that of one handwashing another they formed quick impromptu teams one man would keep an eye on the treasury transfer while the other kept an eye on me each would write a story both would file both stories not quite a miracle but something that would look like one for the home crowd very often thats more than good enough and then there was poor bob none of his countrymen wanted to team with him no doubt theyd seen him in actionor inactionbefore he couldnt team with anyone from a different kingdom because he spoke only albionese by the way he spoke he didnt have much command of his allegedly native tongue either what would you do in my fix your highness he asked lugubriously run away change my name and try to pretend the whole thing never happened i thought or maybe id just slit my wrists but since halim eddin didnt speak albionese i didnt have to understand him north and south east and west thy fame hath gone before thee i told him in hassocki he followed not a word of it but essad pasha laughed and max very nearly smiled i had no royal robes to don with the hassockian empire at war with so many of its neighbors no one thought my colonels uniform out of place considering what the members of the diplomatic corps were wearing i was among the most modestly attired men going into the quadrate gods fane id thought the diplomats were gaudy the night beforeand id been right too they were even gaudier now jeanjacquespierreroland wore black jacket black cravat black trousers and white shirt but the shirt as was usual for a narbonese was a sea of ruffles he had a scarlet sash draped from his right shoulder to his left hipbone a glowing turquoise sash draped from his left shoulder to his right hipbone and an iridescent green sash doing duty for a cummerbund vuk nedic of vlachia wore wolfskin dyed purplespectacular but not a success barisha of belagora had on a uniform of golden watered silk that should have made a lovely evening gown for a lovely lady inside the fancy clothes he himself remained a vlachian semisavage and count rappaport still found a way to upstage him the noble from the dual monarchy looked as if hed killed and skinned a candy cane or possibly like a barber pole with legs and enameled decorations however ludicrous the getup his eyes still saw everything and believed nothing after i saw him i stopped paying attention to the other diplomats i assumed no one could outdo that uniform if something so obviously one of a kind could be dignified by the name and i wasalmost right id reckoned without the quadrate gods votary he wore cloth of gold heavily encrusted with pearls and precious stones his robes must have weighed more than a good suit of chainmail i marveled that he could walk at all his curly gray beard which tumbled down as far as the bottom of his chest hid some of the mystic symbols on the front of the robe his long flowing locks tumbling down under a miter as massive as a battle helm and far shinier covered up whatever ornamented his shoulders and upper back he smelled strongly of himself votaries of the quadrate god bathe once a year whether they need to or not and id say his time was just about up and just as strongly of sandalwood the latter scent warred with but failed to defeat the former behind him less gorgeously robed acolytes swung thuribles north and south east and west their scented smoke was spicy with the exotic odors of frankincense and myrrh but what came from their censers failed to censor what came from the votary and the acolytes hides hadnt met soap and water any time lately either if they put a perfumery next to a place where they pour fertilizer into sacks max whispered thats holiness you smell i said well they ought to keep it on ice in the summertime max said its gone off a horrible noise burst from a set of risers to our left no they werent throwing cats into bubbling oil there even if it sounded like that it was a chorus of shqipetari boys singing my praises so they told me afterwards anyhow i hate to think what they would have sounded like if theyd disapproved of me one boy wore a red robe the next a black and so on the boy on the next step up wore a robe of the color opposite the one just below him if you can imagine a singing checkerboardwell if you can imagine a singing checkerboard im sorry for you but we had one there they also told me red and black were the colors of the kingdom of shqiperi since there wouldnt be any kingdom of shqiperi till that odorous priest plopped a crown on my head i wondered how they knew but i didnt ask them the song of praise ended on a truly alarming high note i later found out one of the boys chose that moment to goose another one he didnt like at the time i assumed it was part of the song the silence that fell afterwards seemed slightly stunned but any silence was welcome then it didnt last how many welcome things do the votary began to pray first in hassocki and then in geez the ancient holy language worshipers of the quadrate god use they seem to think him too ignorant to understand any more recent tongue to me this is not flattering to a putatively allpowerful deity but the quadrate gods followers have never sought my opinion on the subject every so often the votary would pause and look my way i would throw in a so may it be or a he is wise and he is just or a north and south east and west i spoke hassocki which was all right not being a votary or acolyte i didnt have to know any geez and as i say id been to enough of these services to have a pretty good idea what to drop in when i didnt make any mistakes bad enough for the votary to start screaming this is a filthy narbo masquerading as a hassocki prince boil him in tartar sauce when the prayers finally finished he looked at me again this time he looked into me it was an alarming sensation he knew if you travel with a circus even a rundown outfit like dooger and carks you get to recognize that look it does people who know less good than youd think so what if you know the answer when you cant find the right questions to ask if knowing mattered those wizards and fortunetellers would be rich and comfortable and maybe even happy not stuck performing for wages a bricklayer would scorn this holy man didnt find the right question either when he looked inside me he didnt try to see anything like why is this filthy narbo masquerading as a hassocki prince or even why is he thinking in schlepsigian and not hassocki he must not have noticed that though i think i would have but what he wanted to find out was what kind of king of shqiperi will he make by the way his eyes widened even that seemed lively enough five he spluttered and then repeated itfivein even more astonished tones and then his eyes didnt just widen they rolled up in his head and he fell over in a faint someone splashed him with water possibly holy possibly not someone else more practical put a flask to his lips he slurped noisily i hope he left one drop in there keeping with the letter of his faith if not the spirits but he was so thorough sucking up those spirits that i couldnt be sure are you better your reverence one of the acolytes asked what did you see he will be a strong king the votary declared he was pretty strong himself but you didnt hear people telling him about it out of the corner of my eye i saw essad pasha nodding i really had convinced him i was what i said i was of course as long as he believed that he didnt have to believe hed let a schlepsigian mountebank play him for a jackass believing me the genuine article made him feel better about himself since it also went a long way toward keeping my head on my shoulders i didnt mind a bit essad pasha gestured at a wedding in a country where the bride and groom follow the two prophets a ringbearer brings up the ring on a velvet cushion here a crownbearer did the same duty he was a pretty little boy except that his eyebrows grew together above the bridge of his nose in shqiperi though this is accounted a mark of beauty among men and women alike the votary lifted up the crown he set it on my head it was heavier than id expectedgold has a way of doing that it is accomplished the votary cried behold the king of shqiperi he meant me people cheered they meant me too acting on the stage forget it i acted before the worldand the world applauded xi what is your first command for your subjects your majesty essad pasha asked i paused a moment to strike a pose the scribes poised pens and pencils above notepads a sketch artist recorded my likeness in a few quick strokes before long the laws of similarity and contagion would send my image all over the civilized world i wondered how many weeks or months it would take to reach the outlying districts of shqiperi hear me my subjects i boomed fanes to the quadrate god dont have the acoustics of temples to the two prophets but a performer learns how to make his voice fill up the space he plays in hear me i order you to live joyfully all the rest of your days any who fail to obey will be severely punished a brief silence followed some were working that out others were translating it for those who had no hassocki only after a few heartbeats did people laugh and clap the way i hoped they would essad pasha bowed indeed a command worthy of a king north and south east and west may it be so i said grandly bob the albionese scribe was frowning but if he punishes them how can they live joyfully he asked whoever was sitting beside him he spoke much too loudly a common failing of albionese and he wasnt bright enough to get the joke a common failing of scribes i fear untergraf horstgustav also looked puzzled brighter schlepsigians have no doubt been born not even my kingdom would waste a capable man on shqiperi when he could be doing something useful somewhere else count rappaport got it his only problem was he didnt think it was funny he seemed too competent to belong in a backwater like this but then it would be just like the dual monarchy to send skilled diplomats to pestholes like peshkepiia and giggling nincompoops to posts that really matter for my second command i waited essad pasha suddenly stopped breathing if i wanted to get rid of him if i wanted to blame him for everything that was wrong with shqiperi i could i could likely get away with it too although i knew much more was wrong with shqiperi than even essad pasha was to blame for i could buy myself popularity by nailing his head over the gate to my palace for my second commandi declare this the day of my accession a holiday with special rejoicing throughout the land and i order it to be celebrated each year from now on more applause the most enthusiastic from essad pasha maybe the old villain thought i couldnt do without him maybe he was even right we never quite got to find out essad pasha is dead himself these days and ii am the victim of an unfortunate usurpation a king without a kingdom life can be very sad sometimes im getting ahead of myself again you dear reader dont know how and id better not tell you just yet either what i had better tell you is that i left the fane to the acclamations of the assembled dignitaries except for count rappaport and a couple of other spoilsports and to the absolute indifference of the people of peshkepiia sooner or later i thought i would have to learn more about these turbulent people i now ruled and they would have to learn more about me too once they did how could they help but love me guards stood outside the palacethe royal palace now people stood in the street staring at the palace this i took for a good sign no one had paid any attention to it before only one reason for the change sprang to mind the treasury is here i asked essad pasha but of course your highness he answered max coughed significantly essad pasha thought it was significant anyhow and thought he knew the significance but of course your majesty he amended one of the basic rules in performing is that anyone of your own sex who calls you darling hates you anyone of any sex who says but of course is likely to be lying through hisor even herteeth somehow i didnt think statecraft was all that different by maxs eyebrow semaphore neither did he lets see it i said i waited to see what happened next if essad pasha had being difficult in mind he would tell the guards something interestingsomething like kill them for instance in which case i would not only be the first king of shqiperi but also very possibly the last and certainly the one with the shortest reign not a set of records i really wanted to hold i told myself that in the event of my sudden untimely demise essad pashas departure from this life would be every bit as abrupt i hoped max was telling himself the same thing you never know with max till something happensif it happens was essad pasha making the same calculations from the other side as it were if he was he made them in a hurry yes your majesty he said and nodded to the guards waiting inside waswell if it were a squad of crossbowmen i wouldnt be writing this reminiscence for the puncture is mightier than the sword and max and i had only blades but the shqipetari butler or majordomo or whatever he wasflunky i suppose will do well enoughbowed low and cried your majesty in accented hassocki the palacemy palacewas as perfect inside as out soft carpets lay on the floors some of the walls were plaster painted with scenes of the forest and the hunt some were tiled in floral patterns climbing gracefully to the ceiling the beams up there were cedar they would last forever barring fire the governor whod built this place had simple tastes nothing but the best here is the strongroom your majesty essad pasha said it looked strong to me it had more bars than a harbor district more bolts than a linen mill and more locks than all the salmon smokeries in schlepsig essad pasha produced a key ring and handed it to me the first opens the topmost lock one after another i undid them one after another max opened the bolts and took down the bars i pulled on the knob the door silently swung open the hinges gleamed with grease inside stood four stout chests they were festooned with chains and more locks without even looking at essad pasha i held out my hand clank he handed me another key ring this one with even more angled and twisted brass on it than the other he pointed to the chests to show in which order the keys opened the locks i wasted no time testing them they passed the test my heart pounding i opened the first chest it hadnt moved when i shoved against it i liked that silver is nice and heavy gold even heavier up came the lid you see your majesty essad pasha sounded smug i saw all right piasters leptas thalers in silver and gold the dual monarchy hasnt minted gold thalers for a hundred years but you find them everywhere in the nekemte peninsula krams dinars livres also in silver and gold shillings and florins a fat silver shekel with in the prophets we trust under the eagle precious stonesi wanted to chortle like a miser over his fortune i wanted to run my hands through the money for that sweet clinkingclanking sound i wanted to jump in the chest and swim around otto of schlepsig would have too by eliphalets strong right arm prince halim eddin thoughking halim eddin i should say nowwould have seen treasures of his own in vyzance since i was supposed to be halim eddin i couldnt cackle like a laying hen no matter how much i wanted to i gave essad pasha what i hoped was a calm serious nod i see your excellency i saidcalmly seriously examine the other chests by all means essad pasha said you will see i have not cheated north and south east and west treasure from the whole kingdom is here any time someone goes out of his way to tell you how honest he is watch your wallet i opened the other chests one by one max stirred a couple of them to make sure the money and jewels werent hiding rocks or lumps of lead they werent id never seen so muchmuchin one place before i glanced towards essad pasha he was just a little tighter and tenser than he might have been this is very good your excellency i said he relaxed ever so slightly if he hadnt i would have decided i was imagining things but since he did i casually asked and when do you plan to bring over the rest of it he jerked i might have stuck him in the rear with a pin how did you know he said hoarsely you showed me you were formidable but how did you know he wouldnt have understood if i told him he reminded me of dooger and cark or if he did that would have been worse dooger and cark got as much pleasure from cheating a poor performer in their troupe as if there were any other kind out of half a days pay as essad pasha did from hiding who could guess how much treasure essad pasha got more money though have i not lived in vyzance i said trying to sound indulgent and amused have i not seen ministers north and south east and west will ministers not try to line their own pockets when they can then i wasnt so amused any more this is all very well as long as they realize the game has an end we have come to the end essad pasha bring the rest of the treasury here within the hour if you hold out on me this time your story will not have a happy ending there was i judged at least an evenmoney and money was indeed at the root of it chance he could still order me killed and get away with it instead he went to his knees and then to his belly knocking his forehead on one of those elegant rugs id intimidated him all right mercy your majesty he wailed with that wild tremolo only hassocki can achieve mercy i meant no harm certainly not to yourself i thought the sand flows through the glass your excellency i said i suggest you make haste yes your majesty of course your majesty essad pasha was all but babbling i discovered i liked yes your majesty even better than yes your highness captain yildirim i said yes your majesty max said oh i did like that please accompany his excellency to the fortress and make sure everything goes smoothly when my soldiers bring the rest of the treasury back here i said they were in fact essad pashas soldiers but as long as i gave him no chance to remember that and do something about it i was fine and if the first king of shqiperi came down with an acute case of loss of life not for being proved an impostor but for acting every inch a king essad pasha would have a demon of a time finding anybody else to play the part so i told myself anyhow max saluted a hassocki drill sergeant would have screamed at him like any other critics drill sergeants scream whether the performance rates screaming or not essad pasha noticed nothing amiss and he was the only audience that mattered yes your majesty there max said it again off they went i turned to the shqipetari flunky whats your name i asked him i am skander your majesty he replied well skander lets get these chests locked up i handed him some of the keys as i continued well leave the strongroom open till captain yildirim comes back with the rest of the treasure once its closed up again i would like to meet the women of the harem again i didnt want to sound as if i were drooling on the carpet back in vyzance prince halim eddin would have had plenty of women with whom to amuse himself back in vyzance prince halim eddin no doubt still did here in peshkepiia so did i skander bowed hearkening and obedience your majesty there was even a step up from yes your majesty who would have imagined such a wonderful thing skander went on the chief eunuch says your ladies are also eager to meet you naturally i have not presumed to enter the womens quarters myself naturally i agreed in what were probably abstracted tones halim eddin would be used to eunuchs his household doubtless had several he wouldnt have the urge to clutch at himself at the mere thought of the most unkindest cut of all and because i was he i wouldnt either or if i did i wouldnt show it we waited after a bit skander called to a lesser servant and spoke to him in shqipetari the underling nodded and hurried off he came back with a tray with a large goblet and a small one skander took the small one leaving the larger one for me fruit juice your majesty he said improved fruit juice did i need a food taster in vyzance halim eddin probably did as the hassockian atabegs nephew he was lucky to have lived long enough to grow up here i didnt think i did murder in shqiperi looked to be very straightforward the sword the knife the crossbow quarrelthose were worries poison no skander politely waited for me to drink first i raised the goblet your good fortune and shqiperis i said and sipped i had all i could do not to cough theyd ah improved that fruit juice with strong spirits till it had hair on its chest i flicked out a drop with my little finger your majesty is pious skander imitated my gesture he didnt bat an eye when he drank have we got a court wizard i asked how could we your majesty he said up till a few days ago we didnt have a court well have to do something about that i said how many wizards are there in peshkepiia always plenty of hedgewizards skander said that was true it was true everywhere it was also useless what one hedgewizard could make another could unmake he went on wizards of a quality to serve your majesty perhaps four perhaps half a dozen that was perhaps two perhaps four more than id expected skander probably had lower standards than i did were his standards lower than halim eddins there i wasnt so sure in the past hundred years wizards from schlepsig and albion from narbonensis and torino and from vespucciland across the sea have turned the world upside down and inside out its not the same when were old as it was when we were young take consolidated crystal in a lifetime its spread everywhere now anyone can talk to anyone else whether hell have anything interesting to say is a different question worse luck bring one of these wizards before me in the next few days i said if he suits me ill use him if not well try another skander bowed of course your majesty in about an hour max returned with sweating soldiers with three more treasure chests and with the keys to open them when i did i saw they really were full of money with the odd bit of jewelry in there for varietys sake i could live with variety like that is this the lot of it i asked its everything essad pasha coughed up max answered his eyebrows said he thought the local governor had more squirreled away somewhere mine said i thought essad pasha did too but what could i do about it short of turning him on a spit over a slow fire and rendering him down for lardwhich might get me talked about even if he did yield several gallonsnot much i decided that could wait maybe i didnt have all the treasure in shqiperi i had plenty for a thousand ordinary men plenty even for a king which meantthe harem i said the harem skander agreed people whove never lived in kingdoms where they follow the quadrate god have funny notions about harems paintersmostly narboneseuse them as an excuse to paint pretty naked women far be it from me to deny that any excuse is a good one but harem girls dont lounge around naked all the time for one thing it gets cold for another the master of the harem mostly isnt in do they show off for each other then in the hassockian atabegs harem maybe they do he has more women than he knows what to do with well nohe knows what to do with them but with most of them he doesnt do it very often he has his favorites the rest make do with one another or with the eunuchs some eunuchs can keep a woman happy with what they have left and she never needs to worry about having a baby the ones who cant do that have other ways but in most harems the women work when theyre not summoned to ah entertain they spin they sew they weave they raise childrenand the only people who say that isnt work are the ones whove never done it the door to the harem was barred from the outside the kings chosen women werent about to go off on their own after i took down the bar and leaned it against the wall i discovered the door was barred from the inside too nobody was going to sneak in there and fool around either well i didnt need to sneak i knocked on the door a loud authoritative knock max coughed he does that every so often whether he needs to or not sometimes it doesnt mean anything sometimes it does you have to know which is which and how to translate i had no trouble this time if you think youre going to be the only one in there having a good time youre out of your treethat was what he was telling me i was tempted to think too bad for you pal something told me that wasnt a good idea most plots against kings start with their nearest and allegedly dearest i couldnt promise max his share in hassocki skander would have been scandalized i couldnt do it in schlepsigian either skander would have wondered why i switched languages and i didnt know he didnt know mine so i tipped max a wink that did the job the door opened a eunuch bowed to me a lot of eunuchs are fat some are immense this fellow was skinny enough to make up for three of them he looked meanand who could blame him he bowed your majesty he said his voice somewhere in that nameless range between tenor and contralto i am rexhep your majesty pleased to make your acquaintance my good rexhep i said my good rexheps eyes black as the inside of a bear said he wasnt one bit pleased to make my acquaintance i have come to meet the women of my household of course your majesty rexhep said while those glowing black eyes said something else altogether i got the feeling rexhep couldnt do a woman any good with whatever equipment he had left was that why he looked mean lots of people are curious about such things me some details id rather not know i walked through the door the eunuch closed it after me he barred it from his side and i heard skander bar it from the other i knew that was the custom but it made the hair stand up on the back of my neck anyhow was i king of shqiperi or a prisoner as long as i acted like a king i was one if id learned anything coming from dooger and carks traveling emporium of marvels in thasos to the royal harem in peshkepiia that was it when people think you believe it theyll believe it too if you want to tell me im wrong think about essad pasha hed fought vlachia and belagora to a standstill to say nothing of running a province full of shqipetari for years but he knocked his head on the ground to a downattheheels schlepsigian acrobatbecause he thought i was a king then there was count rappaport the less said about him the better so i wont inside the harem the air smelled of sandalwood and cinnamon and rosewater and spikenard and musk just breathing was enough to make your heart race poor rexhep even if his heart did race much good it did him we turned a corner there on couches set in a grassy courtyard waited the women essad pasha and his underlings had chosen for their king before i set eyes on them i thought they might be beauties who would dazzle me with their exotic loveliness then again they were shqipetari the old joke goes first prize is a week in shqiperi second prize is two weeks in shqiperi maybe they wouldnt be worth seeing at all truth dwelt in the middle truth usually does one end or the other those are the places where madness lies think of the fools who conjured up a bolt of lightning to murder the last poglavnik of tver but one they thought that would somehow set the peasants free or think of some of count rappaports colleagues who figured the best way to keep the dual monarchy safe was by slaughtering all the vlachs from the vlachs ive known the sentiment has its points but most of those people havent done anything to anybody sothe middle i wouldnt have minded a couple of dozen ravishing beauties i wouldnt even have minded ravishing them but a couple of dozen hags i could have done without that some of these women were very pretty indeed some werent much above plain i think any man who saw them would have said the same some other man might not agree which ones were pretty and which ordinary though no doubt about it there was something here for every taste or for everyone to taste orwell you get the idea all of them pretty and plain alike wore silk blouses and the baggy bloomers stage shows call harem trousers in the stage shows those are as transparent as the tailor can arrange and as the local laws allow here they were of plain cottonnot a smooth thigh or a rounded rump on display such is life i stood among them and bowed in the four directions north and south east and west i greet you my ladies i said i hope you all speak hassocki yes your majesty their voices made a sweet chorus i looked around to make sure theyd all answered as far as i could tell they had some of them had strong accents but that was all right out of the corner of my eye i saw rexhep gesture i dont think i was supposed to all the harem girls got down from their divans and prostrated themselves before me they were a lot more graceful than essad pasha saying that doesnt do them enough credit a few days with a dancemaster and they could have earned their keep in any theater in schlepsig or narbonensis or albion get up get up i told them no need to stand on ceremony here or even to fall down for it some of them smiled as they straightened others looked puzzled i needed a moment to figure out why when i did it made me sad youll always find people who want other people to shout at them and tell them what to do that way they dont have to figure it out for themselves id be lying if i said i understood thisive been making my own way ever since i got old enough to ignore what my mother and father told me which didnt take long i dont understand it but that doesnt mean its not real some of the girls wanted a king whod roar at them the way a mean taverner keeps his barmaids in line i wouldnt have minded roaring at the minister from belagora as a matter of fact i intended towhat else was barisha for but i have better things to do with pretty girls or even with girls not much above plain than roar at them what are your names i asked them strati lutzi hoti they rained down on me i was once in a troupe with a memorious manfunes his name was from leon he taught me a few of his tricks only a few mind you i dont have a memory like hiseliphalets whiskers who doesbut im good with names inside a few minutes i had them all straight pick something about the person and associate it with the name and you wont go wrong strati had straight hair lutzi stirred up lust in mei think she was the prettiest of them hoti seemed hot she dabbed at her forehead with a handkerchief and so on it isnt magic not the kind that uses the laws of similarity and contagion but it seems sorcerous to people who dont know how its done funes was a master with any kind of stage presence at all he would have been rich and famous not a sideshow performer i dont have a quarter of his skill but i can sell what i do and the harem girls had to be the easiest audience i ever faced if id roared at them they would have thought they deserved it since i didnt they thought i was sweet theyd never dreamt i would bother learning their names let alone that i could do it so fast they crooned and sighed and stared at me as if id fallen from heaven sometimestoo often most of the timeyou cant get one woman to fall in love with you here i had a couple of dozen all doing it at once it would have been embarrassing if i hadnt enjoyed it so much every once in a while i glanced over at poor rexhep once he caught me doing it that was embarrassing may i speak with you a moment your majesty he asked in that strange epicene voice of course i said and then to the harem girls ill be with you in a moment my sweethearts i was sporting with them some of them i think realized as much to others the play was real the shqipetari sequester their women in hassockian fashionhow not when they learned it from the hassocki that only makes it easier for the girls to grow up naive and trusting rexhep drew me far enough aside to keep the harem girls from overhearingand dont think they didnt want to the little snoops are you a wizard your majesty the eunuch asked not a bit of it i answered ive only been a king for a couple of hours wizardry will have to wait why do you ask maybe the girls werent the only naive ones maybe he thought those tricks of memory were real magic too that turned out to be close to the mark but not on it because youve ensorcelled your harem thats why he said before you came in half of them were angry at being plucked from their homes and the other half were frightened now look at them they want to have more to do with you he sounded as if that were the nastiest perversion he could think of all things considered it probably was i dont want them angry i dont want them frightened i want them friendly ill want them very friendly tonight i said so i try to make them like me whats so strange about that he couldnt see it he thought it was a trick if it wasnt magic i wondered what sort of harem hed kept before and what kind of hellhole it was by the look of sour bafflement on his face he knew no more of affection than a blind man knows of sunsets a pity no doubt but i couldnt give him what hed lost i went back to jollying the girls along rexhep went back to trying to figure out what i was up to he wouldnt believe what i told him even when it was true he needed complications poor soul whether they were real or not after a while i turned to go the girls sighed in disappointment rexhep looked relieved and suspicious at the same timean expression only a eunuchs face could manage i told the girls some of you will be summoned to my chamber tonight if you arent summoned to my chamber tonight it doesnt mean i dont love you im only one man and not quite so young as i wish i were some of them giggled others had no idea what i was talking about they really do raise them innocent in shqiperi i went on if i dont summon you tonight i will summon you another night and one not long from now i know you will all delight me and ill try to please you too meanwhile several girls tried to follow me out toward the doorway to the outer world only rexheps scowls restrained them rexheps scowls i think could restrain anything up to and possibly including a dragon as far as gloom goes he gives max a run for his money rexhep of course has the advantageif thats the word i wantof a real grievance against the world no denying max does well without it rexhep unbarred the door on this side of the wall skander unbarred it on that side i passed from one side to the other from one world to another both the head eunuch and the palace majordomo made haste to separate those worlds again as soon as the door closed two bars thudded into place at the same time have you thought of a wizard for me i asked skander id like to use his services this afternoon the very best in peshkepiia i believe is a certain zogu skander said he dwells not far from the palace if it would please you that he be summoned it would please me very much i said i hoped it would anyhow skander bowed and hurried away i went to the throne room it was to put things kindly still a work in progress that might have been gold foil pressed on the arms and legs and back of the shqipetari royal seat it might have been but it looked more like the wrapping paper for nameday gifts you can buy in smart shops from the dual monarchy to albion stranger things than a smart shop in peshkepiia may have happened but i cant think of one lately above the throne hung the royal emblem a black twoheaded eagle on a red background it might have seemed more impressive if it hadnt looked like a small rug woven for the even smaller tourist trade a label was attached to the bottom corner of the royal emblem product of albion it readso that really was a small rug woven for the tourist trade when i rested my arms on those of the throne the shiny gold crackled and crunched it was wrapping paper then i thought of the treasure in the strongroom one of these days shqiperi would be a kingdom i told myself not just try to look like one ah well we all make promises we cant keep after about half an hour skander returned with another shqipetar presumably zogu the wizard had a sharp nose a bristling mustache and a pancake of hair on top of his head the rest of his scalp being shaved your majesty he murmured bowing toward the makeshift throne how may i serve you as you know my rank you will know the privileges accompanying it i said you will also know the obligations accompanying it and you will know that some of the privileges if taken to extremes become obligations they can even become obligations a man is ah impotent to meet i waited zogu looked clever if he had not the wit to figure out what i was talking about though i wanted nothing to do with him he didnt disappoint me laying a finger by the side of his nose and winking he said you want to screw your way through the harem like you were seventeen again better than that i hopewhen i was seventeen i was a clumsy puppy i said zogu laughedreminiscently i suppose for who isnt a clumsy puppy at seventeen i went on i would like to be able to go as often now as i did then i can help you the wizard said the formulary will serve you well for a night or two nights or three or maybe even four use it too long though and you will soon find you are a man of years not far removed from my own his chuckle had a wry edge do i know this from experience north and south east and west your majesty i do a few such nights should suffice i assured him by then i shall have made my point zogu laughed merrily and im supposed to keep you pointing eh well just as you say just as you say was he too clever for his own good men of that sort often are i rely on your magecraft i said but i also rely on your discretion if your spell fails i will do the best i can on my own if your discretion fails zogu north and south east and west the world is not wide enough to hide you from me do you understand what i tell you oh yes your majesty oh yes i have servedothers who relied on my discretion if i were to name them they would have relied on it in vain he said good i said for the answer pleased me carry on thenand i will carry on later he chuckled again and bowed may it be just as you say at his feet sat a carpetbag had i met him in schlepsig or the dual monarchy i would have taken him for a commercial traveler with the worst haircut in the world he began taking sundry stones and herbs and animal bits from the carpetbag you have everything you need i asked oh yes zogu answered easily when skander summoned me i thought on what you might require i was not sure i knewhe gave me no time for a proper divinationbut this possibility did cross my mind get on with it then i said he smiled and bowed and did he was one of those wizards who like to explain things i always let such people ramble on you never can tell when youll hear something worth remembering this we call here the eagles stone your majesty he said it was about the size and shape of an eagles egg or half an egg sliced lengthwise the inside was lined with glittering white crystals but otherwise hollow its property is the engendering of love betwixt man and woman engendering is what i have in mind all right i said zogu put some seeds into the eagles stone and brayed them with a pestle these come from sweet basil he told me i didnt know who basil was but i wanted the girls to think me sweet more seeds i recognized these from their smell before zogu said anise it goes into lokrian spirits and theyll rouse anything this side of the dead the wizard added more bits of vegetable material rocket he said since i wanted to up up like a rocket if not so fast i nodded next came some scraps of what looked like thin parchment whats that i inquired the shed skin of a long snake zogu winked at me i grinned back after that he put in some small blue pills and used the pestle to crush them to powder what are those i asked zogu winked again and powdered another couple of pills my secret ingredient you might say well well i said since he talked about so much of what he did what he wouldnt talk about must have been potent indeed set the eagles stone under your bed before you summon your lovelies zogu told me after chanting over it in both hassocki and shqipetari you will rise to the occasion and may you win a standing ovation my thanks i said and your fee for the services rendered when he named it i didnt scream as i would have in my private capacity how could i when he was increasing my privates capacity i just paid him its good to be the king xii several hours still lay between me and sunset i suppose i could have begun in broad daylight but that might have scandalized the harem girls and as i soon discovered a kings life is not an idle one anyone would think a man with a crown on his head ran a kingdom or something no sooner had zogu departed the palace his belt pouch clinking with silver than skander came up to me and said your majesty barisha of belagora would have speech with you oh he would would he i said about the only people less welcome in the throne room would have been count rappaport and a dentist but skander nodded i didnt suppose i could summarily dismiss the representative of my northern neighbor however much i wanted to with a sigh i nodded let him advance and be recognized recognizing barisha i must confess was seldom a problem each uniform he wore was more garish than the last this one was of thick shimmering blue silk with a gold sash running from northeast to southwest i wondered if hed won it from jeanjacquespierreroland at dice medals and ribbons bedizened his chest i also wondered what they were the belagoran award for gloriously getting up on time two days running the grand star of the illustrious order of horseleeches the medal for proficiency in stealing chickens second class i shook my head barisha no doubt was a firstclass chicken thief all the medals clanked and jingled as he grudged me a bow your majesty he said and then even more grudgingly my congratulations on your accession thank you i said i hope shqiperi and belagora long remain at peace may zibeon grant it be so even barishas agreement was insulting he rubbed halim eddins nose in his following the two prophets rather than the quadrate god and though he didnt know it he rubbed otto of schlepsigs nose in his following zibeon rather than eliphalet because i had to be halim eddin and not otto i rubbed back as a proper worshiper of the quadrate god would have north and south east and west let peace prevail in the south in the east in the west peace will indeed prevail as far as belagora is concerned barisha said in the northin the north your majesty we do not recognize the border the powers have declared now that the hassockian empire has lost the nekemte wars that border should and must become more rational by which you mean more the way you want it i said sourly but of course he was a very smug and selfsatisfied chicken thiefhe didnt even take the trouble to deny it this is my land now you may not steal it i said how do you propose to stop us he sneered i told you beforewe have the men on the ground tremist will be ours and soon hassocki soldiers still in shqiperi will obey me i said barisha went right on sneering i added and we will create a proper shqipetari army as soon as possible i had some hope he would take that seriously shqiperi had no true soldiers except for what was left of the hassocki garrisonsno denying that but the custom of the bloodfeud means every male shqipetar who shaves goes around armed all the time id never seen so much deadly hardware on display as i did here barisha remained unimpressed and what hero from ancient days has been reborn to command your fearsome host he inquired that question struck much too close to the bone most shqipetari acknowledge one master and one master only themselves this makes them excellent raiders excellent ambushers excellent huntersand terrible soldiers men in an army need to act together shqipetari do as they bloody well please they might obey a hero from ancient daysor they might decide he was an old fool and ignore him too any modern leader would have his hands full even more than in the rest of the world in the nekemte peninsula to back down is to admit weakness if i yielded so much as a clod of shqipetari soil to barisha he would be back demanding more day after tomorrow vlachia and lokris would scream for their share or more than their share too other kingdoms would want to do the same but only those three border shqiperi well i suppose the torinans would take a seaside bite too and so the old border will stand i said it will not barisha answered we shall resist with force any attempt to change it i said we do not seek to change it we seek to set it right barisha proved himself a hypocrite and a liar in the same breathno mean accomplishment if you do not take your soldiers back across the old border we will make them sorry i said barisha bowed what is ours is ours and what is ours is also yours is that what you are saying your excellency i am saying the hassocki soldiers still in tremist occupy land that should always have belonged to belagora we must correct this unjust and immoral situation and i must tell you that it looks fitting and proper to me i answered we shall not let our kingdom be abridged before it is well begun the old hassocki province of shqiperi on whose borders the powers have agreed shall be the new kingdom of shqiperi and there is nothing more to be said oh but there is barisha said for one thing your majesty your socalled kingdom is a joke a land full of goatherds and cattle rustlers for another belagora has its legitimate rights and will protect them by force of arms as necessary i remembered my earlier ruminations on barishas medals and a joke id once heard do you know how to make belagoran chicken stew your excellency i asked barishas bushy eyebrows made his frown something less than a thing of beauty why no he saidhe made an admirable straight man first steal a chicken i began he turned a color no doctor would have cared to see in a man of his age and weight you insult me you insult my kingdom you enjoy it more when you insult mine dont you well i am here to tell you that that arrow can shoot both ways i said and i am also here to tell you that we will fight you if you do not withdraw is that plain enough or should i draw you pretty pictures to color in barisha went an even less appealing shade of purple it clashed badly with his uniform before i could point this out to him he said do you presumedo you dareto threaten the mighty kingdom of belagora with war i dare not to be redundant which is moreor rather lessthan you can say i answered and if you want a war in the north you can have it i dont just threaten belagora with war i declare war on your robbers nest of a kingdom as of this moment your not very excellency you are persona non grata in shqiperi i raised my voice to a shout skander he appeared as if from a trap door your majesty give this personi pointed at barisha with the index finger of my left hand an insult skander understood and the belagoran unfortunately didnta horse and aim him in the direction of his kingdom if he is not out of shqiperi in three days time let him be declared fair game from what i knew of the shqipetari there was at least an evenmoney chance they wouldnt wait three days to descend on barisha from the look on his face he knew the same thing he did his best to bluster i shall return to this piddlepot hole in the ground at the head of an army that darkens the sun with the flies that hover over it i finished for him if you belagorans bathed once in a while youd have fewer troubles along those lines barisha must have had some chameleon in him probably on his mothers side he did a very creditable imitation of an eggplant let it be war then he cried and stormed away a couple of minutes after he left the throne room max ambled in um your majesty what have you done he asked declared war on belagora why he laughed getting a laugh out of max isnt easy i laughed too at the look on his face when he realized i wasnt joking well theres a record he said you havent had a crown on your head more than a few hours and youve already started a war i can think of a lot of kings whod be jealous i can your majesty skander sounded scandalized is thisthis personage allowed to speak to you so that made max laugh again you try and stop me pal a warning of this sort from an officer six feet eight inches tall and armed with a sword does carry a certain persuasiveness skander sent me a look of appeal my aidedecamp means well i said and dont think that didnt made max laugh one more time sometimes i find it useful to employ a man who enjoys full freedom of speech sometimes even before i was royal i found it a royal pain in the fundament too but i didnt tell that to skander yes your majesty my majordomos tone suggested that i was eating with my fingers and didnt know any better when i showed no sign of ordering max drawn and quartered and placed outside the palace as a warning to others skander threw his hands in the air and stalked off all things considered he made a better exit than barisha had you really declared war on belagora max said i nodded not without pride he by contrast shook his head how are you going to fight it dont be silly i answered nobody can fight a proper war in those mountains the belagorans and the hassocki have just spent months proving it why should things be any different now because youre in command instead of old essad pasha max suggested what you know about running an army doesnt exactly fill up the encyclopaedia albionica all at once drawing and quartering max looked much more attractive i thought about calling skander back if he knew a reliable wizard he probably knew a reliable executioner too but thinking of zogu and his magic made me decide to try to distract max instead execution is sopermanent i told max about the sorcery adding im going to have rexhep bring some of the harem girls to the royal bedchamber tonight are you max said that got his attention all right of course i am what else would a king do insult the poor dears by leaving them lonely what sort of cad do you think i am i held up a hasty hand max was liable to answer that having forestalled him i went on rexhep may fetch more girls than even a king can handle all in one night you expect me to take care of your leftovers max asked haughtily well unless youd rather not i replied now he was the one holding up a hand i didnt say that i didnt say anything like that he got sensible mighty fast somehow i thought he might all right then i said well see how that goes after the sun sets i waited to find out what happened next what happened was that max realizing which side his bread was buttered on bowed very low thank you your majesty he said all of a sudden he didnt care so much about war with belagora and do you know what else neither did i i dont remember much about the rest of the afternoon after war and the harem not much seems important i think jeanjacquespierreroland called on me i cant begin to tell you why narbonensis is a long way from shqiperi any civilized kingdom is a long way from shqiperi and narbonensis is friendly toward vlachia and belagora which only goes to show all its taste is in its mouth maybe he wanted to tell me not to go to war against belagora that makes as much sense as anything else and more sense than a lot of things i can think of i cant prove it though and if jeanjacquespierreroland had any sense to start with what was he doing in shqiperi not long before supper i heard screams and the clash of cutleryi hoped it was cutlery not swordsfrom the kitchens i sent skander off to see whod murdered whom and why when he came back he reported nothing to worry about your majesty only a disagreement no blood no eh by the noise i expected youd be wading through it up to your knees my answer was punctuated by more shouts and the ringing of steel on steel with a sigh i said you must have hired the cooks from the metropolis how did you know your majesty i think it was the first time i impressed skander as myself and not as king of shqiperi supper waswhat you would expect with a bunch of shqipetari cooking it fried chicken which again wasnt badthough fried chicken feet were something id never tried before and remembering my little love fest with barisha i kept wondering where the fowl came from fried potatoes once more pretty good even if wed be likely to boil them in schlepsig fried squash which waswell better than it sounds anyway fried lettuce about which i draw a merciful veil of silence by eliphalets beard if they had ice cream in shqiperi they would fry that theyve never heard of it proving mercy still does stream down from on high as the meal came to its greasy conclusion i turned to max and said captain yildirim yes your majesty max gives nothing away not even to himself attend me in my quarters if you would be so kind i said we can smoke a pipe together and study the best way to drive the belagoran curs off our soil i got that out with a straight face i really did yes your majesty despite the uniform he wore max was and is about as military as your cat soldiers make other people swallow their swords max swallows his own need i say more but again no one who didnt know him would know that skander and the servants who cleared the table looked very impressed one of the servants in fact was so busy sneaking glances at max that he knocked over a goblet he should have picked up it fell off the table and smashed the servant turned pale so did his friends they muttered in shqipetari mercy your majesty skander begged mercy what was i supposed to do cut off his hand cut off his head by the fear in their eyes maybe i was i started to laugh and tell them not to worry about it i started to but i didnt shqiperi is the kind of place where they see kindness as weakness take it out of his pay i told skander it had better not happen again no your majesty of course not your majesty thank you your majesty skander said the servant bowed very low indeed i did it right i nodded to max shall we go captain certainly your majesty he said you are as merciful as you are kind ive never known a man who could pay a more venomous compliment have you ever seen a sorcerous print of one of those narbonese paintings that imagine what the hassockian atabegs bedchamber looks like theyre all carpets and cushions and silks and gauzy curtains and polished brasswork and bright colors and clashing patterns i dont know what the hassockian atabegs bedchamber really looks like the authentic halim eddin may i suppose mine looked likeone of those paintings not one of the good ones where everything seems elegant and expensive but the tasteless kind where all the furnishings look as if theyre one stepand a small step at thatup from what a whorehouse would have all that was missing were the naked girls they werent far away though max looked around as if he couldnt believe what he saw i didnt blame him i had trouble believing it too he waved how are you supposed to sleep with all this going on this place mostly isnt for sleeping i answered well how are you supposed to do that with all this going on he said i tucked the eagle stone stuffed with zogus ah condiments under the bed i have hopes of finding out i told him and you may rely on it that there are plenty of girls in the eunuchs care for both of us ah max brightened as much as max ever brightens you mean you didnt ask me here to help you figure out how to fight your stupid war against belagora if i ever need a general bad enough to look to you my kingdom is in more trouble than it knows what to do with i said with dignity if its got you for a king your kingdoms already in more trouble than it knows what to do with max retorted thou cowardly hind thou art the veriest varlet that ever chewed a tooth i said i love hassockiendearments oh be still thou flea thou nit thou wintercricket thou max said oh yes i love hassocki endearmentsexcept when they come back at me we slanged each other for a while then we smoked pipes together the long hassockistyle pipes called chubuks after wed smoked a bit i stopped caring whether wed been throwing darts back and forth whatever we were smoking i dont think it was just tobacco in the hassockian empire and other western lands they will sometimes mix hemp or hashish in with their smokables i resolved to ask skander if hed done that for me somehow i never did i kept forgetting i didnt forget the harem girls though whatever we were smoking it didnt bother that side of things at all on the contrary in factor maybe zogus magical stone now that it was in place in a bedchamberwas starting to do its job after some searching in that garish room i found a closet right behind the door it held half a dozen iridescent silk robes which clashed with one another and with everything around themnot easy but they did it the closet also held max even if he had to duck to get in now stay there till i let you out i told him all right he said but if you think you can get away with diddling the girls while i listen your majesty forget it yes id thought about that again but i tossed it aside the same way i did the first time it crossed my mindi cant imagine a better excuse for an assassination so i said no no as if the idea had never oncelet alone twiceoccurred to me i didnt bring you here to screw you max that seemed to mollify him i closed the closet door which all but disappeared and i called for skander yes your majesty as he had in the throne room he seemed to come out of nowhere one thing i will say when you wanted him you didnt have to wait around for him go to the harem door tell rexhep to bring me lutzi and maja and bjeshka and varri and zalli and shkoza certainly your majesty are you sure theyll be enough for one evening if id ever thought skander a man without sarcasm i had to revise my opinion the only way to top him was to pretend i didnt notice he didnt mean what he said in my blandest tones i answered well if theyre not rexhep can always bring me a few more eh now skander had to figure out whether i meant it he couldnt i was a performer in front of an audience and that was all i needed to hold up a mask to the world balked there skander started a new hare where is captain yildirim your majesty did he leave your chambers just when you wish things would be simple once in a whileof course he did hes not here is he he must be back in his own rooms by now id better check said the conscientiousthe much too bloody conscientiousskander you wouldnt want him sneaking into the harem while rexhep brings you your ladies would you no i wouldnt want that i want to share them with him right here but i dont think hed do anything like that you never know skander said darkly let me go see ill be back directly and away he went i couldnt even tell him no he would wonder why if i did no proper hassocki gentleman let alone a high hassocki nobleman like halim eddin would have protested even for a moment those who follow the quadrate god take the harem seriously if i was going to be halim eddin i had topretend anyhow the much too bloody conscientious skander returned almost as fast as hed promised i am glad to be able to tell you your majesty that you seem to be right he said captain yildirim did not respond to my knock but as his door is barred from the inside i have no doubt he is indeed in the room after all he ate at supper he must have decided to turn in early barred from the inside max is a resourceful man but how the demon had he managed that all right then i said a remark that means nothing but bought me a heartbeat or two to think even after whatever id smoked i knew what i was supposed to be thinking about too go speak to the eunuch you do remember the women i asked for dont you lutzi and maja and he bogged down i am so sorry your majesty dont worry about it i could afford to be magnanimous because i was showing i was smarter than he was lutzi and maja and bjeshka and varri and zalli and shkoza i brought out the string of names with no hesitation im not in the same league with the memorious funes but im pretty good bjeshka and varri and zalli and shkoza bjeshka and varri and skander repeated the names over and over to himself as he walked down the hallway i hoped he wouldnt forget lutzi and maja i especially hoped he wouldnt forget lutzi she wouldnt have been a sovereigns mistress in the dual monarchy or narbonensis but she might well have been a dukes nothing to do but wait and hope zogus spell lived up to my anticipation not knowing just when rexhep would appear i couldnt go to the cleverly concealed closet and ask max what hed done and how he did it a time for everything i thought when rexhep led the girls to my room they were veiled and cloaked against mens prying eyes here you are your majesty he said in that cool sexless voice do you require anything else of me i wondered what he was thinking no looking into his eyes i didnt wonderi knew the question wasnt whether he hated me but how much no that will be all for now i told him ill summon you when i need you to take them back i just wanted him to go away can you blame me thinking about eunuchs at a time like that thanks but id rather not rexhep didnt want to be there as much as i didnt want him there maybe more very well your majesty he said and withdrew it wasnt very well not for him nothing would ever make it very well either away he went tall and thin and proudand damned or as near as makes no difference i closed the door to the bedchamber and barred it from the inside how had max done that then i bowed to the girls no one here will have to do anything she doesnt enjoy doing i promised the idea is for us to have a good timefor all of us to have a good time do you understand yes your majesty chorused lutzi and maja and bjeshka and varri and zalli and shkoza good i smiled at them they had to be nervous the only way they had to my heart wasnt through my stomach but by a more direct route they didnt know what strange tastes i might have for that matter they might not know which tastes were strange and which werent had essad pasha recruited a couple of dozen true maidens for me id find out i smiled again you may unwrap yourselves my dears nobodywell almost nobodyhere but us and so they did what they had on under those cloaks was a good deal skimpier and more transparent than what theyd worn when i called on them in the harem maja and zalli were either natural blondes or thorough i didnt care which not a bit may i ask you something your majesty lutzi said i bowed again of course sweetheart in a little while i expect ill ask you something too she blushed with what she was almost wearing i could watch the blush travel a long way i dont know when ive had a more pleasant contemplation she said one of you and six of us your majesty all the girls leaned forward to hear what id say about that they seemed to have some notion of what was what anyhow that was nice do you think i cant do you all justice i asked oh no your majesty of course not your majesty you are the king your majesty they all denied it much squeaking and twittering many artfully shocked expressions what they meant was you havent got a prayer your majesty maybe they were right nocertainly they were right even with zogus spell but i had something better than a prayer i had a friend i said my loves my aidedecamp and i go back a long time together weve guarded each others backs through years of dangers that not only sounded good it had the added virtue of actually being true i went on he having shared danger with me the least i can do is share my reward with him and so i have the honor and privilege to present to youthe valiant captain yildirim i opened the closet door max came out and bowed lutzi and maja and bjeshka and varri and zalli and shkoza all squealed for one thing as ive said max is very very tall for another while in the closet hed contrived to rid himself of anything he wouldnt need later his uniform for instance he emerged wearing nothing but a smile it occurred to me that i was the only one wearing anything significantsurely the only one wearing anything beyond the decorative i didnt need long to divest myself of the problem to say nothing of my pants after a bow of my own i waved grandly toward the broad inviting bed well my lovelies here we are we have one another we have all that room and we have plenty of time shall we make the most of them we did our best you will have seen a kaleidoscope i suppose theyre clever little toys all the wizards i know insist theyre not magical even if those clever mages cant tell me how they do work the little chunks of polished stone and colored glass inside them move and when you look through the other end you watch the colors and the pretty patterns shift you will have seen a kaleidoscope yes but have you ever imagined being part of a kaleidoscope display making pretty patterns and shifting from this one to that one to the next one as the whimor the next beckoning partnertakes you ive done some interesting enjoyable and complicated things in my time nothing ive ever done comes close to that evening for being all three at once every so often i would pause for a moment to admire what was going on all around me i wasnt the only one either i think we all had the feeling this was something very special or could be if we made it so i think we all tried harder than we would have if we enjoyed such sport every night too and i think i would have soon collapsed from exhaustionhappy exhaustion but exhaustion even soif not for zogus sorcery i amazed myself i might have been a bunny i kept going and going and going well actually i keptthe magic lived up to its promise i will say that max held up his end of the bargain by the sighs and moans and murmurs that came from that part of the kaleidoscope picture his end held up quite well indeed thank you very much and the girls were even better than id hoped they would be which is saying a lot i dont know how much experience they had thats not the sort of question a gentleman asks i am sure a couple of them though they did seem to know a good deal about some other things hadnt had one particular experience before cold water would get the stains off the quilt im also sure they didnt have enough experience to let any of what we did embarrass them they accepted it as natural and enjoyableand by thinking it ought to be that way they helped make sure it was lutzi lived up to what her name sounded like bjeshka proved shapelier than i thought she was back in the harem maybe her outfit there hadnt fit her well varri had a very talented mouth maja was almost as limber as dear ilona shkoza enjoyed being rolled onto her stomach zallii dont remember anything remarkable about zalli but im not complaining either oh no everything passes everything perishes everything palls so said some dreary worldweary narbonese allegedly a sage all i can tell you is he wasnt there in that bedchamber that night i never wanted it to end i dont think any of us wanted it to end and for a long timelonger than i ever would have expectedit didnt but even with the best will in the world and with what had to be somewhere close to the best magecraft in the world the time comes when all you can do is all you can do we sprawled here and there on the quilts and cushions and on one another we were all tired we were all sweaty we were all grinning like highgrade idiots well i said lazily ill have to thank essad pasha after i sleep for a week he told us it was our duty said one of the girlsmaja i think it was but im not sure by then they all ran together in my mind whoever she was she went on i never thought doing my duty could be so much fun a chorus of agreement followed it wasnt a very energetic chorus but that was all right i wasnt very energetic myself just then i thought i ought to say something so i did if a king cant make his subjects happy whats the point of ruling that won more agreement i feltstatesmanlike but then max asked what about the grannies with mustaches for that matter what about the granddads with mustaches even at a time like that even in a place like that max would be difficult well what about them i said let them console each other as for the kingi ran my hand along the sweetly curved length of bjeshka i think it was bjeshkadoesnt he deserve the best the kingdom has to offer and havent i got the best right here with me and we have the best right here with us was that zalli was it varri was she looking at me or did her eyes wander over toward max i was too happily sated to care the rest of the charming ladies in the harem deserve a trial too i said wondering if my heart would stand the strain zogu had warned about overusing his charm well what a way to go who wouldnt want such apatriotic ending wait till the others hear about our sport was that lutzi i hope it was lutzi i did want to make her happy and i know with memory yet green how happy she made me she went on they wont be able to wait for their turn to come the others all nodded except fori believeshkoza whod dozed off i gently shook her awake then i said im afraid my dears its time for you to put on your cloaks and your veils and go on back behind the door for a while ill call for you again as soon as i can north and south east and west i promise you that they sighed but they obeyed alas only the two prophets can see ahead of time how and whether what a man says will come to pass i intended to keep that promise i was ah firmly resolved to keep that promise butalas i nodded to max captain yildirim you might do well to disappear while we go through the boring formalities he went back into the closetand no not like that but i didnt want skander and rexhep spitting rivets the girls sighed when he closed the door i reminded myself theyd taken pleasure with me too i had to remind myself rather loudly i fear i also had to remind myself to get dressed again i was the last one out of my clothes and the last one into them again with a sad sigh of my own i opened the door and called for skander he was yawning when he got there what time was it id had other things on my mind be so good as to summon rexhep to escort the ladies back to the harem i told him of course your majesty he said stonefaced i trust everything went well oh yes that wasnt me that was lutzi and maja and bjeshka and varri and zalli and shkoza they sounded so convincingand so convincedthat skander retreated in disorder rexhep came and took the girls away without a word did he hate me more because id satisfied them for that matter did he hate me more because id satisfied myself i didnt inquire yes some few things are better left unknown max emerged from the closet neatly sheveled the opposite of disheveled yes once again how do you propose to get back into your room if its barred from the inside i asked that i did want to know ill pull strings he said the reply made no sense to me but then a fair amount of what max says makes no sense to me the only thing saving him from complete incomprehensibility is that unlike a lot of people i could name he doesnt talk too much on the way to maxs room we passed skander in the hallway skander gave one of the better double takes ive seen on noting the redoubtable captain yildirim out and about put it on the stage in schlepsig or albion or even narbonensis and it would stop the show for a couple of minutes it was that good i wondered if my majordomo would follow us that could have been awkward but he didnt maybe he didnt trust his own eyes if not he was foolish if you think you see something maxs size you probably do when we got to maxs dooralso tallhe reached up and yanked on a bit of string up near the top no one less uncouthly tall would have noticed it or could have reached it i put the bar on a pivot he murmured all i need to do is pull down here and up it comes and it did he opened the door and went into the room where skander thought hed been all along sweet dreams your majesty well i obliged him there oh didnt i just xiii sorryno chapter xiii its unlucky xiv yes i know this is the thirteenth chapter but its not chapter xiii theres a difference if you dont believe me ask the next tall building you happen to meet when i woke in the morning i had some trouble remembering where i was and who i was supposed to be but i didnt have any trouble at all remembering what id been doing i smiled traces of cinnamon and rosewater and sandalwood still lingered in the air my smile got wider had it been only the morning before when i was crowned king of shqiperi by eliphalets curly whiskers so it had this would be my first whole day as a sovereign among sovereigns equal in rank if not in might to the lords of schlepsig and torino and leon in something over half a days worth of kinging it id started a war and started an orgy i wondered what i could do to top that given a day with the full complement of hours first things first i looked under the bed zogus stuffed eagle stone was still there hed warned me about overusing it but he had said i could get a few days out of it you never know how much till you try it would i told myself be purely in the pursuit of knowledge can you deny that carnal knowledge is knowledge like any other kind can you deny its more fun than any other kind didnt think so i walked over to the closet to see what all was in it when it wasnt holding max besides those incandescent robes it turned out to have some specimens of shqipetari national costume what shqipetari wear is more attractive than say lokrian clothes no short skirts no pompoms on the shoes past that i dont have much to say for it one of these days i might have to put it on anyway to show i was at least pretending to be a jolly shqipetar like the jolly shqipetari i ruled more often than not a jolly shqipetar either has something wrong with him or hes just killed someone but thats another story along with the white shirts and tight trousers and clumsy cloaks and horrid headgear and those robes which even count rappaport would have disdained the closet held several sensible comfortable hassocki caftans evidently i was allowed to recall the land i came from as well as the one i now inhabited a caftan and a crown go together oddly but i donned them both maybe i would start a new trend the faithfuli hopedskander wasnt far from the door when i came out if he saw anything odd about my outfit he didnt mention it good morning your majesty he said how may i serve you today coffee i said breakfast a king has to have his priorities straight i thought about asking for another helping of harem girls too just to see the look on skanders face but i couldnt do them justice right then and my mother always taught me not to ask for anything i couldnt use so i tried a different question instead who wants to see me this morning several scribes your majestythey seemed quite insistent the majordomo replied and essad pashahe seemed quite upset and untergraf horstgustavhe seemed quitewell quite hung over ill deal with all of them i said though the prospect of dealing with scribes made me wish i were hung over too considering some of the katzenjammers ive had that tells you how much i love scribes i couldnt face them on an empty stomach coffee i repeated breakfast the coffee was hassockistyle thick and sweet and muddy the way it always is in the nekemte peninsula it was also strong enough to pry my eyelids apart despite my sweaty exertions the night before if i had been hung over the curses and clashing cutlery in the kitchens would have driven me to despair as things were they helped wake me up fried eggs fried blood sausages fried mush which looks like something from the wrong end of a cow but actually tastes pretty good the cooks didnt fry the strawberries if they had i might have ordered my first executions max staggered into the dining room when i was about halfway through breakfast he looked even more bedraggled or possibly bedraggled than i felt coffee he croaked in piteous tones yes your excellency skander bowed deeply at once your excellency he acted a lot more deferential toward max than he had the day before he must have decided captain yildirim was a powerful wizard along with being my aidedecamp how else could the redoubtable captain have got out of a locked room not for anything would i have told maxs secret i lingered over coffee and smoked a cigar to stretch things out still further it seemed to distress skander shqipetari i learned later reckon anything but a pipe unmanly this doesnt keep some of them from smoking cigars and cigarettes it does give the rest an excuse to sneer at the ones who do and skander couldnt very well think me unmanly not after the night before bless the girls anyhow at last though i had to face the evil moment captain yildirim at my side i went to the throne room to do it maybe the royal trappings would impress the foreign scribes there were no shqipetari scribes proving the kingdom did have something going for it after all or maybe notthe trappings didnt much impress me in swarmed the scribes pens poised above notebooks they shouted questions in half a dozen languages only two of which i was supposed to understand i glanced over to max who stood behind and to the left of the throne captain yildirim i said out came the sword the blade glittering in the torchlight show respect for the royal dignity max bawled in hassocki not many scribes knew hassocki that was all right when a very large man bares his blade and shouts angrily even some journalists will pay attentionenough to lessen the racket anyhow bumbling bob of albion wouldnt have noticed the sword if it cut off his head and probably would have gone right on talking afterwards losing his head wouldnt have affected his brainpower much in albioneseof coursehe asked why did you declare war on belagora he didnt know i spoke albionese he thought i didnt in fact but poor sap he didnt speak anything else eventually someone translated the question into schlepsigian which i could admit i understood because barisha wears silly uniforms and ridiculous medals no i didnt say it it was true but i didnt say it ah diplomacy because belagora does not respect shqiperis northern border because belagora has soldiers on our territorymy very first royal weand refuses to remove them that was also true it had the added virtue of being polite or as polite as you can be when you declare war on somebody it had the vice of being dull the scribes didnt care they solemnly wrote it down one of them asked what will you do if vlachia declares war on you why should i care about the vlachs i said grandly because they just beat the stuffing out of the hassockian empire the scribe suggested because most of your soldiers are hassocki leftovers as a schlepsigian i had nothing but scorn for vlachs as id pointed out to barisha theyre born chicken thieves they also have a certain talent for murdering their betters from ambush but the idea that i should take them seriously struck me as absurd as a schlepsigiani had to remember that to these hovering vultures i was no schlepsigian i was halim eddin prince of a folk who as the scribe was blunt enough to remind me had just got ignominiously beaten by the vlachs how should ii as halim eddinreact to that i decided that neither i as myself nor i as halim eddin could stomach knuckling under to the vlachs if they want a fight let them come we will give them all they ask for and more besides they didnt beat our army here in shqiperi during the nekemte wars and they wont beat it now more furious scribbling from the scribes do you trust essad pasha as a general one of them called now there was an interesting question i didnt trust essad pasha to empty my chambers pot deceit was his middle name id put the fear of the quadrate godor at least of captain yildirimin him but how long would that last long enough for me to let him command an army when he wasnt right under my eye maxs cough said he didnt like the idea neither did i but if he let the vlachs beat him he wasnt just risking my neck he was risking his own even more essad pasha is a very valiant warrior i said after those calculations swallowed perhaps two heartbeats i might not even have been lying and i knew that whatever i told the scribes essad pasha would hear of it in short order i went on thanks to his courage and brilliance vlachian aggression in shqiperi went nowhere during the late wars i might not have been lying about that either i didnt say anything about my new kingdoms impossible geography you cant make a hero out of swamps and mountains yes i admit that making a hero out of essad pasha is just about as unlikely but all the same i also hadnt said whether i trusted him i wondered if the scribes would notice there went some wasted worry scribes get paid to write down the obvious and to try not to put their readers to sleep while they do it the better ones can more or less manage that the rest well if someone like bob can still get work the standards of the trade could be higher how did you like your harem your majesty somebody asked all the scribes leaned forward there was the sort of story they were made to cover they didnt have to think which was lucky for most of them they only had to be sensational they could handle that all right some semipornographic drivel their editors could tone downor spice up if they were narboneselater on was just what they had in mind as otto of schlepsig i might have given it to them as halim eddin no in the matter of harems halim eddin was a worldlywise man of experience where the scribes were panting boys with drool running down their chins so i said the girls seem pleasant enough they fully measure up to the ones i knew in vyzance how many of them do you know someone shouted i made a point of introducing myself to all of them yesterday afternoon i replied summoning women i had not met would be most impolite how many of them did you summon a scribe asked while another one called did you summon them all at once or one at a time i looked severe at least i hoped i didnt just look exhausted gentlemen i dont ask you what you did in the nighttime once that was translated for bob he said i did nothing in the nighttime thou lying dog max said behind me in hassocki i dont think any of the scribes heard him which was probably just as well were not the king of shqiperi a journalist said we havent got a harem and you dont want your wives hearing what you did do i suggested that produced laughter and nudges and winks nobody denied it well next to nobody i did nothing in the nighttime bob repeated plaintively he was an old man it might even have been true you will have to draw a veil of silence around the harem i told the scribes for i do not intend to think of it further the real halim eddin would have been proud of me the real halim eddin might even have assumed that since i didnt say anything more about the harem the scribes wouldnt write any more about it if so the real halim eddin would have proved himself a naive innocent hassocki i knew better if i didnt talk about the harem the scribes would put words in my mouth if they didnt their editors back in albion or narbonensis or schlepsig or torino would they had to sell journals after all if the king of shqiperi wouldnt give them the copy they wanted theyd come up with it some other way after all what could he do about it declare war what a tempting thought but belagora lay within my reach the idiot scribes of narbonensis and albion im afraid not if i could have marched a shqipetari army through the streets of lutetia and sacked the editors one by one dividing all of their gall into three partseven more a fantasy on my part than the journalists slavering visions of a harem were on theirs anything else gentlemen i asked stretching a point there wasnt after war and women they werent very interested in other matters now that i think about it they had a point after the scribes trooped out gabbling among themselves skander brought essad pasha into the improvised throne room the former governor of shqiperi bowed low to the master he had summoned your majesty he murmured good morning your excellency i said how are you today i am well thank you essad pashas heavy features worked your majesty did you really declare war on belagora im not making this up you know i said i most assuredly did why because theyll slaughter us he said i doubt it they didnt slaughter you in the nekemte wars why should they start now theyre only belagorans after all i said north and south east and west are there any greater cowards in all the world well there are the shqipetari essad pasha said with a laugh skander hearing this did not laugh he quivered like a hound taking a scent and then aimed himself at essad pasha like that same hound getting ready to spring shqiperi is the land of the blood feud any little insult can bring it on essad pasha had just insulted all the people in the land and not in any little way i wondered if he would get out of the palace alive i wondered if i wanted him to with some reluctance i decided i did perhaps you might think about rephrasing that i said why should i essad pasha fleered then he noticed the tension in skanders body and the terrible intensity in the majordomos eyes like a pricked bladder essad pashas bravado collapsed he realized hed stepped over a line now the problem was to step back without making himself out to be a worse coward than hed called the shqipetari you might have been hasty i suggested mmm that wasnt a word just a noise in the back of essad pashas throat as if to suggest he needed oiling mmm he made it again this time it turned into a word mmmaybe i suppose i put it badly if the shqipetari were properly drilled and led and disciplined they would be brave enough as things are with all their quarrels and ambushes they dont really get the chance to show what they could do he waited i waited behind me and to my left max waited skander hadnt said a word before he didnt say anything now hed tensed all in a moment he didnt relax the same way instead the tautness left his body inch by inch at last he stopped staring at essad pasha as if about to fling himself at the older man in the next instant essad pasha breathed then so did i i hadnt realized id stopped till i started again i hadnt realized how long id stopped till i found out how much i needed that new breath life in shqiperi is often squalid sometimes downright nasty it is rarely dull in schlepsig even in narbonensis you can go for years without being threatened with sudden and violent death is dullness one of the great unheralded virtues of civilization i wouldnt be surprised shall we get back to the northern frontier i asked and essad pasha nodded jerkily since hed just acted like a jerk that seemed altogether fitting and proper i went on now that im king of shqiperi have the mountains up there flattened out have the roads got better have the dragons got friendlier give me leave to doubt it your majesty you are a great and mighty lordessad pasha had a certain low talent for sarcasm himselfbut you are not the quadrate god or if you are the incognito is remarkable effective he could say that if i agreed with it even in jest i blasphemed i knew enough of the quadrate gods cult to understand as much no no i am only a man i said and passed the test so what can the belagorans do past making a nuisance of themselves theyre already a nuisance yes that they are essad pasha sighed i suppose the biggest worry is that vlachia will jump into the fight too vlachia lusts after fushekuqe having no port of its own only people whove never seen fushekuqe could possibly lust after it you held them off before im sure you can do it again i said and essad pasha no more modest than he had to be nodded so much for his worries then one of skanders assistants came in and murmured to him in shqipetari skander turned to me and raised an eyebrow showing he wanted to be heard i nodded he spoke in hassocki your majesty his excellency vuk nedic of vlachia urgently requests an audience with you at your earliest convenience what about horstgustav i asked more backandforth in shqipetari he appears to have gone back to the metropolis skander reported he seemed unwell i see i said well you can send the werewolf in then that sent skander into gales torrents cloudbursts of laughter he never explained why maybe he thought vuk nedic was one too but was too polite to say so out loud or maybe the idea hadnt occurred to him till i used it wherever the truth lay there he liked it i asked essad pasha you can defend the kingdom a while longer a while longer yes he replied do please try not to declare war on vlachia right this minute though if youd be so kind maybe maxs coughs meant he thought that was a good idea maybe they just meant he had his usual catarrh i didnt inquire ill try i told essad pasha north and south east and west he deserves it though most of us deserve a great many things your majesty he replied if were lucky we dont get all of them now there was a nice philosophical point it almost made me wish i had time to discuss it anything else i asked essad pasha he shook his head i gestured to skander show in the vlachian yes your majesty hed got control of himself now he started giggling softly again essad pasha stumped out of the throne room as vuk nedic strode in they glared in passing each mans hand fell to the hilt of his sword but they both kept walking looking more lupine than ever vuk nedic bowed before me your majesty he barked your excellency i said what can i do for you this morning he ran his tongue across his lips it seemed exceptionally long and pink and limber when he reeled it back into his mouth his teeth looked uncommonly large and sharp no ordinary man should have had those goldenbrown eyes you have declared war on belagora he growled thats true i said so what vlachia is belagoras ally he said why should we not declare war on you because you wouldnt get very far i suggested because if you could have got very far you would have done it in the nekemte wars because there would be no point to it except killing soldiers who dont urgently need killing he blinked with those oddcolored eyes the effect was particularly startling my guess was hed never imagined soldiers might not need killing we could tear the throat out of this miserable excuse for a kingdom he snarled i doubt it i said he waited skander waited even max seemed to be waiting though i couldnt see him but id said everything i intended to say for the moment it was vuk nedics turn he bared those impressive teeth again they werent impressive enough to scare me off my throne after a pack of scribes what was one possible werewolf and i hadnt even begun to find out what fangs scribes have vuk nedic growled again down deep in his throat count rappaport is a blundering fool he got out at last well well wed found something on which we could agree who would have imagined it why do you say so i asked always interesting to hear someone elses reasons for despising a man you also dislike because if you were not a proper king you would never have the nerve to defy grand and mighty vlachia vuk nedic replied i didnt laugh in his face i dont know why not i merely report the fact max didnt cough either in an experimental mood i pulled a coin from my pocket a good solid silver schlepsigian kram i tossed it to vuk nedic saying this for your courtesy most of the time if you toss a man a coin he will automatically catch it if you toss a man who is at least part werewolf a silver coin he will automatically catch itand will then be sorry he has that was what i wanted to see whether vuk nedic would be sorry he was holding a silver coin but i never found out the vlach made an awkward grab for the kram but missed it altogether it bounced off the front of his wolfskin jacket and fell to the floor where it rang sweetly before bending to pick it up he pulled from his pocket a pair of thin kidskin gloves which he swiftly donned only then did he retrieve the coin i take this as one man takes a present from another he said i do not take it to mean that vlachia is in any way obliged to shqiperi if my king decides to go to war alongside belagora you may be assured i will fight at the fore i would not doubt it i said and then as one man takes a present from another yes id had my question answered all right if not quite in the way i thought i would as soon as vuk nedic stowed away the kram the kidskin gloves came off and likewise disappeared after that we didnt seem to have anything else to say to each other the vlach departed i couldnt help wondering if the skin from which his jacket was made came from anybody he knew your majesty zogu the wizard bowed before me i hope my little preparation gave ah satisfaction last night he was bold enough to tip me a wink im not complaining i said dryly max coughed once or twice zogus clever eyes slid toward him for a moment did the wizard know my aidedecamp had shared the bounty more to the point did zogu know what a good idea keeping his mouth shut was i suspected he did mages who blab only encourage their clients to turn other mages loose on them im glad you were pleased he said now if you were then i take it you summoned me for some other reason you might say so i told him you will have heard the kingdom has gone to war with belagora i think everyone in peshkepiia will have heard it by now zogu replied it will not hurt your name in this kingdom shqipetari are always at war with vlachs whether they have fancy proclamations or not but what has this got to do with me the mountains in these parts are full of dragons i said i havent been north to the belagoran border but i assume its the same up there am i right i should say you are your majesty zogu said and so and so there will be columns of belagoran soldiers marching through those mountains i said dragons might find columns of soldiers tasty any which way can you use your art to make sure they find columns of belagoran soldiers especially tasty he didnt answer right away instead he cocked his head to one side studying me you dont think small do you your majesty he said at last i wouldnt be a king if i did i said which wasi hopedtruer than he knew can you do this not right here in the throne room zogu said ill need a dragon scale and a belagoran uniform even to begin the spell compelling dragons is a dangerous business no one does it without the greatest need hardly anyone gets the chance to do it more than once coaxing them is commonly wiser you will know your own business best im sure i said but may i ask you a couple of questions before you go about it zogu smiled you are the king how can i say no easily enough i suspect i said which made the smile wider if you work this magic dragons will look to columns of belagoran soldiers on the far side of the border not just on ours certainly your majesty the sorcerer said yes indeedamusement or perhaps deviltry danced in his dark eyes i presume that doesnt disappoint you not a bit north and south east and west not a bit i answered the belagorans are bad neighbors one way to make a bad neighbor leave you alone is to convince him youre a worse one which reminds medo you suppose you can get your hands on a vlachian uniform too now zogu laughed out loud i think i might be able to do that yes but before i got too happy he went on most of the border with vlachia is swamp country not mountains you wont see dragons so often in those western parts too bad i said and then could you make some arrangement with the leeches maybe they ought to be fond of vlachslike calls to like after all zogu didnt get itand then all at once he did as he wagged a forefinger at me he made a choking noise that said he was holding in more than he was letting out he bowed very low ah your majesty surely the imp of trouble dwells in your heart surely max murmured in back of me i couldnt even tread on his toes the indignities a king must put up with sometimes one matter we have not discussed your majesty zogu said the price what i drew myself up straight on my rickety throne you would not undertake this as a patriotic duty to your kingdom by the look in zogus eye if i wanted somebody to undertake something i should talk to an undertakerand i should talk to him about my own funeral as long as i was there your majesty he said in a voice all silky with danger wizards have to eat no less than other men put your feathers down max advised him hes joking was i had i been i couldnt very well call my aidedecamp a liar not without starting an unseemly row name your price magical sir i said to zogu and well see how loud i scream zogu didnt answer right away his calculations i daresay were twofold how much the magic would really cost him and how much the traffic would bear i the traffic waited apprehensively once hed added up the numbers he did name his price i screamed loud enough to bring not only skander but half a dozen lesser flunkies to the throne room on the run i hadnt thought i could hit that high note without being treated the way poor rexhep was some of the servitors had paused to snatch up implements of mayhem before they got there shqipetari are always ready for brawls sometimes if they cant find one theyll start one for the sport of it skander looked around wildlyfor spilled blood i believe are you all right your majesty he panted i could be worse i said the only place im wounded is in the pocketbook this optimisti scowled at zoguthinks i bleed gold ah skander paused to digest that by his expression he didnt find it especially digestible your majesty hasan odd way of haggling thank you i said he blinked one more time if you cant confound them confuse them he and the other servitors withdrewin confusion i nodded to zogu where were we i believe we were trying to cheat each other the wizard was refreshingly frank what price would you consider reasonable your majesty about a quarter of yours i answered i see zogu bowed well if i were to scream now it would only upset your servants twice in the space of a few minutes and for no good purpose you may however take the thought for the deed try another price then i said try one that doesnt make me want to shriek he did i opened my mouth again melodramatically but i confess silently max coughed max always thinks i overact this from the greatest ham not sitting on a dinner plate no one gets the respect he deserves zogu appreciated my performance and he was the intended audience mirth sparked in his eyes your majesty is not the common sort of king he said something of which for one reason or another i was often accused during my reign i did my best to look regally severe and with how many kings have you consorted i asked im not interested in consorting with them by the way zogu said it he could have had tea with monarchs every day if he cared to he went on to explain why he didnt the king of belagora is a bore and the king of vlachia is a boor you left out the king of lokris i said excuse me you are correct the king of lokris isa lokrian i shall say no more and zogu didnt not about that shqipetari love lokrians even more than lokrians love shqipetari you think it couldnt be done well i thought so too we eventually settled on a price that im sure made both of us want to scream the proof of a hardfought bargain then we started haggling all over again over how much zogu should get before he cast his spell and how much should wait till word of its effectiveness came back to peshkepiia not surprisingly he wanted to get it all in advance just as not surprisingly i didnt want to give it to him that way reaching an agreement there that dissatisfied us both also took its own sweet time nothing in the nekemte peninsula happens as fast as a civilized person or even a narbonese wishes it would you haggle you have coffee you have spirits you have little cakes or possibly fried mutton on skewers you smoke a pipe in schlepsig by eliphalets purse a price is a price you pay it or your dont and you go on either way hereabouts a price is negotiable hereabouts everything is negotiable except a blood feuda blood feud is serious business and the dickering is as important as the price you finally settle on to a schlepsigian or any other sensible person this all seems utterly mad i had to remind myself again and again that i was not a schlepsigian i was prince halim eddin and i was used to haggling for the fun of it if i hadnt done those tours in the hassockian army and if i hadnt spent more time than i ever wanted in the nekemte peninsula with outfits like dooger and carks and if i werent a damned fine actor max to the contrary notwithstanding i never could have brought it off seeing the royal treasury again as i got the money to give zogu his first installment helped cheer me up taking the money out of it didnt but there was still plenty left i consoled myself with that zogu no doubt consoled himself with what i gave him not an earthshaking day perhapsof which there are too many in literal truth in those partsbut a right royal one even so and a right royal night as well once again max contrived to leave his room seemingly locked from the inside and to find himself a waiting place in the royal bedchamber i ordered another halfdozen girls brought from the harem and hoped zogus spell wouldnt ah let me down when rexhep brought the girls they were bubbly and giggly and eager from which i concluded that lutzi and maja and bjeshka and varri and zalli and shkoza you seei remember them all had given me a good report the eunuch looked as if he loathed me more than ever from which i concluded the same thing poor fellow i had a hard time blaming him after a few highpitched grumbles he went on his none too merry way i closed the door behind shinasi and urani and xharmi and flisni and kalla and molle yes i remember them too and barred it and now my sweets the night is ours i said they were polite i was the king after all still their newly unveiled faces fell i think it was xharmi who got up the nerve to ask but your majesty where is the thunderbolt we heard so much about lutzi and maja andwell you know the rest by nowhadnt given just me a good report then oh well i dont suppose i should have expected anything different you will recall that thunderbolt in hassocki is yildirim i went to the closet and opened the door will you join us captain i said sweetly your presenceamong other thingshas been requested join us max did as he had been the night before he was dressed or undressed for the occasion the girls exclaimed in admiration or apprehension or possibly both at once max looked as smug as a man with a vinegar phiz can well i wont bore you with the details and if the details of such things dont bore you im sure you can invent your own theyll probably be even juicier than what went on while the two of us and the six of thembut i wasnt going to bore you with that was i suffice to say that if zogus sorcery against the belagorans worked half so well the dragons would devour every man wearing that uniform by the morning after he launched that spell and speaking of devouringbut no thats one of those details im afraid by the timea very pleasantly long timemax and i couldnt hold up our end of the bargain any more everyone in that bedchamber was happy enough or maybe a little more than happy enough i was afraid they were fooling us said mollei think it was molle anyway but no they meant it by the way she sighed she was glad to be mollified too maybe even kings who follow the two prophets should be allowed harems it might give them something to do besides starting wars but then considering how many the hassockian atabegs have started and considering that id just started one myself it might not too what a shame xv there are people who believe eliphalet and zibeon personally presided over the discovery of crystallography quite a few of them work for consolidated crystal me i dont belong to that school in case you hadnt noticed i also cant stand scribes yes my story deserved to be in the journalsdo you think i became king of shqiperi just for the sake of the shqipetari but i didnt need all the trouble the story got me scribes in the nekemte peninsula like scribes everywhere are out for the splashiest stories they can find and so the sensationstealers whod followed me from fushekuqe to peshkepiia wrote the loudest gaudiest reports of my coronation that they could for them my story was a found feast you might say they sent their blitherings off to their journals which duly ran them nothing else nearly so interesting was coming out of the nekemte peninsula just then if i do say so myself why am i so unhappy you ask didnt i want my namewell halim eddins nameon everyones lips almost everyones almost but not quite the trouble was before long the story of halim eddins coronation got to vyzance the hassocki are backward but they arent that backward consolidated crystal has offices in vyzance consolidated crystal has offices everywhere i sometimes think that if wizards ever figure out how to master apportation and let men rise to the moon the first travelers there will walk over to a cc office so a crystallographer can send word back to a waiting world in vyzance then word of the coronation naturally came to the hassockian atabeg why couldnt he have been disporting himself with his harem when it did and i supposed word of the coronation also reached the authentic the veritable the actual the genuine prince halim eddin who was sitting by the silver trumpetfor such they style the main harbor of vyzanceinnocently smoking his long picturesque hassockistyle pipe i can imagine the scene in spite of the chaos gripping the hassockian empire on account of the nekemte wars in spite of everything else that was wrong with the empirea subject on which i could write volumes and many men havethe whole business must have seemed something past a joke to the atabeg he would have sent a message to the real prince halim eddin north and south east and west what the demon are you doing in shqiperi and the real halim eddin would have sent a message back north and south east and west your most sublime and magnificent awfulness the last time i looked i was right here as far as i can tell i still am and the hassockian atabeg would have said well those schlepsigian and narbonese and torinan journaliststo say nothing of bob the halfwitted albioneseall put you in shqiperi if bob has me there thats the best proof in the world that im really here halim eddin would have replied now the hassockian atabeg is not the brightest and most perceptive of men eliphalet knows thats so but even he would perceive that his nephew had advanced an argument of weight he would have said why dont i come over to your little palace and have a look at you for myself come ahead your most supreme and appalling splendor halim eddin would have told him if you discover that im not here i will confess to being very surprised and the hassockian atabeg would have gone to look and i daresay he would have seen the authentic the veritable the actual the genuine prince halim eddin with his very own eyes they might even have innocently smoked together a couple of long picturesque hassockistyle pipes in due course the atabeg would have returned to the imperial palace in vyzance and in due course just how due the course depending on the precise mix those long picturesque hassockistyle pipes were charged with he would have issued a statement of his own saying no one in vyzance had thought at all about sending prince halim eddinor any other hassocki princeto shqiperi since neither prince halim eddin nor any other hassocki prince was in shqiperi no such worthy could possibly have become king of shqiperi the news to the contrary then had to rest on an error and it was probably bobs fault for getting things wrong you will please understand i was not in vyzance while all this was going on i was in beautiful eliphalet no picturesque eliphalet and zibeon no peshkepiia much more pleasantly occupied i cannot prove how the hassockian atabeg came to make his unfortunate statement i can only imagine as i say and reconstruct but i can prove that he did make the statement and i can prove it was unfortunate for me worse luck on the third day of my reign i appointed captain yildirim minister for special affairs the title seemed fitting to us both aside from a round dozena very nicely round dozenof the harem girls we were the only ones who knew just why it fit so well to the outside world it was just one of those mostly meaningless handles by which officials so often come to be known i also announced i would name the rest of my cabinet the following week alas the full administration of the kingdom of shqiperi under the rule of that brilliant and enlightened potentate king halim eddin iotherwise otto of schlepsigwill never be known im sure it would have performed better than any has since in that unhappy realm im just as sure it could scarcely have performed worse having made the initial appointment then i sent the intrepid minister for special affairs out to wander through peshkepiia and learn what he could in the bazaar and the fortress be inconspicuous i told him for some reason or other he chose that moment to suffer one of his coughing fits i threw my hands in the air some people will insist on being unreasonable oh all right i said be as inconspicuous as a sixfooteight man in a fancy uniform can be then yes your majesty the intrepid minister for special affairs captain yildirimotherwise max of wittenodded in somber satisfaction not at all the sort hed shown the past two nights always nice to get orders i have some hope of following heh i said and then heh heh as if you ever cared about following orders i do he said with dignity if im not going to follow an order i want to have fun not following it if he hadnt been having about as much fun as a man could without falling over dead right afterwards he disguised it very well but then max was always good at disguising enjoyment even from himself just go i said come back in the afternoon and tell me what you hear while he was going up and down in the city doing his job skander announced a caller who surprised me count rappaport from the dual monarchy send him in by all means send him in i said what do you suppose he wants something that will do him good skander replied whether it will do shqiperi any good is bound to be a different question he might have made a good foreign minister being able to see the obvious put him quite a few lengths ahead of several men holding the post in older larger kingdoms into the throne room strode count rappaport the phalanx of medals on his narrow chest outshone the i admit it tawdry show of finery wed been able to arrange on short notice the dual monarchy had centuries of practice at that kind of thing they were good at it it is i often think the only thing they were good at count rappaport bowed your majesty he said i thought you didnt believe in me i replied your de facto majesty he said with legalistic precision and bowed again some of the metalwork pinned to his shirtfront clanked since youve declared war on belagora i find myself willing to be agnostic at any rate our interests may march in the same direction youre trying to tell me you want my interest to march with yours i said his narrow mouth got narrower they didnt much like obvious truths in the dual monarchy they had reason not to like them too for one most obvious truth was that the dual monarchy had no business stumbling on into the modern era but he knew the right words to say here we are no more enamored of belagora than you are and we do not love vlachia either how dangerous is vuk nedic when the moon comes full i murmured an interesting question said count rappaport did you try to cross his palm with silver is rumor true yes your excellency it is i told him how the vlach handled his money with kid gloves well well said the nobleman from the dual monarchy i still have no idea who you are your majesty my opinion remains the same you are no more halim eddin than my grandmothers cat is but i do believe shqiperi and the dual monarchy can do business all the same we have enemies in common and the enemy of my enemy is is like as not another enemy for different reasons i thought thats how it works in the nekemte peninsula anyhow i almost laughed out loud there on my foilwrapped throne barisha of belagora and vuk nedic of vlachia were sure i was halim eddin sent from vyzance to rule shqiperi yes they were sure i was the genuine article and they hated me on sight but though count rappaport knew i was a frauddamn himhe was ready to act as if i were authentic and to help me poke the vlachian kingdoms in the eye even for this part of the world that struck me as perverse which didnt mean i wouldnt take advantage of it if i could perversions can be enjoyable they wouldnt be so popular if they couldnt a couple of nights with the harem girls and the redoubtable minister of special affairs had proved remarkably instructive on that score count rappaport was offering a different pleasure but not one to be despised on that account the enemy of my enemy i said can share his short ribs with pepper sauce count rappaportsmiled maxcaptain yildirimmy new minister for special affairsthe swordswallowermy old friendcame back to the palace looking like a man whod seen a ghost his own ghost now max is not one of the more gleefullooking people in the world he never has been he never will be even when hes happy he mostly seems sad when hes sad he seems appalled and when hes appalled when hes appalled he looks a lot more cheerful than he did just then he was doing his best not to seem horrified too the way a man whos just lost an arm will tell you its only a flesh wound the arm is still gone maxs best was miles from being good enough he staggered into the throne room a few minutes after count rappaport departed could we speak in your chambers your majesty he sounded as bad as he looked which is saying something skander saw and heard it too shall i send for a healer your majesty he asked i had the feeling a shqipetari healer does to health what a shqipetari cook does to food i also had the feeling i needed to hear what max had to say so i told skander maybe later before turning back to the minister for special affairs and saying of course your excellency come with me even in his state of poleaxed dismay max raised an eyebrow at that hed never been your excellency in his life before im sure of that you deadbeat son of a whore was much more his usual style and mine oh yesand mine but i was learning how to play the king we chased a sweeper out of my bedchamber i barred the door behind us then i said well what is it even behind a closed door i spoke hassocki not schlepsigian the sound of my voice might get out into the hallway even if words didnt i max paused to try to gather himselfwithout much luck im afraid i handed him a jug of plum brandy he didnt bother flicking away a drop before he drank his throat worked worked overtime in fact after hed poured down a good slug he seemed a new man the new man wobbled a bit on his pins but you cant have everything i went down to the consolidated crystal office to see what i could find out he said a lot of the scribes dont know i can understand em so they just blather away like nobodys business most scribes blather away regardless of whether anybody understands them but thats a different story good thinking i told max might as well find out how the journals are looking at us until the reviews come in who knows how the show will do so i was mooching around listening to all their foolishness but then a message came in instead of going out max paused portentously a message from vyzance oh i said a ship can sail along happy as you please the weatherworker filling the sails with wind everything calm everything sereneand if it tears out its belly on a rock lurking just under the surface everybody on board will drown and it will strike all the harder because it was going so well before i had to gather myself to get out more than the one word which is not like me at all whatwhat did it say what would you expect a message from vyzance to say max answered it says the atabegs bloody surprised to find out his nephews king of shqiperi when good old halim eddins really back there being useless the way a proper hassocki prince is supposed to and what do you think about that good old halim eddin the message was for essad pasha i asked max nodded then reached for the jug of brandy again i grabbed it firsti needed it too once i got a healthy snort inside me i felt better or at least number i pointed an accusing finger at my minister for special affairs why didnt you waylay the messenger i tried he said morosely little bastard gave me the slip its his town and it isnt mine what are we going to do o sage of the age i mean besides getting our heads cut off and spears rammed up our backsides probably not in that order i had to think fast i took another slug of brandy maybe it would lubricate my wits if it didnt maybe i wouldnt care something worked in there its a lie i told max whats a lie that the atabeg sent the message that essad pashas cursed well got it dont i wish it was your majesty max made my title positively poisonous i was there i tell you yes yes i said impatiently theres a real message but its a real lie too in a pigs posterior max said youre as much a hassocki prince as i am a camel the way youve been humping the last two nights you might be i said shut up and listen to me the hassockian atabeg has to deny that im really his nepheweven though i am of course oh yes of course max gives the most disagreeable agreement ive ever known i ignored him its not easy but i have practice he has to deny that im halim eddin what just happened to the hassockian empire it just got the snot kicked out of it in the nekemte wars if it hadnt shqiperi wouldnt be a kingdom it would still be a hassocki province right i suppose so max said but whats that got to do with i went right on ignoring him brandy helps listen i tell you the hassocki tried to sneak a fast one past their neighbors and the great powers by sending me here im their stalking horse im the key to their holding on to influence in the eastern part of the nekemte peninsula youre out of your mind max said i knew it all along you really are youre just jealous i said which had the distinct virtue of making him shut up that accomplished i went on what other choice have we got weve jumped on the dragonwe cant let go of its ears now of course we cant dragons havent got ears and you havent got any brains this is not the time to revoke my poetic license you know what i mean i said what do we do if this crystal message from vyzance isnt a stinking lie eh do we paste on sheepish grins and go sorry we were just playing a little joke on you people i guess well be running along now dont i wish max exclaimed id love to only thing is i dont think essad pashas laughing right now i didnt think so either essad pasha is one of those people who will laugh till the tears come while hes watching his enemies beards burn after hes soaked them in oil and touched a match to them his sense of humor does go that far when it comes to seeing a joke on himself thoughif you want to live to spend any of the money in the treasury if you dont want to wind up envying rexhep whats the eunuch got to do with it max broke in well for one thing if they find out were just a couple of performers from schlepsig they may want to cut our balls off on general principles i said but they may not need general principles not when theyve got specific ones how many shqipetari maidens have you debauched the past two nights debauched my left one they loved every minute of it but max looked worried about his left one and his right one too to the shqipetari that only makes things worse they arent supposed to enjoy it here youre not supposed to enjoy anything here except the cursed blood feuds now that i think on things that made essad pasha a pretty fair governor for shqiperi didnt it i had more urgent worries just then or i would have seen it sooner i went on so that message has to be a lie the best thing we can do is make everyone think it is the worst we can do is buy some time time to get out of here max said eliphalets beard it is time to get out of here dont talk about eliphalet even in hassocki i told him that proved good advice because a moment later someone knocked on the door max jumped like a cornered swordswallower pretending to be an aidedecamp to a cornered acrobat pretending to be a king quite a bit like that in fact as calmly as he could the cornered actor pretending to be a king opened the door there stood skander not pretending to be a majordomoand not even knowing he was cornering us yes i saidregally excuse me your majesty but his excellency essad pasha is here he would like to see you for a moment skander said max didnt jump again but he definitely twitched skander already suspected my minister for special affairs of being in two places at once now max seemed not to want to be any place at all i felt a certain sympathy for that i didnt much want to be any place in peshkepiia myself but if i had to be any place in peshkepiia the palace was the best one tell his excellency i will meet him in the throne room in a quarter of an hour i said skander bowed and scurried away youd be surprised how much brandy you can drink in fifteen minutes or maybe you wouldnt in which case the two prophets have mercy on your liver at the appointed time i sat myself down on the cheap tawdry throne the twoheaded shqipetari eagle made in albion hung on the wall in back of me looking symbolic or absurd depending on your attitude toward such things behind me and to the left of the throne stood the mostly faithful max otherwise captain yildirim otherwise my new minister for special affairs if max swayed as he stood there if my eyes were glassy you can blame the fifteen minutes just past and if max seemed steady enough if i looked the way i usually dowell you can blame a lot of other sessions with a lot of other jugs and bottles in which case the two prophets have mercy on our livers his excellency essad pasha skander cried as if the kingdom of shqiperi were as venerable as albion or the dual monarchy in stumped the man who was the former military governor of shqiperi the man whod decided shqiperi needed a king the man whod decided he knew exactly which king shqiperi needed and the man whod thought hed got the king hed decided on made quite a procession for one fellow didnt he he stopped at the prescribed distance from the throne he bowed the prescribed bow your majesty he said the prescribed phrase except he didnt say your majesty he said your majesty he admitted the possibility of doubt that i was his majesty doubt is not a good thing doubt subverts faith if you dont have faith in me on this score ask a priest it doesnt matter whether hes a sedate eliphilatelist a wildeyed zibeonite or a votary of the quadrate god he will tell you the same thing doubt does subvert faith if you could find a priest who serves the old aenean gods nowadays he would tell you the same thing too but you cant find one of those priests any more theyre as extinct as unicorns or is it virgins doubt has subverted their faith your excellency i said i didnt sound like a man who had doubts well i daresay the brandy helped what brings you here today your excellency like i didnt know scribes your majesty there it was again that cursed question mark hanging in the air and if essad pasha didnt get his punctuation revised max and i might end up hanging in the air tooby our necks or perhaps in some fashion even less pleasant than that yes i said as portentously as a sozzled sovereign could i didnt doubt that i was king halim eddinor if i did no one else ever knew it essad pasha gathered himself i was glad to see he needed to gather himself he wasnt sure i was halim eddin but he wasnt sure i wasnt halim eddin either good that gave me something to work with after coughing a couple of times which made me stare at him to see if hed suddenly turned tall and lean he hadnt he said your majesty i have received a peculiar a most peculiar report from the offices of consolidated crystal have you i said indifferentlyor maybe i was just drunk well what report is this he sounded hesitant he sounded apologeticbetter that than sounding apoplectic i suppose but i heard from him what id already heard from max that the hassockian atabeg eliphalet smite his scrawny arse with boils had the infernal gall to deny that i was the authentic prince halim eddin just because i wasnt oh that i said more indifferently still well werent you expecting that your majesty now essad pasha sounded like he doubted which end was up and unlike some people in the throne room i could name he wasnt even pieeyedor i dont think he was i dont understand your majesty obviously i piled on the scorn the way shqipetari cooks pile on the grease it worked too i could all but hear the gears grinding inside essad pashas head an impostor who knew hed been found out should have trembled like an aspen leaf in fall i didnt act the way a terrified fraud should have i acted every inch a king or at least a prince perhaps your majesty would be gracious enough to explain cautious wasnt a bad way for essad pasha to sound either perhaps he would i dont think id ever talked about myself in the third person before its even more fun than the royal we perhaps he wouldnt have to if he were served by men who could see past the end of their nose behind me max coughed well it might have been the twoheaded eagle on the wall but i suspected the doubtableto say nothing of redoubtablecaptain yildirim essad pasha looked wounded he wouldnt have bothered with an expression like that for a man he didnt believe in he would have gone about wounding the pretender instead north and south east and west my ignorance is wide as the sky deep as the sea black as blackest midnight he said would your majesty grant his slave the boon of enlightenment when a hassocki goes all poetical on you hes either being insulting or youve got him on the run essad pasha wasnt being insulting i smiledto myself then i fed him the same farrago of nonsense about why the atabeg couldnt publicly admit i was who i was that id rammed down maxs throat max did what any normal human being would do he gagged essad pasha swallowed the whole thing he didnt even choke he must have been eating shqipetari cooking for a long time i see your majesty he breathed when i was through indeed that makes most excellent good sense yes maybe it was the twoheaded eagle that coughed when i looked back at max he wasnt doing it i knew what he was thinking though that it made no sense at all i was thinking the same thing then again in the nekemte peninsula things that make no sense often prove perfectly sensible while what would be sensible anywhere else turns out to be the height of folly an actor in a downattheheels circus would be most unlikely to claim the crown of albion for instance he would be even less likely to find it plopped on his head i graciously inclined my head to essad pasha now that you see where the truth liesand the truth was lying as hard as it could believe you me it wasperhaps you will be so kind as to take it back to your junior officers to avoid any unfortunate outbreaks of excessive zeal to keep them from coming over here and murdering me i meant i happen to think it sounded much nicer the way i put it essad pasha bowed as your majesty commands so shall it be he did a smart aboutturn and marched out of the throne room i looked down at my hands i felt like a successful surgeon and so i was id just amputated essad pashas question mark and without even numbing him beforehand my hats off to you your majesty max said may eliphalet beshrew me if he hadnt doffed it when i looked around if a man knows the truth when he hears it he will do what is right i said which sounded good and had nothing to do with anything essad pasha couldnt tell the truth from saltwater taffy as for doing what was righthe was doing what i wanted which was even better having removed or at least reduced essad pashas inflamed interrogative i thought the world was my oyster and maybe it was but i forgot something essential oysters dont keep no sooner had essad pasha departed than skander bowed to me and said your majesty a woman wishes to appeal her sentence as a witch oh she does does she i wasnt so sure that sounded appealing to me can she do that skander shrugged it is for you to decide you are the king so i was for the first time i wondered if i wanted to be romping through the harem was fun declaring war on belagora was fun too so was arranging things so the mountain dragons decided belagoran soldiers made even better snacks than sheep to say nothing of shepherds but hearing a possibleprobably a probablewitchs appeal it sounded much too much like work worse it sounded like boring work i didnt want to admit that to skander i didnt much want to admit it to myself either not wanting to admit it i asked the majordomo what is the shqipetari custom i am not of your bloodeliphalet be praisedand i do not wish to offend by accident or ignorance he only shrugged again we have not had a king for many many years the custom is what your majesty chooses to make it once your majesty makes it we will uphold it with all our might what will they do with the woman if i dont hear her appeal i asked burn her i suppose or else stone her skander said indifferently give her what she deserves anyhow i see and i did so much for skanders faith in her innocence maybe i could enlighten the shqipetari by all appearances they needed it fetch her in i will hear her i declared in ringing tones before you do though call zogu the wizard to the palace max put in just on the off chance she is what everybody thinks she is i thought that sentiment shockingly illiberal skander evidently thought it sensible he bowed first to me then to my minister for special affairs yes your majesty yes your excellency he hurried away that peshkepiia was a small town had its advantages no more than a quarter of an hour later zogu stood before me at your service your majesty he said which mangy trull has decided to try her luck with you he didnt seem to have much faith in her innocence either did he i didnt hear who she was i confessed skander she is called shenkolle your majesty he pronounced the name with fastidious distaste almost as if he were rexhep zogu laughed and laughed and she says shes not a witch next youll tell me the joyhouse girls arent whores she is entitled to her appeal i said stiffly zogu thought that was funnier yet i nodded to skander bring her in ill listen to what she has to say yes your majesty he sighed but he obeyed when i got a look at shenkolle my first thought was she sure looks like a witch she was old she was bent she was homely she had a long nose and a sharp chin with a wart on it if she hadnt been conjured straight from the pages of hans eliphalet andersen and the grim brethren she should have been do you speak hassocki i asked her oh yes your majesty she didnt sound like a witch she sounded the way you wish the girl of your dreams sounded she turned your blood to sparkling wine zogu was immune to thatpurr i dont know how but he was if i hadnt believed he was a strong wizard before i would have now what do they say you were up to this time you old shedevil he asked shenkolle i didnt do anything your majesty she ignored zogu and concentrated on me listening to her i would have been puttywell perhaps something than stiffer than puttyin her hands she went on i am innocent i am nothing but a poor woman wronged youre the richest poor woman in peshkepiia thats dead certain zogu said how many big fat silver shekels from vespucciland did you bury in your garden week before last why you sneaky old crow shenkolle screeched when she wasnt talking to me or maybe when she was angry she sounded the way she looked then her voicemagicallysoftened again she batted her redtracked eyes at me its a lie a foul evil lie your majesty when she spoke directly to me i believed well no it wasnt quite that when she spoke directly to me i didnt care whether she was telling the truth or not any more than i cared that she looked like my grannys wicked cousin i glanced over at max by the way he was staring at shenkolle shed ensnared him too but not zogu he laughed some more by all the signs he was having the time of his life prove youre not a liar shenkolle he said swear by the quadrate god that youre telling the truth come onyou can do it north and south east and west i am telling the truth she tried i watched her try the words wouldnt come her eyes snapped with fury her face turned as red as a drunkards nose but the words would not come all she could get out was have mercy your majesty she still sounded as seductive as ever but if failing to take the oath didnt break the spell it did dent it max sighed a sad little noise that was just how i felt i asked her do you really have those shekels in your garden why yes your majesty she said sweetly though the glare she sent zogu was anything but sweet then she remembered she had to aim at me do you want them if you do of course they are yours anything you want of me is yours even after looking at her and even after two wild nights in the harem the sheer promise in her voice tempted me toi dont know what but with her charm dented i was able to say i dont want them for myself if you pay them to the people you wronged will it buy you forgiveness before she could answer i turned to the majordomo and asked what do you think skander how much silver do we speak of skander asked zogu told him shenkolle screeched which had to mean zogu knew what he was talking about she sounded like a sawblade biting into a nail skander considered that much silver would settle a blood feud up in the mountains it should be enough to atone for her crimes here settling is better than slayingmost of the time anyway all right then i pointed to shenkolle those shekelsall of themto your accusers today will buy your lifethis once if you come before me again though nothing will save you do you understand she nodded do you swear you will pay the price today then i asked north and south east and west i will pay it today she had no trouble with that oath she seemed surprised zogu smiled to himself i sent shenkolle away if she doesnt i said to zogu dont worry your majesty the wizard said she will and she did xvi thethi dashmani shala ragova kiri toplana yes my minister for special affairs and i stayed busy that third night and either zogu was an even better wizard than he claimed to be or we were even better men than we thought ourselves to be for we had no trouble keeping up our end of the bargain you might say from certain encounters i have had since i am inclined to give the wizardry at least some of the credit max will tell you he would have done as well if wed never heard of zogu but then max will tell you any number of things some of them almost anyone can believe without seriously endangering himself others however should be heard only after consulting a physician and are definitely unsafe for invalids and those in delicate health at last after our strenuous efforts to establish friendly relations with the locals were crowned with success i sent the girls back to the harem once skander and rexhep led them down the hallway i let max out of the closet again you see i told him you can get away with anything as long as you put up a bold enough front were not dead yet so you must be right he answered i wouldnt have believed it when the atabeg said you werent who you said you were i thought for sure theyd tear us to pieces i shrugged essad pasha doesnt dare believe im not halim eddin if he did he would have to believe he was a fool nobody wants to do that even so were not out of the woods max said some of essad pashas officers may decide hes a fool whether he thinks so or not and if they do he made a horrid gurgling noise how can you sound so gloomy after what weve just been doing i asked id like to stay able to do it max said you were the one who talked about losing bits and pieces of ourselves if things went wrong nothing will go wrong i assured him youll see in the morning why dont you head back to your room and get some sleep after tonight after the last three nights you ought to sleep like a babya tall baby but a baby even so i dont want to sleep like a baby piddling in the bed and spitting up thanks but id rather not i shoved him out the door go on youre lucky im a kind and merciful king or id give you what you deserve for that everything will be fine in the morning youll find out but everything wasnt fine in the morning i found out and i very nearly was found out it happened like this trouble usually strikes at the most inconvenient times when youve shaved half your face or just stepped out of the tub or told her that of course you werent married here though everything seemed fine id drunk my coffee id eaten my fried mush i thought i was ready to park my fundament on the throne again and act royal i even thought i was getting pretty good at it skander came up to me and bowed excuse me your majesty but colonel kemal and major mustafa are here to see you are they i said innocently i dont know if id convinced max everything was fine max is not easy to convince of such things i do know id convinced myself well id be glad to see them there i sat on the throne happy and kingly max standing a step back and to the left where he belonged there they came two of essad pashas officers in dustbrown uniforms neither of them had missed a meal any time lately major mustafa had a big black mustache colonel kemal had an even bigger gray one major mustafas fez and shoulder straps had one jewel colonel kemals had three they didnt bow they didnt say your majesty they just looked at me not quite as if theyd found half of me in their apple but as if theyd like to give me to a shqipetari cook for some intimate acquaintance with hot grease i did my best not to notice to tell you the truth i didnt want to notice i said gentlemen its good that youre herewhich only shows how much i knew tell me your specialties ill want to get the best use out of you when the fighting with belagora heats up they just kept staring at me after a little while i started not to like that very much at last major mustafa said how can you be who you say you are when the atabeg says you arent who you say you are i waited for max to cough he didnt bother he evidently figured i could see this was trouble all by myself max is so trusting you must not have heard i explained that to essad pasha just yesterday i told the officers and went through my song and dance again really i should have had an orchestra accompanying me i finished so you see all this silly fuss should die down in a few days and waited for the applause from my adoring audience only it wasnt adoring if the major and the colonel were carrying rotten rutabagas they would have thrown them since they didnt they contented themselves with shaking their heads they were out of synch with each other which struck me as most unmilitary major mustafa said we did hear that yesterday we dont believe it colonel kemal said the hassockian atabeg would never sully himself by telling a lie mustafa declared i almost had a laughing fit right there on the throne there hasnt been a hassockian atabeg for the past five hundred years who wasnt a lying reptile its essential for living long enough to get halfway good at the job and i couldnt tell them so if i did they would decide i was insulting their sovereign and i couldnt possibly be the lying reptiles nephew i was plainly going to have to be a lying reptile myself well if working for dooger and cark prepared me for anything it prepared me for that i rose from the throne a smile still on my face gentlemen i have to tell you you are mistaken i said or at least right for the wrong reasons lets talk about it shall we captain yildirim why dont you come along with us yes your majesty max had to be wondering if i wanted him to murder the two hassocki i dont blame him i was wondering the same thing myself we ambled through the palace i went on explaining how i really was halim eddin and always had been even as a small child although the lying reptile in vyzance whom i couldnt call a lying reptile couldnt admit it colonel kemal and major mustafa went on not believing me i started to get angry though i didnt let it show anyone would have thought from their attitude that i was deliberately lying to them in due course we reached the front entrance the soldiers standing guard there sprang to stiff attention whoever was in charge of them seemed imperfectly trustful of my popularity hed posted a couple of squads worth of men there to protect me from my beloved people at ease i told them yes your majesty they chorused and relaxed from their brace they thought i was king of shqiperi and if they didmen i said arrest these officers they plot to remove me from the throne it was as easy as that the soldiers seized colonel kemal and major mustafa after a moments shocked paralysis the officers raised a horrible fuss it did them exactly no good a king outtrumped a major and a colonel put together what shall we do with em your majesty a sergeant asked once the loyal dimwits uh soldiers had laid hold of kemal and mustafa take them to the dungeons i said grandly kemal and mustafa cursed and moaned even louder than they had before i paid no attention to them to my vast relief neither did the palace guards uh your majesty where are the dungeons the sergeant asked a reasonable question under the circumstances i dont know i admitted theyre in there somewhere i supposehow can you have a palace if you dont have dungeonsbut i just got here myself i havent found em yet i went back to the doorway and shouted down the hall skander yes your majesty i dont know how he kept appearing out of nowhere like that but he did maybe zogu had something to do with it we have a couple of gentlemen here who require incarceration i said colonel kemal and major mustafa vehemently denied it skander didnt listen to them either noisy arent they i remarked would you be so kind as to show the soldiers to the dungeons so they can lock these rascals up i hope the doors are thickthat way their racket wont bother anyone else the doors are very thick indeed your majesty skander said he nodded to the sergeant come this way if you please mustafa and kemal did their best not to go that way their best wasnt good enough i dont believe the soldiers did anything in persuading them that wouldnt heal in a few days all the palace guards trooped along with the loud boisterous officers the more kemal and mustafa tried to fight the more men joined in to make sure they couldnt max and i stood by ourselves at the entrance well i said brightly that was interesting theres one word max said he used several others most of which would set the page on fire if i tried to write them down did i get out of it or not i asked him did i get away with it or not he didnt want to say i had but he couldnt very well say i hadnt youve got the balls of a burglar was what he did say and if you dont watch out youll get em chopped off just like rexhep oh rubbish i said and hoped like anything it was when the guardsmen came back it was without colonel kemal and major mustafa the sergeant didnt look happy whoever designed those dungeons didnt know what he was doing no dripping water no bad smellsi didnt see a single rat north and south east and west there are hardly any cockroaches even theyll have to do for now i said later on maybe well fix up something properly nasty i should hope so he said back in vyzance now youll be used to doing it right filth vermin water gloom easy access for the torturersthey dont fool around back there if i ever did decide to renovate my dungeons here was a man with ideas i had an idea of my own it turned out not to be a good idea but i couldnt know that when i had it come with me i said to max the people of peshkepiia should get to know us lets go to the market square and see them at their earnest endeavors yes lets watch the quaint natives was what it boiled down to i should have known better even then shqipetari are too confounded ornery to be quaint not that a shqipetar gave me trouble oh no but im getting to that if a schlepsigian publichealth mage got a look at the market square in peshkepiia he would close it down on the spot fall over dead from a fit of apoplexy or more likely both flies buzzed everywhere they settled on meat and vegetables and stallkeepers and customers sewage ran in the gutters and puddled here and there which helped account for the flies consumptive beggars held out bowls and coughed on passersby another difference between civilization and shqiperi that ive already noted is people were haggling wherever you looked when i went on the road i needed a while to understand this in schlepsig there is a price that is the price the seller tells you what it is you pay or you dont this is the natural way the sensible way to do business its not the way they do business in the nekemte peninsula there is no deal in those parts without a dicker the seller would be offended if you took his first offer he would think you despised him or he would think he set his price much too low since no one ever takes a first offer his honor and his sense of his own cleverness meet no danger in shqiperi where every man usually carries as many weapons as he can afford and as many as he can wear and still walk dickering takes on a whole new dimension a bargainer will think nothing of drawing a dagger or swinging a sword or letting the flat of an axe blade crash down on a tabletop shqipetari treat a haggle like the prelude to a blood feud every now and then it is so when max and i sawand hearda knot of shouting gesticulating people in the market square we didnt think much of it not at first shqipetari shout and gesticulate as naturally as schlepsigians take orders it doesnt necessarily mean anything its just part of who they are it doesnt necessarily not mean anything either though as i was about to discover in fact max being so uncouthly tall discovered it before i did he could peer over the crowd and discover why it was a crowd i had to peer through people which is harder they refuse to go transparent when you most want them to uh your majesty we have a problem here he said what kind of problem i asked the shqipetari not only stubbornly stayed opaque but got more excited by the minute and they said it couldnt be done you know the emblem of this kingdom now max eliphalet bless his pointed little head was being opaque too i thought of the bicephalous eagle made in albion tacked up behind my makeshift throne personally no i answered but i was wrong max proceeded to point this out if that emblem were a man hed be in the middle of that crowd right now a horrid suspicion ran through me tell me anything you please o most excellent minister for special affairs anything at all but north and south east and westeven in my extremity i did remember not to swear by the two prophetstell me thats not josйdiego in there but it was or they were depending on how you look at things dooger and carks flyers went right on showing a twoheaded man even though we didnt have one in the company any more josйdiego was the one we didnt have any more the reason we didnt have himthemany more was that the two heads couldnt get along with each other not even a little bit which meant he or they didnt have an act i finally got my own glimpse of him them whatever he they whatever hadnt changed a bit since the last time i saw himthem josй the righthand head wore a full beard because he did diego was cleanshaven diego the lefthand head let his curly brown hair fall almost to his shouldersi mean shoulder because he did josй shaved his scalp just to make matters worse josй controlled their left arm and leg diego their right and not the other way around sometimes theyhecouldnt even walk because the right leg didnt know what the left leg was doing it gets worse josй was a reactionary diego was a radical josй ate meatadored it diego was a vegetarian josй liked girls diego liked boys whether they ever managed to make like lucky pierre im afraidor rather gladi cant tell you and it gets even worse than that because josйdiego saw me too actually i suspect josйdiego saw max first max is almost as noticeable as josйdiego and under some circumstances even more so and after the twoheaded man spotted max he didnt need long to spot me with him he waved to us and headed our way that was about as bad as it could get he knew we were otto of schlepsig and max of witte he didnt know we were supposed to be king halim eddin and his more or less faithful aidedecamp captain yildirim he knew we followed the two prophets josй followed them too with the fanatical devotion of most leonese diego was a freethinker neither of them knew we were affecting to reverence the quadrate god even if for different reasons they both would have been appalled giving josй and diego something to agree about was not what i had in mind what are you fellowth doing in thith prophetthforthaken plathe diego asked yeth uh yes he talked like that no he wasnt being effeminate josй spoke schlepsigian with the same lisping leonese accent josй was a lot of things starting with badtempered fool and rapidly going downhill from there but no one would ever accuse him of effeminacy max did his best to tip josйdiego off to what we were doing drawing himself up to his full heightwhich takes a lot of drawinghe spoke in severe tones have a care how you address halim eddin king of shqiperi that got both heads attention but not in the way we wanted whose leg are you pulling max josй asked im not going to write the lisp any more im just not but it was there you can hear it in your minds eye if you want to or see it in your ear ottos no more a king than i am diego added youre no king youre a cursed queen josй said i told you they didnt get along they switched from schlepsigian to leonese about then i dont really speak leonese but i do speak narbonese and torinan which are its cousins so i can follow it after a fashion diego said something rude about josйs mother which is strange since she was diegos mother too josй said something very rude about the only kind of meat diego ate diego screeched and tried to hit him josй blocked the punch the crowd watched in fascination as long as the two heads were shouting at each otheras long as josйdiego was shouting at himselfin leonese everything was fine or near enough hardly any shqipetari understand it but if and when josйdiego went back to schlepsigian all my troubles came back too even in peshkepiia which is every bit as prophetsforsaken as josйdiego said why else would he or they have ended up there quite a few people know schlepsigian the language of culture josй stamped on diegos foot that didnt do either one of them any good since they both felt it they howled the polyglot curses anyone whos done time in a circus uses josй did go back to schlepsigian and i felt like cursing him seriously otto what are you doing here he asked and then at my elbow someone spoke to me in hassocki excuse me your majesty but is this uh person bothering you may i turn into a shqipetar if it wasnt the sergeant of the guard he and his men had put mustafa and kemal away and then theyd come after me to make sure i was all right such devotion is touching it almost made me wish i really were halim eddin hesgetting there i answered tell medo you or any of your men speak schlepsigian no your majesty the sergeant said im sorry your majesty dont be i told him josйdiego gave me two suspicious stares what are you yattering about otto josй said irritably it wasnt just diego he couldnt get along with he had trouble with the whole world talk a language a thivilithed man can underthtand heth going to thcrew uth diego thaiduh said i said i wouldnt do that any more didnt i well im trying hes going to screw us to the wall there thats better and i did aim to screw them to the wall too ill tell you something elsei enjoyed doing it metaphorically much more than i would have enjoyed it physically i nodded to the sergeant this fellow is a troublemaker im afraid why dont you take him uh them to the dungeon to cool down for a while yes your majesty all at once the sergeant sounded enthusiastic he nodded to his troopers grab the monster boys i have no doubt that members of the society for the advancement of the rights of individuals with multiple necks will be distressed by the crudity prejudice and discriminatory nature of his language and i apologize for the infliction of any such distress i do not editorialize here i merely report apparently untroubled by higher feelings of brotherhood the hassocki soldiers grabbed the monster josйdiego tried to fight back in less time than it takes to tell hetheyhad three black eyes and two bloody noses if it wasnt pretty obvious that i wouldnt have approved he would have lost two heads for eliphalets sake otto call the authorities josй howled you dont seem to understand i am the authorities i said and then to the sergeant take him away if youre going to be a tyrant be a tyrant yes your majesty away josйdiego went he was still making a dreadful racket fortunately he was doing most of it in leonese which the bystanders couldnt follow now that i look back on it that might have been lucky for him as well as for me if they had understood some of the things he was calling them he might not have made it to the dungeon keep him away from mustafa and kemal i called after the soldiers they dont need to listen to his ravings could you hold a twoheaded man in solitary confinement a nice grammatical and philosophical question isnt it the sergeant waved to show he heard me i wasnt sure whether the hassocki officers spoke schlepsigian i wouldnt have been surprised though if they did they would have found out some things i didnt want them knowing they would have been able to tell the palace guards about them too that could have provedawkward as things were take him away worked just fine no wonder tyrants enjoy being tyrannical not many bigger thrills than telling people what to do and actually having them do it some yes i wondered if zogus aphrodisiac preparation was good for one more night but not many the market square slowly went back to normalwhich is to say dull i turned to max well im glad thats over with i said we dont want any more twofaced dealing around here my esteemed minister for special affairs looked revolted if not outright rebellious but he said i guess you did about as well with that as you could out of sight out of mind dont be ridiculous i said josйdiego is out of his mindmindseven when hes in sight max didnt try to tell me i was wronga good thing since i was right i wonder what he was doing in peshkepiia he said i shrugged this is a place for losers where else would somebody like josйdiego show up there arent many like himand a good thing too i say what are we doing here in that case max inquired dont be difficult i told him ill say thiswhat were doing here is a lot more profitable than haggling for vegetables in the market square more fun too by tonight well have tried out the whole harem a point max said when max doesnt argue you know its a good point too peshkepiia royal harem and royal treasury excepted was rapidly running out of good points chief among the not so good points was the consolidated crystal office given any encouragement from me max would have haunted the place like a jilted ghost in one of those castles on the crags above the river that are so beloved of schlepsigian romancewriters of the female persuasion even without encouragement from me the intrepid captain yildirim went back to the cc office when he returned to the market square his face was longer than the road between dooger and carks and a good circus well what is it this time i asked maybe if he got it out of his system all at once as if from a purgative its the hassockian atabeg thats what said my minister for special affairs really bellowing like an angry dragon now he says the fellow who has the unmitigated gall to pretend to be his highness prince halim eddin should get exactly what he deserves and another twenty piasters worth besides now ive always thought of my gall as being on the mitigated side twenty piasters piled together arent worth a good schlepsigian kram i said somehow this observation failed to calm max that still leaves you getting what you deserve he said it leaves me getting what you deserve too for which i thank you so very much what the atabeg thinks you deserve would keep a team of torturers busy for weeks youve been getting what i deserve the past three nights too or half of it anyway i said when you thank me for that you can sound like you mean it max ignored that thrust despite all the thrusting hed done on those three memorable nights wait till this fireball gets to essad pasha he said dolefully just wait he cant pretend he doesnt believe it the way he did with the last one no he really didnt believe that one i said i had a certain amount of trouble believing essad pasha would disbelieve the atabegs latest since i had trouble believing it i didnt waste my time trying to persuade max trying to persuade max of anything good is commonly a waste of time i did want to persuade him to keep quiet so i added essad pasha hasnt complained about my jugging colonel kemal and major mustafa not yet max said no not yet but he hasnt heard the latest either when he does hell probably complain about your jugging josйdiego too now hed gone too far nobody could possibly complain about jugging josйdiego i said with great certainty north and south east and west even josй thinks diego wants jugging and conversely and perversely you mean max said curse it were in trouble otuh your majesty you worry too much i said for all you know this latest mumble from vyzance wont even get to essad pasha why should it your majesty that was bob the bewigged albionese attempt at a scribe who else would shout at me in a language he didnt think i spoke still in albionese he went on what do you think of the atabegs latest statement your majesty thats why max said fortunately in a low voice oh shut up i told him also quietly i nodded to the scribe with bob a man possessed of some sense the other newshounds i noted made a point of not letting bob wander around by himself i suppose none of them was really eager to be the one who had to identify his body what does he say i asked in schlepsigian the other scribe translated something i understood into something i admitted understanding i also would like to know this your majesty he told me ill bet you would i thought no matter how foolish bob was not all of his questions were perfect idiocy appearances to the contrary notwithstanding seemed beyond him i am afraid the atabeg feels acknowledging my presence here would be an embarrassment i told the other scribe and embroidered on that theme for some little whilethe same story id given my dear max and my not so dear essad pasha as i talked bob hopped up and down in an agony of impatience he tugged at the other scribes sleeve like a little boy with no manners what does he say he asked as i had but he did it over and over again what does he say what does he say had i been that other scribe i would have hauled off and decked him but the other man showed admirable patiencewhat was he doing in his line of work anyway he even did a good job of translating what id told him when he finished bob nodded as if in wisdom well he said that makes sense i sent max a slightly superior smile one that said you see theyre still buying it i didnt want to be too blatant for fear the other scribe would notice me reacting to things i wasnt supposed to be able to follow bob i wasnt worried about bob noticed nothing as he proved by believing me the other scribe sent him a pitying smile as if he still thought eliphalet drank the extra mug of beer people put out for his name day its a crock of crap bob he said in albionese this guys lying through his teeth either he is or the atabeg is anyway and the atabeg sounds too cheesed off to be blowing smoke somethings screwy somewhere you wait and see i wasnt supposed to be able to follow that either by my expression youd never know i did i glanced over at max i wasnt expecting a slightly superior smile from him and i didnt get one max doesnt waste smiles like that id never imagined anybody frowning a slightly superior frown but there it was maxs face is made for expressing subtle shades of disapproval are you really the atabegs nephew your majesty bob asked he had a childlike faith that because he was a scribe nothing he said could land him in trouble or maybe he was trying to prove he was a perfect idiot after all i dont know i do know his keeper turned a shade of chartreuse that didnt go at all well with the dark green jacket he was wearing what does he say i asked again as innocently as if i were innocent instead of answering me the other scribe spoke to bob in a low voice i really couldnt follow all of that what i could follow wasentertaining bobs keeper wasnt telling him all the different kinds of fool he was hed still be standing there in the peshkepiia market square talking if he tried it he did seem to make a judicious selection what does he say i asked again after a while never mind your majesty hes decided he doesnt really want to ask that question the other scribe said in schlepsigian havent you bob he added in ominous albionese it really would be interesting to find out bob said add a bit of human interest to things make a good storydo you know what i mean yes and the story right after it would be how an albionese scribe got his nose cut off because he couldnt keep from poking it into dark corners with knives hidden in them his keeper had some basic grasp on reality the man switched to schlepsigian to tell me bob really and truly doesnt want to ask that question bob really and truly did but i wasnt supposed to know it so i smiled and nodded and let the other scribe lead the ineffable albionese out of danger out of danger from me anyhowi had the feeling bob would keep on putting himself in danger wherever he went and whatever he did and he wouldnt even know he was putting himself in danger which would be all the more dangerous for him your majesty by the exaggerated patience with which max said it he didnt think i even knew i was putting myself in danger your majesty its unraveling its coming to pieces dont you think we ought to get out while the gettings good dont you think we ought to while we still can i sighed and reached up to pat him on the back go if you want to old fellow i wont say a word about it but ill miss you tonight i really will even with zogus charm under the bed i dont know if i can handle six of them all by myself oh well ill just have to try my ah hardest its my patriotic duty after all max walked back to the palace with me im sure his patriotic duty was the uppermost thing in his mind max always was a very patriotic fellow strati hoti rruga jeni zarzavate silnif the last of the harem thinking that made me sad there wouldnt be any more first times for me and max ah well some things dont get boring even with repetition by that fourth night skander had given up asking the whereabouts of my distinguished minister for special affairs he assumed max was in the room where he belonged i assumed max belonged in the room where he was skanders assumption satisfied himand presumably rexhep mine satisfied me max seemed quite capable of satisfying himself between the two of us we seemed quite capable of satisfying strati and hoti and rruga roll those first two rs as hard as you can and jeni and zarzavate and silnif yes zogus magic helped but we knew what we were doing and we did several different things if wed just done that we never could have managed even with a helping hand from the wizardry oh your majesty zarzavate said at one point in the proceedings i think it was zarzavate whoever it was i dont believe i got a more heartfelt compliment in my whole reign but all good things must come to an end which is another way to say you cant keep coming forever no matter how much you wish you could we sprawled across the bed and across one another worn out but happy which of us did you like best your majesty asked hotii do believe it was hoti all of you i said i might not be a politician but im not an imbecile either i sounded sincere too the girls laughed even max unfrowned a little but hotiwas it hotididnt want to leave it alone she pouted prettily yes your majesty which of all of us well i had an opinion i had it and i was bloody well going to keep it to myself the atabegs torturers couldnt have torn it out of me so i say anyhow never having made the acquaintance of those illustrious gentlemen all of you i repeated i cant imagine how any king anywhere in all the world could be happier than i am right now and i could imagine the harem wars if i didnt stay evenhanded i could and i didnt want to none of the girls felt combative just then i liked the way they felt just fine wed do anything for you your majesty strati said im almost sure it was strati anything at all if she was the one i thought she was at one particular momentexactly who was who when blurred a bitshe meant every word of that too and for you brave captain yildirim silnif added well lets say it was silnif we dont want you to feel all alone now she giggled my minister for special affairs might have felt a lot of things right then but he was most unlikely to feel alone a little later max did his amazing astounding never to be equaled disappearing act he went back into my closet the girls sighed with regret i restored myself to something resembling decency they sighed about that too which did ease my mind then they got dressed which gave me something to regret i summoned skander skander summoned rexhep the eunuch took the girls back to the harem youve made yourself remarkably popular your majesty skander said for all six of them went right on sighing remarkably he knew something was going on but he didnt know what a good thing he didnt too that was the end of my fourth night as king of shqiperi xvii on the fifth day things fell apart i might have known they would by eliphalets fuzzy whiskers i had known they would id tried not to admit it even to myself id tried not to admit it especially to myself that didnt make things any better when they did fall apart yes i admit it if id had any sense if id had any sense i would have stayed in thasos i never would have become king of shqiperi i never would have browbeaten essad pasha i never would have slain a dragon on the way to peshkepiia i never would have declared war on belagora i never would have made the acquaintance of so many lovelywell reasonably lovelyshqipetari maidens that was the good side id savored every instant of it the bad side was once things started falling apart everybody else in peshkepiia savored the notion of killing me in as many ingenious ways as possible even essad pasha showed a regrettable tendency not to stay browbeaten i certainly regretted it let me tell you he came to the palace while i was still eating breakfast given the general greasiness of shqipetari breakfasts most of the time i wouldnt have minded having mine interrupted most of the time this particular morning though he came with a sorcerous copy of the portrait of halim eddin the very portrait that had launched me on my kingly career he looked at me he looked at the portrait he looked at me some more he looked at the portrait again apparently i was expected not to notice this if id played by the rules i wouldnt have been sitting in the royal palace of shqiperi eating an indifferent breakfast in the first place is something troubling you your excellency i inquired essad pasha looked at me he looked at the portrait this could have grown tedious it could also have given him a crick in the neck if hed kept it up much longer you look like his highness he said grudgingly and what do you suppose the most likely reason for that is i said a man often resembles his portraitif the artist has half a notion of what hes doing anyway but is that the most likely reason was essad pasha asking himself or me himself for he went on the atabeg says you are not halim eddin ive already explained to you why he has to do that i said with such patience as i could muster a man does get tired of telling the same lie over and over and a man does get alarmed when the fellow who most needs to believe that lie starts wondering about it yes but the atabeg seemed quite emphatic even impassioned in his latest denial essad pasha said i shall have to investigate further he didnt really disbelieve me or he never would have let me hear that last investigate all you please i told him you will find it is just as i say the only sure way he could find it wasnt was by sailing to vyzance and looking at the veritable halim eddin there with his own eyes if he was determined enough to do that at least he would give me plenty of time to make my getaway or so it seemed to me but once things started unraveling they came unknotted and unknitted faster than a cheap mitten where are colonel kemal and major mustafa essad pasha asked if he didnt hear it from me he would from someone else that would only make him more suspicious if such a thing was possible in the dungeon here i answered they presumed to doubt my royal status too i couldnt very well jug essad pasha no matter how good an idea that might seem without him i had no hold at all on the hassocki troops in peshkepiia and the rest of shqiperi before essad pasha could say anything skander bustled up to me your majesty zogu the mage would speak to you i sighed i wouldnt have enjoyed my breakfast even alone not as oily as it was i might as well not enjoy it in company then go fetch him i told skander and away he went he still thought i was king if we are going to fight the belagorans your majesty i need to speak to these officers essad pasha said i should like to have them released if at all possible they are excellent commanders he waited i wondered if he wanted to persuade them i was the king or if he wanted them to persuade him i wasnt but i had to act as if i trusted him or he wouldnt trust me at all you may see them i told him as skander brought zogu up to my table if they pledge their loyalty to meand if they make me believe itthey may be released very well your majesty essad pasha bowed and took his leave he didnt need to ask skander where the dungeons were plainly he already knew he would and he hadnt even got to the diningroom door before i realized how many different flavors of fool i was colonel kemal and major mustafa werent the only ones languishing in the dungeons josйdiego was sitting in one of those cells too and josйdiego knew enough about max and me not just to cook our goose but to incinerate it zogu if fate was kind enough to throw me a straw id try to grab it how would you like to put another chunk of the shqipetari royal treasury in your own pocket well i wouldnt mind zogu answered somehow i hadnt thought he would what do you need me to do he didnt ask about a fee not right then i figured that meant he figured he had me by the short hairs i also figured he was right i pointed after essad pasha can you arrange it so his excellency thinks hes hurrying toward the dungeons but hes really not moving very fast at all a light gleamed in the wizards dark eyes for all piratical porpoises id just told him i wasnt the rightful king of shqiperi if he felt like denouncing me id probably end up envying my breakfast but he only bowed as your majesty wishes so shall it be if zogu had to withdraw to his sorcerous lair essad pasha would already have got to the place where i didnt want him to go by the time the wizard set out to stop him that struck me as an impractical solution to the difficulty in which i found myself i cast about for one more timely tackling the military governor sprang to mind but zogu proved himself a man of parts and he had all the parts he needed right there with him he took from his belt something that resembled both a curiously mottled fingernail and a much smaller version of the dragons scale i now wore under my tunic as tortoises grow he remarked they shed the outer layer of the scutes that armor their backs these come in handy now and again i didnt know whether this was now or again i did know zogu had better hurry if he was going to take care of what i needed from him i also knew that the more nervous i seemed the more he would charge me when he finishedif he finished in time im not the least accomplished actor in the world i wouldnt have succeeded even for five days in the role i was playing without a share of the true gift but staying calm or seeming to stay calm while zogu went through the rest of his pouches and pockets was one of the hardest things ive ever done after what felt like forever and might have been half a minute he let out a small satisfied grunt the bit of dried withered greenery he held up put me in mind of nothing so much asa bit of dried withered greenery but he seemed pleased with it henbane he explainedhe was an inveterate explainer was zogu it has the property of blurring that which is and that which seems to be very good i said and could not help adding can you make it seem to move faster his smile told me his price had just gone up well i was past worrying about that what could i buy with the gold and silver in that multiply locked treasure chamber more precious than my own neck and its continuing attachment to my shoulders zogu rubbed the henbane to powder between the thumb and forefinger of his right hand he let the powder drizzle down over the shed tortoise scute which he held in his left palm as he did so he chanted in nasal braying shqipetari an unmusical language at the best of times which this was not i thought i caught essad pashas name in that flood of incomprehensible syllables i also thought i caught mine no not halim eddinsmine if zogu didnt say otto of schlepsig in therewell then he said something else that was all but i sure thought he did for a moment i was offended how could he presume to know who i really was but he was a wizard after all if he set his mind to it how could he not know with an abrupt motion he swept the scute and the henbane dust from his hand it is accomplished your majesty he said with no irony in my title that i could findand i was looking i got to my feet all right i said lets see what essad pasha is doing before i could leave the dining room max burst in my distinguished minister for special affairs seemed imperfectly pleased with the world around him i wondered why i had the distinct feeling i didnt really want to know your majesty max sounded as happy as he lookedwhich is to say he thought the end was nigh captain the news will wait whatever it may be i said no it wont max said yes it will i said in my best royal tonesso soon to be abandoned we must discover what our bold and clever mage has accomplished you do me too much honor zogu murmured i had better not i told him let him take that as he pleased maybe i meant his services were vital and that i had confidence hed done what he set out to do or maybe i meant his services were vital and his head would answer if something had gone wrong a man with a spell is generally stronger than a man with a sword but a man with a sword can generally use his weapon faster than a man with a spell since zogu was right there between max and me he had to be a little thoughtful max seemed about ready to burst your majesty you really do need to knowow not entirely by accident id done my best to flatten maxs instep the look he gave me made me wonder if zogu was the only one who needed to worry about swords but he did shut up that was nice each of us thinking his no doubt interesting thoughts none of us saying anything we walked out into the hallway one of the palace servants trotted toward me calling your majesty your majesty when i put the crown on five days earlier i never dreamt i might tire of the title just at that moment though i rather wished people would forget i was king of shqiperi yes mujo i couldnt possibly have sounded as apprehensive as i felt but mujo said your majesty essad pashas had some kind of fit come quick you see zogu said quietly i see i answered as quietly max started to say something i stepped on his foot again i dont know how i could have been so clumsy oh what a pity i told mujo in my normal tone of voice or as normal as i could sound while shamelessly overacting take me to him right away and the good mujo did by what hed said i expected to see essad pasha thrashing on the floor foaming at the mouth that wasnt what id looked for from zogus wizardry it turned out not to be what i got either there essad pasha was hurrying along toward the dungeons every line of his body proclaimed his urgency purpose gleamed in his eyes his mouth was firm and determined i walked up to him i walked past him i walked around him i stopped next to him if i watched for a little while i could see him moving if id stood around for an hour or so i might have seen him take another step at that rate he would get to the dungeons just a little before colonel kemal and major mustafa died of old age a number of fates might still await me in shqiperi somehow i didnt think dying of old age was one of them are you satisfied your majesty zogu asked will you listen to me your majesty max asked yes i said and then no to zogu i went on lets go to the treasury youve earned your pay to max i went on captain yildirim whatever it is it will keep for a little while theyre getting ready to hang you from a lamppost out there and me from the one next door max said dont be ridiculous i told him peshkepiia hasnt got any lampposts that kept him quiet till we got to the treasury chamber the guards standing in front of it came to attention i had the keys to the treasury with mewhat better perquisite of kingship one by one the locks opened the bars came off the door swung wide we went inside i unlocked the chests go ahead i said to zogu help yourself north and south east and west your majesty that is spoken like a king he exclaimed nice of you to say so i answered by eliphalets holy hangnail i was still a king i might not have been prince halim eddin the way essad pasha thought i was but i had been properly crowned as king of shqiperi no matter who i really was all hail king otto i long may he reign unfortunately king otto i was going to have a short reign and it would have been even shorter if he hadnt been smart enough to realize as much zogu wasnt shy about exacting his fee but he wasnt greedyor not too greedy anyhow you put my honor at stake here he said were you niggardly i would feel dutybound to take more if i didnt know you had honor i wouldnt have spoken the way i did i replied one more lie for the road even if a lie kindly meant the truth was right then i didnt care how much he took he couldnt carry it all away which was the only thing that mattered to me but this was a lie that helped me more than the truth would have the mage bowed very low clinking musically as he did for your kindness your majesty i will give you a parting gift he plucked a withered leaf from a pouch on his belt here is a veritable tortoise leaf hed used a tortoise scute before that i understood even if id never heard the term till he gave it to me but thisdo tortoises in shqiperi turn into shrubs or maybe grow on them i asked not so zogu said no one knows from which plant the shetortoisefor it is always a shetortoisefinds this leaf she will not seek it if she is followed but she carries it in her mouth with her to get it from her you must build a wall of stones around the nest where she has laid her eggs the leaf has the property of breaking down any wall or door he bowed again may it prove useful to you he still didnt say he knew i wasnt the king essad pasha had thought i was he didnt need to say anything of the kind he just gave me a present that would help me go on being who i was even if i wasnt who essad pasha thought i was zogu might have worn his hair in a cut that looked like a pancake but he was all right i bowed to him in turn it shall be a talisman as long as my reign lasts no i wasnt going to admit a thing good fortune go with youand with your leaf he said one more bow and he was gone now i said to max you wanted to tell me something he eyed the guards outside the door and spoke in a low voice that didnt make him sound any less ah sincereon the contrary in fact man things are getting critical out there we cant stay here any more not after those cursed scribesmay demons take themwent and spilled the beans more and more people know about the denials from vyzance and more and more people believe them if we dont escape right now were lost well be shot shot brrthat was not a pretty word but it was obvious that my good minister for special affairs was right if it became clear the denials were true then nothing good would happen to us essad pasha once he thawed out anyway and his officers would be in a fine fury because wed led them around by the nose like that i could picture it perfectly well in my mind i didnt want to wait around to see it for real and i wouldnt have to wait around very long one of the palace guards trotted up to the treasury he saluted me as king and said excuse me your majesty but there are soldiers outside the front entrance who dont seem wellinclined toward you how big an understatement was that probably bigger by the second if i couldnt get adulation chaos seemed the next best bet i clapped a hand to my forehead i looked stricken as i had with mujo i overacted like you wouldnt believe traitors i cried north and south east and west traitors beset me they must be in narbonese pay those accursed curs theyd eat their dead vomit it up and howl for more hold them off as long as you can reinforcements are on the way the soldier saluted he bowed he ran back toward the entrance waving his sword when you do things like that people get out of your way theyd better anyhow one of the guards at the treasury door turned to peer in at me his eyes as wide as saucers your majesty he said go help the men at the entrance i told him captain yildirim and i will protect the treasury till youve beaten back the wicked rebels aye your majesty this poor sap saluted and bowed too he and his pal hotfooted it down the corridor after the other soldier i couldnt see if they were waving their swords it wouldnt surprise me though if youre going to act melodramatic dont do it halfway narbonese pay max said protect the treasury of course narbonese pay you wouldnt expect me to blame a kingdom thats friendly to schlepsig would you i said and youd best believe i intend to protect the treasuryas much of it as i can carry anyway i started filling every pocket and pouch my uniform possessed i stuffed coins down my boot tops too max stared at me theni know youll think im making this up but i am a truthful manhe started to laugh by eliphalets burgeoning bank account otto youre not crazy after all he also loaded up zogu had clinked when he left the treasury we didnt wed packed ourselves too tight with cash to make much noise the first few steps i was awkwardid gained more than a little weight i soon got the hang of it though max was less graceful but max is always less graceful arent you going to close the door max inquired as we exited stage left not me i told him sooner or laterby the racket out front it sounded like soonerthose meanspirited misguided misunderstanding rogues out there are going to break in some of them just may prove more interested in an open treasury than in open season on a kingand on his minister for special affairs a point a distinct point he allowed how much do you think weve got more than dooger and cark would have paid us thats for sure i said enough so that id sooner not go swimming urk max said which was more or less what i was thinking servants stared at us as we strode past i dont know what they were thinking there wasnt really time to ask they didnt try to stop us surely that was a sign of approval of my glorious if all too brief reign after a bit max asked do you have any idea where youre going surely that was a sign of imperfect trust in ones sovereign as a matter of fact yes i answered and i did things were getting quite unpleasantly loud out front when i came to the harem door ah max said as i unbarred it from my side if you want great roars of approval from max youll be disappointed if you want any sort of approval from max youll mostly be disappointed i was glad to take what i got that door of course remained barred from the other side i pounded on it calling rexhep where are you man the last word gave him too much credit but better too much than not enough just then the pause that followed almost lasted long enough for me to try out zogus tortoise leaf or whatever it was in due coursemuch too duethe eunuch peered at me through the grate well what is it rexhep asked and then after another beat your majesty i want to come into the harem i said what did you expect that i wanted to sell you some garlic his cold eyes flicked from me to max who was standing behind me max couldnt hide behind memax cant hide behind anybody i can think of you cannot bring captain yildirim in with you rexhep said what i yelped demons take you im king of shqiperi i can do anything i please if i got into the harem i might even get away from peshkepiia with a whole skin that would have pleased me all right rexhep shook his head i am the chief eunuch of the harem captain yildirim may not come in no whole man may enter my domain save only the king it is the law he didnt know what kind of entering max had been up to back in my bedchamber the two prophets be praised i started to reach for the tortoise leaf again i wasnt going to put up with that nonsense not even for a heartbeat but then womens squeals and cries of yildirim sweet yildirim came from the other side of the door rexhep said something in shqipetari whatever it was i dosomewhatregret not learning any of the language of the kingdom i ruled it didnt work a moment later i heard the sounds of a scuffle a moment after that the door opened come in your majesty lutzi said come in sweet captain yildirim maja and strati added several of the other girls were sitting on rexhep if looks could killif looks could kill he would have slaughtered the men who made him into what he was so i was safe enough there in i went sweet captain yildirim at my heels what do you need your majesty hoti asked the back way out i answered im afraid theres been a bit of a palace revolution some of the hassocki soldiers in the city want to see me slightly deadand sweet captain yildirim too if they were going to make an unseemly fuss over max no accounting for taste is there i intended to remind them that his long scrawny neck was on the line too lutzi gasped why would anyone want to hurt you your majesty youre soso lovable i liked the way she thought i liked just about everything about her to tell you the truth shed been pretty thoroughly lovable herself its a long story i heard several crashes from out front and then furious shouts inside the palace none of that sounded good its a long story and i havent got time to tell it the back way fast as we can go yes your majesty the girls chorused to them i was still a king some of them led max and me through the harem some went on sitting on rexhepone of them had the presence of mind to gag him some had even more presence of mind than that they shut the door between the harem and the rest of the palace and set the alarmingly stout bar in its brackets which was something i should have thought of theyll notice it isnt barred from the other side max said sorrowfully theyll still have to get in i answered by the time they do well have got out if we hadnt got out by then we were in even more trouble than i thought we were and they said it couldnt be done i started to reach up and yank the rank badges off maxs shoulder straps my first thought was that it would make him less conspicuous my next thought was that painting over a few of a giraffes spots wouldnt make it a whole lot less conspicuous unfortunately that made better sense than the other did i wished id asked zogu for a spell to make max seem shorter too late now we hustled to the back door one of the girls looked through a spyhole to make sure no unfriendly soldiersthere didnt seem to be any other kind just thenwere lurking outside intent on making some royal shashlik the girls hadnt been in the palace much longer than i had did rexhep tell them about the spyhole i doubted it rexhep wouldnt have told his own mother his name theyd probably found it themselves then they had all sorts of interesting talents the coast is clear your majesty she said those nasty people havent broken into the harem yet either another girl said you dont have to leave just yet then three or four girls said that i wasnt sure if they were talking to me or to the redoubtable he was certainly worth doubting more than once captain yildirim i also wasnt sure what wouldor couldhappen next theyd spent the past four nights draining both of us dry worse zogus aphrodisiac was back in the royal bedchamber i hated to leave the girls disappointed and somehow i didnt neither did max we got out a little later than we thought we would a little tireder than we thought we would and a lot happier than we thought we would the back door opened silently on welloiled hinges had any of the women from earlier harems sneaked out had they smuggled any men in id never know but i had my royal suspicions farewell your majesty lutzi purred farewell sweetheart i corrected myself sweethearts ummyou may be interested to know that nobody bothered closing the door to the treasury after the last time captain yildirim and i ah checked it they didnt forget about max and me the instant they heard that i can imagine no more sincere compliment out into the alley behind the palace we went they closed the door behind us the bar thumped down then they all squealedi could hear them through those stout oaken timbersand then i have no doubt they scrambled off for their share of the royal loot i hope they grabbed with both hands well max said what now getting out of peshkepiia without ending up with more holes than a colander would be nice i said it would if we could max said how do you propose to manage it if we can get away from the goons around the palace i think well be all right i answered once we do that we scurry off toward the eastern gate as fast as our little legs will take us if we steer clear of the metropolis and the fortress weve got a pretty fair chance i dont know what youve been putting in your pipe but give me some if youve got any left max said i dont suppose it was lese majesty i wasnt exactly king any more i said think about it who really knows im king of shqiperi the hassocki soldiers who were trying to get hold of this place and the foreigners at the hostel the shqipetari may know theyve got a king but most of them dont know what he looks like to them were just a couple of hassocki officers thats not reason enough to knock us over the head max was cheerful as usual nobody without a stepladder could knock you over the head my dear i told him and speaking of stepping step we did and step lively too we tried to head east steering by the sun and doing our best to stay away from what passed for main streets in peshkepiia now i didnt fall off the turnip wagon yesterday i know how to find my way around if you dont understand how to find your way around strange towns youve got no business signing up with an outfit like dooger and carks peshkepiia was harder to navigate than it had any business being its not very big but the streets double back on each other like you wouldnt believe they would remind me of a plate of those long skinny torinan noodles only theyre slathered in stuff a lot nastier than tomato sauce if the hassocki soldiers caught up with us though theyd do their best to turn us into meatballs right then i didnt think anybody could catch up with us i thought we might run into ourselves coming and going it wouldnt have surprised me much the lanes and alleys and streets were that twisty by the time we walked past the same place that sold secondhand clothes for about the fourth time i started wondering how anybody ever got out of peshkepiia or if anybody ever did the old man who ran the place didnt seem surprised to watch us go by and go by and go by and go by he didnt need to worry about shaving part of his scalp he was bald as an eggplant and not a whole lot less purple he wore a big gray mustache that looked like it was trying to be wings and damn near succeeding when we saw him the fourth time i had an idea what do you say we buy some shqipetari clothes uniforms are fine here in town but out in the countryside wed do better looking like everybody else you should have thought of that back in the palace i know every outfit you had in your closet max said ill bet he did too but it was also too late for that given his excessive assortment of inches i figured he was thinking clothes wouldnt unmake the man but something else was on his mind maybe we ought to just stick around this place soldiers will never find it im not sure its connected to the outside world my guess was that he had at least an evenmoney chance of being right whether he was or not though we really couldnt stick around maybe new clothes will change our luck i said max made a small production out of his shrug i made a small production out of not seeing it striding up to the fellow who sat at the front of the shop i asked do you speak hassocki he paused to puff on his water pipe he blinked a couple of times nothing happens fast in shqiperi youll go mad if you expect it to thats true all over the nekemte peninsula and if they think youre in a hurry down there theyll only go slower watching foreigners go mad is one of the local sports driving them mad is another one i waited and waited and waited some more if i was a hassocki myself i was supposed to understand how the game worked when i didnt whip out my sword or try to snatch that amber mouthpiece away from him and either jam it down his throat or up the other way he eventually unbent enough to take it out of his mouth and grudge me a word yes will you sell us outfits i asked whatever max got wouldnt fit him well i knew that but the people looking for us were unlikely to care much about how shqipetari clothes fit any which way the old geezer looked at me he looked at max his eyes were as black and opaque as a tortoisesand i dont mean a tortoise with a leaf in its beak either he gave me another grudging yes as you find the time then you might let us see your wares i yawned and shrugged nothing of great importance though i dont know why i asked in the first place you probably wont have anything we want anyhow all games have their tricks acting slower than the other fellow will speed him up after a last puff on his pipe the old shqipetar actually stood up id wondered if he was taking root there come i will show you he said id won the round i knew it and he had to know it too his shop was even dimmer and darker inside than it had seemed from the street that turned out not to be so bad about two minutes after we went in a couple of squads of hassocki soldiers clumped bythe place was attached to the rest of peshkepiia after all the soldiers didnt look inside the shop i wasnt sorry they didntoh no not a bit i bought black trousers and a white shirt and a sheepskin jacket and a leather sack to hold my loot i was abandoning any number of pouches and pockets i also bought a floppy hat to keep people from noticing i wasnt sheared like a shqipetar the breeches max got were too short but they were the longest ones the old man had maxs wrists stuck out of his shirtsleeves too he chose a wool cape instead of a jacket it had no sleeves his sack was canvas and his hat was even uglier than mine we gave the old shqipetar our uniformsall but the bootsas part of the price they were bound to be worth more than the outfits we were buying but we couldnt be fussy just then with the uniform went the last vestiges of my royalty i was a commoner again an uncommon commoner but a commoner even so which way to the east gate max asked in lieu of something like how do we never see this corner again the old man gave us directions i made him repeat them we tried them they really and truly worked the two prophets must have been in the mood to dole out miracles thank you eliphalet and thank you too zibeon but not quite so much we had only one bad moment on the way to the gate we walked right past bob he was speakingin albionese of courseto someone who didnt seem to know much of his language yes the king and his minister appear to have fled he said no one has any idea where they are he was looking right at us the only way to make max look like anyone but max would be to chop him off at the ankles a cowflop of a hat will not do the trick bob perceivednothing he was looking for two men in hassocki uniforms failing to see them he had no interest in anything or anyone else neither my good looks nor maxs height made him give us a second glance no one else did either the gate guards were counting sheep for the wool tax not for the sake of sleep as we strolled out one of them nodded to us the rest went on arguing about the count with bopipi think that was the shepherds name anyway i showed the seat of my pants to the seat of my government and headed east xviii after wed put a mile or so between ourselves and peshkepiia max said well you havent got us killed yet i dont know how you havent or why you havent but im still breathing keep it up i said i noticed you were rather vigorous about it the past four nights ive passed evenings i liked less he said and i knew that was as much as id get out of him back to fushekuqe then i said passage on the first ship thats going anywhere and a story to dine out on as long as we liveand the money to dine pretty well assuming we live long enough to be able to dine at all no that wasnt max being gloomy he was looking back along the road wed just traveled only a troop of horsemen riding hard could have kicked up that cloud of dust we were standing in the shade of a mulberry tree sit down i hissed to max that way they wont need to be as blind as bob not to notice how tall you are no but were still dead if they talked to the old bugger who sold us this clobber max said i never needed to worry when he was aroundhe was so much better at it than id ever be he sat down even so and i stretched out beside him up rode the cavalrymen with much jingling of harness and what have you they were going at a fast trot and they paid us no particular attention what do we do if we catch this fellow who was calling himself king one of them asked take him back to peshkepiia the man who answered looked and sounded like a sergeant no one was going to get any nonsense past him not if he could help it then we give him to essad pasha oh theyve got him moving again the curious cavalryman said would he want that other bugger if they hadnt why do sergeants answer questions with questions oh there i am doing it myself well ive been a sergeant too ill tell you kinging it is better what if i couldnt make out the rest of what the first horseman said the jingling and the clop of hoofbeats drowned out his words then the cavalry troop was gone riding east max looked after them nice to know they remember you yes isnt it i sounded as bland as i could that wasnt very max wouldnt let it be very do you suppose they hired zogu to thaw essad pasha out there was an imperfectly delightful thought i managed a smile in spite of being imperfectly delighted well what if they did i said the only thing better than getting paid is getting paid twice the only thing better than getting paid is getting laid max returned well we did that too by eliphalets holy foreskin i said it wouldnt have done him much good if it wasnt holey max is a blasphemous cactus i climbed to my feet i picked up my sack full of silverand the odd bit of gold and the occasional jewel i had only memories to remind me id got laid the sack told me loud and clear that id got paid max grunted as he hefted his it might have been heavier than mine for all i knew hed got paid better as a kings aidedecamp than i had as his majestic majesty was that enough to make him stop grumbling not likely on to fushekuqe i said but we never got there half an hour after that first cavalry troop jingled and clattered past us another one rode by again we plopped down by the side of the road and pretended to be lazy goodfornothing shqipetari peasantsbut i repeat myself again the hassocki rode by without giving us a second glance they were still after king halim eddin and captain yildirim not otto of schlepsig and max of witte to say nothing which is about as much as should be said of fatmir and beqirior pick two other shqipetari names that suit you if youd rather we kept going in spite of that half an hour later though another troop went by this one was loaded for bear or more likely dragon at its head rode essad pasha looking grim half a pace behind him and to his right rode colonel kemal looking determined a whole pace behind him and to his left rode major mustafa looking angry directly behind him on a distinctly spooked horse rode josйdiego looking respectively furious and murderous so they werent just out for halim eddin and yildirim they were after otto and max too but they still hadnt figured out fatmir and beqiri well no ones ever figured out the peasantry of shqiperi tell me my dear dear friend how do you propose to get around that max can be most difficult when he sounds the mildest he has other character traits i find more endearing well get to the coast somewhere that isnt fushekuqe well find a fisherman and well pay him to take us across the tiberian sea to torino i replied max looked at me as easy as that eh as easy as that i said and so it wasnt if we werent going to lovely charming fushekuqe if we werent going past essad pashas shooting boxwhere now we were all too likely to become part of the entertainment not to take part in itwe needed to leave the main road between peshkepiia and the port at first i reckoned this no great hardship indeed i reckoned it no hardship at all since in any kingdom that actually has roads the one between peshkepiia and fushekuqe would be recognized at once for what it is a horrid muddy rutted winding track long long overdue for repair refurbishment or even furbishment and restoration once we left it though we rapidly found out why it was the main road all the others were worse yes universally and without exception no i wouldnt have believed it either but i saw it with my own eyes i went into it with my own feetand anklesand calvesand a couple of times knees you would think a farmer could find a better place to let his hogs wallow than in the middle of what was allegedly a road you would think so if youve never been to shqiperi by the time you saw it for the third time it wouldnt surprise you any more it wouldnt even infuriate you any more it would just behow do i put itpart of the landscape one other thing hogs in shqiperi are not the plump placid pink porkers we turn into hams in schlepsig they are one short step one very short step up from wild boars you cant go through their wallows you would resent it if you try to go around their wallows they are apt to resent itand to come after you when we bombarded one brazen beast with rocks to keep him from eating us instead of the other way round his farmer resented it he shouted loudly and irately in shqipetari thou wretched bloody and usurping boar i replied in hassocki thou hast a sow for a mistress and right sorry am i to have disturbed thy brats he understood me all over the nekemte peninsula people revile one another in hassocki even when they dont use it for anything else this says something about the language and something about the hassockinothing good in either case i fear me let vultures vile seize on thy lungs he cried may thy yard rot off thy yard is but an inch max shouted at him after a few more such pleasantries we went on our way we soon found we hadnt skirted the wallow quite well enough for its stench went on our way with us when we came to a small stream we paused to clean the muck off our boots max wiped at his with a tuft of grass this is a pain in the morass he grumbled look on the bright side i said something he was unlikely to do without encouragementor with it for that matter essad pasha wont find us as long as we keep going down tracks like these of course he wont max threw the clump of grass into the stream it floated away no one could find us here we couldnt find ourselves here if we went out looking for us i started to follow that one through its range of possibilities then gave it up as a bad job we climbed to our feet and splashed across the little creek several frogs jumped off of rocks and into the water and swam away they must have taken us for narbonese perhaps half a mile farther on things got more complicated the track we were following stopped i dont mean it just sort of petered out it stopped a considerable gully interrupted it i considered the gullyunhappily the track resumed on the far side maybe it had been made before the gully was there maybe once upon a time a bridge spanned the gap if so somebodyd bridgenapped it i peered down into the gully wondering if the troll whod lived under the bridgeif thered ever been a bridgecould tell me anything i didnt see any trolls maybe hed been trollnapped maybe thered never been a troll if there had been a troll maybe hed decided he was no homelier than anybody else in shqiperi and gone off to peshkepiia the only thing i was sure of was that he hadnt been in my harem well now what max asked if we went back wed have to go all the way back to the main road essad pasha colonel kemal major mustafa and josйdiego made that seem less than desirable if we went forward we needed wings eliphalet wasnt likely to grant a prayer for them just on the off chance i sent one up anyway eliphalet was not only unlikely to grant one he bloody well didnt i sighed back to that last farm i said we need some rope planning to hang yourself max inquired noyou i said we glared at each other i went on with rope i may be able to get across you may even be able to get across and whats that supposed to mean he asked id kill myself if i tried to swallow your sword i said what kind of a tightrope walker are you weve been walking a tightrope since we got here but that isnt what you meant is it max gave me a large loosejointed shrug better to use the rope to get across the gully than to give it to the hangman he already has plenty of rope to make us dance on air try not to cheer me up any more i said i may fall over and die of joy you can die of all sorts of things in this prophetsforsaken place max said now that were out of the harem joy isnt likely to be one of them we walked back to the farm since wed exchanged endearments with the farmer i wondered whether he would turn his dogsor maybe worse his hogsloose on us can you sell us some rope i called to him in hassocki he looked as much like a bandit as any shqipetar id ever seen which is saying something what do you want it for he asked i know a spell that will make it stand up so we can climb all the way to heaven i answered the less i told him the better off i expected to be the only trouble with saying what i did say was it made him raise his price i suppose he thought any rope that was going to heaven had to be expensive but what a shqipetari farmer finds expensive doesnt badly hurt someone whos been pawing through a royal treasury even a small royal treasury like shqiperis smaller nowoh yes as we headed back to the gully he wanted to follow us max discouraged him max could discourage anything this side of a mammoth i suspect the farmer wasnt much brighter than a mammoth but he was a good deal smaller he decided hed have to get to heaven on his own not on our coattails i thought his odds poor even the quadrate god must be more fussy about the company he keeps than that but the quadrate gods companions arent my worry eliphalet be thanked several tall trees stood on our side of the gully others leaned toward them from the far side but not close enoughnot to someone without special talent anyhow special talent i hador at least i hoped i had i handed max my current share of the royal treasuryand if that doesnt prove i trusted him obstructive and obstreperous as he was nothing ever would i also took off my boots barefoot was better for what id have to do that coil of rope attached to my belt i climbed an oak that had a stout branch sticking out over the gully my target was an outthrust branch on a tall tree on the other side i tied one end of the rope to my branch then i let myself down and then i began to swing back and forth harder and harder each pendulum swing took me farther across the gully i started to feel like part of the works from one of those elaborate mechanical clocks youll see in towers all across schlepsig that other outthrust branch came closer and closer i reached andmissed another swing and then yet another to rebuild the momentum id squandered i reached outand caught the branch i wanted i couldnt pull myself up onto it with one arm i had to let go of the rope with both hands holding on to it with only my feet yes i was glad i had toes to grip with i wished i were a forest ape then i would have come equipped with a couple of extra thumbs what i had sufficed once i was up on the branch on the far side i tied the rope to it then i stood up and also tied the rope to a branch above it and then holding the rest of the coil in my right hand i started back across the tightrope id created a tightrope made a good enough bridge for me it wouldnt do for max not by itself but if he had one strand on which to put his feet and another above it to hold on to i thought that would be good enough to get him across nothing ever turns out to be as simple as you wish it would grrr whos that walking on my bridge grrr no the troll hadnt been there a few minutes before when i looked down into the gully but then the bridge hadnt been there a few minutes before either and there he stood on top of my strand of rope or possibly sheit could only matter to another troll this one had plenty of ugly for both sexes green complexion warts hair fangs claws all the standard equipment including a bad attitude he might have been six inches tall come on he roared in a voice ridiculously deep for anything his size come on you big thing ill bite your toes off i didnt like the sound of that i wasnt sure he could bite a toe off he had a big mouth for anything his size but that big still when youre on a tightrope you dont want anything biting your toes even if not off that could make your day less enjoyable than youd like i thought about imitating the billy goats in the story and asking him to wait till something bigger and tastier came along but i wasnt convinced max is tastier than i am im still not as a matter of fact and even more to the point i wasnt convinced he could knock the troll off the ropei should say the bridgeeven if he went across it wearing boots the burdens of a kingdom still lay on my shoulders even though the kingdom was gone it hardly seemed fair i took a step toward the troll he gnashed those unpleasantlooking teeth why dont you be reasonable i saidreasonably if it werent for me you wouldnt have a bridge where you could annoy people and so ive got one now the troll rushed toward me running along a rope didnt bother him at all i had the rest of the rope though i snapped it as if cracking a whip it caught the troll right in his trollish chops he let out a squawkthis time one of surprise and dismay not one of badtempered rage and he went flying nasty little arms flailing uselessly out and down into the gully i hoped a ferret would eat him just what he deserved though hed probably give the beast heartburn of course i fell off the tightrope too you dont make a violent motion like that on a rope without paying for it but id known i would i caught the rope as i went down and pulled myself back up onto it then i gathered up the second strand again and finished taking it back across the gully well that was entertaining max said when i got back to the side where he waited so glad you were amused i said a lot of things are more entertaining to watch than to do i would put being attacked by a miniature troll while youre walking a tightrope fairly high on the list now that weve got a length of rope for you to hold on to while you cross do you think you can make it over the gully i think id better max said which showed good sense and i think youd better carry the money ill do that i promised you didnt run off with it while i was going across i wont either i should say not where would you run to max said ah do you suppose that thing you larruped is likely to come back i hope not i said sincerely if you want to leave your boots on while youre crossing maybe you can squash it flat if it does or at least kick it off again i didnt believe it but you shouldnt discourage somebody who may have to try something hard and max nodded in something that looked like approval who would have believed it good idea he said how did you come up with it he climbed the tree he is to put it mildly inelegant at such pursuits if there were monkeys in shqiperi they would have killed themselves laughing maybe there are no monkeys in shqiperi because they spent too much time watching clumsy treeclimbers and laughed themselves to death wouldnt surprise me a bit max was every bit as ungracefulmaybe even disgracefuledging out across my makeshift bridge did he hang on tight to the top strand oh you might say so yes you just might did he get from this side of the gully to that one yes he did and how can you ask for more i suspect the nonexistent monkey would have laughed at me too you cannot haul two sacks of silver up into a tree and look good while youre doing it i started across the rope again id got most of the way across when grr whos that walking on my bridge grrr hed learned his lines well i will say that for him but nobodyd blocked his moves for him i was almost to the far side of the gully and there he stood back in the middle of the rope bridge i said please dont eat me master troll why not he roareda damn good roar for his size i must say because youd explode if you tried but no i didnt tell him that since id been thinking of it earlier i gave him the timehonored answer instead because the fellow whos coming after me is much larger and juicier and tastier thats why juicy the troll said and then all right you can cross ill wait for him cross i did as far as i know the troll is waiting yet oh its possible some shqipetar has tried to cross by the rope bridge if he did a grouchy little troll would have annoyed him but more likely the miserable green nuisance is still standing there many goodbyes to him max had had the sense to get down from the tree on the far side of the gully before i crossed over to it when id descended too he asked well what now now on to the coast i said and lets hope we dont run into any more trolls that little pest may have some big friends i dont think ill put eliphalet and zibeon out of business any time soon but that was one of the best prophesies i ended up wishing id never made i didnt have to worry about building my own bridge over this gully a wooden span that looked as old as time already crossed it the bridge seemed solid enough though it certainly had no trouble bearing the weight of the troll who appeared in the middle of it as soon as max and i started across grrr he roared whos that walking on my bridge grrr yes the same old tired line it sounded much more impressive coming from him than it had from the other one because he was at least as tall as max and about four times as wide you and your big mouth max said to me since i was thinking the same thing i couldnt even snarl at him oh maybeprobably eventhe troll would have appeared if i hadnt predicted it that didnt make me feel any better a sixinch troll was ugly and annoying a sixfooteight troll was even uglier and much too likely to be lethal this fellow had warts the size of his little cousin i might have resigned myself to those but he also had fangs and talons about the size of his little cousin by all appearances he intended to use them too do you suppose hes as smart as the little one was max asked out of the side of his mouth i eyed the troll i dont think hell put the seventeen sages out of business any time soon or even ibrahim the wise max snorted ah good old joe he murmured remembering the tubby torinan whod worked for dooger and cark i wonder if his demons devoured him yet and then he did something that convinced me he was no threat to the seventeen sages either he drew his sword and advanced on the troll i drew my sword too and went after him i didnt want him to die out there on the bridge by himself but i didnt really think both of us together could take out that mass of muscles and claws and teeth grrr the troll got louder and angrier as we got closer any moment now he was going to charge that might beunpleasant youre not so tough max said and i wondered if hed come unhinged well noi didnt wonder not even a little bit i was convinced even the troll seemed surprised who says he bellowed ill show you by then we were close enough to be sure hed never made the acquaintance of a fangbrushor if he had he desperately needed a new brand of fangpaste but max just repeated youre not so tough he brandished his blade if youre so tough he went on lets see you do this he threw back his head and swallowed the sword or enough of it as makes no difference the trolls beady bloodshot eyes went wide he jumped up and down on the bridge in his excitement which made those old old timbers creak more than i wished they would gimme that gimme that he shouted and held out a spiked hand youll see max bowed and handed the troll the sword down the creatures throat it wentone great thrust and we saw and it wasnt pretty im afraid after the thrashing stopped at last max extracted the sword from the dead trolls gullet eyeing the gore on it with distaste he said well you were right he wasnt very smart but ill really have to get this steamcleaned before i use it professionally again im sorry for you i said max gave me an odd look hows that i said it again im sorry for you he still looked odd he looks odd a good deal of the time but not odd like that i explained no matter how you cough now you wont be the first one to cut your throat from the inside out oh max stirred the troll with his foot it stayed dead he shrugged well ill just have to live with that and with a little luck ill go on living with it quite a while longer he stepped over the troll a moment later so did i we crossed the bridge and headed east toward the coast to my relief we didnt run into any more trolls the two we did meet seemed like about six too many if we had encountered another one theres no guarantee maxs trick would have worked again i think the odds are decenttrolls pretty plainly arent bright which goes a long way towards explaining why they dont infest more bridgesbut you never can tell ahead of time we came down to the tiberian sea somewhere not too far south of fushekuqe dont ask me exactly how far because i havent the slightest idea it was still beach thougha nice stretch of sandand not rocks in narbonensis and torino and leon theres a growing custom of going to the beach taking off most of your clothes and baking under the sun not in shqiperi nothing there but sandand us well almost someone was walking along the sand as max and i got closer we saw it was the ineffable bob no i dont know what he was doing there im sure he didnt know what he was doing there interviewing sea gulls and sandpipers i suppose i daresay he expected them to understand albionese too i tried not to pay any attention to him a couple of fishing boats bobbed no i didnt do that on purposeof course i didnt not too far offshore i waved to the nearer one i hallooed i didnt think it would take a whole lot of the royal treasury to persuade the skipper to carry max and me across to torino somebody on the boat waved back somebody else raised the sail the boat began gliding toward the beach bob came up to me good day your majesty he saidin albionese naturally i dont know how he recognized max and memaybe somebodyd told him we might be wearing native costume that would have let him see us when we werent in uniform bob i dont speak albionese i saidin albionese the breeze gently ruffled his toupee he frowned at mesomething was going on inside his head i hadnt been sure anything could but i finally found a standard of comparison for bob he was brighter than a troll than two trolls in fact maybe even than two trolls put together though id have a harder time proving that his heavy features worked youyou just did he said point him at the obvious and shove him forward and he mightjust might mind youflatten his nose against it well what if i did i replied still in his language but you didnt before bob paused i dont believe it was in thoughtthe breeze picked up and tried to pick up his notquitemasterpiece of tonsorial artifice he hastily jammed it back almost into place still that brief gust of wind directly on his pate must have improved the functioning of the brain under it for he came out with something that came close to counting for insight or you didnt seem to anyhow his rheumy eyes narrowed in suspicion i nodded in approval of his mental calisthenics youre righti didnt seem to why didnt you was that a scribes probing inquiry or a childs blind naпvetй i only ask the questionsyou have to answer them because as far as i know prince halim eddin doesnt speak any albionese i waited again you had to wait with bob nothing ever happened in a hurry with him except for the small language difficulty he was made for the nekemte peninsula at last things percolated through thenyou really arent prince halim eddin he exclaimed i set a fond hand on his shoulder nothing gets past you does it i said that must be why essad pasha is so interested in finding you he added its a good thing we have such clever scribes otherwise no one in the world would have any idea whats going on of course by the evidence no one in the world does have any idea whats going on which meanswell you might be better off not dwelling on what it means oh is essad pasha looking for me i asked as innocently as only a guilty man could i should say he is bob replied he gasped as a new idea struck himand well he might have because such a thing didnt happen every day or every month either theres a story in this i would have told it to him i would have been glad to tell it to him he and the other bloody scribes had already ruined my reign thanks to them i wouldnt be a famous king since i wouldnt be famous being notorious would have to do yes i would have told him everythingexcept that by then the fishing boat was close enough to hail can you take two men across to torino i shouted in hassocki to the graybearded fellow at the bow bob made a frustrated noise why his journal sent him down to shqiperi when he spoke only albionese would be beyond me if i didnt know how many of his countrymen are just as provincial as he is the fisherman didnt even blink ten piasters apiece he called in the same tongue that was cheaper than id expected i wondered if he was a smalltime smuggler who went from one coast of the tiberian sea to the other all the time i wouldnt have been surprised even though the price was reasonable i haggled for forms sakei didnt want him to get the idea that i had so much money i didnt care what i spent after a few goodnatured curses on both sides we settled on eight piasters apiece in came the boat it looked a bit large to beach itself to take us aboard i supposed we would have to wade out a ways and get wet max plunged his sword into the sand again and again to scour off the trolls blood im sure he wouldnt have wanted to swallow it again right after that but at least the blade wouldnt rust i just saw a funny thing no that wasnt max or bob or the fisherman that was a gull that had landed on the beach about twenty feet from me after gliding in from the north i remembered the taste of dragons blood by essad pashas shooting box i havent talked much since about understanding the speech of birds and animals for a very simple reason most of the time birds and animals havent got anything interesting to say they might as well be people i wouldnt talk about this gull either except that a sandpiper asked what kind of funny thing the gull flicked a yelloweyed glance toward max and me and even bob one of these useless featherless creatures riding a horse this way only it had two heads i didnt think the bird meant the horse had two heads even if it could have done a better job of straightening out its syntax what i did think was if josйdiego is riding this way how far behind is essad pasha did i want to find out that damn fishing boat better hurry up or were going to have a problem i told max how do you know he said a little bird told me i answered max may not have known i meant it literally he didnt taste the dragons blood himself but i had only a couple of minutes start on him as things worked out the gull knew what it was talking about all right here came josйdiego riding south down the beachand riding hell for leather on catching sight of max and me hetheyshouted something in leonese i couldnt quite make out what it was but it didnt sound complimentary here came the fishing boat the fisherman was being cautious as he drew close to shore bob was standing around scratching his headcarefully so as not to rumple his rugand wondering what was going on bob spent a lot of time wondering what was going on poor sap just as the fisherman waved to us to come aboard josйdiego sprang down from histheir horse hes usually clumsyjosй tells his body one thing while diego tells it something else this time though they were both telling it the same thing for some reason or other neither josй nor diego was very happy with me their body drew a dagger and charged throw me in a dungeon will you josй shoutedi think it was josй lock me up will youwith no one to talk to but him diego screamedi believe it was diego youll pay for that they roared togetherim sure it was both of them i started to dodge with my acrobatic grace it should have been easyexcept i stumbled in the sand that cursed dagger caught me right in the middle of my chest yes im still here no you dont see dead peopleim not ghostwriting this tale what happened was the blade snapped in half josйdiego howled in horrified disbelief me i smiled more smugly than the circumstances probably justified but a dragon scale even without a silver backing is more than enough to turn any ordinary blade max tackled josйdiego down hetheywent i jumped on himthemwhatever you please if i remember straight max pounded on josй while i beat on diego but it could have been the other way round after wed knocked both heads together a few times their arms and legs stopped paying attention to either one of him that was what wed had in mind we got to our feet brushed sand off each other and waded out into the blue tiberian sea bob clapped his hands my he said that was exciting he knelt beside josйdiego would either one of you care to give me your comments in regard to this incident both josй and diego were too battered to make much sense right then besides i dont think either one of them spoke albionese bob didnt care well maybe he did care but he couldnt do anything about it because he didnt speak anything else the blind misleading the deaf you might say the fisherman reached out a hand and helped us into the boat one after the other north and south east and west you have a strange foe he said no wonder you want to put the width of the sea between yourselves and him no wonder at all i said he held out his hand palm up i gave him eight piasters youll get the other half when you put us ashore in torino i told him be it so he said not in the least put out you will be a man who has traveled with strangers before now and then i agreed yes every now and then he shouted to the other three men in the boat one worked the rudder the other two trimmed the sails the boat nimbly spun about and started for torino i waved goodbye to bob i dont think he saw me he was kneeling on the sand still trying to squeeze a story out of josйdiego xix as we neared the torinan coast the skipper of the fishing boathis name was hysniasked you wont want to come right into a regular port will you i looked at max max looked at me we both shook our heads the motions so nearly identical we would have got a big laugh on any stage well now that you mention it no i said hysni smiled a thin smile didnt think so he said a few minutes later he added bugger customs men anyway since max and i were carrying as much of the shqipetari royal treasury as we could i sympathized with hysnis enlightened attitude officials might have found some really tedious questions about the money best to avoid all those unpleasant possibilities if we could and we could hysni put us ashore towards evening on a beach not too far from a townbut not too close to one either i happily paid him the other half of our fee he was so forthrightly mercenary he made doing business with him a pleasure good luck he said north and south east and west good luck north and south east and west may good luck sail with you i said he smiled so did the other fishermen who were his sons and his nephew max and i splashed up onto the sand the fishing boat smartly put about and started back to shqiperi watching hysni and his kinsfolk sail west into the setting sun max murmured poor bastards max always was so sentimental i poked him in the ribs now i said now what he answered irritably and what the demon was that for anyhow we went into shqiperi i said i bloody well ruled as king of shqiperi we screwed ourselves sillysillierand we got out of shqiperi not only that we got out of shqiperi with more than we came in i nudged my leather sack with the toe of my boot it clinked softly as if to remind max how right i was now i get to say i told you so thats what and now you get to admit that i told you so too i waited i folded my arms across my chest so i could wait in the proper royal style i still felt like the king of shqiperi even if id had my reign unfortunately cut short you told me so max agreed being max he couldnt just leave it at that oh no and i told you you were out of your mind right from the start and eliphalet turn his back on me if i was wrong i thought about that well maybe i said but i got away with it i poked him in the ribs again i had some pretty good help too captain yildirim he poked me back yes your majesty we both started to laugh no im not making that up max really and truly started to laugh twice in the space of a few days what was the world coming to after a while i asked do you want to find a town now or do you want to spend the night on the beach and find one in the morning id just as soon sleep here max answered im not what youd call hungry or anything neither was i hysni had fed us well oninevitablyfried fish suits me i said this will do well enoughbetter than well enoughfor tonight our clothes will dry out too well need new ones max said they dont wear this kind of stuff here and i wont miss it a bit either you speak torinan dont you sureenough to get by with anyhow i said they wont think im a native or anything but theyll understand me how about you maybe enough to get my face slapped max replied and how much more of a language than that do you really need anyhow we lay down and stretched ourselves out the sand made a fine mattress my sack of silver a perfectly lovely pillow more shqipetari riffraff the clothier muttered peering at max and me around the promontory of his nose torinans like shqipetari about as well as lokrians do and for about the same reasons men come from the land of the eagle looking for work and they steal if they dont find it or sometimes even if they do i wanted to curse the fellow in hassocki but he wouldnt have understood me the hassockian empire never got to torino so its oaths and obscenities never got there either torinans have to make do with their own set which is distinctly impoverished by comparison do you always try to run customers out of your shop i inquired in my bestindifferenttorinan customers he laughed as if id said something funny customers have money shqipetari have i wasnt quite sure what he said then but i believe it involved irreverent affection for a donkey no that was your mother i said while he was still gaping i set enough silver on the counter to make him gape in a whole new way noware we customers or do we give our business to an honest man instead he started to reach for the silver i started to reach for my sword max started to reach for his the clothiers hand suddenly had second thoughts you are customers he allowed and said nothing more about donkeys what is it you want civilized clothes i answered and said nothing more about his mother we went into shqiperi and we got out again and now we dont have to look like we live there any more you i can fit with no trouble he said and then eyed max with the dismay clothiers have eyed him with since he was fourteen years old your friend i am afraid will take a little longer my friend is a little longer i agreed he will cost extra too the clothier said a little extra i suppose i said not a lot torinans think theyre good hagglers put them next to schlepsigians or albionese who hardly haggle at all and theyre right in the nekemte peninsula theyd be picked to skin and bones before they knew what hit them i was used to playing a tougher game than the clothier i got the price i wanted without even coming close to mentioning his mother again by that afternoon max and i looked like a couple of men whod just bought new clothes in a torinan provincial town it could have been worse we could have gone on looking like shqipetari people gawked at max when we bought fares on a northbound stage but people gawk at maxs inches even in schlepsig though he did seem to have more of them in torino where the folk are mostly shorter and the fellow who sold us our tickets smiled at my accent you are from the north eh he said you speak dialect up in that part of the kingdom he didnt think i was a foreigner mind he just thought i talked funny well i thought heand the clothier and everybody else down theretalked funny too its true that the lovely and talented lady and she was both dear annaluisa was from whom i learned most of my torinan did come from the north i was happy enough to follow her lead in whatever she didyoud best believe i was she didnt slap my face either i was luckier with her than max was with the girl from whom hed learned his little bits of the language and i was luckier when it came to the coach max eyed it with distaste crammed into another bloody shoebox he said would you rather stay in torino i asked him weathers better he said which is true after youve sailed the middle sea you can never look at the weather in schlepsig the same way again but in the end he shook his head no ill go home too an hour later than it should have the coach rattled north even though a small woman sat across from him max didnt have much legroom i didnt either i dont think anyone else on the coach did but max had it worse than the rest of us we were all glad to stretch our legs when we got to the next town this one boasted a consolidated crystal office across from the depot i stretched my legs by walking over there the crystallographers inside wore turbans i smiled seeing myself back in a civilized kingdom i sent my message to several leading schlepsigian journals the exiled king of shqiperi returns to his homeland it said i hoped that would pique some interest scribes had helped bring my reign to a premature end but i couldnt make my bid for fame without them now it was like sitting down to supper with a dragon you know you may be the next course but if youre hungry enough you have to take the chance when i got back to the depot one of the clerks recognized that my accent was foreign not just northern your passport please sir he said seeing that max was traveling with me the clerk asked for his too he looked up from them a moment later his face a dark cloud i am afraid you two gentlemen do not have proper torinan entry stamps this is a matter of some importance since flouting our regulations can lead to a fine or imprisonment or both at the judges discretion i am devastated i cried and clapped a hand to my hearttorinans love melodrama what can we do after a bit of dickering we did it from that time forward our passports did boast proper torinan entry stamps well they boasted properlooking torinan entry stamps anyhow a forensic wizard might have expressed a different opinion but how likely was it that a forensic wizard would examine the properlooking passports of a couple of obviously respectable obviously innocent travelers not very i hoped when we got up into the north of torino i sent the journals in schlepsig another message this one letting them know where and when i was likely to come up into schlepsig i hadnt wanted to do that before since travel in torino is tardy and inefficient enough to come right out of the nekemte peninsula and things in the dual monarchy arent always better the turbaned crystallographer who sent my message said so youre the fellow who pretended to be the hassocki prince are you thats me i strutted a little even sitting down so youve heard of me eh maybe the scribes in shqiperi were good for something after all and sure enough the crystallographer nodded i showed off a little more then i asked what do you think of me what does the world think of me you must have been out of your mind to try it and youre lucky you got away with your neck he answered without the least hesitation one good thing anyhow max wasnt along to hear him say it our passports passed muster when we passed from torino to the dual monarchy the customs official at the border checkpoint added more stamps why were you in torino he asked like most officials in the dual monarchy he was of schlepsigian blood like some other schlepsigian officials ive known he liked to throw his weight around just because he could id just escaped from shqiperi i answered and what were you doing in shqiperi he asked as if id just confessed to some horrible depravity in his eyes no doubt i had i was being king of shqiperi i said not without pride and his whole attitude changed he pounded me on the back he clasped my hand he gave me a knock of cherry brandy from a flask on his belt he gave max a knock too when he found out id had an enormous aidedecamp max drank only with the greatest suspicion now that you mention it so did i who ever heard of a customs official acting like a human being but this one had his reasons youre the fellow who turned the dragons loose on the belagorans he exclaimed by eliphalets toes theyve been screeching like a bunch of cats with their tails under rocking chairs for the past week i looked at max max was looking at me zogus magic had worked again he was no lightweight wizard not zogu he was wasted there in peshkepiia the way stagiros the weatherworker was wasted aboard the gamemeno both of themand how many otherscould have done so much more with themselves if only theyd got the chance all of a sudden nothing was too good for max and me the dual monarchy hated and feared belagora and vlachia because even then they were doing their best to lure their relatives inside the monarchy away from vindobon and the kingemperor and into some kind of kingdom with them the vlachs werent fussy over how they went about it either and so anybody whod given the belagorans a good tweak was a friend of the dual monarchys max and i rode in government coaches fit for a grand dukewhich i suppose made them more or less fit for a king too we feasted at every stop we got put up at the grandest hostels no one asked for a thaler from usor even for a copper thent i was almost sorry to cross the border into schlepsig oh and we got there ahead of schedule which in the dual monarchy is as near unheardof as makes no difference crossing into schlepsig ahead of schedule complicated things for me i wanted to tell my story and the stupid scribes hadnt got there to hear it you just cant rely on those people theyre there when they shouldnt be they stir up trouble when you dont want them toand when you really need them where are they and then at last they finally did show up took them bloody long enough thats all ive got to tell you but they listened as i told my tale they listened as max told his too one enterprising journal sent along a sketch artist as well as a scribe he did my portraiti still have the original as a matter of fact that outfit ran the picture of me next to the one of prince halim eddin that had started my adventure one man or two it said below them i was a nine days wonder i might have been an eleven days wonder exceptwell well get to that soon enough because of all the stories about me i got offers from three or four of the biggest circus companies in schlepsigand later after some of the stories were translated from troupes in narbonensis and albion and even tver where they take the circus very seriously indeed max also got his share of offers he got inducted into the swordswallowers hall of fame too if you didnt know there was such a thing as the swordswallowers hall of fame well neither did i and as max confessed after a few beers one night neither did he the circus of dr ola has to be the best company in all of schlepsig max and i both signed on there with what they paidand with what wed brought back from shqiperiwe wouldnt have to worry about money again as long as we stayed anywhere close to careful dooger and carks traveling emporium of marvels ive spent a lot of timea lot of timetrying to forget dooger and carks i havent done it yet but every year i gain a little as things worked out i would have been glad to hire on with the circus of dr ola if they hadnt paid me a kram the proprietors real name is gunther by the way and hes no more a doctor than i amless if anything because ive bandaged wounds on the battlefield but i dont want to talk about gunther however admirable he may be he is a good fellow but not so good that i would have been willing to work for him for nothingexcept for kдthe if you can imagine ilona even betterlooking even bettershaped andeventempered you have a good start on kдthe and im gladand everyones gladshe is eventempered too because she does trick shooting with a crossbow the likes of which the world has never seen the likes of thats what the barker says about it and eliphalet smite me if hes not right shell shoot doves on the wingbehind her back aiming with a mirror yes i know its impossible she does it anyway once before i knew her she shot a lighted cigar out of the king of schlepsigs mouth from twenty yards what would you have done if you missed i asked when i heard about that meaning what would they have done to you i didnt even think about it then she answered and i believe heryou dont think about what can go wrong when youre doing a stunt or else it will you just make sure you do it right afterwards she didnt go on for a little while then she said i only did that once eliphalet i bet you did i said we didnt fall for each other right away but it didnt take too long either one afternoon when we were getting ready for a show she said weve both done a lot of things and weve both done them with a lot of other people i nodded i already knew she wasnt a maiden or anything close to a maiden as if i minded but she went on that was fine then if were going to get along from now on though we probably shouldnt do those things with anybody else any more and i nodded again and we didnt and we havent and its a boy and two girls and a fair number of years later and i havent missed the variety a bitexcept every once in a while and kдthes never oncenever once mind yousaid a word about shooting a crossbow quarrel in one ear and out the other to say nothing of shooting one through some even more tender spots if i slipped i told you she was eventempered as for me i have sense enough to know when im well off yes i really donow you need to keep a sense of proportion speaking of a sense of proportion max fell for a little trapeze artist named rita and when i say little i mean little shes got to be two feet shorter than he is of course all girls are short to max i wondered if they could enjoy more postures because of the difference in size or if it closed some off for them before i met kдthe i probably would have just asked him nowim still wondering shescivilized me she has believe it or not max and i did fine in the circus of dr ola we were billed as king halim eddin and captain yildirim and performed in costumes garish enough to embarrass barisha let alone count rappaport as i say we might have been eleven days wonders in schlepsig instead of just nine we might have been but we werent the second round of the nekemte wars crowded us out of the journals not a kingdom in the nekemte peninsula was happy about what it had stolen from the hassockian empire the first time around plovdiv wanted thasos which lokris was holding on to and more of what used to be fyrom just north of there lokris wanted southern shqiperi and more of fyrom vlachia wanted northern shqiperi and more of fyrom belagora wanted northern shqiperi too belagora doesnt come close to bordering fyrom but probably wanted some of it anyhow essad pasha kept hanging on in shqiperi even without a king to call his own he didnt lose any to belagora not least thanks to my dragons and thank you zogu he didnt lose any to vlachia not least thanks to the dual monarchy and he didnt lose any to lokris not least thanks to well the lokrians farther west plovdiv tried to chase lokris and vlachia out of the part of fyrom the plovdivians thought should belong to them which is to say most of it how do i put this politely it didnt work lokris and vlachia thrashed plovdiv in fyrom dacia which hadnt even been in the first round of the nekemte wars jumped plovdiv from the north and even the hassocki sallied forth and took back the fortress of edirne so when the dust settled plovdiv had to cough up its chunk of fyrom to lokris and vlachia and some land in the northwest to dacia and the territory up to and even past edirne to the hassocki again which must have been even more embarrassing than everything else that happened to her now thered been two rounds of war down there and everybodyexcept possibly daciawas still unhappy of course the only way to make anybody in the nekemte peninsula really happy is to slaughter all his neighbors out to the horizon they were still working up to that but they hadnt got there yet then the powers gave shqiperi a king whether essad pashaand the shqipetariliked it or not wilhelm the weed i think they called him a schlepsigian prince with time on his hands he went down there but he couldnt make essad pasha or anyone else pay any attention to him i had better luck than that by eliphalets strong right hand and thenand thenwell how do you talk about the start of the war of the kingdoms without breaking down and sobbing how do you talk about the vlach werewolf who tore out the throat of the dual monarchs heirand the poor princes wifes toobefore a silver crossbow quarrel killed him how do you talk about the vlach werewolf who had friends at the court of the king of vlachia once upon a time i said the vlachs might huff and puff and blow the nekemte peninsula down the vlachs huffed and they puffed and they almostalmostblew the world down when they didnt do enough to show the dual monarchy they were sorry if they were sorry instead of laughing behind their hands which is more likely the kingemperor declared war on vlachia then tver declared war on the dual monarchy because tver was vlachias ally then schlepsig my schlepsig declared war on tver because schlepsig was the dual monarchys ally then narbonensis declared war on schlepsig because narbonensis was tvers ally narbonensis had fortified its border with schlepsig clearly with evil intent to get at the narbonese my kingdom had to march its soldiers north of narbonensis through the little kingdom of bruges yes years ago an earlier king of schlepsig signed a treaty promising not to do any such thing but whats a treaty only a scrap of paper because of a scrap of paper albion perfidious albion declared war on schlepsig all the same everybody thought wed beat narbonensis in a hurry turn around and give the tverskis a couple of good ones in the slats and go home again before the leaves fell onlyit didnt quite work out that way with help from albion and with the brugeoisie fighting like fiends the narbonese held us in front of lutetia and we did give the tverskis a couple of good ones but so what tver is so big she can take more than anybody else can dish out the war dragged onand on the hassockian empire came in on our side so did plovdiv torino was supposed to but decided to jump on the dual monarchys back instead dacia tried to do the same thing and promptly got squashed for her trouble for a while the circus of dr ola toured behind the lines entertaining troops on leave so did other troupes then more and more of the men started putting on pikegray uniforms themselves my own call came when the war was about a year old just after kдthe had our first i speak good narbonese they could have sent me east i speak fluent hassockido i ever they could have sent me southwest i speak pretty fair torinan they could have sent me south when schlepsig gave the dual monarchy a hand down there i would have been truly useful in any of those places they shipped me west to fight tver i have little bits of vlachian which is sort of like tverski in other words in that fight i was no more useful than any other soldier and less useful than quite a few did they care ha i was a body i could shoot a crossbow that they cared about we could beat the tverskis whenever we set our minds to it it did us less good than we hoped it would i shot a few of the poor bastards some of them only had hunting bows it hardly seemed fair then one of the lousy zibeonites shot me in the arm and i stopped caring whether it was fair or not max max never never did get into pikegray turns out they didnt make uniformsand especially bootslarge enough to fit him he went on swallowing his own sword all through the war and never had to worry about anybody elses just as well i suppose he would have been a demon of a big target thanks to some good medical magecraft the arm healed fine i went back to the lineand got shot in the leg i was evidently a demon of a big target myself we managed to knock tver out of the war while i was laid up the second time and no i dont call that cause and effect but vespucciland came in about then the cursed vesps were getting rich selling albion and narbonensis everything under the sun they wanted to protect their investment eliphalet afflict them with carbuncles we fought for four years all told till we couldnt fight any more then we threw in the sponge the king abdicated there was a short civil war till we got a new one whos only distantly connected to the old royal house we lost land worse we lost face and at that we were lucky tver had a peasants revolt and councils of peasants and artisans are trying to run the place till someone steels himself to put a crown on his head the dual monarchy fell to pieces all the pieces declared themselves kingdoms of their own or else joined neighboring kingdomsgreat vlachia got too big for its own britches in a hurry but its still not big enough to be a power the old dynasty still hangs on in the eastmarch which isnt much to hang on to and the hassockian empire also fell apart their old imperial family had to run for its life theyve got a tough new atabeg named kemal no i dont think hes the one i jugged whos trying to whip whats left of them into shape well see what comes of that if anything ever does shqiperi shqiperis a bloody mess but then shqiperis always been a bloody mess so it hasnt changed as much as most of the world has wilhelm the weed didnt lasthe ran away during the war essad pasha didnt last eithersomebody murdered him right after the war i wonder how many suspects there were the whole population of shqiperi minus about twelve i suppose last i heard someone named zogu claimed to be running things there that zogu my zogu i dont know if it is they could do worse and they probably will after the war of the kingdoms i half hoped the shqipetari would call me back to take over again no doubt wilhelm the weed hoped the same thing were both still waiting im afraid i dont know about wilhelm but ive given up holding my breath just as well kдthe said when i told her that havent you got enough going on right here this was just after we had our third so no denying she had a point once i came home for good i needed a while before i started performing again that isnt just or even mainly because i got wounded twice while i wore the pikegray part of its because like a lot of soldiers coming home from the war i was too gloomy and disappointed to care about anything wed done so much wed suffered so much and what did we have to show for it nothing nothing at all i needed a while to get over that who gives a damn feeling and part of its simply because id got out of practice you dont practice for a day or two and you notice youre off when you go back to it you dont practice for a month or two and the audience notices youre off at the front i didnt practice for much longer than a month or two if a lot of your performance involves going up there on a tightrope the audience is like to notice because you fall off and go splat not good little by little i eased myself into it again i wasnt the only veteran coming back to the circus of dr ola and i wasnt the only one who had trouble picking up where hed left off the circus wasnt the same either the circuit was smaller and so was the pay after the war they didnt want to watch performing schlepsigians in narbonensis or torino or albion or gdansk yes gdansk has risen from the deadtill the next time her neighbors pound a stake into her heart so we played in schlepsig and the eastmarch with an occasional foray into yagmaria whose new king is an old admiral from the dual monarchy which would make more sense if yagmaria had a coastline i knew i wasnt going on any more grand adventures after youve been king how can you top that i found myself doing more behind the scenes than i ever had too arranging for coaches and wagons booking halls and hostels seeing that things ran smoothly for the circus i still get out in front of the crowds every so often but thats mostly when the circus plays near putzig the little town where kдthe and i settled down with the children you see i ended up normal which for me is an even bigger surprise than ending up king im a good citizen im a breadwinner im the father of a family sometimes when the bookings are more complicated than usual i hurry down the street to the cc office carrying my papers in a briefcase a briefcase me normal as you please no more hijinks for me well hardly any because i dont tour much any more i was at home when someone knocked on the front door one mild summer morning i think i muttered a little as i got up from my desk a hostel in the eastmarch had just written to say they couldnt take us after all and i had to scramble to find the troupe some other place to stay next week i didnt fancy getting interrupted just then if it was a peddler i aimed to send him away with a flea in his ear the man at the door wasnt a peddler he wasnt a neighbor come to borrow a hammer or scrounge a cigar id never met him before but he looked familiar and well he might have he was wearing my face close enough anyhow after a nervous moment when we sized each other up i managed a bow and spoke in hassocki wont you please come in your highness prince halim eddin courteously returned the bow thank you very muchyour majesty he said in excellent schlepsigian his voice wasnt really much like mine it was a bit higher and a lot more musical i cant carry a tune in a sack but you could tell just by listening to him talk that hed be able to sing i got him settled on the sofa i brought him coffee the thinner brew we make in schlepsig but it was what i had i fixed myself a cup too i also brought out a bottle of narbonese brandy and set it on the table in front of him for improving the coffee if you care to i said he did i did too i needed it he didnt bother flicking away the ritual drop he just drank its a great privilege to make your acquaintance at last sir i told him he raised an eyebrow he didnt pluck them any more i was going to say the same thing to you he answered now that i see you i see how you brought it off the resemblance is remarkable isnt it it is i agreed we looked all the more like each other because he had on a homburg and a sack suit i might have worn myself even if the suit was cut more conservatively than i favor i took a big swig of that improved coffee and said i daresay ive owed you an apology for a good many years for whatever its worth to you now you have it i dont want it i dont need it he was still studying me north and south east and west how did you have the nerve do you know what essad pasha would have done to you if hed realized you werent me have you got any idea i tried not to think about that i said i believe it halim eddin poured more brandy into his coffeecup he took another sip then eyed me again why because it was the grandest role id ever have the chance to play i said i was a king i really was a king for five days i was i dont know if that makes any sense to you oh yes he said softly oh yes you must remember you had five more days as king than i ever did you had five more days as king than i ever would have even if the dynasty survived my dear uncle told me he would take a month killing me if i tried to go to shqiperi he thought i would rise against him if i did he thought everyone would rise against him he let out a harsh chuckle and in the end he was right everyone didnot that he hadnt earned it id never thought my going to shqiperi might endanger the real halim eddin truth to tell i hadnt cared what did he do when he heard youi mean iwas there after all he came to my home he had to see me with his own eyeshe had to hit me with his own fistbefore he would believe i wasnt in peshkepiia halim eddin said it wasan unpleasant afternoon i didnt think i wanted to ask him any more about that instead i said what do you do these days i teach hassocki i buy and sell i do well enough im not rich but im not poor either he replied i live by your customs here i have one wife three children what of you one wife and three children also i said im slowly easing out of performing after i played your part none of the others seemed to matter so much i help keep the circus running smoothly and i do some gardening out back of the housei grow herbs and flowers i shrugged its a hobby we twist the arm of coincidence again halim eddin said for i am a gardener too would you like to see what im up to then i asked nothing would please me more he said as we walked out to my plot he found a question of his own and how did you like your harem it was a lot of fun for a little while i answered but do you know what one woman is plenty as long as shes the right one i more than halfway thought he would laugh at me but he only said i have found the same thing the right one is worth any number of wrong ones i opened the back door for him he stepped out then paused to look at what i was doing his nod of approval was worth gold to me ah this is fine this is fine indeed im so glad it pleases you i told him inside a border of roses some red some yellow i grew neat rows of sweet basil and rocket and anise i was particularly proud of the last which is not easy to raise in schlepsig because of the cold winters rocks with hollows underneathplaced north and south east and westsheltered grass snakes and smooth snakes every so often i would find a cast skin those crushed blue pills zogu usedi do manage without them yes i do halim eddin nodded again very much had you started it when you were younger it would have been wilder i think and i might have liked it that way myself then now i prefer things neater and tidier too he said candidly as we go through our lives we all must cultivate our gardens as best we can yes i said and we stood there together in the warm sunshine
