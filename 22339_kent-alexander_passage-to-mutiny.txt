alexander kent passage to mutiny bolitho epilogue where lies the land to which the ship would go far far ahead is all her seamen know and where lies the land she travels from away far far behind is all that they can say arthur hugh clough all things remembered it was almost noon and the sun which blazed across sydney harbour was pitiless in its intensity the sky above the capital of the infant colony should have been bright blue but it was blurred as if seen through a crudely made glass and the air around the waterfront buildings and anchorage alike felt gritty and humid isolated and apart from the varied collection of local shipping and heavier merchantmen a manofwar stood above her reflection as if she had been there forever as if she would never move again her ensign flapped only occasionally above her high poop and the commodores broad pendant which flew from her mainmast truck was only a little more enthusiastic but despite the heat and discomfort her decks were alive with watching figures as they had been for some while since another british manofwar had been reported entering the anchorage the commodore leaned his palms on the sill of his cabin windows and withdrew them hurriedly the dried wood felt like a heated cannon but he watched nevertheless conscious of the unusual silence throughout his command as the newcomer crawled closer and closer across the glittering water her masts and yards and then her curved beakhead taking shape and clarity above the haze the commodores flagship was the old hebrus a small twodecker of sixtyfour guns which had been ready for disposal after nearly thirty years of service then she and her commodore had been given just one more commission now on this october day in anchored as senior british naval vessel in sydney harbour she was still expected to act if need be with her old efficiency and relish although many of her officers secretly believed she would be hard put to reach england if her recall was ever offered the other ship was a frigate common enough in times of war and at any other place where their agility and speed might be required at short notice but out here thousands of miles from home and familiar faces and customs a kings ship was rare and all the more welcome her presence accounted for the hebruss silence every man watching her painstaking entrance in the merest breath of wind would be seeing her differently a town in england perhaps a voice children he could barely remember the commodore grunted and straightened his back the effort bringing a prickle of sweat across his spine it was absurd the new arrival was the thirtysixgun frigate tempest and she had never been to england at all he waited as his servant padded around him with dress coat and sword the trappings of officialdom and ceremony remembering what he had heard about tempest it was strange how circumstances could affect a ships purpose as well as the lives of the many who might serve her six years earlier when war with the american colonies and the francospanish alliance had come to a close ships which had been worth their weight in gold in battle were like most of their companies no longer wanted a country soon forgot those who had fought and died for it so a ships survival seemed of even less importance but peace between the great powers had never been very secure at least to those who had been involved in the price of each bloody victory and now there was renewed tension with spain which could just as easily fan into something worse it was over rival claims to various territories which each hoped to exploit for trading and colonial purposes once again the admiralty had been directed to search around for more frigates the lifeline of every fleet the tempest had been built in the honourable east india companys yard at bombay just four years back as with most of john companys ships she was constructed of the finest malabar teak and to the best available design unlike the navy the companys ships were always built with long usage in mind and with some regard for those who had to work them the admiraltys agents in bombay had purchased her for the kings service without her ever sailing under a company flag she had cost them eighteen thousand pounds the admiralty must have been desperate to pay such a princely sum the commodore thought privately or else as was equally likely a little extra gold had changed hands in other directions he gestured for his silent servant to offer him his telescope he waited for the hebrus to swing very slightly to her cable and then trained the glass on the slowmoving ship like most sea officers he was always impressed by the sight of a frigate this one was heavier than he was used to but still retained the graceful proportions the appearance of latent speed and manoeuvrability which made them every junior officers dream despite the damned haze he could see a cluster of figures around her forecastle one anchor catted and ready to let go as she glided purposefully above her twin on the blue water her stem barely raising a ripple under topsails and jib only her canvas filling and then flapping emptily while she changed tack to take advantage of the poor breeze he could almost feel the excitement across the water the sight of a port any port always dulled the memory of hardship and sometimes brutal conditions which had got them this far the commodore had been expecting the tempest two weeks or more earlier than this she had come from madras and despatches he had already received from a courier brig had left him in no doubt tempest would arrive on time but he was not irritated as he might have been with other ships tempest was under the command of one captain richard bolitho not a friend exactly but a fellow cornishman and that out here in this misery of convicts and foul conditions fever and corruption was worth almost as much he levelled the glass again he could now make out the frigates figurehead a wildeyed girl with streaming hair her breasts outthrust as she held a horn fashioned like a great shell to her lips her hair and torso were painted in bright gilt only her eyes were blue and intense while they stared far ahead as if to follow the makings of her tempest the gilt on her and the gingerbread around the part of the poop yet visible must have cost bolitho a small fortune he decided but in these waters there was little else to spend your money on he winced as he heard his marines stamping along to the entry port even their boots seemed loud and heavy enough to shake the poor old hebrus apart a lieutenant peered respectfully through the screen door the commodore nodded curtly not wishing his subordinate to see that he was so interested in the other ship yes yes i know ill come up even as he reached for his hat the first bang of the salute echoed across the harbour making the dozing birds lift from the water flapping and squawking to reprimand the newcomer for disturbing them on the quarterdeck and despite the spread of an awning it was like a kiln the flag captain touched his hat and studied his superiors mood tempest thirtysix sir captain richard bolitho gun for gun the salute continued the dark smoke pressed down on the water as if by something solid the commodore thrust his hands behind him make a signal as soon as she is anchored captain repair on board the captain hid a smile the mood was good he had known times when he had made a dozen signals right in the middle of another ships lastminute manoeuvring as if he had enjoyed the apparent confusion caused there must be something special about this one he thought with her topsails shivering to the regular crash of her elevengun salute to the commodore his britannic majestys frigate tempest continued slowly across the harbour the glare on the surface was so fierce that it was painful to look much beyond the rigging or gangways richard bolitho stood aft at the quarterdeck rail his hands locked loosely behind his back trying to appear relaxed despite all the usual tensions of entering an unfamiliar anchorage how still it was he glanced along his ship wondering how she would appear to the commodore he had taken command of tempest in bombay when she had been commissioned for the navy just two years ago the thought of the actual date made him smile changing his grave expression to one of youthfulness for it had been his birthday as it was today on this the th of october after making one more in a countless line of forgotten landfalls richard bolitho of falmouth in the county of cornwall was thirtythree years old he glanced quickly to the other side of the deck where thomas herrick the first lieutenant and his best friend was peering beneath the shade of one hand while he studied the set of the braced yards and the shortened shapes of the barebacked topmen he wondered if herrick had remembered bolitho hoped not in these waters with week following week of disagreeable climate and persistent calms you were all too conscious of the passing of time bout five minutes now sir very well mr lakey bolitho did not have to look round in the two years of his command in tempest he knew the voice and temperament of all those who had served with him for most of the period tobias lakey was the lean taciturn sailing master born and raised in the spartan reality of the scilly isles off the tip of bolithos own cornwall he had gone to sea at the age of eight he was about forty now in all those years in every sort of vessel from fishing boat to a ship of the line there was little of the seas ways he had still to learn bolitho glanced slowly along the deck trying to recall all the other faces which had vanished in the two years death and injury disease and desertion the faces had come and gone like the tides now tempests company was much like any other in a vessel which had never touched a british port and as mixed as the waterfronts she had seen in her voyages some were men who really wished to make the navy their career usually they had signed on other ships in england and had transferred to any available when their own had paid off they better than most would know that conditions in england six years after the war were in many circumstances far worse than life aboard a manofwar here at least they had security of sorts with a fair commander and a large portion of luck they could make their way in their own country for which many of them had fought long and hard there was little work and the seaports were too often full of the wars cripples and those rejected by the sea but the remainder of tempests people were a real meltingpot french and danes several negroes an american and many more besides as he looked at the men at the braces and halliards the boat handlers waiting to lower his gig outboard the swaying line of sweating marines on the poop he tried to tell himself he should be content he knew that if he were in england he would be fretting and worrying about getting back to sea trying to obtain a new ship any ship that was how it had been after the war then he had already held two commands a sloop and his beloved frigate phalarope when he had been given the undine another fifthrate and despatched to madras on the other side of the world he had felt only gratitude that he had been spared the fate of the many who daily thronged the admiralty corridors or waited in the coffee houses hoping and praying for just such a chance as his that had been five years in the past and apart from a short visit to england he had been away from home waters ever since when he had taken command of tempest he had expected to be recalled to england for new orders to be sent to the west indies perhaps to the channel fleet or to the territory which was in dispute with spain he looked at herrick again and wondered herrick said nothing of his own views now although he had once made them plain enough apart from his coxswain john allday bolitho knew of no other who risked his anger by such plain speaking it had all come back to him when tempest had anchored at madras two months ago even as his boats crew had made their desperate efforts to pull him through the angry surf without getting their captain soaked to the skin he had remembered his first visit when he had carried viola raymond wife of the british governments adviser to the east india company as passenger herrick had spoken out then to warn him of the real dangers of the risk to his name and advancement in the one life he loved automatically he touched the shape of the watch in his breeches pocket the watch she had given him to replace one broken in battle where was she now during his brief return to england he had gone to london he had told himself he would not really try to see her again that he would just pass her house see where she lived at the same time he had known it was a lie but he could as easily have stayed content with her memory the house apart from the servants was empty james raymond and his wife were away on the governments business raymonds steward had been offhand to a point of rudeness aboard a kings ship a captain was second only to god and many said that was merely due to seniority in the streets and terraces of st jamess he ranked not at all he heard herrick call stand by to let go mr jury jury the barrelchested boatswain needed no advice about watching the anchor party so herrick must have sensed bolithos mood and was trying to jerk him from it bolitho smiled wearily he had known herrick since taking command of phalarope and they had rarely been apart since he had not changed much stockier perhaps but the same round open face with those bright blue eyes which had shared so much with him if as bolitho now suspected his brief affair with viola raymond had made its mark in high places then herrick was being punished too and without cause the thought angered and saddened him maybe the commodore would shed some light on things but this time he would not hope he did not dare he thought of his despatches of the extra news he would give commodore james sayer he remembered sayer quite well and had met him in cornwall once or twice they had served in the same squadron on the american station before that both lieutenants with the echoes of the final shot hanging in the air tempest glided the last half cable to her prescribed anchorage bolitho said curtly when you are prepared mr herrick herrick raised his speaking trumpet his reply equally formal aye aye sir then he shouted man the lee braces there hands wear ship the motionless seamen sprang into life topsl sheets bolitho saw thomas gwyther the surgeon hovering by the larboard gangway trying to avoid the hurrying seamen how unlike the last surgeon bolitho had had he had been a violent towering drunkard of a man one who had let his passion for drink and the memories he had tried to contain with it destroy him entirely gwyther was a stooped driedup little man with wispy grey hair whose frail looks were at odds with his apparent toughness and durability he attended to his duties readily enough but showed far more interest in plants and vegetation in whatever place the ship touched land than he ever did in humanity topsl clew lines the master said in his flat unemotional voice put the helm alee tempest obedient to rudder and to the dying breeze turned slowly above her own image losing way her decks even hotter as the last canvas was manhandled and fisted to the yards let go bolitho heard the familiar splash beneath the bows and pictured the massive anchor shattering the stillness of that inviting water he repressed a shudder he recalled the two large sharks which had patiently followed the ship for several days almost into the harbour itself signal from flag sir captain repair on board bolitho looked at midshipman swift he was in charge of the signals party and at seventeen was no doubt full of hopes and impatience for a chance of promotion he shifted his gaze to keen the third lieutenant wondering briefly if he was remembering when he had been in swifts shoes aboard the undine it all seemed so long back now keen was twentytwo as brown as a berry with the clean good looks which would conquer any girls heart bolitho thought keen who had joined his first ship because his father wanted him to learn to find himself before entering the familys city business and who had stayed on because he actually liked it keen who had taken a wood splinter the size of a marlin spike which had been blasted from the deck into his body within inches of his groin even now he grimaced whenever it was mentioned allday mistrusting any ships surgeon and undines in particular had taken the splinter from the boys body himself the burly coxswain had surprised bolitho yet again with one more unsuspected talent away gig herrick cupped his hands mr jury put some more hands to the tackles and lively so allday was watching the hurried preparations his eyes critical as the boat was swayed up and over the nettings in his blue jacket and flapping white trousers his hair tied to the nape of his powerful neck he looked as solid and as dependable as ever he said quietly another place captain another task no doubt then he yelled watch that paintwork you clumsy bugger this is for the captain not the bloody cook some of the old hands grinned others newer or with less knowledge of the language about them cringed at the outburst allday muttered by god if we dont get back to proper work i cant picture what sort of hands well be using he shook his head seamen indeed bolitho did not know what allday meant by proper work they performed regular patrols amongst the growing spread of trading stations which were scattered across the seas from sumatra to new guinea they had made long passages many hundreds of miles to the west to search for and act as escort to some valuable merchantmen on passage from europe tempest was always kept busy for with the spread of trade and with it the exploitation and expansion into settlement and colony so too came those who preyed on it pirates selfstyled princes old enemies sailing under letters of marque it was dangerous enough without the additional hazards of hostile natives and tropical storms perhaps he meant like herrick getting away from heat and thirst the daily risk of an uncharted reef or attack by warring savages the explorers and the great navigators had done much to disperse the mystery and the dangers of these waters but those who had followed in their wake had less noble motives for a handful of nails some axes and a few strings of beads a captain could buy almost anything and anyone for the sake of their trade and possessions britain france and holland carried the main share of protecting the vast sea areas so that vulnerable merchant vessels could go about their affairs unfortunately the oceans were too large the forces employed too small to be much more than a gesture also the countries who had the most invested in the indies and the islands of the great south sea did not trust each other nor had they forgotten old wars and debts still left unpaid bolitho heard the gigs crew clattering into the boat and saw that the side party of marines and boatswains mates were waiting to see him safely away he looked up at the drooping masthead pendant and then across the shimmering water to two large transports which were anchored well clear of the shore and now there was this additional responsibility the growing colony of new south wales he studied the big transports for some sign of life convict ships how many poor wretches had been transported out here to provide labour and the power for clearing land and founding a nation he tried to imagine what it would be like in such a ship battling round the cape of good hope or worse around the dreaded horn men women and children the law was as impartial as it was tragic herrick touched his hat boats ready sir bolitho nodded gravely and looked at the redcoated marines and their captain jasper prideaux it was rumoured that he was in the marines because he had been made to leave society for killing two men in duels bolitho more than many had cause to understand that for two years he had tried not to dislike prideaux despite sun and salt air the marine captain remained pale and unhealthy looking he had sharp almost pointed features like a fox a man who would enjoy duelling and winning bolitho had not succeeded in getting rid of his dislike attention in the boat allday stood by the tiller one eye on bolithos sword as he clambered down the side to the twitter of calls and the slap and thud of muskets on the deck shove off give way all bolitho shaded his eyes as the boat pulled swiftly around and beneath the tapering jib boom and blueeyed figurehead tempest was a wellfound ship but as lakey had said often enough she was a company vessel no matter what flag flew above her taffrail with thirtysix guns which included twentyeight twelvepounders she was more powerful than any ship he had yet commanded but she was so heavily built of teak and her timbers and spars matched accordingly that she lacked the swift agility expected of a kings ship in close combat she had been built to protect heavy indiamen from pirates and to strike fear into any such island or inlet which might be harbouring them herrick had remarked from the start that if challenged by a real fighting ship they would have to close the range and hold on to it any sort of feinting and lastmoment manoeuvres were not even to be considered on the other hand even the most doubtful had to agree she was a fine sailer under good conditions with just her plain sail set and she carried over seventeen thousand square feet of it she had been known to log fifteen knots but lakey always down to earth had said trouble is you dont get good conditions when you needs em bolitho made sure his despatches and his own report were safely stowed below the thwart and turned his attention to the hebrus another castaway perhaps events were moving so fast in europe that they had already been forgotten around the world lonely solitary ships like his and the commodores patrolled and tacked back and forth in complete ignorance of what was happening in the very countries whose decisions shaped their destinies way nough allday swung the tiller his eyes slitted against the sun until they were covered by the flagships great shadow hook on bowman bolitho stood up and took a deep breath he always remembered a captain he had once served he had caught his legs in his sword as he had come aboard for the first time and had sprawled headlong at the feet of his startled marines at the top of the steps and just inside the entry port he removed his hat and waited for the din of calls and muskets being snapped to the present to subside the commodore walked to greet him one hand outstretched for a split second longer bolithos mind told him he was mistaken this was not lieutenant james sayer of the american station or even of cornwall he had been another sort of man altogether the commodore said good to see you again richard come aft and tell me your news bolitho returned the handclasp and swallowed hard sayer had been a wellbuilt lively man now he was roundshouldered and his face was deeply lined worst of all his skin was like old unusable parchment yet he was only two or three years older than bolitho in the comparative cool of the great cabin sayer threw off his heavy dress coat and sank into a chair ive sent for some wine my servant keeps it in a specially cool place in the bilges only rhenish but lucky to get that out here he shut his eyes and groaned what a place an island of felons surrounded by corruption he brightened up as the servant entered with some bottles and glasses now your despatches richard he saw his face what is it bolitho waited for the servant to pour the wine and leave the cabin i was delayed on passage here sir we were struck by a squall three days out of madras and two of my people were badly injured by falling from aloft two others were lost overboard he looked away remembering the pity he had felt at the time the squall which had come with the swiftness of sound in the middle of the night had departed just as quickly two dead and two permanently crippled for no reason i decided to put into timor and land the men there i have had business with the dutch governor at coupang and he has always been most helpful the commodore watched him above the rim of his goblet yes youve had fine successes against pirates and privateers in that area bolitho faced him but for my unplanned visit i would not have heard the news a ship a kings ship had a mutiny aboard some six months ago according to the governor she had been outward bound from tahiti when it happened i am not certain of the reasons for it but one thing is clear the mutineers cast their officers and loyal men adrift in a small boat but for the commander i am told his name is bligh they would have perished as it was he found his way to timor over three thousand six hundred miles before he could summon help the ship was an armed transport sir the bounty sayer stared at him his face grave ive not heard of her he stood up and walked to the broad stern windows so the mutineers will probably use her for piracy they have little choice other than hanging bolitho nodded feeling his own uncertainty mutiny even the word was like the touch of some terrible disease he had felt it aboard his first frigate phalarope it had not been of his doing but the memory was still sharp in his mind as the commodore remained silent and continued to stare through the windows bolitho added i upanchored and headed southwest and then around the southern coast of this colony sir i put into adventure bay in van diemens land i thought the mutineers might have gone there before the news broke about their crime he shrugged but they have vanished it is now my belief they have no intention of returning to a civilized country where they might be seized theyll stay in the great south sea add to the list of renegades and murderers who are living off traders and natives alike but a kings ship it does not bear thinking about sayer turned and smiled sadly you have cause to hate the word mutiny i am glad you discovered what you did but higher authority than ours will decide what to do next have no doubt he sipped at his goblet bligh you say he shook his head must be a determined man to survive such a journey bolitho felt himself relax in the chair ever since he had spoken with the dutch governor he had held the story of the mutiny on his mind now under sayers influence he could face it in its proper proportion he had reacted like most captains seeing himself in the same predicament without knowing the ship the men or the exact circumstances it was like baying at the moon for more light he watched sayer with sudden compassion tired out with this unenviable appointment broken by some past fever he was nevertheless the senior officer just as bolitho had been the only representative of the worlds greatest navy as he had covered many hundreds of miles in search of pirates and the local rulers who gave them encouragement perhaps one day he might fly a broad pendant of his own but he doubted if he would carry sayers selfassurance to go with it the commodore said i shall see the governor without delay i suggest you return to your ship and take on water and whatever stores you need he studied him calmly i am afraid ill be sending you to sea very quickly i would have done so anyway your news hastens the event as bolitho rose he added if you need extra hands i daresay it can be arranged after two years of botany bay it is hard to discover where a transported convict leaves off and an honest man begins he winked ill speak with the receiving officer ashore at the entry port sayer stood with bolitho looking across at tempest in the bright glare her rigging and shrouds shone like black glass fine ship he sounded wistful bolitho said i imagine you will soon return to england sir the commodore shrugged i would wish to see cornwall again he reached out and touched the worn gangway rail but like my poor old hebrus i expect i will die out here he said it without rancour or bitterness bolitho stood back and removed his hat to the quarterdeck as the side party paid its respects to him once more and he climbed down to the waiting gig he found himself thinking of the fine houses in st jamess would anyone there care if they read sayer was dead but he thought he already knew the answer and he was frowning when he ordered allday to cast off as he sat in silence and the boat left the flagships shadow and moved into the blazing heat he glanced at the faces of the oarsmen what did he really know of these men it was different in war the enemy was clear to see the cause though vague was always a just one because it was your own holding together cheering and hitting back were all part of that desperate world but now miles from real civilization what would men like these think if pressed too far allday glanced down at bolithos squared shoulders at the black hair which as always was tied neatly above his goldlaced collar the captain was going over it all as he usually did fretting and bothering himself for other peoples sakes he could guess what was uppermost in his mind allday had been aboard bolithos ship in the mutiny a pressed man at that hed not forget it either he looked at the oarsmen each picked and trained by him they knew about the bounty mutiny and by sundown every manjack and convict in the colony would too allday had never known his parents and could not properly remember at what age he had first set foot aboard ship he had been at sea all his life but for a short while in falmouth where he had been pressed by men from bolithos own ship over the years before that time he could recall several captains who would warrant a mutiny cruel vindictive men who seemed to delight in making their people suffer men such as those could make even the tiniest act of kindness in the crowded world between decks seem like a kind of miracle it was wrong that it should be so when there were others like bolitho who cared for their responsibility bolitho snapped if you do not watch your helm allday well be inboard by way of a gunport im thinking allday swung the tiller and grinned at bolithos back that was more like it the dusk which quickly enclosed the harbour was like a seductive velvet curtain it helped men to forget the heat of the day and the strain of reprovisioning the ship with anything which benjamin bynoe the hardeyed purser could obtain at the lowest barter bolitho leaned back on the bench beneath the open stern windows and watched the lights winking from every level of the town it was to be their second night at anchor in sydney but his first on board commodore sayer had kept him busily engaged mostly ashore meeting the assistant governor his superior being elsewhere in the colony attending to some petition from those damned farmers as he described them the first settlers even with the available if reluctant aid of the convict labour were not finding their lives easy bad crops some floods and theft by natives and escaped prisoners had left them in no mood for tolerance bolitho had also met the officers of the local military he had got the distinct impression they were not eager to discuss their affairs with anyone from outside the colony he had said as much to sayer who had smiled at his doubts you are quite right bolitho the commodore had said at first the governor was content to use marines to keep order and contain the transported convicts but they were required in england and most have been shipped home these soldiers you spoke with are some of the new south wales corps they are specially recruited at high expense and in many cases are more dishonest than those they are supposed to be guarding i would not wear the governors coat for a sack of gold bolithos impressions of sydney had been equally mixed the dwellings were rough but well sited for the most part with ready access to the waterfront some like the huge windmills behind the town standing on the slopes like gaunt onlookers showed signs of the dutch influence practical and well designed bolitho was well used to the crudity and drunkenness of seaports in many countries but sydneys rash of grog shops and worse made some he had seen appear quite mild sayer had told him that many of the shantykeepers were actually employed by the officers of the corps who openly encouraged immoral liaisons between their own men and the convict women who served in such places he had scornfully described the men who enlisted in the corps as either blacklegs or blackguards and none in it for anything but personal gain aboard his own ship again he was able to find some satisfaction and escape from the busy life ashore sayer had discovered nothing more of tempests new instructions which would eventually come from the governor upon his return opposite him lounging contentedly in another chair was herrick they had dined together on an excellent mutton pie which noddall the cabin servant had obtained specially from an unknown source ashore they had consumed all of it and bolitho realised it was the first meat not taken from a salt cask he had eaten for months he said i think some claret thomas herrick grinned his teeth white in the glow of a solitary lantern they had soon found that to increase the light only encouraged a host of buzzing insects which immediately destroyed the blessing of the cool air he said no sir not this time he beckoned noddall from the shadows i took the liberty of getting some good french wine from the barracks quartermaster he chuckled they may not be much as soldiers but they live well enough noddall busied himself at the table with his wine cooler bolitho watched him recognizing every movement noddall was small like a little rodent even his hands which when not in use he held in front of his body were like paws but he was a good and willing servant and like some of the others had come to the ship from bolithos undine herrick stood up his head clear of the deck beams as evidence of tempests generous proportions and raised his goblet he said to you sir and your birthday he grinned i know it was yesterday in fact but it took me a day to discover the wine they continued almost in silence their long pipes lit their glasses readily refilled by the watchful noddall overhead through the skylight they could see the stars very large and close and hear the regular footsteps of a masters mate as he paced back and forth on watch the occasional shuffle of boots from the marine sentry beyond the bulkhead bolitho said it will be late autumn in cornwall now he did not know why he had said it maybe he had been thinking of sayer but he could see it all the same gold and brown leaves a keener edge to each dawn but still fresh and bright it always held off the winter in cornwall he tried to recall the ordinary sounds the ring of chipping hammers as the farm workers used their time building or repairing the characteristic stone and slate walls which separated their fields and houses cattle and sheep the fishermen tramping up from falmouth to one of a dozen tiny hamlets at the end of the day he thought of his own house below pendennis castle square and grey the home of the bolithos for generations now apart from ferguson his steward and the servants there was nobody all gone either dead or like his two sisters married and living their separate lives he remembered his feelings when he had met the marine captain prideaux for the first time and his attendant rumours of duels fought and won it had reminded him of his own brother hugh he had killed a brother officer over a gambling debt and had fled to america to desert his ship had been a bad enough shock for their father but when he had joined the revolutionary navy and had risen to command a privateer against his old friends and companions it had been more than enough to speed his death and hugh was gone too killed it seemed by a runaway horse in boston life was difficult to fathom out herrick sensed his change of mood i think i should turn in sir i have a feeling well all be up and about tomorrow two days in harbour tch tch someone highup will say itll never do for the tempest and thats the truth he grinned broadly i truly believe that if all our people were allowed ashore in this place wed never get em back bolitho remained by the stern windows long after herrick had gone to his cot or more likely the wardroom for a last drink with the other officers herrick always seemed to know when he needed to be alone to think just as he understood that it only made the bond stronger between them he watched the smoke from his pipe curling slowly out and over the black water which surged around the rudder it was bad to keep thinking of home but he had been away so long now and if he was to be banished he would have to do something to change his future he heard a violin strangely sad from below decks and guessed it was owston the ropemaker who played for the capstan crew and entertained the hands during the dog watches tempest would make a fine picture from the shore if anyone was watching gunports open lit from within like yellow eyes riding light and a lantern on the starboard gangway for the officeroftheguard to climb aboard without losing his footing in the darkness he thought of some of the convicts he had seen surely none could be here for serious offences they would have been hanged if they were hardened criminals it made him ashamed to think how he had just been brooding on his own separation from home what would these transported people be suffering if they could see his ship know that she would eventually weigh anchor and perhaps sail for england whereas they he looked up off guard as there was a rap at the outer door it was borlase the second lieutenant as officerofthewatch he was no doubt the only officer aboard in full uniform he was twentysix years old tall and powerfully built and yet his features were rounded even gentle and his expression was usually one of mild surprise that he should be here bolitho guessed it had originally been a guard to hide his feelings but had since become permanent borlase had been first lieutenant in a small frigate the ship had run hard aground near the philippines and had been a total loss fortunately there had been an east indiaman nearby and all but three hands had been rescued at the hastily convened court martial the frigates captain had been dismissed from the navy for negligence borlase had been officerofthewatch at the time and his evidence had helped to send his captain into oblivion bolitho asked well mr borlase the lieutenant stepped into the lantern light the guard boat has sent this despatch for you sir he licked his lips another childlike habit from the governor bolitho saw noddall hurrying from the dining compartment carrying another lantern his little shadow looming giantlike against the whitepainted screen as he slit open the canvas envelope he found time to wonder if borlases part at the court martial had been as much to clear himself as to bring down his captain he read swiftly along the neatly written paper all at once the stresses and anxieties of the past weeks faded and even borlase who was watching him with a gentle smile on his lips seemed to have vanished he said sharply my compliments to the first lieutenant mr borlase id like to see him directly the lieutenant opened his mouth as if to put a question and shut it again bolitho walked to the stern windows and leaned as far out as he could letting the sea air explore his throat and chest he wished he had not drunk so much or dined so well on the mutton pie he tried to clear his mind to concentrate on the despatch tempest was to weigh and put to sea as soon as it was prudent to work clear of the harbour limits he felt the air cooling his hair and cheek it felt stronger but would it last he checked his racing thoughts and heard herrick coming into the cabin sir we are ordered to sea thomas a transport ship is overdue although she was reported safely on passage three weeks ago by the mail packet the packets master made signal contact with her southeast of tongatapu herrick tucked his shirt into his breeches his face frowning but thats over a couple of thousand miles from here sir bolitho nodded but the ship shes the eurotas is a regular visitor she supplies the colony and some other islands as required her master is well versed with these waters it is no use deluding ourselves she should have been here at anchor days ago he recalled the grog shops and the brazeneyed girls at the windows the governor knew she was expected he kept it a secret even from his subordinate the eurotas is filled with guns powder and supplies and money to pay the military and civil authorities and you think the bounty mutineers may be in that area sir bolitho did not reply immediately he was thinking of the governors instructions feeling their anger and urgency most of all he was remembering the last paragraphs the eurotas apart from her valuable cargo was also carrying more convicts and he could almost see the rest in his mind the newly appointed adviser and acting governor for yet another colonial project james raymond and his wife were passengers he turned from the glittering lights and reflected stars they had gone cold rouse the master thomas find out the first possible moment we can proceed ill warp her clear with boats if need be it may be a false alarm eurotas might have put into an island for water or wood or she could have been becalmed as we have often enough herrick was studying him his eyes very still he said doubtful bolitho walked past him touching the chairs without feeling them and the old sword which hung on the bulkhead where allday watched over it like a keeper he continued sayer will be sending the courier brig when she returns and the governor will despatch two small schooners to the north and east like a needle in a haystack sir bolitho swung on his heels i know that damn it but we must do something he saw the instant look of surprise and hurt on herricks homely features and added im sorry too much wine herrick would have to know sooner or later bolitho thrust the papers across the table read them for yourself he walked to the door and said to the sentry call the midshipmanofthewatch i want all officers in the cabin without delay he turned aft again and saw herrick watching him bolitho said simply i know thomas i even know what you have been thinking but it was five years ago a long while to remember herrick eyed him grimly aye sir if you say so ill go and assemble the officers outside and bring them in together he left the cabin bolitho sat down on the bench seat and after a slight hesitation drew the watch from his pocket it was a very good timepiece made by mudge and dutton and it had a neat cylinder escapement and a firm airtight guard he saw none of these things but clicked open the guard to read the engraved inscription on the inside conquered on a couch alone i lie once in dreams deceit you came to me all dreams outstripped if only thou were nigh he closed the guard and thrust it into his pocket his head and mind were quite clear and when his officers filed into the cabin they saw nothing to make them believe he was in any way different except for herrick and he could do nothing about it isolation bolitho paused on the companion ladder and allowed his eyes time to adapt to the harsh glare it was almost eight bells with the men of the forenoon watch listlessly assembled below the quarterdeck rail to make the changeover bolitho had been on deck two hours earlier as was his habit then even with the sure knowledge of another scalding day to come it had seemed refreshing and alive there had been a dampness on canvas and rigging to add to the deception but now the suns heat had expanded and magnified and as he stepped on to the quarterdeck he found himself wondering just how long they could continue searching for the eurotas since leaving sydney they had made good two thousand five hundred miles nearer three thousand with all the changes of tack and the maddening perversity of the wind herrick had remarked that itfelt twenty times that much three weeks of searing heat and endless empty miles bolitho squinted his eyes to try and see beyond the gently pitching bowsprit but the glare was already so fierce that the sea appeared as polished silver without division between it and the sky slowly he examined the set of each sail drawing but only just with the yards braced round to hold the vessel on a starboard tack he heard the masters mate report to lieutenant borlase the watch is aft sir then borlases heels squeaked as he crossed the deck his shoes clinging to the hot pitch between the seams both he and keen who was relieving him were well aware that their captain was present but were used enough to his ways to know he would not interfere with the routine of changing the watch bolitho heard keen say aye sir noreast by east full and bye then borlase curt and impatient as usual nothing to report i have logged peterson for insolence the first lieutenant can deal with him later he wiped his streaming face and neck relieve the wheel if you please then with a nod he vanished through the companionway the hands went about their allotted duties and the watch began another long four hours bolitho had seen herrick right forward with the boatswain and some working parties the tasks were unending the ship like any other was like a finely tuned instrument with every inch of rigging and canvas designed and arrayed to play its part splicing and stitching painting and blackingdown rigging tempest took a lot of sweat and backbreaking effort herrick saw him and strode aft along the weather gangway his stocky frame barely angled to the sundried planking it was hardly surprising for even with courses and topsails set to the wind the hull was hardly heeling to its thrust herrick observed another hard one sir he looked at each mast in turn ive had the hands turnedto early itll save them from the worst of it mr jury has some heavier tasks on the orlop for this afternoon bolitho nodded watching keen as he moved restlessly around the wheel and compass like the other officers he was dressed only in shirt and breeches and his fair hair was plastered across his forehead with sweat he said good thomas i know theyll curse us for the heavy work but it will save them from other troubles herrick knew as well as any officer that too much leisure under these conditions could lead to arguments and worse in cabin and wardroom it was bad enough for the company crammed together in their screened quarters or messdecks it would be like part of hell herrick watched him judging the right moment how much longer sir he stood his ground as bolitho turned towards him i mean we have covered the full distance that mail packet reported eurotas in these waters safe and on passage she must have run into trouble we could barely miss her at this snails pace bolitho walked to the quarterdeck rail and gripped it with both hands the heated woodwork helped to steady his mind hold back his uncertainty he saw jacob twig the cook walking purposefully beneath the shadow of a gangway on his way to see the purser no doubt the fresh food and extra stores they had obtained from sydney had to be eked out within the usual issue of meat from the cask salt beef salt pork some so hard it was like the ships teak twig was very dark and extremely tall when he was in his evilsmelling galley he loomed over the pots and platters like some kind of sorcerer brewing potions bolitho said slowly i agree that we have run the full course he tried to picture the missing ship guess what could or might have befallen her in the whole three weeks they had spoken with only two other vessels small dutch trading schooners they had been a week apart but neither of the masters had reported sighting anything except the usual clusters of native craft amongst the many islands and it was always prudent to give them a wide berth he added according to the chart we are once again due south of tongatapu if we come about and steer to take advantage of this wind i think we could sight land early tomorrow herrick waited reading his mind bolitho said ill not hazard the ship amidst the reefs but we can put boats ashore the local chief is alleged to be friendly our ships are not unknown to him according to mr lakey herrick grimaced ill take a loaded brace of pistols with me nevertheless sir there have been too many good sailors cut down without warning bolitho turned to watch a sudden flurry in the sea alongside a shark falling upon a smaller fish the incident over in a second then the surface was smooth again with just the occasional pointer of the sharks fin to reveal their patient escort he replied some of these islands have had good reason to hate us he unconsciously touched the lock of hair which hung above his right eye herrick saw the movement it was as familiar as bolithos level grey eyes beneath the lock of hair was a deep savage scar which ran right up his forehead as a junior lieutenant bolitho had been struck down and all but killed by a native when he had been on an island with his ships watering party herrick persisted ill shoot first all the same sir ive come too far to have my brains spilled with a war club bolitho was suddenly impatient the thought that the eurotas might have been overrun by warring islanders appalled him call the master thomas well lay off a new course and decide what we must do herrick watched him stride towards the poop his face completely absorbed he said to keen keep an eye on your watch we will be needing all hands within the hour keen did not answer he remembered viola raymond she had nursed him when he had been put ashore after being wounded like some of the others he knew about the captains involvement and what herrick thought about it all keen was fond of them both but especially so of bolitho if he was going to search for viola raymond and more risk was to come from their reunion then it was their business he watched herricks troubled face or was it in the small chart room beneath the poop and adjoining the masters cabin bolitho leaned over the table watching lakeys fingers busy with brass dividers and rule if the wind holds noon tomorrow lakey looked up from the table his lean face silhouetted against an open port beyond it the sea was glittering and painful to look at how much worse in a big transport loaded with convicts if the eurotas was aground somewhere then the first fear would soon change to something more dangerous the desire to escape to be free with even the tiniest chance of survival could make men do the impossible if the wind holds it must be engraved on every sea officers heart bolitho thought he eyed lakey thoughtfully so be it one hundred and forty miles to tongatapu if we can log five knots and no more once we have changed course i think your estimate a fair one lakey shrugged he rarely rose to either praise or doubt ill feel happier when ive examined our noon sights sir bolitho smiled very well he turned on his heel and hurried to the quarterdeck knowing lakey would be there when he was needed ah thomas we will bring her about on the halfhour and steer norwest that will allow us sea room when we are closer to the reefs also if the wind veers we will be better placed to select one of the other islands in the group when a ships boy turned the halfhour glass beside the binnacle the hands manned the braces and hauled breathlessly at the frigates great yards as tempest wallowed round and allowed herself to be laid on the opposite tack bolitho was very aware of the time it took to perform the change even allowing for the poor wind he had every available man employed on deck and aloft he knew the folly of allowing slackness and taking shortcuts even on routine work in battle with the biggest proportion of seamen required at the guns and repairing damage the ship would have to be handled by far fewer and yet tempest had answered helm and canvas more with the slow dignity of a ship of the line than a frigate it was so easy to get complacent to put off the backbreaking and thankless work of gun and sail drill with a battle in mind out here with sometimes months on end and no sight of any other manofwar it was hard to build up enthusiasm for such drills especially when it was only too easy to turn your own back upon it bolitho had one bitter reminder however in the years when he had commanded undine he had been forced into open conflict with a powerful french frigate the argus commanded by le chaumareys an experienced veteran of the war and one of admiral suffrens most capable commanders although serving under a letter of marque for the selfstyled prince muljadi le chaumareys had remained a french officer in the best sense of the word he had even warned bolitho of the foolishness he would display in trying to fight his argus muljadis pirate fleet and the dithering incompetence of governments on the other side of the world just two ships could decide the fate of a great area of the indies bolithos little undine and le chaumareys powerful fortyfour as in tempest bolitho had been blessed with a motley collection of seamen some of whom had been gathered from prison hulks to make his complement adequate all he had had against the frenchmans experience and his equally welltrained company had been youth and a freshness of ideas le chaumareys had been away from home for years his work under anothers flag was to have been his last before returning honourably to his beloved france it had been le chaumareys familiarity with an established routine his reliance on the same old methods and manoeuvres which had cost him a victory and his life bolitho wondered how long it would take him to get too complacent or so weary with endless patrols and chases after pirates that when a real challenge offered itself he would find himself without the steel to repel it or if indeed he would recognize the weakness if there was no one to tell him course norwest sir full and bye herrick wiped his forehead with his wrist and no fresher on this tack either bolitho took a telescope from midshipman swift and trained it beyond the bows through the taut rigging and shrouds and above the figureheads golden shoulder on and on to nothing very well dismiss the watch below he stopped herrick as he made to hurry away i believe mr borlase wishes you to punish a seaman today herrick watched him gravely aye sir peterson for insolence he swore at a bosuns mate i see then warn the man yourself thomas a flogging for such a triviality will do nothing to help matters he looked at some seamen on the deck below and along the gangways almost naked and tanned in a dozen hues they appeared strong enough able to control any sudden flareup of temper which could end in flogging or worse then have a word with mr borlase ill not have him or any officer passing over responsibility in this manner he was in charge of the watch he should have dispersed the trouble as soon as he saw it herrick watched him leave the deck and cursed himself for not stepping into the matter earlier for letting borlase get away with it as he did so often when you stopped to think about it when you were tired sundried and dying for a cool breeze it was often much easier to do the work yourself instead of following through the chain of command which is why ill never rise above lieutenant as herrick moved up and down the weather side of the deck he was watched for much of the time by keen and midshipman swift from midshipman in the undine to tempests third lieutenant when keen had been raised from acting rank and had passed his examination for lieutenant he had imagined that no reward could provide greater satisfaction while he tried to stay under the shadow of the mizzen topsail he watched herrick and wondered not for the first time where the next move would come some lieutenants seemed to soar to post rank and higher like comets others remained at the same level year after year until rejected by the navy and thrown on the beach if only he had been old enough to have served with men like bolitho and herrick in the real way against the french and the american revolution or anyone who faced them across the water and challenged a flag as well as a broadside he heard lakeys step beside him i have been thinking the sailing master smiled grimly my old father on tresco used to say leave thinking to horses tobias theyve bigger heads than yours it seemed to amuse him weve a course to run out mr keen and no brooding or pining is going to change our captains intentions not by one inch keen grinned he liked lakey although their worlds were so different ill try to contain myself below in his day cabin bolitho sat at his desk and worked slowly through the days affairs as in most forenoon watches he received a regular stream of visitors bynoe the purser requesting a signature on his ledger of newly opened meat casks hard of eye more so of heart bolitho suspected the purser was better than many he had served with his rations were fairly issued and he did not dock a seamans meagre pay for some article he had not received and would not remember when the ship eventually paid off the surgeon came with his daily sick report the hands kept remarkably free of hurt and illness bolitho was thankful to discover but when it struck it was without warning or mercy as with the men lost overboard and the two left in the care of the dutch doctors at coupang while he studied each book and ledger placed before him by cheadle his clerk he was conscious too of the life above and around him they were all extensions of the ship herself if a man died or was removed the ship lived on gathering replacements to sustain herself he heard the rumble of gun trucks as one by one each cannon from the long twelvepounders on the main deck to the snappy sixpounders aft were hauled inboard and examined by jack brass tempests gunner it was brasss routine arrangement that every week he would check each weapon and god help the gun captain whose charge failed to reach his standards bolitho had been lucky with his warrant officers and more seasoned men and was grateful for it even his four midshipmen sent to him originally by parents who wished them to gain experience and advancement which was harder to get elsewhere in peacetime were more like young lieutenants after two years continuous service swift and pyper were seventeen and already thinking of the time when they would be able to sit for promotion fitzmaurice a pugfaced youth of sixteen had had much of the arrogance knocked out of him he came of a very rich family indeed and had imagined apparently that his commission in tempest was to be something akin to a courtesy cruise herrick and lakey had taught him otherwise the youngest evelyn romney was fifteen they all made a change from the usual twelveand thirteenyearolds you found in most ships bolitho thought romney had improved the least he was a naturally shy youth and lacked the firmness required when dealing with men old enough to be his father but if fitzmaurice cursed his family for sending him packing to sea romney who was less able to face up to the demands made on the young gentlemen seemed desperately determined to do well he obviously loved the navy and his attempts to overcome his shyness were pathetic to watch bolitho heard the measured tramp of boots as the marines trooped aft from their daily drills on the forecastle and in the tops prideaux would not be with them he would leave the sweat and discomfort to his sergeant then later he would emerge and criticize his foxy face peering at each of his men in turn bolitho had never heard him offer one word of encouragement or praise even when a marine had been promoted more muffled than the sounds near the quarterdeck he heard the thump of hammers and the occasional rasp of a saw isaac toby was the ships carpenter fat slowmoving and rather vacantlooking he had the appearance of an untidy owl but as a carpenter he was an artist with his own small crew he kept the repairs up to date although with a vessel built of teak that was the least of his worries at this moment he would be completing his latest challenge the building of a new additional jolly boat it had been something of a joke to begin with a casual remark made by the gunner about waste of valuable wood when a seaman had been caught throwing some offcuts over the side toby had taken it as a personal affront and had said he would build a boat with his own hands out of all the oddments which brass could discover the boat was nearly completed and even brass had had to admit it was far better than tempests original one bolitho leaned back and ran his fingers through his hair cheadle gathered up the last document and made sure the signature was dry the clerk was a strange withdrawn man as were many of his kind he had deep hollow eyes and large uneven teeth so that he appeared to be smiling something he never did as far as bolitho knew to discover anything of his past bolitho had had to drag it from him word by word he had been transferred from another ship which had been paid off in bombay his captain had assured bolitho that cheadle was a good clerk if somewhat reticent he had once worked in a grocers shop in canterbury and prided himself on his service to the quality but so far even after two years of daily contact bolitho had never heard him mention it noddall entered as the clerk left and placed a glass of wine on the desk with fresh water so much in demand and the uncertainty of supply a constant worry bolitho usually took wine as an easy alternative he recalled when he had been guided to the famous shop in st jamess how he had purchased the many fine bottles before his voyage to the other side of the world in undine the wine had been reduced to broken glass and spillage during his fight with the argus but the memory stayed with him he touched the watch in his pocket like so many others allday sauntered through from the sleeping cabin and watched him gravely reckon well find em captain he stood with arms folded across his deep chest his face and body relaxed he was more like a companion than a subordinate how much they had shared together bolitho often wondered if allday missed england he would certainly be missing the girls allday had always had a reputation with them and more than once had been glad if not eager to set sail in haste for fear of husband or irate father i hope so bolitho sipped the drink cheap and stale not like the french wine which herrick had got for him the sydney garrison had probably bought a stock from a french ship or some ambitious trader if you were prepared to risk your fortune and your life and pit your wits against fierce natives pirates and the constant dangers of shipwreck you could sell anything out here in the wake of navigators and explorers like cook had come the others on some islands where the natives had lived in simple idyllic surroundings the ships had introduced disease and death the merchant adventurers had set one tribe against another by offering shoddy goods and cheap cloth in exchange for secure moorings from which to barter and now everyone was paying for it soon some overgreedy trader would start supplying a tribe with muskets bolitho had seen it happen in the americas where the french had trained indians to track and kill the british and the british had done the same to them afterwards with their independence won and with both british and french gone from their newborn country the americans had been left with another army in their midst a nation of indian warriors which if joined together might still drive the settlers into the sea and isolate the new ports and cities he added i doubt very much that we could have passed the eurotas without sighting her we have had double lookouts and at night have shown enough lights for a blind man to see her captain would know of the concern for his late arrival and would try to make contact with any ship of size alldays eyes were distant as he watched the sea through the stern windows with the wind across the larboard quarter the ship was leaning slightly under the pressure so that the sea appeared to be on the slope like most professional seamen allday seemed able to stare at the sea without a blink and yet the horizon was shining fiercely like a tautly stretched thread of gems my guess captain is that shes put in somewhere for water her supply might have gone foul as ours did once he grimaced with a hull full of convicts and the like her captaind not want to add to his worries and thats no error true bolitho looked away remembering the way she had looked their carefree disregard for discovery and what might have happened at madras and afterwards in that wretched feverinfested colony to which bolithos ship had been sent to lend authority to yet another governor often he had sweated at the thought of those possibilities a door being flung open her face and shoulders pale as he tried to hide her from her husband but nobody had come to break their passions and the ache of losing her was even harder to accept he felt anger too what could james raymond be thinking of to drag her out here again european women found the climate cruel and demanding and for raymond there was no such need his fine house his authority all he had gained at others expense would have made it easy to leave her in security and comfort amongst people and customs she understood there was a rap at the door and borlase peered through the screen his face less mild than usual i was wondering if i might speak with you sir he looked quickly at allday but if it is inconvenient bolitho gestured to allday and as he left the cabin said be brief mr borlase i intend to exercise the twelvepounders before noon he knew why the lieutenant was here that too depressed him borlase licked his lips i had occasion to log a seaman sir peterson i know he saw the merest flicker of surprise before borlase hurried on i see sir but i intended that mr herrick should award punishment peterson was defiant and insolent to his superior and twelve lashes at the very least should be his just deserts the speech had brought a flush to his cheeks like a petulant but triumphant child who has found a weakness in authority bolitho thought he answered quietly the bosuns mate who was defied was schultz is that so he did not wait for an answer but continued in the same level voice he is an excellent seaman and we are lucky to have him but the word hung in the air less than two years back he could speak no tongue but his native german what language he has mastered is made up of sailors talk and slang the commands needed to obey and instruct others borlase stared at him blankly i dont see had you bothered to investigate this matterbolitho could feel his anger mounting despite his care to control it why were men like borlase never able to learn from mistakes and to accept the lessonsyou would have treated the incident with a minimum of fuss i believe that peterson was slow to respond to an order and schultz shouted that he were better on a gallows than on the main yard he waited seeing borlases fingers opening and closing like claws well yes sir something like that then peterson called schultz a pig and a heartless devil borlase nodded firmly it was then that i ordered him to be taken below bolitho locked his fingers behind his head he felt the sweat trickling down his chest and armpits the shirt newly washed and fresh on today clinging like a wet shroud maybe this was what had occurred in the missing bounty or aboard the eurotas men tormented by climate and unceasing work taken off guard by some stupid remark made without real thought the rest could explode like a powder cask he said petersons father was hanged at exeter for murder and theft but he was wrongly identified and the real murderer was caught and executed a year later his tone hardened but not before petersons mother and family had been driven from their home by the dead mans friends they received a pardon but it was somewhat late he saw borlase pale and added i do not blame schultz because his language is limited i cannot blame peterson either the very mention of a gibbet the suggestion no matter how casually made that he were better use hanging from one would drive me to rage borlase muttered haltingly i am sorry sir i did not know which is why i blame you that man is in your division and was of your watch i knew so did the first lieutenant i trust that you will do something and soon to restore his respect something you have to earn mr borlase it does not come with the kings coat borlase turned about and left the cabin and for several moments bolitho remained quite still in his chair letting the sea noises intrude again to cover the fierce beats of his heart allday said that was a rare quilting captain i told you to leave the cabin he stood up furious with himself for losing his temper and with allday for his calm acceptance of it but i did captain allday kept his face stiff i thought you were calling me aft again bolitho gave in was it that loud allday grinned ive heard worse but i guessed you had pressing matters on your mind and might wish to be reminded of them thank you he felt his mouth giving way to a smile and damn you for your insolence the coxswain took down bolithos old sword from the bulkhead and rubbed it against his shirt i think ill give it a polish captain might bring us fortune bolitho looked up at the open skylight as bare feet pounded over the deck and he heard the sudden squeal of blocks the boom of canvas the watch on deck was trimming the sails and resetting the yards again the wind getting up a change of direction he left the chair and walked swiftly through the day cabin to the outer door keen was still in charge of the watch and was as competent and reliable as any young officer could be but bolitho knew his one weakness that keen would rather die than call his captain to aid him if the wind began to change he also understood why keen was so unwilling and the knowledge had so far prevented him from warning the lieutenant of the danger which delayed action could bring he reached the quarterdeck and saw the hands at the braces and the yards trimmed to take a slight alteration in the winds direction starling masters mateofthewatch touched his forehead and reported winds backed a mite sir an tis risen too his voice was extra loud and bolitho guessed he was warning his lieutenant that the captain was about bolitho consulted the compass and the set of the sails they were hard and filling well they might gain another knot for a few hours with any luck keen hurried in from the quarterdeck rail his face anxious bolitho nodded impassively we will call the hands to exercise the main armament in an hours time mr keen he saw the surprise and the relief on keens face something wrong keen swallowed hard nno sir nothing i just thought he broke off bolitho turned aft to the poop keen would never make a good liar keen watched him walk to the comparative seclusion of the stern and then whispered fiercely did he say anything mr starling the masters mate eyed him cheerfully like most of the others he liked keen many once raised to the rank of lieutenant thought themselves too proud to speak with mere sailormen he replied i think e just wanted you to know e was there sir in case you needed im like he showed his teeth but o course we didnt did we sir he walked away chuckling to himself and to supervise the flaking down of disordered halliards keen thrust his hands behind him as he had seen bolitho do so often and began to pace the deck ignoring the heat and the thirst which was making his mouth like clay it was difficult to fathom the captain sometimes to know if he was sharing something with you or holding it to himself for his own amusement keen had heard his voice through the cabin skylight although he had not known what was said but bolithos tone and borlases face when he had appeared on deck had told him far more it never stopped for a captain never he saw allday walking along the gundeck carrying the sword under his arm he could almost envy him his confidences with the captain more even than herrick he seemed to be the one who really shared them he swung round startled as bolitho called from the taffrail mr keen i fully realize your intention to keep your body in a healthy condition by walking back and forth under the sun but would you please exercise your mind also and send some hands to the foretopsl brace it too needs your urgent attention keen nodded and hurried to the rail no matter what other problems might be on the captains thoughts his eyes were in no way affected a strange message bolitho raised a telescope to his eye and winced as the hot metal touched his skin since first light when the masthead lookout had reported sighting land tempest had continued her slow approach the first excitement giving way to a feeling of tension he studied the islands with methodical care noting the various hills the one on the nearest headland which looked for all the world like a bowed monk with his cowl pulled over his head how close it looked through the powerful lens but he knew that the first spit of land was a good three miles away beyond it and further still other islands and tiny humps of bare rock overlapped in profusion giving an impression of one ungainly barrier of land a seamans head and shoulder loomed through the glass and bolitho steadied it as he focused upon tempests cutter which had been lowered soon after dawn under a tiny scrap of sail it was pushing ahead of the frigate and he could see an occasional splash beyond the bows as a leadsman took regular soundings to mark their approach for if the sea looked placid and inviting bolitho knew danger was rarely far off close to the nearest headland where the sea was green rather than blue he had seen a darker smudge beneath the surface like a giant stain or a submerged patch of devils weed reefs were here in plenty there was no room at all for taking chances without lowering the glass he said let her fall off a point mr lakey aye aye sir the sailing master sounded tense bolitho continued to study the nearest island uninhabited or did those lush slopes hide curious eyes he recalled how he had landed on one such beach lulled by the heady scents of palms and unfamiliar vegetation free for a while from the spartan life aboard ship he had been totally unprepared for the sudden rush of screaming stabbing savages it still came back to him especially at moments like this norwest by north sir steady as she goes very well bolitho turned slightly towards herrick nothing thomas not even smoke from a fire herrick replied i dont like it he too had a glass trained on the islands at this crawl any lookout would have sighted us long ago as if to confirm his words six bells chimed out from the forecastle eleven oclock a long while since dawn bolitho bit his lip too long he did not know the eurotas but she was a wellfound ship and no stranger to these waters her captain james lloyd had an equally sound reputation but even if the ship had foundered on a reef surely some survivors would have got clear in the boats he lowered the glass and watched a shark rise momentarily to show the whole of its sleek back to the sunlight barely an oars length from the side midshipman swift said cutters signalling sir even his voice was hushed like the hot breeze like the ship bolitho raised the glass again and saw starling one of the masters mates standing upright in the sternsheets his arm outstretched take note mr lakey bolitho shut the glass with a snap the boat has sighted shoals to the norwest he looked up shading his eyes with his forearm under topsails and jib only tempest was making poor headway but they had to stay alert be ready to come about in a babys breath if necessary and fight clear of those hidden reefs he watched the sails barely filling and the shortened shapes of the lookouts just to watch them made him feel dizzy one was not even holding on to his perch in the crosstrees and bolitho could see his leg jerking up and down probably in time with a song only he could hear lakey left the wheel where two helmsmen stood crushed by the blazing sunlight and walked to the quarterdeck rail bolitho turned to face him dragging at his shoe which had stuck to the deck seams lakey said quietly been thinking sir theres another island to the noreast on the chart it shows no name but sailors call it the island of five hills he shrugged for the hills are all there are of it i went ashore there some years back when i was serving in the old fowey the hills give good shelter to an anchorage and theres a beach too we put in looking for water he sighed remembering but apart from rock pools we were unlucky herrick said well eurotas is hardly likely to be there is she he could barely hide his impatience like most of those around him he was feeling the strain lakey was unmoved its not that sir if the ship was damaged holed mebbe well she could be beached in safety with far less chance of attack by natives an the like than on the larger islands he frowned i should have thought of it earlier bolitho looked at him thinking hard no matter it makes good sense and as we have to pass through the islands anyway well lose nothing by extending the search a little mr starlings signalling again sir swifts tanned face was screwed up with concentration as he watched the cutter through the big signals telescope reefs close to larboard but still no bottom lakey breathed out slowly the chart is right about that anyway bolitho plucked the shirt away from his chest it was wringing wet nevertheless we will begin sounding ourselves pass the word forward to the leadsman it must be like a great spiky cavern down there bolitho thought he could picture tempests hull as it would be seen by fish or merman dull against the glittering surface idling forward between the reefs while far beneath her keel the sea fell away to blackness to a silent world somebody must have sighted the ship even if the lookouts could see no sign of life there would be other eyes about the word would be passed through the islands quicker than any known signal a ship was near a manofwar once tempest had passed by the people would emerge to continue their lives in their own way preying on each other hunting fishing killing no bottom zur bolitho watched the cutter thoughtfully call away the quarter boat mr borlase take her yourself and run close inshore once we are through the reefs no risks but keep an eye open for wreckage washed into caves or on the beaches arm your people and mount a swivel in the bows borlase who had been a spectator like most of the ships company forced his sundulled mind to react aye sir he cupped his hands quarter boats crew lay aft tempest was moving so slowly that it was not even necessary to heave to while the men tumbled into the boat and thrust off from the side bolitho watched until borlase had got his men working the boat properly and had a sail hoisted to the solitary mast it was better to do something than merely stand still and brood it would also confuse any hostile eye on the shore boats in the water without obvious purpose could mean anything and would delay the passing of messages until the reason became clearer by th mark twenty zur a pause as the leadsman hauled in his line handoverhand rocky bottom bolitho looked at herrick if the tallow in the bottom of the lead held no sand it was likely they were right above the reef at its safest point twenty fathoms were as secure as a hundred starling in his cutter would not even have known it was there for with a boats smaller lead and line of half that length he would be unaware that the worst was over but his sounding was still essential a sudden uplift of reef an uncharted pinnacle no matter how small could tear out tempests bilge like an axe through a hammock he watched the surf writhing beneath another headland no wonder old sailormen kept their audiences enthralled with tales of sirens and mermaids luring ships to their deaths it all looked so peaceful so inviting no bottom zur bolitho moved restlessly to the starboard side and tried not to think of fresh cool drinking water like that which you found in streams and brooks in cornwall so clear and refreshing it was like wine he saw keen watching him his face in a frown probably thinks me mad to keep on looking searching he heard the rattle of canvas and blocks as another weak gust filled the sails to make the masthead pendant lick out like a long tongue few of the seamen and marines were speaking or even showing much interest in the passing islands the gurgle of water alongside the creak of the wheel were the loudest sounds to be heard deep nineteen it was like a dirge as the leadsman hauled in his line yet again lakey said suddenly theres the island sir fine on the starboard bow the hills overlap from this bearing but five there are with the anchorage beneath the second and third as i recall bolitho took a glass from midshipman romney who had been hovering nearby with his sextant in readiness for the noon ritual of shooting the sun under lakeys demanding eye poor romney could not even do that properly the other three midshipmen were now as proficient as any lieutenant better than some he saw the hills stark and bald of vegetation nearer the top but for lakeys hoard of sea knowledge he would never have guessed there were five hills in a row what a terrible place to be shipwrecked or marooned no vessel unless driven off course by a storm or on some unlawful mission would pass this way a man could die of madness as easily as of thirst by the mark fifteen bolitho touched romneys shoulder feeling his skin jump beneath the grubby shirt you keep an eye on mr borlases boat if it becomes hidden around a point or lost from view for any time inform mr herrick at once he saw the boy looking up at him as ever desperately eager yet already fearful of making some new mistake bolitho added quietly you are excused noon sights mr romney i know our position well enough but i do not wish to lose a boats crew romney touched his forehead and hurried to the nettings his telescope making him all the more pathetic lakey said gruffly never make a sea officer never in this life by the deep twelve bolitho looked away he doubted if it would get much shallower just yet but the leadsmans regular reminder calls helped to steady his thoughts without turning he knew allday was behind him despite his solid build allday could when he desired tread like a cat he said i could fetch you a drink captain bolitho shook his head later its not time allday strode forward to the rail his head to one side cannon fire if he had voiced some terrible obscenity against king and country his words could not have had a more startling effect ross masters mateofthewatch said scornfully my empty stomach more like then they all heard it a solid reechoing bang like a drum in a cave lakey nodded firmly from that anchorage must be the sound would be bounded seaward bolitho saw the faces along the gundeck upturned towards him seeing what he would do how he would begin he said signal mr starling to maintain his distance and then recall mr borlase romney exclaimed wretchedly i ccant see the other boat sir they all stared at him herrick said harshly you what romney had been distracted by the distant gunfire and the sudden excitement on the quarterdeck like everyone else who was not below he had been looking ahead and not where he had been ordered to watch bolitho gripped his hands behind him the gunfire was very irregular and obviously from only one cannon at a time whatever the reason it was not the action of someone trying to hide he looked past the midshipman and watched an outthrust shoulder of land borlase must have gone right into the beach to pursue his search it was unfortunate that romney had looked away at that moment but it could not be helped now borlase would know how to take care of himself he had already shown he was more than capable of that bolitho said sharply set the foresl mr herrick alter course two points to starboard herrick snatched up his speaking trumpet pipe the hands to the braces lively there as tempest swung heavily on her new course and the hurrying seamen freed and set the big foresail bolitho felt the slight increase in speed with the wind now almost astern and the additional span of canvas to contain it she gathered way and began to overhaul the cutter bolitho raised a glass again seeing the first hill sloping down towards the weather bow so that through the lens it appeared to be touching the figureheads left shoulder deck thar all eyes were turned up towards the foremast lookout ship at anchor round th point another crash echoed and grumbled across the blue water and bolitho saw hundreds of seabirds circling above the nearest hill like tiny white feathers he waited until the seamen had finished belaying the weather forebrace and then turned and walked aft to the wheel he could feel the helmsmen watching him and knew keen and lakey were also following his movements the senior helmsman said hoarsely nor by west sir steady she be bolitho consulted the compass and examined the trim of the yards and loosely flapping sails then he looked at herrick recalling in fleeting seconds all those other times very well you may beat to quarters now and clear for action herrick nodded his features impassive the two marine fifers came pounding aft dragging out their sticks and adjusting their drums before starting a staccato tattoo while the bosuns mates ran from hatchway to hatchway bellowing all hands all hands beat to quarters and clear for action bolitho realized that midshipman romney was still standing by the rigid helmsmen and asked what is keeping you the boy a small unmoving figure in a helterskelter of outward confusion as tempests seamen and marines ran to quarters stammered huskily ii am sorry sir i thought he trailed into silence herrick said sharply starboard side forrard report to mr jury he is already shorthanded he raised his voice move yourself mr romney he watched the midshipman hurry away and murmured god help that one the leadsman forgotten by almost everybody called by the mark ten zur bolitho watched the cutter passing abeam starling standing in the sternsheets to wave as they ploughed past he took out his watch it was all taking too long but he dare not set any more sails if tempest had to come about to avoid grounding the extra canvas would make it almost impossible herrick called cleared for action sir his eyes were on bolithos watch and he added i regret that it took all of fifteen minutes sir bolitho returned the watch to his pocket for once he had not been thinking about his standard requirement of ten minutes or less for clearing for action yes we must try to lop five minutes off it it would do herrick more good to worry about that than to know his captain was feeling new anxiety he looked over the rail and along the gundeck at the barebacked seamen by each twelvepounder and on to the forecastle where the long bowchasers and stubby carronades were also ready and waiting gun captains and marines seamen and warrant officers as mixed a company as he had ever encountered but whatever lay around the point or beyond the next horizon they were all he had he said slowly well then mr herrick run up the colours with her canvas filling and emptying as if drawing breath tempest steered unwaveringly towards the island of five hills bolitho could not recall such a frustrating and slow approach and he was conscious of the tension all around him he raised a glass to his eye again trying not to count the number of times he had done so since sighting the little island the rocks at the foot of the first headland were like broken teeth and he could see the trapped water lifting and surging amongst them and further still to a tiny crescent of beach too steep to climb from that place he decided even if he could get a boat through the rocks without stoving in her planks bang the sound of a solitary cannon echoed around the next headland above which a lopsided hill seemed about to slide straight into the sea he steadied the glass and examined the black topgallant masts and yards of the anchored vessel the careless flapping of her brailedup sails she was so close inshore that she must have been beached at some time possibly to repair damage as lakey had suggested he said alter course to weather those rocks mr lakey we will cross the bay and show ourselves though i cannot imagine what they are firing at bolitho had voiced what herrick and some of the others had been thinking since the first sound of a shot eurotas and there seemed no doubt it was she was well armed as a merchantman had to be in these waters but as there was no obvious sign of another ship she was either being harassed by natives or from the shore itself her cannon should be well able to drive off any such threat and as they had heard no heavy weapons fired in reply the mystery was all the greater hands to the braces men moved slowly in the blazing glare and then with haste as their petty officers bustled amongst them put up th helm bolitho watched the masts gaunt shadows swaying across the dried planking as tempest responded to helm and wind round and further so with the humped island swinging away to larboard revealing the bay around the second hill and the one beyond it steady as you go noreast by north sir tempest seemed to take it upon herself to increase speed as with the wind following almost in her wake she threw droplets of spray over the beakhead and the men crouching at the carronades herrick exclaimed i can see em sir a dozen or more canoes big ones with outriggers a gun fired from the other ships concealed side and a fin of spray ripped past one of the nearest canoes bolitho studied the low darting hulls the gesticulating figures who were controlling the men at the thrusting paddles clear away a bowchaser mr herrick i want a ball amongst those canoes the range is too much for grape herrick looked at him his eyes as blue as the sea will i pass the order to the gundeck to load and run out sir no it would be taking an axe to kill an ant he smiled the effort making his parched lips crack he realized he must have been moving about this pitiless deck for hours a few feet either way oblivious to the heat and the discomfort as he had fretted over what he would discover shes making a signal sir bolitho halted in his restless pacing and waited for midshipman swift to add what ship bolitho shaded his eyes as some of the canoes backpaddled vigorously and turned endon towards him they had at last realized that tempest was in the bay he ignored the bright hoist of flags as swifts signal party sent them dashing up to the yards he could leave all these things to others he had to think to hold his mind absolutely clear something was wrong like a picture where the artist had forgotten to include a face or a shadow from right forward he heard the cry larboard bowchaser ready sir very well he raised his hand fire the bang from the long ninepounder was expected but made most of the watchers start with alarm nonetheless it was always like that bolitho watched the balls progress as it touched the crests of two steep breakers which were receding from the rocks and then slammed down amidst the untidy clutter of canoes paddles thrashed wildly and acting on some signal of their own the slender hulls began to move away towards the headland which tempest had just cleared another ball sir no if we hit one of the canoes it would tell us nothing and the others will be through the rocks and away up the other coast before we had even found the wind to come about he shook his head eurotas is in some sort of trouble beg pardon sir lakey looked worried but i feel the wind rising a bit not much as yet he gestured with a hand tanned so dark it looked like carved mahogany look astern tongatapu is all but hidden in mist the glass wont tell us much but im for caution bolitho nodded the main island which they had sighted first was no more than a green and purple blur yet the eastern coastline was all of ten miles long according to the latest chart to be hidden in thick mist while out here just a few miles away the wind was freshening warned of something fiercer to come yes id not wish to be caught amongst these reefs in a real squall wed drag our anchor and be aground in no time he looked towards the open water open but for occasional feathers of spray to mark the scattered humps of reef and coral he made up his mind heave to if you please and call away the launch i want a boarding party sent across immediately he saw herrick patting his pockets and added not you thomas he sought out keens slim figure on the gundeck send the third lieutenant he held herricks attention by saying i want it to look very normal if i sent my first lieutenant or he hesitated did what my heart directs and went myself i think it might appear unusual he nodded carry on while the frigate laboured round into the wind and the business of swaying out the big launch got under way bolitho sent for captain prideaux he made the same point to him as to herrick and knew he was equally mystified just send your sergeant and a squad of marines he tried to smile at prideauxs foxy face their uniforms no matter how uncomfortable in this heat will reassure eurotass master that we are not pirates prideaux touched his hat yessir he hurried away snapping for his burly sergeant keen was on the quarterdeck already staring across at the anchored ship his face creased with responsibility pass my compliments to the eurotas mr keen he waited for the lieutenant to turn ask if we can be of assistance although from out here the ship seems in good condition he knew herrick was listening at his elbow as he continued there are some passengers aboard i would be obliged if you would enquire of them also he saw the sudden understanding on keens face now off with you with herrick he watched the launch shove off from the side the oars rising and falling like wings as it ploughed into the first steep swell from the rocks even aboard tempest bolitho could feel the powerful undertow and current in the way his ship was swaying and rattling her sails in disorder as she drifted heavily with the wind bolitho braced his legs and followed the launch with his telescope it was in calmer water already and making good speed towards the eurotas he could see activity at her entry port a touch of blue and white to mark at least one officer awaiting tempests boat no matter what reason eurotas had for being here and hull damage seemed the most likely it must have cheered every heart aboard to see the unexpected arrival of a kings ship herrick said im not sure mr keen will know what to look for sir he sounded anxious excluded from something he did not recognize bolitho lowered the glass look for thomas herrick grinned awkwardly i know you too well sir you head into the bay with gunports sealed and only a chaser to speak our authority then you send mr keen instead of me or even mr borlase when he eventually reaches us bolitho smiled the weather signs are not good i want to speed things along also i want to know why eurotas did not fire all her guns at those canoes one scattered broadside would have made kindling of them he turned to watch the boat hooking on to eurotass chains and only her captain can tell us that quarter boats in sight sir a bosuns mate was pointing over the nettings mr borlase is standing well out to clear the rocks bolitho nodded hoist his recall at once the man knuckled his forehead an the cutter is in sight too sir bolitho tried to keep his face impassive as he examined his actions seeing his men in their various roles at this moment mr starling had best remain where he is we may need more soundings directly he looked at swift signal the cutter to that effect prideauxs marines were on the eurotass upper deck now their coats like droplets of blood on the gangway bolitho trained the glass and tried to keep the scene steady as his ship wallowed heavily in the swell then he forgot herrick and everyone else as he saw some women right aft by the poop one in particular with long autumn hair holding a broadbrimmed straw hat with her hand as it caught the wind viola he almost spoke her name aloud she was there across the strip of restless water her dress the colour of fresh cream as she stood watching the captain speaking with keen while midshipman fitzmaurice arrogant even at that distance waited a little behind him he heard herrick remark i can feel the difference now then lakey said aye were in for a blow before another dawn sharp and savage itll be herrick must have turned to allday as he said like some of the girls youve known eh allday replied they were the days sir bolitho saw a marine returning to the launch they were coming back he raised the glass again climbing on to a quarterdeck sixpounder to get a better view as tempest swung crablike away from the land he was in time to see keen shake hands with the ships master and then saw viola raymond move a few paces from the other passengers it was like a silent play the youthful lieutenant pausing with one foot on the entry port grating the figure with the broadbrimmed straw hat and cream gown raising one hand to delay his leaving between them like the jilted lover of any melodrama eurotass captain was looking from one to the other then the contact was broken and keen climbed down after the rest of his men and the cutter shoved off for the long pull back to their own ship lakey swore as ross one of his mates called winds backed sir almost due south id say if it keeps abacking well be lakey snapped i know well be hardpressed to avoid a lee shore bolitho knew that all these remarks were for his benefit if not directly put he was as worried as lakey about the wind and the dangerous proximity of reefs but he was also troubled about the eurotas violas husband was supposed to be going to some new appointment their paths might never cross again he felt something like panic he should have gone in the boat himself and ignored his stupid caution everything was exactly as lakey had suggested it would be and had there been no search ordered by the governor in sydney eurotas would have arrived safe and sound in the end it was common enough for ships to be delayed after the wearisome and often hazardous passage around the horn and bolitho suspected that but for her rich cargo no such efforts would have been called for borlase and his boat were tossing and pitching around the stern as keens launch hooked on to the chains the oarsmen gasping and sweating from a hard pull keen came inboard and hurried aft well bolitho watched him partly wondering what keen thought of his captains strange whims keen took a breath as we thought sir she was damaged and holed some while back and put into this bay to complete repairs i spoke with captain lloyd and he assured me that all is now satisfactory he thanks you warmly for your support especially as he was being attacked by some savage natives he answered bolithos unasked question he had landed most of his artillery to lighten ship while the hull repairs were carried out herrick nodded makes good sense keen frowned trying to miss out nothing he did say that if you are returning to sydney he would be obliged if you would reassure the governor that cargo and convicts are safely on passage convicts bolitho had almost forgotten about them again he was reminded of their plight below decks transported perhaps forever from their own country and then after weeks at sea to be under siege in an island they did not even know he said slowly thank you have the launch hoisted inboard and prepare to get under way if you please he looked at the master without seeing him lay a course to take us clear of the northrd headland then which ever way the wind chooses to turn we will have the sea room to use it he turned back to keen as his ideas were translated into orders and action by the others was that all keen glanced at herrick but he was already calling the hands to the tackles to hoist the boat and to the braces in readiness for bringing the drifting ship under command again he said quietly as i was about to leave sir the lady the wife of yes mr keen i do know please continue she called out to me the passengers had been told who was in command of tempest she wished to be remembered to you i think she might have said more but i was about to take my leave he sounded apologetic bolitho smiled gravely did she look well keen nodded very sir he frowned but she did mention something i did not fully understand captain lloyd interrupted her by asking me for information about the missing bounty bolitho saw it once again in his minds eye the little cameo the three figures on eurotass deck try and remember exactly yes sir keen looked across at the other ship i was at the entry port when she called something like i hope your captain was able to have his watch repaired he shrugged helplessly then captain lloyd saw me to the side sir i am sorry i can tell you nothing more bolitho looked at him for several seconds you told me a great deal he took the watch from his pocket and turned it over between his fingers she had thought of the one thing which would make him suspicious he chilled despite the sun as the reality crowded in on him when his watch had stopped a musket ball it had saved his thigh from a bad wound but it had been smashed to fragments in the process she had known it and had given him this one as a gift to replace it it was the one thing she would remember he asked sharply was mr raymond present aye sir but he remained aft with some of the others i see herrick strode from the gangway and said ready to get under way sir i have had word passed to mr starling of our intentions and he will proceed ahead of us right away he sensed bolithos mood is something wrong everything bolitho thrust the watch into his pocket he felt angry and sick at the same time to think of her across the water suffering god knew what torment and trying to find a way of warning him through keen she would never mention the watch in the presence of her husband it was their own secret and in any case she would not have forgotten the truth of the story he said then get under way mr herrick he looked up at the masthead pendant its backed a point more by the look of it we will try and stand clear of the islands before it gets worse he looked at the lieutenant and said simply the eurotas is taken we must land our people and attack before they know what we are about they stared at him as if he had just gone raving mad but but herrick floundered for words i heard most of what mr keen described sir i can find no hint of trouble there especially as we have chased the attackers away i believe the real enemy is within that ship he dropped all formality and stood between them you both know about my watch even though you are careful never to mention it you both know and none better than mr keen himself that he was nursed by viola raymond after his cruel injury she was i believe very good to you he looked at each in turn do you honestly believe she would falsify one fact and omit to mention the other altogether keen answered no sir i do not thomas bolitho watched his friend the emotions on his open face i must know herrick bit his lip perhaps not sir but to assume the ship to be in wrong hands well bolitho turned away do any of us know captain lloyd have we ever spoken with eurotas before he swung round making keen start there is no other reason for such careful deception herrick rubbed his chin that being the case sir i think we should make haste he sighed if youre wrong and if im not he watched him gravely what then thomas lakey called all ready aft sir his voice broke the spell bolitho said once clear of the next headland i want you to set the tgallants mr herrick now send your topmen aloft and let us be about it eh awkwardly at first until her yards were braced round to receive the freshening wind tempest tilted to the pressure and began to turn her jib boom towards the next headland high above the decks the seamen worked busily and expertly untroubled by the menace which viola raymonds message had thrown amongst them by early evening the island of five hills lay sprawled far astern across the larboard quarter its shape and outline lost in haze and reflected glare in the cabin bolitho sat at his table an untouched meal pushed to one side the wind had backed still further and it would take some while to beat round the northern tip of the tiny island they had just left but equally the wind would prevent eurotas from sailing he thought about the attacking war canoes an accidental encounter or an attempted settlement of past scores but without them it was doubtful if they would have discovered eurotass anchorage her captain whoever he was would have had lookouts ashore and they must have seen tempests patient and persistent search amongst the islands if he had not been forced to fire guns at the canoes and remained silent tempest might have missed the little island completely but there were too many ifs bolitho moved restlessly to the stern windows and sought out the dorsal fin close astern there had been a firm link between the two ships which the other captain could not have suspected in any way he touched the watch in his pocket the fear was that the brave gesture might already have cost her life after the storm true to the sailing masters prediction the weather began to worsen rapidly soon after midnight the wind although hot and without freshness mounted in power and as moon and stars vanished beyond low layers of scudding cloud tempest prepared to fight it out even bolitho found it an eerie experience after heat and searing glare the slow and patient changes of tack to use what little wind they had had at their bidding this violent motion the distorted roar and hiss of waves were unnatural their world had shrunk again confined to familiar objects and handholds about the decks while beyond the bulwarks the water seethed and boiled like a cauldron before fading into the surrounding darkness he found plenty of time to pity the men working aloft on the quivering thrumming yards and shrouds occasionally during a brief lull in the winds strange moaning he heard the topmen and their petty officers yelling to one another high above the deck voices distorted and wild like demented spirits herrick lurched up the tilting quarterdeck and shouted all secure sir he waved one arm his blurred outline gleaming dully with blown spray she should ride it out well enough if all holds together he ducked cursing as a frothing wave rolled along the weather side and burst over the nettings drenching everyone in reach with all respects to the late and lamented captain cook sir i think he was wrong to name these the friendly islands god damn them i say bolitho groped his way aft to where lakey and his mates and three helmsmen who were lashed to the wheel swayed and bobbed in a tight breathless group he peered at the compass bowl unnaturally bright in the tiny lamp and tried not to consider what this delay might mean he was thinking like the french captain he had fought le chaumareys had started to plan too much beyond the present at sea you could not take even the next minute for granted he pictured his command reeling and plunging with spars and cordage under savage pressure he could have run with the wind and even now might have been well clear of the worst of it but if the wind continued to rise tempest might have been driven many miles to the north with little hope of getting back to the island in time to act these violent tropical storms were frequently followed by intense calms and if that happened bolitho knew the chances of a quick passage were destroyed as it was his ship was standing into the wind as well as could be expected under her great maintopsail only shortened and under constant watch she was lyingto like a floundering glistening hulk he heard the occasional clank of pumps but knew they were being used merely to clear the water which swept over the weather side and thundered along the gundeck like surf before finding its way below any other frigate bolitho had known would have been working badly in this sea and the pumps would have been manned and busy through each backbreaking minute but tempest with all her faults in manoeuvrability was as tight as a powder cask and her stout teak timbers barely leaked a drop bolitho watched the water sluicing down the lee side cascading over each tethered twelvepounder eager to catch a spluttering halfblinded seaman and knock him senseless into the scuppers as it passed he gripped the hammock nettings and tried to think although he felt halfnumbed by sea and wind the eurotas should be safe in her sheltered anchorage but if her cables carried away she could go aground and break up even there suppose after all this he was wrong that keen had been mistaken in what viola had said to him or had tried to invent something just to please him maybe she had blended her message with sarcasm that only he would understand so that should they meet again he would stand clear and keep his place or perhaps she did want to see him and thought such a message would bring him back anyway he pushed his hair from his eyes as the spume and ragged spray drifted through the mizzen ratlines like darts no if he was right about her he had to be equally so about eurotas he felt herrick lurching to the nettings beside him mr lakey stakes his reputation that thisll last till noon sir herrick waited squinting into the darkness but at least well be able to see what were about ive trebled the lookouts but were drifting too much for comfort he sounded raw from shouting orders maybe we shouldve gone closer to the eurotas grappled her and to hell with the weather he was thinking aloud but it sounded like criticism im not sure of anything now bolitho replied if im right thomas i think both ships would have been in danger the passengers the convicts who knows how many more might have been murdered or killed in the attack herrick wiped his mouth with his sleeve aye i suppose so my guess is that the convicts were released out of humanity when the ship struck and then seized control he turned waiting for bolithos opinion if the ship struck thomas theres something too clean about all this starling one of the masters mates by the compass yelled i heard somethin carry away aloft sir as if to mark his warning two heavy blocks and some fifty feet of cordage clattered across the quarterdeck like a twinheaded snake starling was already bellowing for extra hands to get up the treacherous shrouds and secure the damage it was small enough but if unchecked might spread to something worse bolitho listened to the masters mate and marvelled starling had been hoisted inboard with his cutter at the last possible moment so that his leadsman could give the ship as much speed as possible to clear the reefs a misjudgement or a man losing his nerve and the cutter might have been left astern in this sea it would be unlikely to survive and yet starling who had begun life as a drummer boy in a foot regiment and had run off to join a kings ship for preference had showed little excitement when he had reported to the quarterdeck right on time sir was all he had said and now he was up and about shouting and instructing the afterguard as if nothing had happened out of the ordinary bolitho saw the legs and ragged trousers of one of the seamen hurrying up the ratlines the bare feet moving rapidly like paddles he recognized the man as jenner before he vanished into the maze of rigging above the deck another piece of human flotsam jenner was an american who had fought in the revolutionary navy against the british a good seaman although something of a dreamer he had joined his old enemies as if he had become bored with the independence he had helped to win just beneath the quarterdeck ducking and jumping clear of the thundering crests which swept over the twelvepounders was another mystery a giant negro he had been found half dead in a drifting longboat shortly after bolitho had taken command he had been naked and cruelly savaged by sun and thirst worse when he was taken below to the surgeon gwyther had reported in his precise manner the fellow has no tongue it has been cut out in the drifting longboat they had discovered a metal disc all it had cut on it was the name orlando the name of a ship a man a piece of cargo nobody knew bolitho suspected the boat had been from a slaver and that the big negro had either tried to escape or had been cast adrift as a warning to others but when tempest had reached land again their survivor did not want to be put ashore despite all that was said to him in every language which the ships company could muster and that was quite considerable so with his new name and rating entered on the muster book as orlando a landman he had been accepted because the american jenner seemed to get on with him better than most herrick had put them both in the afterguard the mizzen mast and its attendant sails and rigging was by far the least complicated of any squarerigged ship and orlandos inability to speak and jenners dreamy attitude which even the touch of the boatswains rattan had failed to cure would leave them less chance of suffering or causing an accident that was typical of herrick of course always watching over his men as he had been when bolitho had first met him in the phalarope during the war a ship beset with discontent and inhuman treatment where a junior officer could reasonably be expected to keep his silence rather than provoke a tyrannical captain not so herrick his ideals his stubborn yardstick of right and wrong had more than once put him into real danger bolitho always hoped that herrick would get a chance of the promotion he richly deserved but peace the countless numbers of sailors thrown on the beach without work or hope had blocked his chances he was lucky to be employed at all unlike bolitho whose family and upbringing had been set in tradition with the sea and ships the only possible career herrick came from a poor family what he had he had worked for because he needed it the fact he loved the sea was a hardwon bonus sir the fore tgansl is tearin adrift bolitho dashed the salt from his eyes and tried to see up through the rigging then he heard it the irregular crack and thunder of canvas freeing itself from the yard threatening to fill with wind and change the trim of the ship herrick cupped his hands mr borlase send your people aloft mr jury stand by the main staysl he turned panting if the tgansl carries away without ripping itself to pieces well need the staysl to give us balance he showed his teeth god how quick the mind skips when you need it bolitho nodded herrick had acted well and without waiting for approval if as could still happen before the topmen fought their way up the foremast shrouds the sail freed itself entirely it would slew the bows round and their situation in the rising gale could be suddenly critical he saw the boatswain mustering his men beneath the mainmast others wading through waistdeep water to reach their stations familiarity harsh and sometimes unfair discipline had made them so in pitch darkness or in a raging storm they could find their way about a ship as a blind man will know his own cottage borlase was busy too his voice matching the wind as he urged the foretopmen into action when he shouted his voice tended to be shrill and piercing and bolitho knew the midshipmen often made unflattering comments about it behind his back it was strange that few people ever thought about the cabin skylight on the poop voices from the watchkeeping officers reached the captain very easily bolitho had learned his lesson early as a midshipman when his captain had called from the skylight i am sorry i did not hear that where did you say you met the girl all these things and more he had tried to describe to viola raymond when she had sailed with him as a passenger he had expected her to be bored or tolerantly patient perhaps from those first conversations had grown the ache he now felt for her safety with each dragging hour i think they are in trouble sir herrick was leaning over the quarterdeck rail his back and legs streaming with water he yelled what is it borlase strode aft his figure leaning over against the ships steep angle mr romney sir hes out on the fore tgansl yard despite the din of wind and sea he sounded irritated theres enough risk as it is without bolitho cut him short send up a bosuns mate or someone senior enough for him to trust he looked at herrick his voice bitter midshipman romney may never make a lieutenant but he tries as hard as ten men ill not have him fall because mr borlase has not the sense to see the danger he swung away trying to hold on to the picture of the island their position and bearing from it what he must do or avoid when the time came yet all he could see was that terrified boy clinging to a yard some hundred and fifty feet above the deck with a great billowing mass of windhardened canvas trying to smash him down and hurl him to certain death a quick end if he hit the deck slower by a little if he fell into the sea he might live long enough to see his ship fade into the darkness for no boat could be lowered now and tempests drift would outpace any swimmer bolitho thought too of the shark which was there to greet each new day midshipman swift blurted out ill go sir he faltered as both bolitho and herrick turned towards him hell trust me and besides he hesitated i promised i would watch out for him they all looked forward as someone yelled hes gone something pale fell through the rigging and struck the lee side of the forecastle near one of the carronades it made a sickening sound and then bolitho saw the body bounce over into the creaming water which surged back from the stem nobody said anything for several seconds so that the roaring noises of the storm swept in on them like a fanfare of brutish triumph midshipman swift said thickly iim sorry sir i should have then he pointed along the gundeck swaying like a puppet and suspended on a bowline being lowered rapidly from the foretop was midshipman romney several seamen ran to catch him and lay him on the deck while schultz the bosuns mate who had been sent aloft to assist him on the yard hurried aft and stood below the quarterdeck his face upturned as he said in his thick guttural voice mr romney is safe zur he showed his teeth as if in pain as more water surged over the nettings and doused him from head to foot he vas trying to save a man from falling he shook his big head sadly it vas too much by god zey both nearly die dawn coming up sir lakey slapped water from his watchcoat young mr romney is lucky to see it bolitho nodded who was the seaman the bosuns mate replied tait zur he shrugged good man i tink by the time the topmen had finally mastered the rebellious sail and returned to the deck the sea had opened up on either beam in a violent rearing panorama of broken crests and dark troughs herrick said and you always hope youre going to get by without losing a man he sighed bolitho saw allday climbing through the cabin companionway and replied that is true he turned with surprise as allday said ive brought you something to cheer sir it was brandy and bolitho felt it going through him like fire a seaman observed that bloody sharks still arter us th bugger another answered reckon old jim tait made a good meal eh bolitho looked at herrick no words were needed life at sea was hard too hard perhaps to reveal weakness even when a friend had died lakey closed his telescope with a snap i think i know where we are sir he sounded satisfied separated from the drama which had just left them ill be able to fix our position very shortly he tugged out his watch which if set beside bolithos would have looked like a chronometer aye ill be able to do that bolitho looked away searching for the tiny islet which lakey had marked as one which he would be able to identify if the wind dropped he sighed not if lakey meant when and that was enough if only he was as confident and as spared of doubts in his own ability of what he would do when they returned to the island he saw romney walking aft pale and dazed and seemingly unable to understand why the sodden unshaven seamen nodded and grinned to him as he passed bolitho looked down at him that was well done mr romney the midshipman would have fallen but orlandos towering shape shining in spray like wet coal caught him and carried him beneath the quarterdeck when he recovered bolitho thought he might be able to use that one wild gesture as a prop or a lifeline it could make all the difference herrick watched him narrowly seeing the signs of uncertainty and searching enquiry which made bolitho so dear to him each one aboard had a job of work to do hard or less demanding according to rank or station carried out well or just well enough to suit a mans individuality but it all came from aft from the one man who now stood with a dented goblet in one hand while he gripped the nettings with the other bolithos black hair was matted with salt and blown spume and his shirt stained with tar and grease from a dozen encounters with guns and tackles during the night yet he stood out as their captain as if he were in a dress uniform bolitho said abruptly that rogue of a cook will not be able to light his galley fire for hours yet mr herrick he had to raise his voice for the winds noise like the light was strengthening pass the word to mr bynoe to broach some spirits for the people theyll not care what it is i think rum or gin go down as well with salt spray as brandy he met herricks glance his grey eyes suddenly bright then we will decide what to do the heat in the cabin was overwhelming and bolitho had to use something like physical strength to control his nausea all day while tempest had fought sea and gale and they had been buffeted slowly and inexorably around the islands and the protective barriers of reef and shoal he had examined his ideas and plans from every angle by noon he had known they were winning their battle with the weather and from the faces and voices of many of his men he knew they were proud of what they had done together it was strange how quickly men could change men penned together for months sometimes years on end who saw and examined each others habits and flaws like misers counting their gains and losses an argument could flare into blood and harsh punishment using their common understanding could bind them just as easily into a single body and then with the wind still ripping the crests from the long banks of waves the sun had emerged again pinning them down with its old familiar force it had seemed as if the ship was afire and to some of the less experienced men it must have looked as if tempest was about to become their pyre from every plank and timber spar and piece of rigging the sun had raised great clouds of steam and even the seamens bare bodies had left tendrils of it behind them as they had worked to splice and make good the damage left by the storm it was night now but with a difference outside the great cabin windows the moon had laid a firm path on the sea rippling in a light wind which mercifully brought them this far everything else shone darkly like black liquid glass but it was hot and in the crowded cabin it was hard not to think of cool transparent water jugs and jugs of it filling yourself until you felt like bursting bolitho watched the bottle of stale wine going round the table herrick keen lakey and captain prideaux of the marines were refilling their glasses looking at the masters chart wondering saying little a storm at sea knocks the stuff out of a man bolitho thought like a physical fight all bruises and anger then it was done and all you wanted to do was creep away and be alone he said we are now standing off the norwest shore of the island i dared not beat in earlier for fear of lookouts on the hills the island is only a mile wide at this point our approach would be easily recognized he paused hearing borlases feet moving about the deck above as near to the cabin skylight as he could prudently get he knew herrick was watching him he even knew what he was thinking preparing to say bolitho continued evenly mr lakey is certain that we can reach a small cove without too much difficulty the moon will assist and once inshore the land will afford some shelter against the wind he looked round the table i intend to land a small but wellarmed party it is already being arranged he saw herrick nod but the important part is afterwards prideaux said tersely i think it would be better to land all the marines sir a show of force no matter the reason for showing it usually works wonders bolitho looked at him prideaux was very relaxed he was enjoying it he obviously thought discussion unnecessary and stupid that his captain was totally out of depth with his plan as well as with the execution of it bolitho said to the cabin at large we will take thirty men and the marines selected will be your best sharpshooters captain prideaux the sergeant will be one and he is picking six more i do not want a show of anything if my fears are justified we will have to act with haste and with stealth there was a tap at the door and the midshipmanofthewatch stepped into the lanternlight mr borlase sends his respects sir and wishes you to know that the boats are ready for lowering his eyes moved round the cabin as he spoke midshipman pyper was seventeen and probably already saw himself as a captain in some fine ship very well bolitho leaned over the chart knowing they were watching his every move once the landing party is ashore the boats will return to the ship there are too many eyes about for my liking and i want no evidence of our movements left in the open then tempest will steer south and round the southern headland much as we did originally mr herrick knows what is expected once you arrive there and will pass his instructions in his own time the landing party will divide into halves one under mr keen and the other will go with me we will cross the island to the bay he pulled out his watch and flicked it open the hands showed two oclock in the morning dawn came up fresh and quick in these waters there was no room for doubts now after that gentlemen we will think again they all stood up and bolitho added and remember to tell the people exactly what we are doing explain that protecting lives is as much part of the navys work as taking them in battle they moved to the door already grappling with their own parts of the pattern he had thrust on them herrick stood his ground as bolitho knew he would i think i should take charge ashore sir he sounded very calm but determined it is my right and in any case in any case thomas you think i am foolhardy to go myself eh he smiled gravely as allday came out of the shadows and took down the old sword from the bulkhead it is my decision many of you probably think it is a wrong one i have doubts too over some things he waited for allday to buckle the sword round his waist ill feel more at peace amongst chaos of my own making than fretting aboard this ship and worrying that you may have fallen because of me he held up his hand it is done thomas i know you relish a good argument but leave it until my return he clapped him on the shoulder now see us away and do your part on deck the air was a little cooler but not much bolitho walked to the starboard gangway and looked down at the jostling figures who were being sorted out and having their weapons and meagre supplies checked by jury the boatswain he tried to appear relaxed to recognize and acknowledge each of these silent men once the boats had gone from the beach they would be entirely selfdependent there was no water on the island as lakey had long since discovered just a handful of men their small resources and an unknown enemy he heard someone whisper by god the capns comin with us must be important another said hoarsely wants to stretch is legs more like silence on deck that was jury borlase touched his hat he looked enormous against the moon all mustered sir bolitho looked at herrick heave to if you please then we will lower the boats he touched the sword against his hip after that he shrugged with her canvas flapping noisily tempests shadow rode across the moons path while the three boats were swayed out and the seamen and marines scrambled into them two boats would have been sufficient under normal circumstances but with the additional hands required to pull them back to the ship overcrowding would have added a full hour to the operation bolitho made a last check in his mind lieutenant keen aged twentytwo was his second in command james ross masters mate a thickset scot with dark red hair would add weight and experience to the party sergeant quare and his six sharpshooters all strangely unrecognizable without their usual scarlet coats and hugging their long muskets like backwoodsmen midshipman swift and miller a boatswains mate completed the authority the bulk of the men had been chosen for their skills their ability to obey under almost any conditions and some because they would kill without hesitation if such was the need he took a long breath carry on mr ross he saw the masters mate raise his fist and then the cutter began to move away from the deck it looked crammed with men oars and weapons next tempests launch and her largest longboat idled clear of the side oars in momentary confusion until the current swung them away from the ships undertow bolitho saw keen very upright in the sternsheets his shirt holding the moonlight like a banner allday was already in the gig as were midshipman swift and the rest of the last group bolitho touched herricks arm perhaps when this is done you may have more respect for captain cooks description of the islands he smiled grimly take care thomas then he lowered himself down the side and jumped out into the gig allday said shove off out oars give way all the gig plunged and rose steeply in the swell and now they were clear of the ships hull bolitho could hear the hiss and boom of breakers he glanced along the boat at the regular rise and fall of the oars it was not easy to pull smoothly with the boat filled with arms and legs he noticed too that his gigs crew had donned their chequered shirts which they always wore for taking their captain on his normal affairs of duty this was hardly normal and he was moved to say thank you lads but nobody spoke and the only sound to match the sea was the steady creak of oars when he looked astern again tempest was only a tall shadow with the moons silver across her flapping topsails as soon as the boats were safely hoisted inboard again she would set every stitch of canvas she could carry to stand clear of the land as fast as possible a shuttered lantern blinked from the leading boat ross had sighted the first elbow of rocks they must follow through one gap and then a second after that it was no more than a cable to the beach if it was there watch your helm allday this is the worst part he saw the quick exchanges throughout the boat it was best for everyone to know all the risks and not just some of them he thought the sea noises changed again the great surge of water against the outer reef muffled slightly as the three boats forged steadily around the glistening crags of rock little waterfalls changed to surging torrents as the tide cascaded over and around the rock barrier making pools and lakes and just as quickly draining them again the bowman called beach dead ahead sir a pause cutters already there by the time allday had steered the gig through the last scattering of rocks and lined up the stem with the tiny patch of beach the cutter was already passing on the return trip the bowman leapt down and almost fell as he guided the boat into the shallows and more men waded out to stop her from broaching to men weapons discipline bolitho watched his gig backing water with the oars the crews check shirts already more distinct in the first hint of dawn he felt alldays grip steadying him as he climbed up the wet sand and on to some fallen boulders they were all cut off and he had brought them here he said i will lead with my party mr keen you will bear south and then east as soon as we get off the beach good luck with allday and midshipman swift at his heels he turned and looked up the steep suncracked slope if ever he had needed his confidence it was now he decided now or never we will rest here bolitho lowered himself on one knee and unslung the telescope from his shoulder sergeant quares scouts will be back directly the gasping sweating file of seamen climbed over the lip of a small gully and found what shelter they could amongst thick prickly bushes the sun was higher and the heat which was thrown back from the hillside and cracked boulders fiercer than ever bolitho trained his telescope on the nearest of the islands five hills it was more rounded than the others so that it looked hunched leaning away from him towards the sea on the other side he saw a brief glitter of reflection probably on a weapon as one of the scouts paused to examine one of the many small gullies but nothing else moved it was like a dead place harder now to believe that the eurotas was anchored beyond the big hill that she had ever been there midshipman swift scrambled over loose stones his tanned features shining with sweat he liked swift more so since his willingness to go aloft in the storm to rescue romney he had pleasant regular features and hair so bleached by sun and salt bolitho doubted if his mother would recognize him swift had been barely fifteen when she had last seen him when she saw him next with any kind of luck he would be a lieutenant bolitho said pass the word just take a sip of water see that they dont drink the whole lot at once he felt the wind ruffling his hair and shifted his glass towards the sea it was rarely out of sight in this island it was hard to believe they had come through a storm how blue the sea looked with just the cruising movement of white horses to betray the wind which had carried tempest away to the south under full canvas now it was empty reaching away towards the larger islands and sluicing over the long reef barriers to show the set of the tide and yet another change of wind sergeant quare strode through the dusty bushes his boots covered in salt and sand he was a tall powerful man with intense pride in his marines and what they could do bolitho nodded to him seems quiet enough quare lowered a musket to the ground and slitted his eyes in the glare two more hours and we should see something sir he had a round devonian dialect which was like a touch of home he hesitated course the ship might have upanchored already sir yes bolitho took a flask from allday and let a little water trickle over his tongue brackish from the ships casks yet it tasted like the best wine in st jamess quare straightened his back his eyes on the opposite slope here comes blissett sir the scout in question loped down the slope towards them seemingly without effort his musket held high to avoid striking the ground bolitho knew something of blissetts past and why quare had selected him as a scout the marine had once worked on a vast estate in norfolk as one of the gamekeepers and a fine shot to boot he had enjoyed a good and fairly comfortable life until that was he had set his cap at the niece of his lord and master bolitho imagined that the matter was probably more complicated than quare knew but the end result was that blissett had been thrown out of work and had gone into town to drown his sorrows a recruiting party had been at the inn also and the rest marked down in a haze of despair and bravado was now history the island of five hills must seem very different from norfolk blissett arrived beside them its pretty fair going once you get up that slope sir he pointed i reckon the sea is just yonder with the bay below that shoulder of rock he took a flask gratefully quare nodded mr keens party will be about an hour later than us its a longer route round the other side of the hill he cocked his head still we should meet up midafternoon what dyou say tom blissett shrugged reckon so sarnt i found a few fire places in the gullies but not new ones the last piece he added hastily as some of the seamen in earshot moved with sudden apprehension no natives around here for some while bolitho reslung his telescope and gestured to swift get the men on the move again same distances as before you take two hands to the rear and make sure were not being followed he looked up at the sunbaked slopes there would be no cover here a perfect place for an ambush he could sense the men as they followed at his back breathless and tired already and totally unused to tramping over land they would never respect him again if they found he had led them on a fools errand he tightened his belt but better him than herrick herrick had taken enough knocks on his behalf bolitho concentrated on the land ahead keeping his pace slow but regular as he tried to picture the other side of the hill tomorrow if the wind was favourable tempest would tack around the southernmost headland once again and if there were lookouts on the shore they should sight her immediately more to the point bolithos scouts should see them it should appear quite natural deception was a game any number could play after a fierce storm it might even be expected for a kings ship to return to the bay if only to ascertain that eurotas was still intact allday broke into his thoughts a scouts signalling captain i think hes sighted the other party he grinned unfeelingly god mr keens people will curse when they see the hill theyve still got to climb sergeant quare hurried across the lip of another gully and dropped out of sight he appeared eventually on a fallen landslide of loose stones while slightly above him another marine gestured and pointed like a deaf mute quare came back breathing fast he says to stand fast sir a runner is coming from mr keen he mopped his face and neck hell not run for long in this lot bolithos party sank gratefully into the bushes again and waited for the messenger to arrive it took a full hour and when he was finally dragged out of a gully the man looked almost spent with exhaustion it was miller boatswains mate nimble enough when dashing about the deck in a full gale or urging the hands out on the swaying yards but no match for this island take your time bolitho concealed his impatience wondering why keen should send him and delay the worst part of the journey miller gulped noisily mr keens respects sir an e he gulped down air again like a landed fish we found some corpses he pointed vaguely in a little cove their throats was cut sir he looked suddenly sick as the memory came back to him i i think they was officers bolitho watched him not wanting to break his train of thought but quare asked bluntly you think miller looked past him aye george you just know them things he gave a violent shudder mr ross reckons theyve bin dead for days covered with flies they was still are bolitho nodded despite the horror of the story he realized that either keen or ross had managed to keep his head and not do what every decent man would wish and bury the unknown bodies but they were not unknown the eurotass senior officers in all probability murdered after being taken to the little cove he wondered if keen had thought the same as he had shaken hands with the man he had thought to be the ships captain he had been facing a murderer in his victims coat the realization moved through him like sickness viola had tried to warn him she might have died just as horribly because of it he snapped get back to mr keen fast as you can manage tell him we will meet as arranged but with double the caution he watched his words sinking in nobody must see our approach if we are sighted before we can act miller the ship may weigh and mr herrick will have no chance of catching her he did not add that it might as easily mean the landing party would be murdered beforehand the expression on millers stubbled face told him he had already considered it bolitho looked at quare and the others come along he strode up the slope again the heat and discomfort suddenly forgotten youll need to stay down sir quare spoke with a whisper as bolitho crawled beside him between two great boulders the stones were like heated metal and bolitho was conscious of the cuts and bruises he had gathered on his limbs and body in the final part of the journey the big hill was quite different on the other side and different again from the way it had looked from seaward there was a broad cleft halfway down and then another slope which continued down to the beach and the bay and there hazy in the sunlight lay the eurotas still at her anchor and with several boats alongside and two drawn up on the sand clear of the surf there were a few figures visible on her poop and maindeck but no sign of work being carried out on the hull or anything else bolitho wished he could use his telescope and study the ship more closely but with the sun blazing down at an angle he dared not risk a sudden reflection warning of their arrival above the bay quare had already sent blissett and another scout to see what they could discover but bolitho had to guess what was happening aboard the ship if he was to be of any use quare hissed there sir several men had walked into view from the bottom of the hill they were moving slowly untroubled but all were armed to the teeth one was drinking from a bottle and had to be aided over the gunwale of a small boat before they pushed it into deep water and started towards the ship that left one boat ashore bolitho blinked the sweat from his eyes but how many men swift crept up behind him mr keens party is coming sir bolitho looked at him keep them away from here and no talking you make sure the weapons are unloaded i dont want a musket going off in error he looked at the anchored ship and tried to think what to do she lay a cables length from the beach and the boat which had left the island was barely halfway to her exposed helpless against even the smallest weapons but where were the guns which keen had been told were unloaded to lighten the ship they were certainly not in the empty ports along the nearest side nor were they on the beach surely they had not been jettisoned it would take a long time and there seemed no point in it unless he stared towards the southern headland almost black against the glittering sea another ship perhaps the eurotass guns may have been offloaded into her he closed his eyes tightly he could form no pattern at all blissett came round the side of the great rocks soundlessly quare asked what is it tom the marine wiped his mouth and stared at the ship we found a dead girl down the bottom there she must have put up quite a fight poor lass but they done for her all the same when theyd had their way bolitho looked at him his mind reeling he barely recognized his own voice what sort of girl blissett frowned young un english id say probably bein deported to botany bay or th like sir he said nothing more but his eyes proclaimed bitterness his anger at those who had sent the unknown girl to this easy tom quare turned to bolitho you were right sir i wish to god id been wrong the ship has been taken not by the convicts he saw the question on quares face theyd not waste time and labour hoisting big guns over the side theyd be weak and frightened after what theyve been through i believe our enemy is something far more dangerous and without mercy he rolled on his back and dragged out his watch despising himself for his relief he had feared it was viola lying down there it would not be dark for several hours he said post a good watch sergeant then join me he hurried down the slope and into a tangle of driedup bushes the whole place seemed scorched by the sun and covered by the droppings of countless seabirds keen and the others crowded round him he said i believe theres a boatload of men ashore somewhere theyre probably out on the headland its too dangerous to run a boat through those rocks which is why they were taken by surprise by the canoes its my guess theyve mounted a guard there to watch for ships and to drive off any native canoes before they can pass through the rocks keen nodded and their boat is unguarded ross ran his thick fingers through his red hair now it is mr keen after night itll be another story entirely bolitho said well take cover as soon as its dark well go to the beach he glanced at keen when you boarded eurotas did you see many of her company keen looked surprised well no sir i suppose i assumed they were working below decks with a kings ship entering the bay and a pack of yelling warriors nearby in canoes bolitho thought it was unlikely that any seaman would be so set on his work it was strange he had not thought about it earlier so there had to be a second even a third ship he turned and scrambled back up the slope to the two boulders and crawled beside a watching marine he studied the ship for several minutes there was no doubt about it the eurotas was standing higher in the water all those cannon a valuable cargo and ships stores no wonder there were so few hands visible about her decks just enough to watch over the ship the wretched convicts battened below he tried not to think of the murdered girl he returned to the others keen watched him his face tight with anxiety bolitho said it will be a gamble he saw alldays hand drop to his cutlass but i intend to board that ship as soon as its dark once there we can hold her until tempest arrives ross said flatly the winds no helping mr herrick sir its veered quite a piece since we stepped ashore he looked at the clear sky aye we may have a long wait im thinking keen said why dont you take a rest sir i will stand the first watch but bolitho shook his head i must go and have another look at the ship keen watched him climbing towards the twin boulders he should rest mr ross well need all his edge tonight allday heard him and stared up at the boulders bolitho would not rest or close even one eye until it was done until he knew he drew his cutlass and sliced its heavy blade through the sand allday had grown to like viola raymond very much she had been good for the captain when he had needed her most but he had been secretly grateful when she had sailed for england she represented trouble a threat to his captains future fate or lady luck as lieutenant herrick would have it had decided otherwise no matter how it had all begun it looked as if it might well have a bloody ending before another dawn bolitho licked his lips and felt sand grate between his teeth waiting for darkness had been a test for everyone in his party scorched by the sun stung and pestered by flies and crawling insects it had been torture he saw the splash of oars in the gloom and knew a boat was heading for the beach all through the afternoon and evening while they had tried to find shelter amongst the scrub and eke out their rations of water and biscuit bolitho had watched the occasional comings and goings between ship and shore the boat had made several trips but never fully manned it seemed likely there was a constant picket or lookout on the headland and few hands could be spared for manning the boat but the timing was haphazard and it was impossible to gauge any sort of routine one thing was certain once it had begun to grow dark the boat was always challenged aboard the anchored ship there had been hardly any sign of movement but what there had had struck dismay and anger into the watching sailors a woman had been seen on deck in midafternoon her dark hair hanging over bare shoulders her screams shrill across the heaving water as she was chased and finally dragged to one of the hatchways later a body that of a man had been carried to the bulwark and hurled into the sea it floated away from the hull and made no effort to swim so it seemed there was another murder to their account the boat grounded violently in the surf and the men struggled with oars and then a small anchor to kedge it on to hard sand from the din they were making and the attendant clink of bottles it was obvious they were all drunk or nearly so one slumped down on the beach his shoulders against the dripping boat while his companions trudged away towards the headland bolitho touched keens arm it was now or never the men might be back for more drink or to change places with their comrades aboard eurotas within the hour he said tell sergeant quare to begin he looked at the sky there was cloud about but not enough to hide the moon the wind was fresh and with the hiss of surf and the distant boom of waves over the reef they might be able to get near the ship unheard bolitho strained his eyes into the darkness but the shadows played tricks with his vision he heard the seamen breathing and shifting along the cleft in the hillside and guessed they were imagining what was happening blissett creeping towards the boat smothered in sand which they had plastered on his body with the aid of their precious water only the unending line of writhing surf separated land from sea against it the grounded longboat lay like a dead whale bolitho stared towards the ship there were no anchor lights but he could see a faint glow through some of the open ports and knew they were where the remaining guns were stationed loaded with grape they would make short work of any clumsy attack but there were no boarding nets once alongside the odds might alter he stiffened as he heard something like a dry cough then quare said hoarsely all done sir he sounded pleased bolitho drew his sword and rose to his feet at two hundred yards plus the distance down the final slope they would be invisible he started to walk towards the beach his shoes scraping noisily on loose stones while the seamen emerged in a ragged line behind him most of them hunched forward as if expecting to meet a volley of shots this was the worst part so far as he walked bolitho tried not to think of the muskets and pistols now all loaded and primed the rasp of steel from axe to cutlass he turned with surprise as he heard a man humming quietly as he strode behind him it was the american jenner walking in his familiar loose gait his hair flopping over his eyes he saw bolitho turn and nodded companionably fine night for it sir beyond him was the negro orlando a boarding axe over his powerful shoulder like a childs toy what they were doing here the cause they represented were of no value now they were going to fight and if possible stay alive all at once bolitho was standing beside the boat while the seamen gathered into tight groups as they had been ordered the marine blissett took his musket from quare and looked at bolitho i left him sir he touched the spreadeagled corpse with his foot hes not carrying anything but his weapons he could be anyone bolitho looked at the dead man around his head and shoulders the sand looked black where his blood had soaked away he forced himself to kneel beside him to examine him for some sort of clue the moon swept momentarily between the clouds so that the mans eyes came alight in the glow as if to rebuke him his clothes were poor and ragged but his belt pistol and cutlass were in perfect condition bolitho touched his wrist and arm the skin was warm but quite still there was no wasting no loose flesh this man was a sailor he stood up slowly had been a sailor keen whispered ive got my party around the boat he sounded out of breath excited or frightened it was hard to tell ease her into the water bolitho stood back to look at the ship while two groups of men began to slide the boat through the lively surf there had been five in the boat before and never more than six he watched as the selected seamen clambered into the hull thrusting out the oars and muffling them in the rowlocks with food sacks and pieces of clothing he saw miller rip off the dead mans shirt and pass it into the boat one foot planted on the corpse to steady himself as he did so miller probably more than any other here was in his element he had come through the war and had survived cuttingout expeditions cannon fire and every other sort of risk without a scratch as a boatswains mate he was above average but in a hand to hand fight he was something else again a killer allday said ill take the helm he looked at bolitho ready captain he spoke so casually he might have been suggesting a stroll bolitho knew him so well that he could see past the calm voice like himself allday was stretched like a halter only when they were finally committed would he show his true self the boat lifted and splashed in the shallows the men on either side easing it into deeper water as more of the boarding party clambered into her and flattened themselves on the bottom boards like corpses enough bolitho looked for quare and midshipman swift keep the rest of the men out of sight if you can if any more pirates come from the headland you know what to do he nodded to the sergeant the work of the marines was over and if things went wrong quare and his little group would have to hide and wait for herrick to come for them he climbed into the boat very carefully his sword bared against his chest shove off allday crouched forward easy you noisy bugger the clouds had thickened even in the time taken to get this far it might mean a tropical downpour but not for some while bolitho drove the doubts aside if he waited for rain to deaden his approach he might wait forever he looked at the panting oarsmen they had pulled only a few yards and were already finding it hard work with so many inert passengers if he stopped the attack now he doubted if he could rouse them to fight again keen whispered shall i tell the swimmers to leave now sir bolitho nodded and saw two figures their naked bodies shining in the filtered moonlight rise up and then slide over the gunwale with barely a ripple it had all sounded so dangerous and difficult when they had discussed it on the island now it seemed impossible he tore his eyes from the two swimmers and concentrated on the ship how large and near she looked now surely somebody would challenge them soon maybe they had already been seen for what they were and the loaded guns were being quietly depressed towards them bolitho heard one of the oarsmen curse and then gasp as something rolled between the boat and the dipping blades it was a corpse turning over loosely as a man will do in bed the one they had seen cast overboard caught and carried by the current unable to free itself from the bay easy on the stroke allday bolitho felt the pistol in his belt they must give the swimmers time to reach the anchor cable and haul themselves aboard without discovery it was all too easy but then why not the pirates or whoever they were had bluffed their way past a british manofwar and had sent away a boarding officer convinced of their identity at anchor in a safe bay with sentries posted ashore why should they not feel secure the challenge when it came was loud and startling boat ahoy an english voice allday dragged two empty bottles from between his feet and hurled them into the bottom of the boat throwing back his head and roaring with laughter as he did so bolitho heard other voices from the ship but no further challenge the empty bottles were more convincing than any password i saw one of the men on the beakhead sir it was miller straining his head above the gunwale theyre aboard by god the boat was very near the side now and bolitho saw the entry port two dark figures watching their slow approach he could even smell the ship the familiar tang of tar and hemp one of the men by the port swung towards the forecastle as a figure appeared in a shaft of moonlight swaying from side to side and snatching at rigging for support allday hissed thats haggard captain a better actor than topman by the looks of him but the seaman called haggard had the full attention of the watch on deck as with sudden dignity he reeled and fell over the side with a violent splash two things happened almost at once the watch left the entry port and disappeared towards the bows imagining that one of their own had fallen over the side and then out of the darkness came a terrible thrashing sound like something being hauled through water at a great speed they all heard haggard yell my legthen he screamed the sound cut short as he was dragged bodily under the surface bolithos mind accepted all these things even as he dashed towards the bows of the boat and a grapnel soared up and over the eurotass bulwark he had not thought about sharks had never imagined they would enter the bay the drifting corpse must have attracted one and haggard had been seized and crushed to bloody pulp in those great jaws he heard himself yell up lads lets be at them the spell snapped and the horrified seamen were all at once on their feet fighting like wild things to reach the steps to the entry port a pistol exploded from the gangway and a ball sang past bolithos face as he hauled himself on to the deck the two men on watch were caught in the pale light one looking at bolitho the other still gaping towards the forecastle as if expecting to hear another scream seamen surged on to the deck knocking each other aside in their eagerness to reach the two men cutlasses swished in the air and the men fell with barely a sound from the poop came more shouts and it sounded as if others were clambering through the forward hatch towards the forecastle but keen and his men were already dashing along the gangways firing into the hatch and towards the starboard cathead where a man had been clinging to get a view of the shark or to hide bolitho ran wildly towards the poop almost falling as a figure loomed from behind a companionway and barred his path he ducked aside and cut out with his sword feeling it jar against steel as the man met his attack hilts locked they lurched towards the wheel while seamen charged past and others paused feverishly trying to reload their weapons in the far distance bolitho heard the crackle of musket fire and knew quare was dealing with the sentries from the headland he could feel nothing but cold hatred for the unknown man who was pressed against him it was like being somewhere else an onlooker the mans breath strong with brandy the heat of his body were all part of the unreality bolitho felt the heavy thrust of the mans forearm he stepped back catching him off balance and swinging him round against the bulwark something flashed past his eyes and he heard the sickening crunch of steel in bone as allday sent the man pitching down a ladder allday spun round again reaching out with the cutlass as a dark figure ran from the poop saw him and hesitated just too long allday his legs carrying him across the deck like a charging bull hacked the man across one shoulder and as he fell shrieking finished him with a heavy blow on the neck another was on his knees babbling and pleading in a language which might have been almost anything although the meaning was clear enough miller seized him by the hair and then drove one knee into his face before lifting him bodily and pitching him over the rail the attendant thrashing and bursting spray alongside showed there were other sharks hurrying to an unexpected prize light flowed from a door below the poop and bolitho saw a man framed in it crouching as he peered blindly towards the din of steel and yelling seamen bolitho dragged out his pistol and squeezed the trigger nothing happened so he hurled it at the door and ran straight for it the speed of his charge almost dragging the sword from his grip as he plunged it into the mans body he half turned hearing cries and more shots seemingly from the water itself someone was getting away in a boat but he could leave that to keen he kicked the door aside thrusting the dying man off the coaming and then leapt into eurotass poop it was like a scene from bedlam cabin doors hung open or were smashed down clothing weapons and all manner of personal belongings were strewn everywhere on the deck above he heard a voice shrill with terror and then millers loud and menacing stand still you little bastard the sound ended with a body slithering across the poop deck and one final gasp bolitho stepped slowly aft his sword across his body his feet stepping carefully so as not to trip in the scattered and looted confusion easy capn he recognized jenners drawl next cabin he ducked past bolitho his shadow swaying across the screen doors with two more seamen close on his heels his face lit up as a pistol exploded from the cabin and the man nearest him fell clutching his stomach blood already gushing from his mouth jenner drew back his arm and a small dirk flew through the door like a flash of lightning when bolitho reached the door jenner was tugging the blade from the victims chest wiping it carefully on the mans leg more feet clattered along the maindeck and keen burst into the poop a curved hanger in one hand an empty pistol like a club in the other weve taken the forecastle and the rest of the upper deck sir he was breathing very fast and his eyes were shining in the lanternlight with the desperate wildness of battle he added some got away in a boat but i think the sharpshooters are trying to mark them down he looked at the corpse we managed to seize two prisoners bolitho said tightly open the after hatch but be ready for tricks tell mr ross to take over the upper deck someone might try to cut the cable he walked past the last of the cabins to the large one in the stern again the disorder of clothing and sea chests a meal halfeaten on the masters table a womans dress too with blood on it it was suddenly very quiet as if the whole ship was listening stricken with terror come he strode out of the cabin allday behind him his head turning from side to side as if to protect bolitho from attack when the hatch was opened and not without difficulty as it was wedged tight with bars and chains as if in a slave ship bolitho was sickened by the stench of bodies and fear which rose to meet him and his men still no sound at all just the regular creak of spars and rigging perhaps they had killed everyone aboard allday whispered if anyones down there captain they must think hell itself has boarded the ship bolitho stared at him why hadnt he thought of that the horror they must have endured the sheer terror of the past weeks and then the deafening onslaught of tempests seamen no wonder there was no sound he stood on the edge of the hatch ignoring alldays sudden anxiety and the fact he was probably framed against the moonlight stand fast below he waited hearing his voice echo around the deck you are in the hands of his britannic majestys ship tempest for a moment longer he imagined his worst fears were realized and then as if out of the bowels of the ship he heard a mounting combined chorus of cries and sobs down quickly lads bolitho waited as more seamen dashed to the hatch with lanterns and then stumbled with them to the deck below here there was another hatch beside which stood a chair from the officers quarters a tankard near it to mark where a guard had been sitting at the moment of attack they withdrew more heavy bars and lifted the hatch it was a small hold one which had been used for cabin stores without light or much ventilation it was packed from side to side and bulkhead to bulkhead with people it was like looking down at a solid carpet of upturned terrified faces men and women dirty dishevelled and at the last stage of survival bolitho kept his tone as level as he could have no fear my people will take care of you he thought about his small boarding party he did not yet know how many of them had died or were wounded if this crowd chose to attack them they would stand little chance weapons or no weapons there must be close on two hundred souls down there miller strode to the hatch he seemed calm again his voice crisp as he gestured for some hands to enter the hold but from the side of his mouth he said quietly mr ross as three swivels loaded with canister and trained inboard sir if they start to show their metal hell sweep the deck afore they knows whats it em so he was not fully recovered from the killing it was terrible to watch as the people began to emerge from the packed hold some held on to each other from weakness and from fear for whatever bolithos voice may have implied he knew he and his men did not look like part of the kings navy one man cut above the eyes and his face so bruised it was almost black was wearing the jacket of a sailor bolitho asked who are you the man stared at him blankly until allday took his arm and guided him away from the slowmoving procession then he said archer sir ships cooper bolitho said quietly the passengers where are they passengers it was an effort even to think ii think theym still on the orlop deck sir he gestured about him most of these are being deported he almost fell we bin down there for days he stared around water i must have water bolitho snapped broach every cask you can find miller sort them out you know what to do tell mr ross to send a boat for sergeant quares party at once he sheathed his sword his mind rebelling against the necessary details to allday he added orlop lively now another hatch another ladder and down below the waterline even in a ship of eurotass tonnage and girth there was no room to stand upright between deck beams lanterns swayed to greet them as more seamen entered the orlop deck by another hatch further forward tiny cabins like hutches lined the sides of the hull much like those in a manofwar where the ships professionals lived and slept always cut off from natural daylight sailmakers and coopers like the man archer carpenters and quartermasters open the doors he heard a woman weeping hysterically and a man further down the line of cabins pleading with her to be brave allday snapped here captain bolitho strode to the door while allday held a lantern for him she was sitting on an upturned chest her arm around a girl with long black hair probably the one they had seen chased around the upper deck the girl was moaning her face hidden against viola raymonds shoulder her fingers digging into the creamcoloured gown like small frantic claws bolitho could barely speak at his back he could hear the confused cries and sobs of people being reunited and others looking for friends and relatives without success but it was all part of something else viola stood up slowly taking the girl with her she said softly go with him she tightened her grasp as the terror shook the girls body he is a good man and will do you no harm the girl moved from her one hand still held out as if she was being cut adrift bolitho thought allday had left the lantern and closed the door behind them bolitho reached out and held her shoulders feeling her reserve crumbling as she threw her arms round his neck and buried her mouth against his cheek you came she gripped him even tighter oh my darling richard you came back for us he said ill take you aft no not there she looked up at him and he could sense her disbelief take me on deck they made their way through the jostling crowds of men and women seamen and the newly arrived marines until they reached the high poop then she stood facing the wind repeatedly pushing her fingers up and through her hair and taking long breaths as if each was to be her last bolitho could only watch her afraid for her wanting to help he made himself ask your husband is he safe she nodded slowly and then turned towards him but where is your ship he replied it was too great a risk they would have killed everyone by the time tempest worked into the bay she walked across the deck her gown swishing on the worn planking she did not speak but kept her eyes on him until their bodies touched then and only then did she break down sobbing into his chest oblivious to the ship and everyone around her keen paused with one foot on top of the poop ladder his mouth set to frame a dozen questions for his captain seeing them together he changed his mind and returned to the maindeck his voice suddenly firm after the madness he had seen and shared lay aft mr ross mr swift tend to the wounded and then report to me allday watched him remembering him as the young midshipman he had once saved from an agonizing death now he was a man a kings officer then he turned and glanced towards the poop well he should be a good one he thought he had the best there was as his example revenge bolitho put down the pen and stretched his arms it was early evening too soon for a lantern but not bright enough for any more writing he glanced around eurotass big cabin picturing it as it had been when he had burst through the door now with the deck cleared of looted boxes and clothing it looked almost normal he stood up and walked to the tall windows away on the starboard quarter leaning to a fresh breeze his own ship tempest made a perfect sight her topsails and topgallants pale pink in the sunlight her stem throwing up spray as she ploughed indifferently across each rank of rollers herrick was holding tempest well up to windward just in case there should be another attack if anyone was foolhardy enough to make such an attempt he would bring the frigate dashing down at full speed presenting the other face bolitho had seen just three days back as he had taken eurotas carefully from her anchorage in the bay tempest had tacked around the headland exactly as he and herrick had originally planned it was the first time bolitho had seen his own ship cleared for action from outboard she had looked more than hostile with her guns run out like black teeth her big courses brailed up to the yards to reveal the crouching marines in the tops and against the hammock nettings muskets already trained on the slowmoving merchantman as herrick had explained later when he had come aboard he was taking no chances even eurotass flag hastily run up to the peak and swifts signals from the deck had not convinced him his best gun captains had dropped two twelvepound balls almost alongside even as tempest had made the signal to heave to and receive boarders while he had listened to bolithos story and had seen the chaos and disorder for himself herrick had reacted much as bolitho had expected his relief at finding bolitho alive and the attack completed successfully had given way to reproach you should have waited for us sir anything might have happened you could have been killed or taken by those scum even when bolitho had explained how the american jenner had discovered one of the pirates hiding in a magazine with a lighted slowmatch and had forced a confession from him that his orders were to blow up the ship and everyone aboard herrick remained stubbornly critical bolitho smiled grimly recalling herricks attempts to maintain his sternness it never lasted for long in the three days it had taken to stand clear of the islands and head towards sydney again he had done a great deal of thinking also he had examined the evidence and made out a report for the governor and for commodore sayer the attack had broken out within the ship after fire had been reported in a forward hold in the ensuing confusion which had been hardly surprising in a vessel filled with civilians and deported prisoners the poop had been rushed and seized by some of the passengers who had boarded eurotas at santa cruz where she had put in for fruit and wine for the long voyage around the horn eurotass comings and goings must have been watched and checked for many months by the time the crew had discovered the fire to be nothing more than oiled rags in a large iron pot the ship was in new hands some of the prisoners had been brought on deck and had immediately gone over to the attackers some had tried to protect their wives and had been instantly killed captain lloyd had been ordered at pistolpoint to change tack and head towards the islands that had apparently been a bad moment for the pirates as they had been sighted and had received recognition signals from a mail packet en route to sydney once within sight of the islands all hopes of retaking the vessel or putting up any sort of resistance were dashed a large heavily armed schooner had escorted them to the bay and had sent aboard two boatloads of men as one of the loyal seamen had exclaimed the most terrible villains you ever seed sir it had been then that the real horror had begun looting and drunkenness had been the order of the day while some of the pirates had directed the unloading of cargo and weapons money and stores using the dazed and frightened prisoners like slaves others had gone on a wild rampage through the ship several people had been beaten or hacked to death women and young girls raped time and time again in a frenzy of brutal cruelty captain lloyd no doubt dismayed that his own lack of vigilance had allowed it all to come about had made a final attempt to overcome his guards and rally the loyal men to his aid it had been in vain and the next day there had been no sign of lloyd or his mates or indeed most of his senior men bolitho found himself moving round the cabin recalling violas eyes as she had described the nightmare every hour was filled with despair and terror the pirates came and went abusing men and women like beasts sometimes fighting with each other in a daze of brandy and rum although battened down on the orlop she was convinced there was also another ship in the bay for part of the time she had heard the guns being moved from the eurotas and into a ship alongside it sounded as if the vessel was lower than eurotas perhaps the same size as the schooner she had been imprisoned in the little cabin on the orlop for much of the time sharing it with a young girl who had been deported for theft every day the girl had been dragged screaming from the cabin while the pirates had left viola in no doubt that the fate reserved for her was to be the worst only once had she broken down as she had described the sacking of the eurotas it had been when she had recalled her feelings as tempest appeared in the bay eurotas had been harried and attacked by hostile natives and she had heard it was because the schooner had raided one of the islands and had left more carnage behind them there viola had said quietly i knew you had come richard i have been following your career watching for fresh appointments in the gazette when i saw young valentine keen appear over the side i knew it was your ship she also described how the leader of the pirates left to guard the eurotas had threatened them all with instant death by firing the magazine if one made the slightest attempt to warn the boarding party i could not just stand there richard that brute had paraded a handful of passengers to make it appear normal he and some of the others had donned company uniforms there had been so much killing so many terrible things she had raised her chin the brightness in her eyes making her sudden defiance fragile had it been any other ship but yours richard i could have done nothing but the watch i knew you would remember it was a terrible risk she had smiled then well worth it bolitho looked around the cabin she had been brought here to meet the real leader of the pirates her description had been a good one a giant of a man with a beard halfway down his chest his name was tuke and he was english or so it seemed viola had said a man with neither mercy nor any sort of scruple his language was as foul as himself he goaded me raped me with his words he was enjoying my helplessness my complete dependence on him whether i lived or died but for my husbands importance and his usefulness as hostage i think i would have quickly followed the fate of the others bolitho found he was pacing more urgently his stomach muscles contracting as if he were already in closecombat with the pirate called tuke now the schooner and her consort if there was one were somewhere in hiding gloating over their loot and the women they had taken with the first load an island or islands not too far from here he thought the chart told him nothing and the two pirates taken alive little more they were typical of their calling brutalized by murder and hard living their leaders might grow rich on their spoils but men such as these lived hand to mouth like the savages they were even threats had left them untouched they would die on a gibbet anyway there would be no torture and their fear of tuke was greater even in the hangmans shadow than of anything their captors could offer including the luckless swimmer haggard who had been killed by a shark bolitho had lost three men considering the darkness the unfamiliarity of the ship it was a miracle even the wounded looked as if they would recover within a few weeks the risk had been justified vital the outer door of the cabin opened and james raymond walked aft through the screen he was freshly changed into a clean shirt and neat green coat and displayed little sign of his ordeal for several seconds he stood looking at bolitho his features giving nothing away he was about the same age as bolitho but his face once handsome had become marred with a permanent frown petulance disapproval it was all there he acted as if he owned the ship had been behaving like the one dependable man aboard since bolitho had seen him released from another tiny cabin he had not met him for five long years all the while he had imagined that raymonds path to better things had been furthered by his work in the indies by his treachery to the governor he had been sent to advise now it seemed different while bolitho had fretted at being kept at sea far from the scenes of greater happenings raymond had been sliding towards ignominy this appointment he had been sent to occupy sounded even lower than the one held five years ago it was impossible to read his reactions on the matter from what he said raymond remarked coolly still writing your reports eh captain aye sir bolitho regarded him evenly trying to conceal the anger he felt for him theres more to this than i first imagined really raymond walked to the windows and stared towards the frigate this man tuke bolitho checked himself once before he had shared too much of his confidence with raymond he said from this ship alone he has equipped himself royally hmm raymond turned his face in shadow it is a pity you could not have taken him and his damned hirelings it is bolitho watched him the way his hands opened and closed at his sides he was less calm than he pretended he wondered what would happen when they reached port what story raymond would tell from what he had already gathered raymond had been pleading for his life when tukes men had seized the eurotas it was to be hoped raymond had not bartered secrets for personal safety the great south sea was attracting the flags of a dozen countries always the search for more trade further influence and territory perhaps the authorities in sydney knew more than they said bolitho hoped so for with only tempest and the elderly hebrus to represent the kings authority any additional threat in these vast waters did not bear consideration raymond complained i have lost a great deal of money those damned rogues he faltered caught off guard by his own disclosure ill see them all hanged the door opened and viola raymond stood with one hand steadying herself against the screen as the deck tilted heavily bolitho watched her the stiff way she held her shoulder again he felt the rage churning inside him tuke had pressed the heated tip of a knife against her bare skin his mark it must have been agony she said who will you see hanged james she did not hide her contempt i do not see you as a man of action raymond replied harshly that is enough your stupidity might have cost us our lives but for you but for her quick thinking most of the prisoners and loyal men would have been burned alive in this ship bolitho faced him maybe you would have been spared i cannot tell but the deaths of so many set against money and personal trappings seems too great for my reasoning he looked away feeling raymonds hatred and violas compassion i lost some good men too did you think to ask about them to know if a young seaman called haggard who was seized by a shark has a family or a widow in england he shrugged i suppose i should be used to such indifference but it still snares my throat raymond said hoarsely one day captain bolitho ill make you regret your insolence i am not blind nor am i a fool she asked are you going on deck captain she glanced at her husband i have endured enough for one day they walked between the other cabins and bolitho heard raymond slam a door with such force it sounded as if it would tear from its hinges he paused in the shadow one hand on her wrist three days i cant stand seeing you with him perhaps i should have returned to my ship and put a lieutenant in command it will be three weeks before we make a landfall he felt her skin in his touch soft and warm she was looking at him her eyes very steady and i have been waiting and hoping for five years we were wrong we should have dared have broken with convention she raised her hand to his face i have never forgotten her teeth showed white in the gloom even the special smell you have of ships and salt id have thrown myself to the sharks which killed your poor sailor rather than submit to that monster tuke bolitho heard the chime of a bell the attendant slap of bare feet as the watch changed someone ross or keen might come aft at any moment he said take care viola you have made a bad enemy in your husband she shrugged he has made himself that he did not even lift a finger to protect me allday clattered down a companion ladder and shot them a brief glance she asked calmly what do you see allday she smiled at him more things to worry you allday scratched his head viola raymond was part of a world he had never shared and rarely trusted squalls maam i see plenty o them but ive no doubt well manage bolitho watched him go you have him at a loss for words that is rare indeed they walked forward past the big double wheel and out on to the broad deck the air tasted fresh after the cabin and from the set of the topsails bolitho guessed they were making fair headway he wondered if herrick was watching them through his glass worrying like allday at what might happen she slipped her hand through his arm and said lightly the deck is very unsteady is it not then she looked up at him her eyes challenging pleading in a quieter tone she said three weeks you say he felt her fingers digging into his arm she continued after so long i could not bear it keen stood with ross at the lee side and watched discreetly the masters mate asked what dyou make of it mr keen the capn seems to weather as many risks here as he does in battle he chuckled man hes fair taken wi th lass theres no doubt to it keen cleared his throat yes yes im sure the big scot stared at him mr keen sir youre blushing he strode away enjoying his discovery and leaving the lieutenant with his confusion midshipman swift hovered nearby and asked is there anything i can do sir keen glared yes attend to your duties damn you the two figures by the weather rail heard none of this the savagery of hand to hand fighting and what had gone before was momentarily lost against the darkening blue sea and the future still lay out of reach and without form perhaps it had all been quite hopeless from the beginning and yet bolitho felt restored commodore james sayer moved wearily to avoid the bright sunlight from the stern windows as his flagship swung heavily to her cable he had just returned from the governors residence and was still wearing his dress coat beneath his shirt his skin felt cold and clammy even after the pull across the anchorage in his barge so great was the contrast in his cabin through the quarter windows he could just see the frigate tempest her outline bending through the thick glass as if she was in a haze she had anchored at first light that morning and captain bolitho had come aboard the flagship in response to sayers signal and had delivered his written report as well as a verbal account of the eurotass plundering and murder the important passenger james raymond had not visited the flagship but had gone straight to government house sayer breathed out slowly as he recalled his own reception there usually he got on quite well with the governor allowing for the usual span between government and the navy this time he was surprised to find him fuming with rage if things werent bad enough sayer weve now got that animal tuke on our hands he stripped the eurotas and god knows what use hell make of her artillery im sending the brig quail to england with my despatches immediately i must have more support here i cant be expected to take incoming prisoners build their accommodation tend to their security and keep our trade routes patrolled commodore sayer had never met raymond and he had not known what to expect he had heard that he had been promoted from being a government adviser to the east india company to his present post out here as far as sayer was concerned being posted to the great south sea could never be seen as promotion punishment more like but tuke he did know mathias tuke like many of his trade had begun life at sea in an english privateer it had seemed the natural thing to take the next step and act merely for himself against any flag and with every means at his disposal he had missed hanging by inches many times and all the while his influence and the stories of his horrific deeds had spread across two oceans he had sailed these waters before and had then set up a base near more prosperous routes in the caribbean and the spanish harbours of the americas cruel ruthless feared even by his own sort tuke had given many an admiral a headache wondering where he would strike next and now he was here sayer had said i have a full report of the happenings in eurotas sir but for captain bolithos prompt action with no little risk to himself and his landing party i fear we would have lost everything and all the people aboard the vessel slaughtered in a most callous manner quite the governor had fiddled with papers on his great desk i am furious with eurotass master for acting so stupidly taking extra passengers at santa cruz with so many convicts and too few guards on board he had thrown up his hands in despair well he has paid for it poor devil sayer had said nothing he had known for some while that most of the captains of merchantmen on government warrants had added to their payment by taking extra passengers like deck cargo they paid handsomely and many a sea captain retired rich but not captain lloyd of the eurotas it puts me in the very devil of a position the governor had moved around the room despite the sullen heat mr raymond has important work to do in the levu islands it is all arranged now with eurotas virtually disarmed and in need of competent officers and replacement crew i dare not allow him to proceed there without escort sayer had still remained silent the levu group adjacent to the friendly islands where tuke had run eurotas to ground had been under discussion for many months and almost as long as the colony in new south wales had been founded the local chiefs were friendly and open to barter they hated each other but that was safer there was a good anchorage on the main island with fresh water and plenty of timber the group or parts of it had been claimed and reclaimed over and over again by any ships captain who chose to anchor there in search of water and food and hoist his countrys flag but now with a bad situation brewing once again between britain and his most catholic majesty of spain the island group represented more than a mere extension of trade and local influence with sydney and the rest of the great colony growing and spreading by the month the newly opened trade and supply routes and the flanks of the colony itself had to be protected the levu islands would easily act as a base for menofwar to patrol the routes from the south americas and cape horn he could not picture raymond there at all in any capacity he looked too spoiled by comfortable living there was a hardness to him also but it seemed to come from the heart and not the body raymond had said yes i must have an escort he had looked at sayer you command the squadron here it had sounded like an accusation one which sayer was used to but resented surely you can manage that i have a few schooners some armed cutters and the brig quail he had gestured towards the window now i have tempest thank god and a captain with the experience and dash to make good use of her sayer had seen the quick exchange of glances they had been discussing bolitho strange there should be an atmosphere of unease fear perhaps that bolithos commodore might say something not meant for his ears then the governor had said you will send tempest i am drafting orders for her now i have also instructed that eurotas be restored with whatever supplies we have available the guns and the money are another matter he had added bitterly raymond had excused himself and had gone to another part of the residence where he and his wife were being quartered sayer would have expected raymond to show some sign of gratitude for being alive compassion for those less fortunate it was as if the whole incident had been shut from his mind but once alone with the governor sayer had received his second surprise i can assure you sayer that but for bolithos recovery of the ship his obvious bravery and his successful rescue of many of the people i would order you to arrange his his court martial sayer had been astounded i must protest sir i know his record he is a fine officer in every sense as was his father and his brother the governor had watched him coldly mr raymond tells me that bolithos brother was a traitor during the war a bloody renegade he had held up one hand that was unfair of me sayer but i amfeeling unfair i am overworked beset with strife in the colony and the incompetence of my administrators now this james raymond an important man from london who has the prime ministers ear the kings too in all probability is accusing bolitho of having a liaison with his wife so that was it something like a bell had tinkled in sayers mind four or five years back bolitho had commanded the frigate undine and had given support to another newly founded possession in borneo that was it the governor appointed to that godforsaken place had been a retired admiral there had been talk of an attachment between the wife of a government official and the young frigate captain the governor had said crisply i see from your face sayer that you have already heard something of it no sir a long time ago just rumours maybe but some damned fate has drawn them all together out here but it is not the same as before bolitho is still a frigate captain but raymond has grown in influence if not in charity try to see it from my point of view i cannot afford more trouble i will send word to london with my despatches and ask that tempest be replaced i am not such a tyrant that i would suggest the removal of her captain the governor had more or less admitted that he had not liked raymond it was just as well sayer had decided now as he stood in his own cabin again sayer was uncertain how to face bolitho when he came aboard he was a fine officer better still he was a good man but sayer had his own responsibility it was the chain of command again his captain peered into the cabin tempests gig approaching sir very well receive captain bolitho and show him aft he turned towards the windows again mrs raymond was a very beautiful woman or so he had heard he supposed she had taken passage here merely to keep her husband company she would hardly fit into the sydney society he thought officials officers of the corps their wives and their women sayer had seen more social gatherings in cornwall than he had out here not quite the thing for a lady of breeding he heard the stamp of feet the trill of the boatswains calls as the side party paid its respects to a visiting captain he turned and faced the door bracing himself without knowing why when bolitho entered he looked as he had that morning in his dress coat with his goldlaced hat tucked under one arm he was sayer thought enough to win any ladys heart he was very tanned and his black hair with the rebellious lock above one eye gleamed in the filtered sunlight like a ravens wing he looked at ease and with none of the strain sayer had seen when he had first sailed into sydney harbour sit down richard sayer looked at him awkwardly ive just come from the governor been with him for hours im about dead with weariness im sorry sir but i hope the visit was worthwhile worthwhile the commodore looked at him grimly i thought he was going to have a fit he wrenched open a hanging wine cooler and took out a bottle and some glasses god damn it richard is it true about you and raymonds lady he swung round wine slopping unnoticed over his shoes because if it is you are pleading for trouble bolitho took the proffered glass giving himself time it was to be expected after what had happened it had to be so why was it a surprise he replied i do not know what you were told sir oh for christs sake richard dont play with words were both sailors we know how these things happen god with your attack and rescue id think every woman in sydney would give herself to you tonight bolitho put down his glass viola raymond is not a whore sir i met her five years back then i thought it was over when in fact it had only begun she is married to the wrong man he is vain arrogant and dangerous he could almost listen to the level tone of his voice again like a bystander i have no regrets other than the regret for the lost years when she returns to england she will leave her london residence and await my return he looked up his voice quiet i am deeply in love with her sayer eyed him gravely he was shocked by the disclosure but touched by bolithos sincerity and his willingness to share his hopes with him he said the governor is sending his despatches to england tonight in the quail in them will be a request for tempests transfer to home waters what you have wanted if for other reasons but it will take months before those despatches are delivered and replied to by then anything may have happened i know sir and thank you for telling me sayer had shown his concern by disclosing the governors plans bolitho could now if he so wished put his own report and letters aboard the same brig if he lacked influence he had plenty of friends he was moved that sayer had laid himself open for his sake sayer said heavily i know little of james raymond but what i have seen i regard as unfriendly we are both firmly set on our course sir bolitho could see her eyes in his mind feel her skin the touch of her long autumn hair she will wait for my return to england she is not going to england richard sayer felt sickened by his own words she is to go with raymond to his new appointment in the levu group he stood up quietly believe me she has no choice the governor is bound to offer his assistance and support to raymond and no amount of pleading or finance on your part can put her aboard the quail for england bolitho stared at him then she will remain in sydney until would you have that sayer looked away how they would delight in sneering at her scandal is news here rumour the pathway to jealous and petty minds bolitho could not believe it and yet he knew it was exactly what raymond would do if he could not break them apart he would ensure that she was trapped he said but the great south sea sir how long can a woman survive in the islands it is bad enough here but the conditions are like a palace compared with the primitive islands she has been through all this before no man no real man would ask it of anyone let alone her i know sayer looked at him sadly but raymond is under stress to make this work successful there will be some convict labour too a showing of occupation which should inspire confidence until proper arrangements have been made bolitho leaned back in the chair his eyes seeing nothing that third night aboard eurotas he had gone to her in the great cabin she had shared it only with the girl she had taken under her protection the wretched girl barely spoke and was still shocked and terrified whenever a man went near her for viola she would do anything raymond had been given a separate cabin just as before when they had sailed in bolithos ship but this time there had been a difference desperation desire and an overwhelming relief at finding each other again had broken down all barriers of caution he could hear her voice as if she were here and not sayer we are in a ghostship darling richard we are alone i want you so badly that i am ashamed need you so much that you may be ashamed of me he came out of his despair as sayer said you will be under orders to escort eurotas to the levu group he watched the pain in bolithos eyes imagined how he would feel under similar circumstances forced to watch the woman he loved and be unable to reach her the governor has no other forces at his disposal and tuke may be intent on another attack bolitho said quietly i will kill him sayer looked away who did he mean tuke or raymond when he spoke again bolitho sounded calm too calm how long do we have sir a few days with the seasonal storms becoming more frequent and the delay caused by all this things have become more urgent he tried to sound matter of fact one thing richard you are not to see her in sydney he saw him start and as a favour to me id like you to remain aboard until you weigh except on matters pertaining to duty and the ships affairs bolitho stood up i understand good i have too much respect for you to give you a lecture but time passes old pains are forgotten you are going to need all your wits tuke is a vicious pirate and no hero as some legends would have him i believe he is here to sell his special services to someone which is why he is arming and storing his vessels at our cost maybe he seeks respectability under a letter of marque to become a mercenary instead of a hunted pirate it is common enough he lowered his voice and you will have raymond watching and waiting for you to make a mistake bolitho said the french and the dons have long been interested in these waters but without much success he felt nothing could find no excitement at the prospect of a new mission a chance of running tuke to earth sayer nodded in the last despatches they speak of starvation and riots in france even in paris so the king will be too busy to cast his eyes towards us but spain he shrugged no matter what flag the devil flies i want him taken and hanged before his fire spreads one good thing though the bounty has vanished foundered i shouldnt wonder one less worry sir bolitho looked at him blankly sayer crossed the cabin and gripped his arm no matter you were leagues away but take heart think of cornwall do your work the rest will unfoul itself bolitho replied aye sir he had in fact been thinking of cornwall the big grey house in falmouth a few moments ago it had begun to come alive again in his thoughts she would like it there and they would all love her as they had his mother and the other captains ladies who had walked on the sea wall and watched for their husbands ships some in vain and now because he had lowered his guard he had betrayed the one person he really loved because of the resulting hatred and envy raymond was risking everything and would do so even if it cost violas life id like to return to my ship sir sayer watched him yes ill send word if i hear anything theyre gathering some hands for the eurotas and you will have to supply an officer to take charge of her he added firmly an officer richard you must remain in your own ship once established in the levu islands eurotas will act as accommodation vessel she can be safely left with someone junior until i can send more replacements but you will act as you see fit when you have made the place secure bolitho held out his hand thank you sir for doing what you must hate doing i know plenty who would have made it short and sharp sayer smiled true but mark what i said i cannot save you if you cross raymond he is the sort of man who looks for scapegoats well in advance of anything he attempts i do not wish to fit that role nor do i wish to see you as one bolitho went on deck and paid his respects to the quarterdeck and to hebruss captain a gun boomed dully in the distance and the other captain said there go your two captured pirates they dont waste time on trials out here for such carrion with the execution gun still echoing over the harbour bolitho climbed down to the gig where allday stood to receive him his face expectant to the jetty captain bolitho looked past him towards the slowmoving crowd of people who had gone to see two men kicking out their lives on a gibbet she was there somewhere no allday to the ship allday barked shove off out oars something had gone badly wrong give way all he shaded his eyes to look across at the anchored transport recalling the screams and frenzy of hand to hand fighting and killing what did these poxy dolts know of such things he looked down at bolithos shoulders the way he was gripping the hilt of that old tarnished sword once allday had been thankful to see viola raymond parted from bolitho he had known what might happen as it was happening now but as in a fight once committed allday believed in seeing it through he would think about it slip in a good word or two when he got the chance bolitho watched the rise and fall of the oars the carefully blank faces of the pigtailed seamen they all knew some would be glad others sympathetic all would be interested in what was to happen next he heard the creak of the tiller as allday steered the boat past the stern of a dutch trading schooner him most of all he thought he could almost feel alldays mind working all of his loyalty courage and cheek could not help him this time he saw the side party mustered at tempests entry port the blue and white of the officers the scarlet of prideauxs marines stand by to receive the captain he straightened his shoulders and looked up at the ship he was sailing as escort it was not much of a bridge but it was better than nothing there was hope and his determination like alldays was stronger than ever the narval lieutenant thomas herrick sipped at a mug of scalding bitter coffee and watched bolitho making notes beside his chart a week out of port and herrick for one was glad to be at sea doing something he understood six days they had lain at anchor and it had been painful to watch bolithos efforts to hide his anxiety to contain his dismay as he looked at the anchored eurotas and the town beyond even now herrick was not sure what bolitho was really thinking to anyone who did not know him as he did he seemed his usual alert interested self he was studying the chart with care comparing his notes with those of lakey the sailing master herrick did not know much about the levu islands except that they were some two hundred miles to the north of where they had recaptured the eurotas now they were plodding along held back by the slower merchantman while tempest stayed watchfully to windward of her bolitho looked up his eyes bright dyou remember old mudge thomas aye herrick smiled mudge had been the sailing master in undine must have been the oldest man in the kings service the oldest afloat maybe he admitted to sixty and kept to that a great lump of a man but a fine master pity he didnt meet mr lakey maybe theyll have a yarn in heaven one day bolitho looked wistful he knew a lot about these waters how he rebuked me when i ordered every sail to be set but how he grumbled when we crawled like this herrick looked up as keens feet moved across the deck borlase was in charge of the eurotas it was a pity in some ways he thought borlase might say too much to raymond he was like that on the other hand he was glad to be here with bolitho if he had gone across to the merchantman instead he might have spoken too forcefully to that scum raymond he asked what dyou expect to find in the levu islands sir bolitho walked to the stern windows and stared at the sloping horizon there was mist about and the glittering sea looked as if it was boiling from some great marine cauldron a flag on a pole thomas a few hardworking servants of the country much what were used to noddall pattered into the cabin the coffee jug in his paws theres some more ere sir good bolitho thrust out his mug it makes me sweat but it is good to taste something which is neither rotten nor rancid for a change he held the mug to his lips feeling it burning down to his stomach another day the same empty sea he had taken to counting seconds whenever he went on deck to consult the compass and their estimated position seconds before he had to look towards eurotass fat hull she always seemed to remain in the exact position held in the frigates shrouds as if snared in a giant web in fact she was well down to leeward too far to examine without a glass those occasions too had to be measured rationed he heard some muffled shots and knew the marines were practising again firing their muskets from the tops at makeshift targets which sergeant quare had hurled overboard he wondered if one of the marksmen was the exgamekeeper blissett and whether or not he was remembering the man he had silently killed on the beach herrick said suddenly its no use sir i must speak my mind good bolitho turned towards him i have been expecting something so be done with it herrick put his mug very carefully on the table its all been said before but im no less concerned me i dont count ill never rise above wardroom rank and i think im glad for it having seen what command can drag out of a man but you have a family tradition sir when i saw your house in falmouth those portraits all that history i knew i was lucky to serve under you ive been at sea since i was a lad like most of us and i know the measure of a captain its not right that you should be in jeopardy because of all this bolitho smiled gravely despite his inner ache by all this i take it you mean my indiscretion my discovery that i could fall in love like other men he shook his head no thomas ill not let anyone abuse that lady just to hurt me ill see raymond in hell before that he turned away now youve made me abandon my selfcontrol herrick replied heavily at the risk of offending you further i still believe commodore sayer was right to he shrugged awkwardly to keep you occupied aboard ship perhaps bolitho sat down again and rubbed his eyes with the palms of his hands if only he looked up sharply what was that a hail from the masthead herrick was already on his feet as the call floated down again deck thar sail on the lee bow they both hurried from the cabin and collided with midshipman romney who was on his way aft sir mr keens respects and herrick brushed past him aye we know bolitho strode past the wheel feeling the sun across his shoulders as if he were naked a glance at the compass and to the trim of the sails told him all he needed eurotas was still on station her big courses filling and deflating depriving her of any beauty anything further keen looked at him not yet sir he trained his telescope nothing hmm bolitho tugged out his watch send another lookout aloft if you please he searched round for midshipman swift make a signal to eurotas sail in sight to the noreast he looked at herrick though in gods name they should have seen it themselves herrick held his peace merchantmen rarely maintained a good lookout especially when they had a naval escort but there was no point in mentioning it now he could tell bolithos anxieties were only just below the surface one spark and bolitho snapped in heavens name what are our people doing deck there it was the new lookout she be a manowar zur bolitho turned to herrick again what can she be about thomas one of ours maybe bless you thomas he clapped him on the shoulder we are the only one of ours in this whole ocean even the governor of new south wales is having to plead for ships herrick watched him fascinated the prospect of action was making bolitho react no matter what he was enduring privately herrick said and weve absolutely no idea whats happening in the world we may be at war with spain or france anybody bolitho walked aft to the wheel again and examined the compass eastnortheast and the wind still comfortably across the starboard quarter the stranger was on a converging tack but it would take hours to come up with her what would he do if the newcomer turned and fled at the sight of them he could not leave eurotas but as the hour ran out and another began the lookouts reports showed that the other vessel gave no sign of going about set the forecourse mr herrick bolitho crossed the quarterdeck and climbed into the mizzen shrouds i shall feel happier if we lie closer to our charge the hands hurried to their stations and a few minutes later the frigates big foresail filled to the wind and sent a tremor running through the shrouds and rigging like a message bolitho steadied his glass waiting for the long undulating swell to lift the other ship long enough for him to examine her then he saw the ship with surprising clarity as with a freak of nature she and tempest rose together for just a few moments he held her in the lens then mist and distance distorted the picture and he lowered himself to the deck frigate french by the cut of her he peered up at the masthead pendant be up to her in two hours if this wind holds within range of a long shot before that lakey observed quietly were not at war with france sir so i believe mr lakey but well take no chances all the same he glanced along his command picturing her wreathed in smoke and flying iron but not this time the frenchman was taking his time and making no effort to change tack enough to grapple for the windgage he added send the hands to quarters in good time and make sure we have some experienced eyes at the masthead to see if the frenchman does likewise he took the glass again and trained it on the eurotas he saw the flash of a gown as she walked across the poop one hand holding the big hat to prevent the wind taking it from her oh god he lowered the glass and she dropped into distance leaving only the ship deck there shes run up er colours a pause frenchie right enough zur even without a glass bolitho could see the tiny patch of white breaking from the other ships peak as she tacked heavily to hold the wind her yards braced round until they were all but fore and aft it was a strange feeling like many of the men aboard bolitho had rarely met a french ship other than across the muzzles of a broadside he thought of le chaumareys and was suddenly sad for him and the waste of his life captains were like kings in their own ships no matter how small but to the powers which manoeuvred and used them they were expendable pawns he made himself leave the deck and return to his cabin almost blind from staring across the shining blue water allday entered the cabin ill tell noddall to fetch your coat and hat captain he grinned those breeches patched or not will do for a frenchman bolitho nodded if the french captain was new to these waters he would want to see every other captain he could would he come to tempest or would he go to him noddall scuttled through from the sleeping cabin carrying the coat over his arm tutting to himself bolitho had just finished transforming himself into some semblance of a kings officer when he heard the pipe all hands hands to quarters and clear for action the drums rolled and he felt the hull quiver as her company rushed to obey by the time he had reached the quarterdeck it was done even to the sanding of the planking around each gun it would not be needed he was quite certain as he watched the other frigates approach but sand was plentiful and every drill gained experience for some load and run out sir no mr herrick he was equally formal he looked along the black guns and barebacked men he found he was wishing it was the pirate mathias tuke lifting and plunging across the water towards him midshipman fitzmaurice came running aft to the quarterdeck ladder and called beg pardon sir but mr jury sends his respects and says that frigate is the narval thirtysix and that he saw her in bombay bolitho smiled give my thanks to the boatswain he looked at herrick it was always the same in a ship always someone who had seen or served in another no doubt the french captain was receiving similar news about the tempest thirtysix guns the same as his own ball for ball if so ordered he watched the other ship shortening sail with professional interest a lighter sleeker hull than tempest wellweathered as if she had been at sea for a long time her sailhandling was excellent another mark of long usage bolitho shaded his eyes and looked up at the peak out here tempest sailed under the white ensign and he wondered if the french captain was looking at it remembering shes hove to keen strode across the gundeck ducking to peer over a twelvepounder and dropping a boat herrick grinned just a lieutenant sir probably wants us to put him on the course for paris but when the young lieutenant eventually clambered aboard from the longboat he seemed anything but lost he doffed his hat to the quarterdeck and then presented himself to bolitho i bring the respects of my capitaine msieu and the invitation to visit him his dark eyes moved swiftly around the manned guns the swaying line of armed marines certainly bolitho walked to the entry port and glanced down at the french longboat the seamen were neatly dressed in striped shirts and white trousers but they had no life in them they looked afraid and who is your captain the lieutenant seemed to draw himself up another inch or so he is jean michel comte de barras msieu bolitho had never heard of him very well he said to herrick quietly retain the windgage and make sure eurotas keeps proper station until i return then with a nod to the rigid side party he followed the lieutenant into the boat the oarsmen pulled steadily across the water taking and mounting each roundbacked roller with practised ease he felt the spray stinging his cheeks refreshing him a vast ocean and the ships meeting by accident on one tiny pinpoint of it a french count and an english captain from falmouth the officer snapped an order and the boats oars rose dripping in two pale lines while with a flourish the bowman hooked on to the narvals main chains it was expertly done but bolitho had the feeling it was as much from fear as from experience he grasped his sword and pulled himself up towards the entry port very aware of the eyes watching him from the deck above the narvals great cabin was in total contrast to bolithos own once aboard he had been met by her captain with barely a word and had been hurried through the formality of the guard and side party with what had seemed like discourtesy now sitting in an ornate gilded chair his eyes halfblinded by the sunlight bolitho examined his host for the first time the comte de barras was of very slight build and framed against the sloping stern windows appeared almost girlish his dress coat was slightly flared and of superb cut and bolitho wished he had not allowed allday to talk him into coming across in his seagoing breeches the only other occupant of the cabin was a youth either indian or malay who was busily arranging glasses and a beautifully carved wine cabinet on one of the two tables but the cabin was quite breathtaking tempests builders had used all their skills in carving and shaping her captains quarters with the finest woods in their yard narvals were only to be described as elegant and fanciful in contrast rich beautiful curtains hid the usual screens and doors and across the deck were several large rugs which must have cost a fortune he realized de barras was watching him awaiting his reactions bolitho said you live well capitaine de barrass smooth forehead wrinkled in a brief frown bolithos failure to use his title perhaps or his treating him as a fellow captain might have offended him but the frown vanished just as quickly and he sat down very carefully in another gilded chair the twin of bolithos i live as best i can in these frugal circumstances he spoke perfect english with a slight lisp he snapped his fingers at his young servant you must take some wine er captain he watched the boy as if daring him to spill any on a carpet it gave bolitho more time to study de barras now that his eyes were growing used to the cabin he could be any age between twentyfive and thirtyfive with delicately fashioned nose and small chin he looked more like a member of some exclusive court than a sea captain he was bolitho had observed when coming aboard wearing a wig that too was unusual and only added to the sense of unreality but the wine was good more it was excellent de barras seemed pleased my father owns many vineyards this wine travels quite well again the small petulant frown like borlase bolitho thought which it needs to do this vessel has been in unbroken service for three years now and i have held command for two i see bolitho watched him wondering what this strange man really wanted he noticed how the boy was hovering by de barrass elbow he was not merely attentive he was terrified de barras murmured and you are bound for there was nothing to be gained from secrecy the levu islands you are expecting er trouble he waved one hand carelessly towards the sea allowing a great show of lace shirt to froth from beneath his sleeve two ships we have had trouble bolitho wondered if raymond had a telescope trained on the narval he hoped so hoped too he was fuming at being excluded pirates bolitho smiled gently i can see you are not surprised de barras was taken off guard i am merely curious he prodded the boys shoulder sharply more wine bolitho asked and you are bound for new south wales yes de barras stood up and walked quickly to the bulkhead and adjusted one of the curtains clumsy fools they live like swine themselves and have no thought for fine things he curbed his sudden irritation and sat down again i intend to pay my respects to the governor and replenish my stores there bolitho kept his face stiff the governor would really explode when he saw a french frigate in his bay de barras added quietly i am looking for one such pirate and have been for many months he is an englishman but a pirate nonetheless we are both bound to his eventual destruction eh msieu it seemed to amuse him he was plundering the waters of the caribbean from la guaira to martinique i pursued him to port of spain and lost him when his men sacked and burned a village nearby his chest was moving with agitation like a spoiled child bolitho thought frail he might appear but he was as dangerous as a serpent underneath bolitho said it is a lot of concern for one man he watched for some hint some sign of what lay behind de barrass confidences he is a man who attracts others de barras sipped his wine delicately one without loyalty himself but one who can instill it in those he leads i was going to explain these matters to the governor of new south wales but it seems that he may be better informed than i realized he came to a decision the pirate is called tuke he has with him a man who was awaiting deportation from martinique to france that was to be one of my missions he spat out the words this cochon tuke aided his escape and now has him with his own foul company may i ask about this other man it is no matter de barras shrugged a traitor to france an agitateur but he must be taken and punished before he can cause more unrest when bolitho remained silent he added vehemently it is in englands interest also this traitor will use tukes strength to spread trouble to rob and sack more and more ships and islands as his own power expands he dabbed a droplet of sweat from his chin it is your duty something threw a shadow across the cabin and when bolitho turned towards the windows he imagined he was seeing a spectre from a nightmare dangling outside was a man or what was left of him suspended by his wrists with ropes attached to his ankles and which disappeared towards the rudder he was naked and his body was a mass of bloody lacerations and great gaping wounds one eye had been torn from his head but the other stared fixedly at the ship while his mouth opened and closed like a black hole de barras was almost beside himself with anger mon dieu he pushed the frightened boy towards the bulkhead door pursuing him with angry words and threats voices sounded overhead and the dangling body dropped swiftly from view bolitho sat stockstill in his chair he knew what was happening had heard about the savage and barbarous custom of keelhauling from old sailors to punish a man in this manner was to condemn him to an horrific death the victim was lowered over the bow and dragged along the keel his progress controlled by lines attached to his hands and feet after three years in commission coppered or not narvals keel and bilges would be covered with tiny razorsharp growths which would tear a man to fragments unless he was sensible and let himself drown but mans instinct was to survive even when the case was without hope bolitho stood up and said i will leave now msieu le comte i have my duty to attend to so if you would excuse me he turned towards the door sickened and disgusted de barras stared at him that man was a troublemaker i will not tolerate such insolence filthy degraded beast bolitho walked into the sunlight remembering le chaumareys the way his solid courage had inspired and welded his ship together by comparison de barras was a monster a vicious tyrant who had probably been appointed to narval to keep him away from france by the entry port de barras said sharply save your anger for your enemies then as bolitho took his first step through the port he swung on his heel and stalked aft towards the poop the lieutenant who had escorted bolitho aboard accompanied him back to tempest when they were almost alongside bolitho asked is that how your ship is run msieu by terror the young officer stared at him pale under his tan bolitho stood up in the boat eager to be back in his own ship then he added for if that be so watch out that the terror does not consume you within minutes of returning to his ship bolitho received a signal from raymond a summons to attend him aboard the eurotas without delay although still appalled by what he had seen aboard the french frigate bolitho could nevertheless find room for personal satisfaction in his heart he had known that raymond would insist on his going across to the transport even at the risk of his meeting viola raymond needed to display that he and not bolitho held the reins of command and his curiosity at what had passed between him and the frenchman would do the rest also bolitho suspected raymond felt less in control when he was aboard a kings ship herrick watched him anxiously as he prepared to make another crossing this time in his own gig bolitho was changing into some clean breeches and had just finished his description of de barras and the atmosphere of tyranny aboard the narval he guessed herrick was probably comparing de barras with the captain of the phalarope where they had first met only seven years ago it did not seem possible they had seen and done so much together herrick said eventually i hate even the sound of his kind and i for onell be a sight more happy when his topsls dip below the horizon id wager youll be disappointed thomas bolitho took a glass of wine from noddall it was as much to destroy the french captains taste as to clear the salt from his throat herrick looked at him with surprise but i thought you said narval is steering for new south wales bolitho tugged his neckcloth into position and smiled grimly she was my guess is that de barras has hot irons under him to recapture this mysterious frenchman and now sees us as a better chance he may be right he snatched up his hat well herrick sighed fine sir there seemed no point in further protest bolithos eyes were shining more brightly than they had for some time he followed bolitho to the entry port and stood with him above the swaying gig a quick glance aft told herrick that keen and lakey and even young midshipman swift were all watching and smiling like involved conspirators it only made him depressed they did not understand that this was not just a man going away in the hopes of seeing his love but one who could easily be casting his career into ashes borlase was at the eurotass side to greet bolitho but his childlike features were carefully set giving nothing away bolitho looked around the maindeck and was thankful to see there appeared to be quite a number of competentlooking seamen amongst the replacements for those killed or maimed by the pirates in every scattered seaport even one as new as sydney there always seemed to be a few abandoned sailormen who were ready to chance one more strange ship just once more all sailors said that how are the prisoners mr borlase it was strange that the term prisoner seemed to carry more dignity than convict ive had them put to work in small parties as you suggested sir a mere hint of disapproval here good maybe borlase found them too much responsibility and worry or perhaps he thought they should be kept penned up as before but once ashore in the levu islands they would need all their health and agility to stay alive deported convicts in the americas and now in new south wales had left plenty of bitter examples in their wake they must survive like those who guarded and directed them upon their own resources they moved into the poops shadow and made their way aft to the great cabin raymond was waiting there sitting at the desk his body silhouetted against the reflected glare from the tall windows he said crisply you will remain here mr borlase bolitho waited impassively raymond was keeping the lieutenant as a defence or a witness or both and now captain raymond leaned back his fingertips pressed together perhaps you will be so kind as to inform me of your discourse with the narvals captain i would have sent you a report of that i am certain it sounded like sarcasm but give me the bones of the matter for now borlase made as if to get a chair for his captain but after a glance at raymond seemed to change his mind curiously bolitho felt better because of raymonds attitude no pretence no change between them nor would there be he listened to his own voice as he explained briefly what had passed between him and the frenchman calm unemotional like evidence at a court martial he thought raymond dismissed the keelhauling as a matter for each country to decide bolitho said quietly france decided long ago but out here de barras is their country it is not my concern raymonds fingertips drummed rapidly together in a silent tattoo but the narval most certainly is she will not dare to bolitho got no further raymond snapped really you sea officers are as one we are not at war with the king of france now you must adjust to your new role or exchange it for another his voice was louder and crisper it was as if he had been rehearsing for just such a moment with french aid we can explore all possibilities of trade and the mutual defence of it the fingers tapped in and out to mark each item the crushing of piracy and plundering for instance the covering of greater sea areas for our combined benefit if one day we are forced to fight france again and i think it unlikely no matter what i have heard to the contrary then we will be better placed because of this cooperation now know your competitor every merchant will tell you so a pity that those entrusted with our protection cannot bring themselves to do likewise in the sudden quiet bolitho could feel his own heart beating with anger and caution he could tell from the manner in which borlases eyes were flickering back and forth between them that he was expecting him to lash out at raymonds last remark a calculated insult doubly so as bolithos men had saved his life and restored his freedom with no little risk raymond frowned have you no comment i know little of merchants sir but i do know an enemy from a friend borlase shifted his feet noisily raymond said anyway you sent the narval on her way no doubt with fresh fuel to burn at our expense i expect de barras will be close to us for this passage sir he is determined to recapture his prisoner and if we fall on the pirate tuke his chances of doing so are good from his point of view quite tuke hanged and this renegade restored to his chains may in some way make up for what has happened already he paused waiting to see if bolitho would take up the bait when he remained silent he snapped when do you expect a landfall if this wind holds it will be under three weeks if not it could take two months it was pointless to compare the sailing ability of the unmatched vessels just as it was dangerous to be too optimistic raymond was waiting for a weakness a flaw raymond pulled out his watch and said tell my servant to bring some wine mr borlase he looked at bolitho coolly i am sure my wife would wish to join us here also he glanced around the cabin yes i am certain of it bolitho looked away he should have expected it raymonds top card to borlase it may have sounded a formal or expected invitation out of custom or courtesy the senior official sharing his wine with the captain of a naval escort but the way his voice had lingered on the word here bolitho needed no other key to his reasoning for here was the cabin where bolitho had met with his wife had held her to drive away the terror and despair of the eurotass capture had kissed the cruel burn on her shoulder where they had loved with all passion and simplicity the screen door opened and she stepped into the cabin despite her daily walks on deck she looked pale and there were shadows under her eyes which filled bolitho with pain a visitor my dear raymond half rose and sat down again a redcoated captain of the militia sent as guards for the convicts had followed borlase into the cabin too and was beaming at bolitho and the wine totally ignorant of the real drama around him another witness bolitho crossed the cabin and took her hand as he put it to his lips he lifted his gaze to her face she said softly it is good to see you again captain she tossed her head it has been too long she looked at her husband as she spoke under any circumstance borlase said a toast to the king he sounded as if his neckcloth was strangling him he at least guessed what was happening indeed raymond sipped at his glass perhaps after i have completed my affairs out here the palace of st james will be ready to offer me an appointment which will keep me suitably employed in london bolitho watched him again the hint was there for borlase and the militia captain to note that raymond was a man of influence with more advancement on the way not one to cross or deny obedience surprisingly he thought at that moment of his dead brother hugh always hasty to react always the leader in this instance he would most likely have searched out some point of honour on which to challenge raymond to a duel he would not have stopped to consider the consequences the risk to all parties concerned to him it would have been the simplest solution swords or pistols he was more than a match with either he realized that viola had crossed the cabin and had deliberately turned her back towards raymond she asked do you know of these islands captain but her eyes were exploring his face his expression consuming him with their need a little my sailing master is better versed he dropped his voice please take care once ashore it is a cruel climate even for one as used to travel as yourself i am sorry i did not hear that raymond stood up and lurched against the desk as the ship wallowed steeply then he added i think the wind may be rising captain bolitho looked at him his eyes hard aye mr borlase would you signal for my gig he hesitated by the door knowing he was beaten and that the battle had not even been joined as yet raymond nodded curtly i hope the wind does stay fair he smiled why not see the gallant captain to his boat mdear on deck the heat was oppressive and the sea had risen slightly to a lively breeze tempest was standing to windward her sails flapping in disorder as she lay hove to and awaited his return the french ship was already well away her courses and topsails hardening to the wind and to all intents still set on her original destination bolitho saw all and none of these things he stood by the bulwark looking at her eyes watching her hair breaking free and streaming into the wind like fluid bronze i cannot stand it viola i feel like a useless traitor a buffoon she reached out and laid a hand on his cuff he is baiting you but you are so much stronger she made to touch his face and then lowered her arm my darling richard i cannot bear to see you so sad so despairing i am still full of happiness that we found each other again surely we could not be parted again forever she raised her chin i would rather die boats alongside sir raymonds feet scraped across the deck and bolitho saw him watching from below the poop just to snatch her in his arms and be damned to raymond and all else even as he thought it bolitho dismissed the dream raymond would use all he had to keep her out here like a beautiful prisoner a possession bolitho raised his hat his hair ruffling across his forehead rest easy my love i do not intend to strike just yet then with a nod to borlase he climbed down into the tossing boat short respite bolithos estimate for a landfall at the largest island of the levu group was closer than he had imagined the total passage from sydney having taken only twentysix days the first few hours at anchor in the mushroomshaped bay were busy for everyone aboard the tempest for apart from the importance of selecting a safe anchorage with room to swing and little chance of dragging in a sudden gale the company were further hindered by a growing collection of native craft from this and surrounding islands they were different from other islanders which tempest had encountered their skins were paler their noses less flat and their bodies for the most part devoid of violent tattoos and tribal scars the girls who crowded the canoes or swam happily around the frigates stem as she glided to her anchorage caused plenty of comment amongst the seamen and were obviously well aware of the interest they were arousing as scollay the masteratarms remarked sourly therell be trouble with that lot you see but he was quick to wave and grin with the best of them herrick came aft as soon as the anchor was down and reported to bolitho on the quarterdeck bolitho moved his glass past the anchored eurotas and trained it slowly along the shoreline and creamywhite beach low surf lush green trees which held the shade to the waters edge and bright blue water beyond partly hidden by haze or low cloud the islands tallest point shone like polished slate towering above the other hills and forest like a perfect pyramid it was like some part of paradise this and probably nothing more could have caused the bountys company to mutiny how different from the slums and seaports from which so many sailors were drawn warmth friendly and hospitable natives abundant food it was a margin between hell and heaven he steadied the glass on the settlement here the paradise was less evident herrick was also looking at the stout wooden palisades and blockhouses the larger building beyond the outer perimeter with the flag above it there were places like this all over the pacific the east and west indies and as far north as china some said well sited it was all herrick could find to describe his feelings he was probably thinking like bolitho of viola left with her maid and no friends in this remote outpost of trade and empire there was a small schooner moored to a fraillooking pier and several longboats tied up nearby she would be used for visiting the other islands no doubt against her eurotas and tempest would appear like giants keen strode aft looking worried he touched his hat what do i do about the natives sir they want to come aboard theyll overrun us herrick glanced at bolitho for confirmation and said unfeelingly let em come in manageable groups mr keen keep them from sneaking below and watch out for local drink being smuggled inboard he grinned then at keens confusion and a weathereye for some of our own jacks too remember theyve not seen girls like these for a long time the first natives came eagerly and within minutes the deck was strewn with gaily coloured garments piles of fruit and coconuts and to keens astonishment a young squealing pig it was like watching children bolitho thought as some of his seamen struggled to break the language barrier and the giggling girls with their long black hair and barely concealed bodies pointed at their knives or their tattoos touching each other and shrieking with uninhibited laughter lakey said glumly how long before they ruin this place too i wonder but nobody took any notice it was not so easy to get the visitors to leave and make way for the next group and some of the seamen aided keen in his efforts by picking up the girls and dropping them overboard where they dived and surfaced like neptunes handmaidens bolitho said at length i will have to go ashore thomas set a good anchor watch and put out a guard boat it all looks peaceful but herrick nodded aye sir but always seems to mar things he followed him down the companion and aft to the cabin where noddall and allday were peering through the stern windows and waving to some hidden swimmers below the transom bolitho added mr bynoe will be going ashore to obtain fruit and other fresh supplies i have no doubt herrick understood ill have the purser guarded too dont you fret sir inwardly he was wondering how it was bolitho never seemed to forget anything even when his heart was elsewhere and mr toby im fairly certain the carpenter will be off as soon as he can to seek useful timber for his store herrick said quietly ill remember sir he waited for bolitho to look at him you go ashore and do what you must ill have a safe ship for your return he hesitated hoping he had not used his friendship to go too far and i mean that both ways sir bolitho picked up his hat and replied simply i never doubted it thomas then more sharply allday if you can drag yourself away from the contemplation and selection of your lust id be obliged to be taken ashore allday sprang towards the screen door his face under control never faster captain left alone with herrick bolitho added quietly the narval aye sir herrick waited knowing the frenchman had been on bolithos mind they had sighted her several times just a tiny sliver below the horizon following waiting like the hunter bolitho said hell not anchor here but as soon as i am sure what we are required to do i would like to discover his whereabouts herrick shrugged some would say it was a sort of justice if this de barras got his grappling irons into tuke before we did sir i think were too soft with bloody pirates of his kind bolitho looked at him gravely hanging would certainly be too soft in de barrass book have you considered the reverse side of the coin thomas the grey eyes watched herricks uncertain frown that tuke may have the same plan in mind for the narval he walked towards the square of bright sunlight below the companion adding he nearly took eurotas into his brotherhood and he certainly captured enough heavy guns to make him a power to reckon with herrick hurried after him his mind hanging on to bolithos words mutiny in a kings ship was bad enough but to contemplate that a mere pirate could attack and seize a manofwar was impossible to accept he said grudgingly of course narval is a frenchie bolitho smiled at him and that makes a difference to your conscience aye herrick grinned awkwardly some there was even more fruit on the gundeck now and the shrouds and gangways were festooned with plaited mats strangelooking garments and long delicate streamers daubed in bright colours herrick said what would the admiral say to all this bolitho walked to the entry port noticing the instant attention and interest his appearance was causing several girls crowded around him trying to hang garlands over his neck while others touched his goldlaced coat and beamed with pleasure one old man kept bobbing his head and repeating capitain cook like a sailors parrot it was probable that cook had once visited the islands or maybe the old man had carried the story of his ships and his sailors with their pigtails and oaths rough humour and rum from another part of this great ocean entirely bolitho heard allday call to his gigs crew therell be a few little maids here whod suit me lads an thats no error bolitho lowered himself into the boat while the calls shrilled and brought more cheers and laughter from the onlookers it was like that all the way to the little pier with girls and young men swimming on either beam touching the oars and turning alldays stroke into confusion even his threats made no difference and bolitho was glad for his sake when they were safely ashore he paused with the sun beating down on him tasting the different aromas of thick undergrowth and palms of woodsmoke and drying fish allday said it looks a bit rough captain he was looking at the wooden wall around the main settlement yes bolitho straightened his sword and started to walk along the pier towards a group of uniformed militia who were obviously waiting to escort him close to their red uniforms with yellow facings were shabby and badly patched the men were well browned by the sun and he thought as hard as nails like the corps in new south wales they were adventurers of a sort unwilling to risk the discipline and regulated life in the army or aboard ship but without the training or intelligence to stand completely on their own one with shaggy hair protruding beneath his battered shako brought up his sabre in a salute which would have made sergeant quare faint welcome captain he showed his teeth which only made him appear more wild im to take you to see the resident mr hardacre weve been watching your ships coming in all day a fair sight they made too i can tell you sir he fell in step beside bolitho while the rest of his party slouched along behind on the short walk to the settlement bolitho discovered that hardacre had built the place with very little help from anyone and had somehow managed to win the respect of most of the islanders for several miles around it was unlikely he would take very kindly to raymond bolitho thought the militia had been collected mostly in sydney and their numbers had dwindled over the past two years to a mere thirty men and two officers the rest had either deserted leaving the islands by native craft or the occasional trading schooner or had gone to make their lives with one of the local tribes enjoying an existence of women plentiful food and no work at all and a few had disappeared without any trace the talkative lieutenant whose name was finney confided i came to make my fortune he grinned but no sign of it yet im thinking below the gates of the settlement protected by little blockhouses above and on either side of them bolitho paused and looked back at his ship herrick had been right about it it was well sited and a handful of men with muskets even these ruffians could hold off twenty times their number he frowned provided they were armed with nothing heavier inside the gates bolitho stopped and stared up at a crude gibbet the halter was still attached but had been cleanly cut with a knife finney sucked his teeth and said twas a mite awkward captain wed no idea that a real ladyd be coming to a place like this we had no warning ysee he sounded genuinely apologetic we cut him down sharply but she saw the poor devil all the same bolitho quickened his pace filled with hatred for raymond what had he done mr hardacre said hed been after the daughter of a chief on tother side of the island he forbids any of the men from going there an says the chief is the most important friend we have among the tribes they reached the deep shade of the main door and he had the man hanged for it finney sounded subdued you dont understand captain mr hardacre is like a king out here bolitho nodded i see it was getting worse instead of better then i am looking forward to meeting him john hardacre made an impressive sight well above average height he was built like a human fortress broad and deepchested with a resonant voice to match but if that was not enough to awe his visitors his general appearance was of a selfmade king as his lieutenant had described he had bushy hair and a great spadeshaped beard both once dark but now the colour of wood ash somewhere in between his eyes stared out beneath jetblack brows like two bright lamps he wore a white loosely folded robe which left his powerful legs bare and his large feet were covered only in sandals and held well apart as if to sustain the weight and strength of the man above he nodded to bolitho and studied him thoughtfully frigate captain eh well well so his majestys government appears to think we may need protection at last he chuckled the sound rising like an underground stream you will take refreshment with us here it was not a suggestion but an order raymond who was standing beside an open window and mopping his face with a sodden handkerchief complained its hotter than i thought possible hardacre grinned displaying disappointingly bolitho thought a set of broken and stained teeth you get too soft in england out here it is a mans country ripe for the taking like a good woman eh he laughed at raymonds prim stare youll see two native girls padded softly across the rush mats and arranged glasses and jugs on a stout table bolitho watched hardacre ladling colourless liquid into the glasses it was probably like firewater he thought although hardacre seemed willing enough to drink it too well gentlemen welcome to the levu islands bolitho gripped the arm of his chair and tried to stop his eyes from watering hardacres ladle swept over him and refilled his glass damn good eh bolitho waited for his throat to respond strong raymond put down his glass my instructions are to take overall control of these and other surrounding islands not yet under common claim by another nation he was speaking quickly as if afraid hardacre might fly into a rage i have full instructions for you also from london from london hardacre watched him swilling the drink around his glass and what does london think you can do which i cannot pray raymond hesitated various aspects are unsatisfactory and besides you do not have the forces at your disposal to support the kings peace rubbish hardacre turned towards a window i could raise an army if i so wanted every man a warrior each one ready to obey me bolitho watched him seeing his anxiety which he was trying to hide and his obvious pride in what he had achieved on his own hardacre swung towards him violently bolitho of course i recall it now your brother during the war he sighed that war made many a difference to a lot of folk and thats true enough bolitho said nothing watching hardacres eyes remembering knowing that raymond was listening hoping for his discomfort the great bearded figure turned back to the window yes i was a farmer then lost everything because i was a kings man when we had to take sides so i pulled up my roots and set to work out here he added bitterly now it seems it is the king who wishes to rob me this time nonsense raymond swallowed his drink and gasped it will not be like that you may still be needed i must first hardacre interrupted youll first listen to me he flung aside the plaited screen and pointed at the dark green trees i need trained men to help me or those i can instruct before i get too old i dont want officials like those in sydney or london nor with all respect captain do i need uniforms and naval discipline bolitho said calmly your discipline appears somewhat harsher than ours oh that hardacre shrugged justice has to be matched against the surroundings it is the way of things here your way bolitho kept his voice level hardacre looked at him steadily and then smiled yes if youll have it so he continued gruffly youve seen what can happen in the islands captain the people are simple untouched laid open for every pox and disease which a ship can drop amongst them if they are to prosper and survive they must protect themselves and not rely on others impossible raymond was getting angry the eurotas was captured and retaken by the tempest every day were hearing worse news about marauding pirates and murderers and even the french are disturbed enough to have sent a frigate the narval hardacre shrugged oh yes mister raymond i have my ways of learning news too indeed well youll not seek out and destroy these pirates with a trading schooner and a handful of painted savages raymond glared at him hotly i intend to make it my first task after that we will talk about trade my men will begin landing convicts tomorrow and clear more land near the settlement where huts can be built for them he sounded triumphant so perhaps you can begin with that mr hardacre hardacre eyed him flatly very well but your wife i trust youll not detain her here longer than necessary your concern moves me hardacre said quietly please do not use sarcasm on me and let me tell you that white women especially those of gentle birth are no match for our islands dont your people have wives hardacre looked away local girls raymond looked at the two who were standing near the table very young very demure bolitho could almost see his mind working hardacre said bluntly two girls of good family their father is a chief a fine man hmm raymond pulled out his watch the sweat running off his face like rain have someone show me my quarters i must have time to think later when bolitho was alone with him hardacre said your mr raymond is a fool he knows nothing of this place nor will he want to learn bolitho said what of the french frigate where did you see her so you had it in your mind to ask eh like a teazel in the brain hardacre smiled traders bring me information barter and mutual trust is our best protection oh yes i have heard about narval and her mad captain just as i know about the pirate mathias tuke he is often lying off these islands with his cursed schooners so far he has thought twice about trying to plunder the settlement damn his eyes he looked at bolitho but your frigate will be outwitted my friend you need small craft and strong legs and guides who can take you to this mans hiding places and he has several could you discover them for me i think not captain we have survived this far without open war bolitho thought of the eurotas the superb planning which had gone into her capture that and the ruthless cruelty to back it would be more than a match for lieutenant finneys militia hardacre seemed to read his mind i brought stability to the islands before i came the chiefs had fought each other for generations stolen women taken heads adopted barbarous customs which even now make me breathe a little faster to think of them you are a sailor you know these things but i made them look to me forced them to trust me and from that small beginning i founded the first peace they had enjoyed ever so if someone breaks it he or they must be punished instantly finally it is the only way and if i began to use their trust to cause havoc amongst them by allowing you or the frenchmans cannon to smash down their primitive world these islands would revert to blood and hate bolitho thought of the laughing supple girls the sense of freedom and simplicity like the shadow of a reef it was hiding what lay just below the surface hardacre remarked absently you know of course that narvals captain is more concerned with recapturing a prisoner of france than he is in killing tuke he nodded i see from your face you had already thought as much you should grow a beard captain to hide your feelings what you were saying earlier about white women hardacre chuckled that too you could not hide the lady means something to you eh he held up his hand say nothing i have severed myself from such problems but if you want her to continue in health i suggest you send her back to england he smiled where she belongs there was a commotion of voices and hurrying feet in the yard below the window and moments later herrick with lieutenant finney panting in his wake strode into the room herrick said the guard boat found a small outrigger canoe sir he ignored hardacre and his officer there was a young native aboard bleeding badly the surgeon says he is lucky to be alive he glanced at hardacre for the first time it would appear sir that north island in this group was attacked by tuke and two schooners and is now in their hands this young lad managed to escape because he knew of the canoe tuke burned all the other boats when he attacked hardacre clasped his big hands together as if in prayer god their boats are their living he turned to herrick and you are herrick regarded him coldly first lieutenant his britannic majestys ship tempest bolitho said quietly so it seems you do need us after all north island is the hardest to defend its chief the least willing to learn from past mistakes hardacre was thinking aloud but i know how to seek him out he looked at finney muster the men and take them to the schooner i will leave immediately bolitho said gently no you will stay here i will take the schooner in company with my command and with your permission some of your men and a few reliable guides he added you will serve your islanders the better if you stay here he saw his words sink in hardacre nodded his massive head raymond you mean he frowned no matter i understand even if you cannot say it bolitho said to herrick recall the shore parties thomas news travels fast in the islands apparently we must travel faster the wind is still with us so we shall clear the anchorage and reefs before dusk herrick nodded absorbed in the only world he understood and respected aye sir lady luck permitting he hurried away and bolitho heard him shouting for his boats crew a resourceful lieutenant captain hardacre watched him grimly i could use him here use thomas herrick bolitho picked up his sword ive not seen any man including his captain do that as yet he strode from the room leaving the bearded giant and the two silent girls to their thoughts then he stopped dead as he heard her voice richard he turned holding her against him as she ran down the narrow wooden stairs she felt hot and shaking through her gown and her eyes were desperate as she asked are you leaving when will you return he held her tenderly putting aside the mounting demands and questions which only he could answer there has been an attack tuke he felt her shoulders go rigid i may be able to run him to ground in the courtyard he heard finney bawling orders the clatter of boots and muskets the sooner i can do it the quicker you will be free of this place she studied him stroking his face with her hand as if trying to mould it in her memory just be careful richard all the time for me for us he guided her back into the shade and walked into the harsh glare again raymond was already in the courtyard he must have run from his room to find what was happening for himself he snapped you were going to tell me captain bolitho looked at him gravely yes he touched his hat the movement needing all his selfcontrol now sir if i may go to my ship he turned away seeing the brief twist of her gown on a stairway above the yard as she watched him leave allday already had the gig prepared the crew ready bolitho sat in the boat and tried to think clearly as the oars churned the water alive tuke de barras raymond they all seemed to revolve and blend into one enemy a last barrier between him and viola borlase met him at the entry port i have reported back to duty sir so i see bolitho looked past him at the mingled brown figures of the islanders the familiar ones of his own seamen and marines clear the ship mr borlase then let me know when the schooner is ready to make sail he saw the confusion in his eyes come along let us not be all day herrick came hurrying towards him i am sorry i was not here to greet you sir you must have the wind under your gig bolitho nodded vaguely ill want you to take command of the schooner thomas use the native crew and hardacres militia but take prideaux and twenty marines he clapped him on the shoulder action thomas what a way to begin the new year eh herrick stared at him as if he had gone mad then he nodded of course sir tomorrow is the first day of seventeen hundred and ninety i have been checking the log on each and every day and had forgotten all about it he strode towards the quarterdeck ladder calling for the boatswain aft by the taffrail bolitho paused to collect his thoughts into some semblance of order another year he had hoped it might be different the beautiful surroundings and quiet shore made it harder still to accept that she was here also and denied him he sighed deeply and tomorrow because circumstances insisted they might be fighting for their lives yet again he watched the boats pulling from different angles towards the ship the carpenters crew and the purser the guard boat and the surgeon who had probably been ashore to examine the local vegetation some of his men had been thinking more of other distractions and almost everyone had expected at least a few days and nights at anchor he shaded his eyes to look up at the masthead pendant still whipping out strongly enough he started to walk towards the companionway as captain of a manofwar you must earn respect but to obtain and hold popularity was somewhat harder bolitho paced deliberately up and down the weather side of the quarterdeck his mind going over the sketchy plans while his eye wandered towards the nearest islands as they moved slowly abeam their hills and crags were painted like dull copper by a magnificent sunset ahead just off the lee bow was hardacres little schooner and beyond her a deeper curtain of shadow to mark the closeness of night on the opposite side of the deck his officers chatted quietly and watched the view as they discussed their ideas of what would happen it was strange not to see herrick moving about the deck or hear his familiar voice in some ways his absence was a blessing and allowed bolitho to stay remote more able to contain his thoughts he heard lakey murmuring with his two mates and guessed he was repeating his earlier doubts and anxieties for their benefit hereabouts the straggling islands and humps of the levu group were less well charted some barely at all depths and distances were vague and probably pure guesswork but the schooners crew knew them well enough and herrick would be sure to impress upon them the need for absolute caution when comparing their own draught with that of the frigate north island was very small highcrested and with a deep inlet to the northwest like something carved by a great axe the population lived in one village and as hardacre had said drew a regular harvest from the sea maybe tuke had gone there to set up a new base or to gather stores and water for his ships so he did have at least two schooners viola had been right about that also he found himself thinking about raymond again wondering what his hopes really were he would probably stay in the islands until more help arrived the usual caravan of secretariat and overseers which always followed most of his original staff had either been murdered by tukes men or had stayed in sydney to recover from wounds and to put affairs in order for friends and relatives who had also been killed or captured raymond had been lucky or was it that tuke was cleverer than everyone gave him credit for to single out raymond as a hostage to know he was aboard even before the attack showed a far superior mind to the usual kind of pirate borlase crossed the deck permission to shorten sail sir it is close on time to change the watch he waited uncertain of bolithos mood you did order it sir yes bolitho nodded call the hands there was no sense in driving the ship through the islands in pitch darkness he thought he heard lakey breathe out with relief as the boatswains mates piped the watch on deck to reduce sail the attack would have to be quick and efficiently executed he moved aft to avoid the hurrying marines and seamen tempest would cross and if need be enter the inlet while the schooners party landed and attacked the village from the rear tuke must feel safe enough he would not expect one youth to have escaped to have had the courage to take a canoe all on his own and carry the news to the main island high above the deck he heard the seamen calling to one another as they hung over the yards and fisted the canvas into submission two of their number had not returned to the ship with the other shore parties bolitho had ordered borlase not to mark them in the log as run for desertion carried only one penalty he had heard that hardacres village were planning to hold a heiva to welcome the ships and their companies amongst them with feasting and dancing and doubtless some of that drink which had cut his breath like fire out of a whole company two desertions were not so bad under the tempting circumstances if the men returned freely he would think again if not they would most likely end up as unwilling volunteers in hardacres militia when the frigate had departed for good he thought about hardacre and could find nothing but a grudging admiration his motives were obscured behind his power but his feelings for the natives and the islands were sincere enough but he would lose against raymond idealists always did with men like him he moved to the wheel and examined the compass north by west he nodded to the helmsman steady as you go aye zur the mans eyes glowed dully in the last of the sunset bolitho heard borlase rapping out orders in his shrill voice as acting first lieutenant he would let nothing slip past him after his last experience and the subsequent court martial he dare not he would take a few hours sleep if he could another glance at his command feeling the gentle thrust of wind and rudder listening to the familiar sounds of rigging and canvas they were so much a part of his everyday life that he had to listen to hear them allday was in the cabin watching noddall filling a jug with fresh drinking water and placing it beside two biscuits bolitho thanked him and allowed his coxswain to take away his coat and hat the trappings of command he looked at the offering on the table water and biscuits much what the prisoners eat in the fleet prison he thought allday asked shall i get the cot ready captain no ill rest here bolitho laid down on the stern bench and thrust his hands behind his head through the thick glass he could see the first stars distorted in the stout windows so that they looked like tiny spears he thought of viola pictured her lying in her strange bed listening to the growls and squeaks from the forest her maid would be with her protecting her new mistress in her quiet stricken manner his head lolled and he was instantly asleep allday pulled off his shoes and removed the deckhead lantern sleep well captain he shook his head sadly you worry enough for the lot of us decoy gods teeth mr pyper what is taking you so long herrick mopped his face with his sleeve and peered up at the brightening sky below him some waistdeep in boiling surf were the remainder of his landing party while others notably finneys militiamen were already higher up the steep rocky slope which they had confronted when the schooners two boats had carried them here herrick watched midshipman pyper staggering in the water while several brownskinned islanders tried to keep a boat from smashing itself on the rocks he hated it when things went wrong because of careless planning or as in this case no planning at all finney and his other lieutenant a dulleyed man called hogg had been certain of the right place to land the party herrick glared at the pitching schooner which had anchored nearly a cable offshore that showed just how much they knew of landing places the result had been several long trips back and forth with the two small boats and by now it was well past the time when they should have been moving inland pyper scrambled up the slope water trickling from his shirt and breeches his face beset with worry like swift he was seventeen and looked forward to promotion if and when a chance came he did not want to irritate his first lieutenant all ready sir captain prideaux called from the top of the slope i should damn well think so despite the discomfort he of all present looked impeccable as usual herrick bit back an oath send the marine skirmishers ahead if you please done prideauxs foxy face gave a sly smile ive got those bloody guides to hurry their carcasses too he drew out his slim hanger and lopped the head off a plant so herrick gritted his teeth so be it he waved his hand over his head and with some further delay his mixed party started to move inland finney observed cheerfully the village is right at the top of the inlet most of the huts are on stilts their backs in the hillside if tukes men are in there theyll be like rats in a cask when your ship blocks the seaward end the prospect of a fight seemed to please him down the straggling line of guides and marine skirmishers came the message there was smoke in the air strong stench of burning prideaux said they must be destroying the village he did not sound as if he cared herrick slapped a stinging insect from his neck and tried to fathom it out tuke had attacked the island and was creating his usual terror and murder but why if he needed supplies which seemed unlikely after his rich haul from the eurotas why waste time in sacking the place likewise if he was setting up a new hiding place why burn it down first nothing made sense he thought of discussing it with prideaux but checked himself the marine always seemed to be sneering at everyone he considered beneath his station in life too bloody clever by half he glanced at the two militia lieutenants as they strode easily amongst their ragged retainers they would know nothing it seemed likely they left all their thinking to hardacre herrick thought about bolitho and pictured him here now what would he do he grinned in spite of his apprehension he was not here he had sent his first lieutenant he looked up sniffing the air there was the smoke right enough it was shimmering over a low hill staining the sky prideaux said harshly by god this is hard going midshipman pyper turned to herrick and said i think i should go ahead with a guide sir he was rather a serious youth but likeable herrick paused hiding his surprise that was what bolitho would have done i was thinking along that tack mr pyper but ill go myself he waved to finney halt the men and put out your pickets i want the best guide doublequick it was amazing how easily it was coming to him now right mr pyper you can come too he slapped his shoulder pyper stared at him unaware what he had done to excite his lieutenant aye sir prideaux said wearily attack from the rear five or six volleys and a charge of canister would do just as well less work too theyd run like rabbits right under tempests guns herrick looked at him trying to mask his anger prideaux always swept other peoples plans away with a few simple remarks the trouble was he always sounded so confident we shall see herrick replied stiffly and in the meantime he turned and hurried towards the waiting guide a squat native quite naked and whose ears were split and transfixed by sharp bones pyper grimaced he stinks a bit sir the guide showed his teeth they were filed like marlin spikes god herrick examined his pistol and loosened his sword come along then the island was tiny but after blundering and crawling over scrub and stone and thrusting between tightly interwoven fronds herrick imagined it must be twice the size of kent the guide bobbed round some rotting trunks and jabbed his hand towards the thickening smoke he was excited herrick said tightly well have a look he dropped on his knees once again and followed the guides scarred and dusty rump through a clump of prickly scrub pyper exclaimed masts and yards sir theyre anchored right below the village where the smoke is coming from herrick shook his head insolent buggers they are that sure of their safety while they do their work he rubbed his hands tempest will be able to take her time and blow them apart as she pleases he turned round with difficulty well tell the others he looked at the midshipman well pyper flushed i thoughtwell i was once told spit it out or well be here all day pyper said firmly hadnt we better look at those vessels first sir one might be better armed than the other perhaps we could get our sharpshooters to pick off her seamen if she seems likely to weigh first he added lamely i am sorry sir herrick sighed you are quite right it must be the heat i should have thought of it leaving the perplexed guide amongst the scrub herrick and the midshipman wriggled further towards a dip in the bill then they saw the inlet a line of huts blazing and crackling along the far bank like torches and smoke hiding the water beneath them to the left was a jutting wedge of land while closer to the hill and partly hidden from herrick were the other huts but he could only stare at the jutting piece of land and the beach below it there are the ships mr pyper he could still not really accept it the masts and yards looked real enough but they were rigged to stand on the short beach held upright by long stays and plaited creepers there was even a masthead pendant on one of them and herrick realized that the loosely brailedup sails were in fact crude matting the truth thrust into his dazed thoughts like ice water if they seemed genuine to him this close to tempests masthead lookouts as she forged towards the headland they would appear perfect two vessels at anchor their crews intent on pillage and murder ashore pyper stared at him his face filled with confusion what will we do sir herrick felt his throat go dry just above the outthrust wedge of land he had seen something move tempest was here already he could picture her exactly as if she were not hidden guns manned officers at their stations bolitho and lakey on the quarterdeck he felt something akin to panic what was waiting for her where were the pirates he could hear occasional musket and pistol shots and there was much more smoke now something glinted beyond the burning huts and pyper said thickly a battery some big guns sir so that was it it was all frighteningly clear to herrick like walking to the edge of a grave and seeing yourself there the message the dummy masts the burning village had been a combined plan to lure tempest to the inlet herrick stood up regardless of the danger due to the wretched schooner to everything which had happened since their arrival in the islands bolitho was unwarned and unready he heard himself say run back tell captain prideaux i want a fullscale attack here and now he saw the shocked understanding on pypers face i know well not be able to get away but well save the ship remember that then as pyper stumbled away and the naked guide watched him with fixed fascination herrick cocked his pistol and drew his sword by th mark seven bolitho looked at lakeys intent face as the leadsmans voice drifted aft from the chains he restrained himself from using a telescope again and stood with his hands on his hips trying to visualize his ship and the narrowing strip of water the undulating barrier of land as a single panorama after coming on deck before dawn and going over the charts and calculations with lakey and his two lieutenants bolitho was as prepared as any captain could be when approaching a littleknown island island it was not much more than the ridge of a drowned mountain he thought he watched the surge of current around the nearest clump of rocks the drag of it as it receded in a bright welter of spray but the wind hesitant though it was so near to land was still holding and steady he glanced up at the long masthead pendant as it licked away towards the starboard bow wind and depth the ability to stop the ship and anchor the procession of thoughts and precautions trooped through his mind like persistent beetles deep eight lakey said sharply more like it bolitho walked to the quarterdeck rail and looked down at the guns here and there a man moved nervously or took another pull on a gun tackle bare feet scraped on the sanded decks and high in the maintop some marines were swinging a swivel gun back and forth in a silent bombardment he saw lieutenant keen standing between the lines of twelvepounders bending at the waist to peer through one of the open ports but keeping his arms folded as if to show how calm he was two midshipmen were assisting him at the divisions of guns the pugfaced fitzmaurice and the slight figure of young romney swift stood with his signal party on the quarterdeck while borlase puffing and emptying his cheeks like a fretful baby moved restlessly by the starboard gangway all there ready and waiting for something to happen bolitho glanced at the halfhour glass beside the compass he wanted to take out his watch to be sure but knew it would be seen as agitation uncertainty he had been aware of the men nearby watching him looking away quickly as his gaze had passed over them but it was taking far too long if they had to change tack now it would be an age before they could work back towards the inlet he studied the outthrust wedge of land the only thing recognizable from the bald description on his chart it was pale probably some sort of rock and strangely at odds with the lush green background beyond it glittering now above the starboard carronade was the first hint of an opening he bit his lip if herrick stayed silent he would have to drive past the inlet and lose precious time in so doing if there were ships still there they might even slip past before he could come about and spread more canvas he looked up slitting his eyes against the glare the sunlight angled down between the shrouds as if through windows in a cathedral he thought vaguely topsails and jib with the forecourse so tightly reefed it was barely filling but it was dangerous to make more speed he saw allday watching him from the companionway his heavy cutlass across one shoulder allday was waiting his moment he knew his captains moods so well that to speak now would only bring a swift rebuke the realization even amidst all his uncertainty moved bolitho he said quietly i can almostfeel the island allday walked to his side the smoke is thinning a bit captain no i think its being fanned further inland mebbee its my thought that the first lieutenant has found nothing the pirates have gone and knowing mr herrick ill wager hes looking after the dead an wounded left behind deck there the urgency of the cry made everyone look up ships at anchor around the point two of em a pause topsl schooners bolitho turned to allday his eyes gleaming well allday seemed troubled i was wrong then yes bolitho strode to the rail shake out the foresl mr borlase theres no sense in losing that pair he smiled at the lieutenants anxious expression we might even catch them as prizes if theyve the wit to strike to us he turned away trying to contain his anxiety for herrick and his men they must have lost their way or perhaps the schooner had grounded the big forecourse boomed and filled importantly from the foreyard in response the land seemed to move abeam more quickly while spray spattered over the bow and across the crouching seamen there keen was shouting starboard battery will fire by division on the order gun captains and not before dyou hear bolitho looked at him at the opposite end of the ship or almost how far he had come to gain such confidence and authority without becoming a tyrant on the journey which was even more important it did not occur to bolitho that keens captain might have had something to do with it he said stand by to alter course mr borlase pipe the hands to the braces we will steer noreast how many times had they altered tack and course during the long night but it had been usual enough for these men this was different they had made their landfall they would do what they were ordered he listened to the bark of commands the clatter of halliards and blocks as belaying pins were removed and the hands prepared to trim the yards the pale wedge of land was almost past now and he could see fires burning and hissing clouds of steam from the opposite side of the inlet by th mark five lakey said ready sir bolitho looked at him gravely it was all on the sailing masters lean face responsibility anxiety determination the ship and it was always his ship to a master had to have room to come about should the water become too shallow or the wind die at worse they must anchor but still hope they could fight clear of the shoals and the angrylooking spray below the foreshore very well as the seamen hauled at the braces and the big double wheel was put steadily over by lakeys best helmsmen bolitho cupped his hands and yelled masthead what of the ships the seaman must have been so enthralled by his place as spectator that he had not added to his first report still at anchor sir the man was probably peering down at the deck but the blinding sunlight hid him bolitho consulted the compass and then the set of the sails feeling the ship leaning less steeply as she came into the lands shelter borlase was yelling belay there take that mans name mr jury bolitho had no idea who that man was nor did he care he was staring at the reflected fires on the water leaping and glowing dull red despite the suns power making the inlet ahead of the bowsprit glitter like one great flaming arrowhead take in the forecourse mr borlase as the sail was brailed up to its yard again bolitho studied the blazing village and charred boats with mounting anger where was the point of it what prestige could a pirate like tuke hope to gain by destroying and murdering these simple people deep six the leadsman sounded completely absorbed ninety feet above the deck marine blissett exgamekeeper and now one of tempests best musket shots stood with his companions beside the little swivel gun and watched the sticklike masts above the barrier of land once round it and the starboard battery would begin to fire slow and deadly the first shots were always under control he peered over the barricade at the intent figures between the black guns the lieutenants and warrant officers pacing and worrying or snatching a look aft at the captain he saw bolitho almost below him he was carrying his hat and his black hair was moving in the hot breeze blissett remembered the other island the girl he had found stripped and murdered blissett was always amazed at his fellow men they were often forced to live and work in unbearable hardship and no matter how the captain kept an eye on such matters there was always some bully ready to make things worse when he got the chance yet these same men who could face a broadside with outward calm or watch one of their mates flogged with barely any emotion could rise to madness if an outsider kicked a dog or as in that case killed an unknown girl who was probably a slut anyway blissett was not like that he thought things out what you needed to stay out of trouble but also what you had to do to get noticed he wanted to be a sergeant like quare he might as well now that he was one of them he wondered why he had not been one of the party sent ashore with that pig prideaux the captain of the maintop legs braced his back against the massive blocks of the topmast shrouds asked wot you dreamin about blissett the captain of the top a giant petty officer called wayth was very aware of his responsibility the maze of cordage and spars the great areas of canvas which he might be ordered to repair or reset at any moment of the day and he disliked marines intensely without knowing why blissett shrugged well have no chance of taking these buggers theyll fight to the finish and take their bloody ships to the bottom with em no prize money no nothin the mast trembled and wayth forgot the marines as he peered up at his topmen blissett said to his friend well be up to em shortly dick aye the marine at the swivel swung it towards the land wed never even reach the ships with this poor cow he grinned now if we was shootin on the larboard beam we might it a couple of fat ogs for our supper eh rising to his friends joke blissett turned away from the rocky shoreline and the two sets of masts and playfully pointed his musket towards the opposite side one for the pot dick he froze jesus theres a bloody cannon over there wayth snarled ive ad about all the rest of his anger was blasted away by the crash of a heavy gun and the immediate shriek of iron as it smashed between tempests masts blissett fell to his knees ears ringing the breath pounded from his lungs by the closeness of a massive ball dazedly he stared at the length of severed rigging and then as he retched helplessly over the barricade at the pulped remains of the maintops captain the ball had cut him completely in half leaving his stomach against the mast like a pancake somehow blissett managed to shout deck battery on th larboard bow it was then he realized that apart from the corpse he was alone his friend and the other marine must have been hurled bodily to the deck below blissett leaned his musket against the barricade and trained the swivel towards the shore the first shot from the shore was followed instantly by another bringing cries of alarm from the tempests gundeck as it passed between the masts and ploughed into the beach on the opposite beam bolitho yelled engage with both batteries mr keen he turned away as blood and flesh fell across the nets which had been spread above the guns someone had been killed on the maintop and two marines had gone over the side after hitting the same nets then bouncing into the water dead or alive he did not know some of the men at the starboard battery were shouting and cheering the sound strangely wild they were probably trying to drown their sudden surprise at the bombardment the unexpected deaths right amongst them but soon they would hit back themselves even the score the shouting faltered and broke up into more confusion as the hidden guns fired again putting down a heavy ball almost alongside bolitho watched the spray falling across the hammock nettings a seaman peering up at it as if expecting to see a boarder he felt chilled unable to move his thoughts in time with the swift change of events bang that was surely a third gun perhaps halfway up a slope and above the blazing huts the ball went wide and he turned to see it raise a tall waterspout near the rocks keen had his sword above his head ready lads ready bolitho saw the sword drop to keens side and for an instant feared he had been hit by some hidden marksman then keen came running aft heads turning from each gun to watch his passing what the hell mr keen borlases voice was shriller than ever but keen ran halfway up the larboard ladder and shouted to bolitho sir the masts are false there are no ships to add menace to his words a shot crashed through a gunport and upended a twelvepounder over two of its crew the air rent with screams and sobs as the ball shattered in fragments on a gun across the deck men fell kicking and plucking at their bodies with hands like claws their dying progress across the planking marked by trails of dark blood engage to larboard bolitho walked quickly to the compass broadside and then reload with grape through his reeling thoughts came a spark of hope that they might hit some of the carefully sited guns and give themselves time to beat clear of the inlet fire the ship bucked and vibrated as if she had struck a sandbar the smoke rolling away downwind in a dense pall from the uneven broadside shouting like madmen the gun captains urged their men to reload with heavy grape while around them the ships boys darted with more powder dodging the gaping corpses and crawling wounded their faces like tight masks ready hand by hand each gun captain looked at keen his trigger line pulled almost taut on the uproll fire this time it was better timed and bolitho thought he saw the trees and burning huts shiver as the packed grape sliced through them but the reply came just as swiftly almost two together one hit the forecastle and bolitho heard the crash and whine of splinters saw men flung down as if by a terrible wind he felt the air throb over his head and winced as a ball cut through rigging and clawed down another seaman who was pulling himself aloft to repair some of the damage the man fell with a sickening thud across one of the quarterdeck guns and for a few moments he moved like some obscene bloody creature before he died and was hauled away by the stonefaced crew we will come about mr lakey bolitho staggered as the deck jumped to another longdrawnout broadside thank god the smoke was going towards the hidden guns it was their only protection lakey nodded his head jerky at once sir he cupped his hands man the braces if you please mr borlase borlase peered aft his eyes bulging from his head another shot whined low over the nettings and it seemed to bring the lieutenants limbs back into motion man the braces clear the starboard battery if you must but lively there bolitho watched coldly no room to wear and take full advantage of the wind they would have to pass right through its eye pivoting round with those four mocking masts their only adversary he could feel the anguish blinding and choking him it was his fault he should have seen the flaw felt his enemys cunning no skill ready ho several men let go a brace as a ball splintered through a portion of the gangway and ground three men into a writhing shambles bolitho saw it all felt it one second a scene of pain and survival as two men dragged a wounded companion towards a hatchway and safety now they kicked and screamed in one hideous gruel put the helm down bolitho ran to the lee side to try and see any sign of the enemy but apart from several scattered fires on a hillside caused no doubt by keens grapeshot it was as before he watched the men hauling at the braces their features grim and shining with sweat here and there a warrant officer even some of the wounded added their weight to drag the great yards round while above the proud figurehead the jib with broken rigging drifting amongst it like weed flapped in abandoned confusion helm alee the quartermaster had to repeat it as the guns hurled themselves inboard on their tackles one of them making red tracks through the remains of a fallen seaman off tacks and sheets borlases voice was like a scream through the speaking trumpet let go and haul bolitho watched hardly daring to breathe as the land began to move very slowly to larboard as his ship responded to rudder and canvas a grating crash brought more startled shouts and he saw a ball upend another gun slewing it right round amidst its severed tackles and gasping men as if to turn upon its own ship in revenge rigging fell from the maintopmast in black glittering coils and heavy blocks bounced and trailed over the nets like live things through it all urging and threatening sliding in blood or colliding with men employed at trimming the yards keen and his subordinates sent more hands across to the still unfired starboard battery all these things were recorded in bolithos brain like writing on parchment keen was keeping his head knew that once around they might have a faint chance of finding and hitting their attackers before they reached open water again crash lakey yelled main tgallant sir watch out on deck like a giant murderous tree the whole topgallant mast and yard all its canvas blocks and shrouds swept down and through the flimsy protection with the sound of an avalanche it fell across the larboard side breaking down nettings whipping men from their feet and flinging them aside like dolls bolitho felt the ship stagger under the onslaught sensed the change in motion as the tangle dragged at the hull like a great seaanchor jury was booming axes there clear it away get those wounded below his great voice seemed to rally the dazed gun crews along the side where the topgallant mast had fallen more trailing halliards and ratlines followed by the masthead pendant splashed over the side surging around some corpses and a few frantic swimmers as if to suck them under somewhere through the din and smoke bolitho heard the foretopsail filling to the change of tack and saw the land loom dangerously close while tempest continued to turn the planks bucked beneath him throwing up splinters like jagged darts as a ball smashed through the poop and explored the semidarkness between decks in a trail of destruction and terror in disbelief bolitho saw the sun glinting on clear water a distant island very green in the untroubled light in the opposite direction the trailing smoke from his ship mingled with that of the inlet and glowed above the burning village one more ball struck the hull right aft a great hammerblow as if to mark the final seal of defeat bolitho listened to voices resuming command and order the cries of the wounded becoming fainter as men died or were carried below to the orlop for gwyther and his mates to tend as best they could the broken mast and spars were drifting clear of the stern and he saw one man sitting astride the crosstrees staring after his ship too stunned to know what was happening borlase lurched towards him we are out of range sir it seemed as if he had to speak although his voice was thick and unsteady midshipman swift was on his knees beside one of his men hold on fisher he peered round desperately for aid his powdergrimed face streaked with sweat or perhaps they were tears bolitho thought the wounded seaman was one of the older hands and had been put in the signals party because of his inability to swarm aloft as he had once done two bad falls had rendered him almost a cripple and by rights he should have been ashore with his family if he had one now he lay staring up at the trailing rigging his face ashen as he gripped swifts hand between his as if in prayer he asked in a strong voice be oi goin zur swift stared blindly at bolitho then he seemed to draw on an inner reserve and pulled a flag up and over the mans waist a ball split in half by striking an upended gun had almost severed one of his legs and had laid open his groin like a cleaver swift said haltingly youll be all right fisher youll see fisher tried to grin oi dont feel all right zur then he died swift stood up violently and vomited on the deck bolitho glanced at allday see to him he was worth six men today aye allday sheathed his cutlass and walked to the midshipmans side swift did not look at him all these men we never stood a chance look at fisher mr swift alldays voice was calm but firm he could have been any of us he waited for the youth to face him or all of us he did his best now there are other poor fellows who need help he turned as the midshipman hurried to the quarterdeck rail then he said hell do captain just give him something to bite on he watched bolithos face seeing the strain clouding over it like pain hed not heard a word of it lakey asked what orders sir bolitho looked past allday towards the island and its pall of smoke he said we could enter and reenter that place with little change in result until he thrust his hands behind him gripping his fingers until the pain steadied him until our damage became fatal then we would lie aground or sinking until we agreed to terms or until we were all killed he forced himself to look up at the men who were already climbing up the shrouds towards the gap left by the lost topgallant mast they were moving slowly the confidence and the will gone out of them almost to himself he said they have the upper hand in his brain a voice insisted they beat you you you until he thought his mind would burst we will rejoin the schooner and anchor mr lakey he turned to borlase i want a list of dead and wounded soon as possible they were all looking at him accusing sympathizing hating he could not tell any more lakey murmured very well sir then in a louder voice watch your helm damn your eyes bolitho crossed to the weather gangway and took several deep breaths in a moment more he would step inside his role again plan a suitable approach lay his scarred ship on her rightful tack to rejoin herrick with least delay bury the dead attend the wounded see to the repairs discover the reason for failure no matter how painful it was to swallow but first he let his gaze move over the quiet shore the huts were hidden as were the dummy masts it was a savage lesson what he had seen as his last moments on earth might now be viewed as a last chance to redeem a terrible mistake he made himself turn away from the land and examine his ship as if to punish himself even further borlase asked secure guns sir he nodded then have the galley fire lit and see that the people are fed directly he looked at the dangling rigging the long smears of blood on the decks already brown in the sunlight there is a lot to be done allday said awkwardly ill fetch something to drink captain bolitho looked at him sharply something in alldays tone dragging him from his own despair the big coxswain added that last ball captain it did for poor noddall he looked away unable to watch bolithos eyes ill fetch it for you bolitho took a few paces hesitantly and then with sudden urgency poor defenceless noddall loyal and uncomplaining who despite his terror of the din of battle had always been ready to serve to watch over him it seemed impossible he was not below now hands like paws shaking his head and fussing lakey watched him grimly while from nearby jury the boatswain paused in his work with the scrambling grimy seamen to study bolitho he had heard alldays words and marvelled that with all this hell the captain could find time to mourn just one man bolithos eyes lifted suddenly and settled on him your men are doing well mr jury but not yet well enough to idle i think jury sighed it was a relief to see bolitho returning from inner hurt no matter how bad the consequences might be too much courage fix your bayonets herrick gritted his teeth to contain his impatience as prideaux brought the marines into a single line while further along the uneven slope finneys militia were following their example faces tight with concentration the air shook to the sudden boom of cannon and herrick knew the hidden battery had opened fire the gunners would be able to see tempest beyond the point even though it still hid all but her topmasts from herrick prideaux snapped advance his slim hanger shone in the sunlight moving from side to side like a steel tongue as he strode through the scrub and sundried stones more shots and before he followed the main part of his men towards the burning huts herrick turned and watched the waterspouts rising like spectres on the frigates shadow as she continued to force the inlet his mind repeated warnings and dreads so that for precious seconds he could only stand and punish himself with what he saw the inlet was too narrow the ship would strike she might be pounded into submission without even sighting her executioners he swore savagely he was here not on the quarterdeck where he belonged he shouted fast as you can then with the others he was running and stumbling down the slope the marines starting to cheer like madmen as they charged into the drifting smoke and sparks if they could overwhelm just one of those guns they could train it towards the others the shock of an attack from behind might cause enough confusion and give bolitho the diversion he desperately needed a seaman fell kicking and clasping his head blood soaking his hair and shoulders herrick stared at him as seamen and marines faltered or blundered against each other in the choking smoke then as if to a signal the air was filled with flying rocks and sharper pieces of stone herrick heard them hitting flesh and bone men cursing and staggering while they tried to see their attackers prideaux shouted look across that clearing he raised a pistol and fired natives from the village more stones hurtled through the smoke and two men fell knocked senseless midshipman pyper crouched beside herrick his teeth bared what are they attacking us for were here to help he sounded more angry than frightened herrick raised his pistol and fired feeling nothing as a dark figure cartwheeled down the slope and through the charred wall of the hut they think were all the same he swore obscenely as a stone hit his shoulder numbing the whole of his arm so that he lost his grip on the pistol come on prideaux the marine captain was peering through the swirling smoke his eyes smarting as he watched the naked figures becoming real and menacing as they started to pound up the hillside ready his hanger did not falter as a marine fell sobbing beside him his jaw broken by a rock aim herrick dashed sweat from his eyes gripping his sword with his left hand he could hear them now like baying hounds rising to a crescendo of hate and despair it would be better to die than to linger on at their hands he thought fire the muskets cracked together the stabbing flames making the smoke lift above the grimfaced marines reload keep your timing slightly above them finneys men began to fire with neither timing nor preparation herrick could hear the balls cracking into trees and rocks the sharp screams which told their own story but they were still coming herrick cleared his throat it felt raw up lads a spear passed over his head he saw it but through his racing mind it meant nothing he balanced himself carefully on the treacherous stones keep together his eye took in the fact that the marines were moving with practised jerky motions like red puppets arms rising and falling as one while the ramrods tamped home another volley take aim a marine shrieked and dropped down the slope his bloodied hands trying to drag a spear from his stomach fire again the musket balls swept across the crouching men in a lethal tide controlled but with less authority as two more men fell under the ceaseless bombardment of rocks and spears a great chorus of shouts from the militia made prideaux lose his outward calm he looked at herrick finney is being attacked from the other side his hanger fell to his side and he added with bitter disbelief god the buggers are running for it herrick snatched up a musket from a fallen marine and cocked it ignoring the agony in his shoulder as he made sure it would fire through his teeth he said send someone to the top again see if the ship is safe quick as you can prideaux nodded mr pyper you go he ducked as a spear hissed between them tempest will be dismasted i shouldnt wonder he took a reloaded pistol from his orderly here they come again he smiled tightly put a ball in me rather than leave me eh he walked back to his men ill do the same for you herrick watched him for those few seconds he almost liked the man then they were firing again reloading and fumbling firing and crouching together like the last men on earth herrick heard ragged shooting from some way off and guessed that finneys men were retreating back to the schooner all thought of defiance gone out of them he pulled the trigger a misfire he stood with his legs astride and used the musket like a club feeling the pain run up his wrists as he smashed down a screaming savage and struck out at two more all round him the sounds were of people now the muskets used only for their bayonets or as crutches for the wounded herrick hurled the musket into a mans face noting briefly that his eyes were almost red with fury and the lust to kill then he drew his sword again parrying aside a spear and hacking open a brown shoulder with the same movement above and through it all he heard pyper calling his name then the ships gone about shes clearing the entrance then he fell silent terrified even dead herrick did not know he yelled fall back carry the wounded he slashed at a figure which had somehow got past the gasping thrusting marines herrick slipped and almost fell searching wildly for his sword knowing that his loss had halted the man that he was turning towards him his voice lifted in one terrifying shriek another figure ran through the smoke holding a pistol outstretched in both hands as if it took all his strength to use it the heavy ball took away the natives forehead and hurled him across herrick in a welter of blood and convulsing limbs he had been carrying a long wavy knife which fell across herricks shoe and slit it open merely with its own weight herrick picked it up and recovered his sword thanks mr pyper he waved his arms in the air realizing that the attackers had melted into the smoke leaving dead and wounded entwined amongst their discarded weapons prideaux said tersely theyll try to cut us off damn them he watched his marines reloading their muskets and those of their dead or wounded comrades herrick nodded it gives us a little time prideaux regarded him coolly for what praying he swung round angrily be careful you dolt you nearly dropped it his orderly had been reloading a pistol and was shaking so badly he seemed barely able to stand go and help the wounded man youre more menace than aid in your state herrick wiped his face and blinked at the sky so clear above the smoke mocking all of them for their antlike confusion a seaman said four wounded or stunned by them rocks sir five killed i dunno ow many of the militias still with us but i can see several corpses on th illside prideaux said angrily to hell with them i say if i meet mr finney again ill give him cause to regret he survived herrick said ready to move he had seen it before the wildness of a battle going with the suddenness of a squall leaving men like fallen trees useless broken yes prideaux waved his hanger two scouts up ahead he glanced at pyper you take charge of the wounded his head darted forward is that clear pyper nodded his eyes glassy he was probably remembering how he had nearly been cut off how he had held the heavy pistol feeling it gaining weight with each second as he had tried to clear his vision of sweat and fear as the naked yelling savage had lunged towards the first lieutenant aye sir that is a relief prideaux strode off again his heels striking up dust as he hurried after his marines herrick watched the clearing it was wrong to leave the dead marines but what could he do he must lead and rally the survivors the pirates might be after them as well although it was unlikely they would wish to cross swords in wild country with natives whose village they had just burned he waited for pyper and his stumbling group of wounded to pass and then walked towards the same rounded hill he had seen just hours ago and he had acted on his own initiative the thought troubled him as he walked and he searched his mind for satisfaction or justification tempest had got away although she must have suffered under those powerful pieces his action to attack and divert the gunners may have made little difference although the pirates must have heard the din they were making but bolitho would not know that they had tried to help to prevent the ships destruction with the only means they had their lives a marine turned and looked back at a companion who had been hit in the leg by a spear he was leaning on pypers shoulder his eyes bright and feverish as he stared after the rest of the men the marine called come on billy not long now youll get a double tot o rum for this i shouldnt wonder herrick swallowed hard they were not done for yet not with men like these when eventually prideauxs scouts signalled that the landing place was in sight herrick knew even his moment of frail hope was extinguished as they crawled into whatever shelter they could find and shaded their eyes against the fierce glare from the sea herrick saw finneys men surrounded by even more natives than had originally attacked them near the village it was made worse by the silence the pathetic attitudes of the militiamen as they stared out at the hostile faces finney had thrown down his sword probably because he had been here before or had met some of these same natives during his service with hardacre the other lieutenant hogg was standing well back with his men his terror evident even at this distance and beyond the little scene of fierce tension the schooner idled clear of the rocks her mainsail already set and drawing as she moved further from the shore her small native crew would imagine the raid had been a complete failure and why not they would try to save themselves get home a seaman muttered theres one o the boats still here sir herrick did not answer he had already seen it known that it had been stove in by the rocks or the natives no longer made any difference it was then the silent figures exploded into the militiamen in a solid naked wall the light glinted on stabbing and plunging weapons on limbs waving above the swaying crowd like scarlet roots while through the heated air herrick and his men listened to the rising roar of jubilant voices there was nothing they could do it was still too far and they would probably refuse to move even if he ordered it they would wish to stay together at the end it was not because they were frightened they were beyond that nor was it caused by any sort of revenge for being left abandoned by those same men who were being mercilessly hacked to death it was the way of sailors and on land or sea it was the only one they knew the crowd began to break away from the trampled sand and scrub it was like some great obscene flower scarlet in the heart with trailing ends and parts which still moved until pounced on and clubbed or cut to death only finney was left and he was being stripped naked and bound trussed to a pole being saved for something even more horrific a marine said hoarsely i might hit him with a long shot sir no herrick turned away all these men to save one he would not expect it even of himself but it was hard to form the word he said time enough when they discover whats happened to the rest of us herrick rolled on to his back and stared at the sky he remembered with stark clarity when he had been a small boy and had been playing with his friend on the bank of the medway he had thrown a stone through the rushes meant as a joke like those they always played on each other it had hit his friend in the eye nearly blinding him herrick had screwed up his face willing that it was a dream that when he looked again it would all be clean and as before but then as now it was real if he looked the litter of corpses and torn limbs would still be there and the schooner would be gone prideaux was saying to his corporal put all the muskets together and then inspect the powder and shot the wounded can do the loading right sir attentive even now pyper said quietly will it be soon sir herrick did not look at him but watched a bird with scimitarshaped wings circling far far up against the washedout blue sky i expect so he added but no quarter nor do we surrender i see then herrick did turn his head to look at the midshipman do you see the boy who had started to become a man did he not ask why he was to die here of all places someone said the buggers are searchin about on tother side of th hill sir prideaux sounded irritable yes well it wont take a foxhound to pick up our trail will it herrick raised himself carefully amongst the prickly gorse and looked at the sea the schooner was sternon now standing well out from the landing place we could light a fire make an explosion but it would only bring down the savages that bit sooner anyway the schooner would not dare to come inshore he looked again at the schooner his mind suddenly clear the wind it had shifted quite a lot he stared at the hillside bushes and scrub and tried to fathom its direction prideaux asked what is it he was trying to sound disinterested as he always did and the fact he was not succeeding gave herrick sudden desperate hope he replied quietly the captain will come to look for us the wind it could make a world of difference give him a days start he looked at pypers strained features a whole day if we can just hang on here the marine who had been speared in the leg said huskily that would be fine sir his friend grinned wot did i tell ee billyboy prideaux scowled dont raise their hopes the wind what is that time how do we know anything herrick looked at him hell come mark me captain prideaux he looked away he must bolitho sat in the cabin going over his written log while a lantern swung back and forth above his head all yesterday and through the long night they had sailed with as much canvas as they could carry no one had spoken of risk or caution this time and he had seen men look away when his gaze had passed over them he glanced at the stern windows realizing with surprise they were already paling with the dawn he felt suddenly empty and dispirited noddall would have reminded him hovered around the desk he thought of all the faceless bundles sewn in hammocks which he had watched dropped overboard it could have been ten times worse but it did not help at all to remind himself wayth captain of the maintop sloper of the carpenters crew and who had done more than anyone to make the newly built jolly boat a success marine kisbee maintop old fisher able seaman william goalen second quartermaster noddall cabin servant and too many others beside in all fifteen had been killed and as many more wounded and for what death for some discharge for others and advancement for the lucky ones who filled their shoes he rubbed his eyes again trying to quell the ache in his mind there was a tap at the door and midshipman swift stepped into the cabin mr keens respects sir and we have just sighted a light to the northrd a ship he cursed himself for passing back the information as a question he stood up and placed the thick book inside his desk ill come up he had been wrong about herrick too it seemed the light must be the schooner although even with the shift of wind it seemed strange she had reached this far he thought about the wind and how they had cursed it so often in the past when lakey had told him of the sudden change he had found it hard to conceal his emotion from him on the quarterdeck the air was almost chill after the heat of the days and the stuffy restriction below a quick glance at the compass bowl and another at the flapping mainsail and driver told him the wind was holding as before and the ship was steering to the north with the island hidden somewhere on the larboard beam but for the wind they would have taken perhaps two days even more to beat back and forth to fight round the southern end of the island before returning to search for the schooners landing place he took a glass from swift knowing there were more than the duty watch on deck watching and waiting he saw the vessel straight away and even in the few moments since swift had reported it to him the light had strengthened so that he could make out a darker smudge which would be the schooners big driver how roundly the dawn comes up that was mackay the first quartermaster he sounded calm enough glad perhaps that his mate goalen and not himself had gone several hundred fathoms down in a hammock with a roundshot at his feet to speed the journey aye lakeys coat rustled against the compass as he moved about in the gloom like a restless dog nother ten minutes itll be blinding your eyeballs out true to the sailing masters prediction the daylight swept across the islands like the opening of a vivid curtain bolitho watched the schooner sensed the uncertainty as she tacked hesitated as if to turn away from the masthead where keen had sent him midshipman swift shouted no sign of red coats aboard sir blazes borlase had appeared now they must have left them there or he did not finish signal her to heave to bolithos voice cut through the speculation like a rapier stand by the quarter boat mr borlase bolitho watched the wave troughs changing from black to deep blue from dark menace to friendly deception he felt his anxiety giving way to unreasoning impatience and pass the word for mr brass tell him to prepare a bowchaser directly if the schooner does not respond i want a ball as near to her bilge as makes no difference by the companionway his thick arms folded allday listened and watched bolithos words having effect he saw jack brass the tempests gunner bustling forward with his mates and knew he too was well aware of bolithos mood shes heavin to sir very well bolitho let his thoughts carry him along we will fall down on her to within hail it will save time he looked at allday we will probably need the launch select the best hands you can he slitted his eyes to watch the rolling schooner as the frigate ran down on her empty or all but perhaps there was no more time that would make the defeat even more complete an acceptance of it impossible he looked at the quarterdeck rail remembering herrick he said harshly see that the people are well armed tell sergeant quare to lower two swivels into the launch and provide some good marksmen for the quarter boat as well like extensions they were moving from him acting on his wishes his ideas the schooner was much nearer now he lowered his telescope and said give them a hail mr keen he had seen the schooners master a great hulk of a man probably born of mixed blood right here in the islands keens voice reechoed across the water distorted by his speaking trumpet bolitho listened to the hesitant replies some barely understandable but the main message was clear enough the schooner had left without herricks party they might be dead as were all the militia butchered bolitho glanced at the men around him with the company already depleted by death and wounds by herricks landing party and marines tempest was getting more and more shorthanded he made up his mind it could not be helped he said tell the schooner to stand by to receive a boarding party he looked at borlase you will take command here until our return he snapped well come along let us be about it midshipman pyper said huskily i think we may be safe sir the sun was beating down on the saucershaped depression where herrick had gathered his party of seamen and marines he felt as dry as the sand and rock which burned through his clothing like hot metal and he had to force himself almost physically not to think of water there was precious little left and what there was was needed by the wounded especially watt one of the marines he had been hit in the shoulder either by a dart or spear nobody was sure or could remember he was lying with his head on the marine corporals knees gasping and drawing his legs up in deep convulsions of pain herrick said too soon to know yet he listened to the marines groans he was in agony maybe his wound had been deliberately poisoned he had heard of such things darts which left men or animals to die in dreadful suffering once the corporal had tried to adjust the crude bandage and herrick had been forced to look away from the wound in spite of all he had seen during his years at sea like a ripening obscene fruit prideaux sat with his boots outthrust dragging a stalk of sunbleached grass through his teeth his eyes were distant as he said weve got to keep watt quiet those devils are not far off i know it in my bones wattll raise an attack if were not careful herrick looked away prideaux was doing it again passing an idea like a hint leaving it for him to decide he said corporal morrison give the man some water the corporal shook his head not much in the flasks sir he shrugged and held one to the mans lips still i suppose a seaman on lookout called sharply some of em comin now sir the dull acceptance and lethargy vanished as they struggled to their allotted places seizing weapons screwing up their faces herrick watched as a file of natives came down a narrow gully on the opposite side of the hill and padded swiftly towards the sea they did not hesitate even to glance at the carnage which lay rotting in the sun but hurried on into the shallows by the rocks where herrick and his men had come ashore pyper said theyre looking at the longboat herrick nodded pyper was right he remembered then seeing the village boats all ablaze their only way to reach other islands to trade to seek revenge or to escape they must have been back to their village that means the pirates have gone probably had a boat standing offshore all the while herrick could not disguise his bitterness while tempest had tacked round the point and into a trap and he and his men had fought for their lives the pirates had carried on with their welllaid plan they might have failed to sink the frigate but they had shown what they could do with a mere handful of men he saw the longboat lifting sluggishly in the surf the water sliding across her bottom boards as the natives hauled and guided it into the shallows herrick tried not to listen to another man being given water he watched the natives knowing he would have to do something and soon the night had been friendly enough apart from the insects after the horror of the day the systematic massacre of finneys men and their own desperate plight all they had wanted to do was fall into exhausted sleep but like the memory of his boyhood friend on the bank of the medway the menace and danger were still waiting with the dawn there were no more rations and certainly not enough water for another day if they left the depression to search for a pool they would be seen or heard prideaux had remarked during the night tempestll not come the captainll think were dead we will be too herrick had turned on him with such force he had said very little since but when their eyes had met in the first light after they had searched an empty sea herrick had seen the same rebuke the same contempt he heard the corporal say its all gone mate see empty mother of god the pain help me herrick pushed them from his mind watching the busy figures in and around the beached longboat he thought he saw water through the starboard side between the planks that was not too bad not like being stove in from the bottom he rolled over and propped himself on one elbow ignoring the rawness of his throat the cracks in his lips he had started up from that beach yesterday morning with twentynine others excluding finneys men five had been killed and four were badly wounded hardly anyone had survived without a cut or bruise to remind him of their struggle he took each man in turn some were almost finished barely able to hold a musket others lay holloweyed and desperate watching the sky over the rim of their heated prison pyper looked weary but he was young as strong as a lion prideaux he of all of them seemed unchanged herrick sighed and shifted his attention to the boat it was half a cable over open land if they waited until night it was likely the boat would be gone especially if the natives wanted it to raise an alarm in other islands he pictured them running down the slope the satisfaction of being the ones with the upper hand as they shot and cut their way to the boat then he thought of the others too sick or wounded to move on their own prideaux said very quietly we could rush the boat and make certain that none of those savages is left alive how many are there ten at most he did not drop his eyes as herrick faced him the rest of the village would think wed run for it once in safety we could send help for the wounded herrick studied him loathing him for reading his mind for his casual dismissal of those who were dying behind him for being able to think clearly and without sentiment he replied hotly or we could kill them ourselves eh make it easier all round prideaux said oh for gods sake herrick felt suddenly lightheaded wild he turned towards the others and said now lads this is what i intend when he began he found he could not stop well wait a mite longer until theyve done some repairs on our boat he felt a lump in his throat as the marine with the spear wound tried to grin at his feeble joke then well go together this last word seemed to hang above all of them herrick continued half of us will fight the others will help the injured he tried not to picture that long naked slope half a cable one hundred desperate yards what then sir it was the corporal well head for the nearest island where we can take stock get some he tried not to lick his parched lips water pyper said theyre moving the boat again sir they peered over the rim and herrick saw the boat was riding up and down in the surf while three of the natives worked inside and the rest steadied it as best they could while the search for leaks went on they must need the boat more urgently than i thought now that he had made some sort of decision herrick felt better he had no idea how many of them would be able to get away but anything could be faced if the only alternative was being rounded up and slaughtered like beasts damn prideaux scrambled up beside one of his men who was pointing inland another party was coming from the direction of the village and there were many more this time prideaux looked at herrick he said nothing but it was as clear in his eyes as if he had this is our only chance herrick stood up collect your weapons easy lads he examined his own pistols and loosened his sword thinking of bolitho of all those other times corporal select the best marksmen he looked at pyper stay with corporal morrison and make sure he leaves some fit men to carry the wounded he gripped his wrist weve not much time herricks mind was cringing from the swiftness of events he tried to concentrate on the boat the distance from it if they held off the newcomers the wounded and their helpers would be killed by the men on the beach if they charged down and attacked them now the wounded would be left behind he looked at prideauxs thin features well youre the marine what should i do prideaux eyed him with surprise attack now leave two sharpshooters with the wounded when weve taken the boat the rest of us can cover their retreat the others from the village will make perfect targets as they come down the slope his lips twisted in a brief smile that is how a marine would do it herrick rubbed his chin makes sense he looked at pyper all of them ready lads he glanced at the glittering bayonets the crossbelts of powder and shot the extra muskets loaded and slung on anyone with a shoulder to spare he drew his sword and saw there was a dried bloodstain on it follow me it was at that moment as two of the men hoisted the marine watt that he gave a terrible scream of agony it seemed to strike everyone motionless even the natives in and around the boat stood stockstill their eyes white as they stared up the hillside a man called god the wound is broken sir watt screamed again kicking as the pain tore through him there was a crack and herrick saw watts head jerk back from the corporals fist morrison gasped sorry matey but weve work to do prideaux shouted charge and the handful of marines ran down the slope yelling enough for a full platoon herrick pyper and two seamen went with them eyes blind to everything but the boat and the startled scattering figures spears were seized and hurled blindly and one of the seamen fell gasping on the sand a broken shaft sticking from his chest then they were up to them and the frantic anger of their attack almost carried them straight into the surf pistols banged and bayonets lunged through the powder smoke in a confusion of killing and fury three of the natives ran along the beach but one fell to a marines musket the rest lay either dead or wounded around the boat herrick yelled here they come lads he waved his sword towards the lurching group of wounded and the two marines who had fallen back to give them some cover he watched as prideauxs men began to fire over their heads towards the rushing tide of figures at the top of the slope again the torrent of stones and spears the air rent with voices then he and pyper and the remaining seaman clambered around the boats stern and thrust at it with all their strength feeling it fighting back thrusting at them with each lift of breakers around the rocks its no use pyper was almost sobbing cant do ittoo heavy herrick snarled push harder damn your eyes he shouted at prideaux two more men as he twisted round the water swirling and clinging to his clothing he saw the little procession staggering past the body of the speared seaman they were too slow and the nearest natives were less than fifty yards behind them prideaux called man the boat its our only chance well all die if we wait here herrick waded ashore his sword above his head he felt half mad with anger and disappointment but he would not leave those men behind go to the devil he ran towards the corporal who was carrying watt bodily over his shoulders like a sack the others including the one with the wounded leg hobbled and hopped after them herrick saw that two men had fallen together further away and before they could get up again were pounced upon and brutally hacked to pieces despite the sporadic musketfire from the beach herrick ran through the reeling men not knowing what he hoped to do the two marines at the rear saw him and yelled no good done for one of them threw away his empty pouches and raised his bayoneted musket come on then yew bastards lets be avin yew the other fell choking on blood as a spear hissed out of the sun herrick saw it and heard it even watched their faces as they came towards him he could not see the boat now not that it mattered nobody would escape he moved his sword slowly seeing the crouching figures fanning out on either side he could sense the power of them smell them the sun was almost in his eyes so that there was no shadow for him or the solitary marine it was as if they were already dead to one side of the slowly advancing crowd he saw a spear raise itself carefully and deliberately now the bang when it came was almost deafening in the terrible silence herrick heard startled shouts from behind and then as if torn from a mans heart a strangled cheer herrick said harshly stand still man dont look round the marine blinded by sweat his musket and bayonet as rigid as before said from one corner of his mouth im with yew sir slowly uncertainly at first the front rank of natives began to move back when another bang shook the air they retreated bounding up the slope seemingly without effort then and only then did herrick turn just inside the rocks was tempests launch a smoking swivel mounted in the bows where the canister had struck herrick neither knew or cared it must have gone into the sky for had it been aimed at the slope it would have killed more of his men than their attackers perhaps the sound and the sight of the long launch with the frigates quarter boat coming up astern had been enough herrick crossed to the marine and clapped him on the shoulder that was bravely done together they walked towards the surf where men were leaping from the boats to help and support the others through the shallows bolitho stood quite still on the sand his hands at his sides as he waited for his friend to reach him but in his mind he could still see herrick as moments earlier the launch had thrust through the rocks after being towed at full speed by the schooner herrick sword in hand his back to the sea as he stood with one marine to face a mob and certain death it was something he would never forget nor would he wish to he clasped herricks arms and said simply you have too much courage thomas herrick tried to grin but the strain prevented it you came sir said you would his head dropped told them bolitho watched unable to help shocked to see herricks shoulders shaking i did this to him he looked round at the beach now empty but for the dead for nothing pyper came up the beach and hesitated all inboard sir bolitho said to herrick come thomas there is nothing we can do now they passed the abandoned longboat and it was then that herrick seemed to come out of his shock the boat had begun to sink again the primitive repairs already leaking to the surf s rough motion he said damn thing would have sunk anyway he looked at bolitho steadily it would have served bloody prideaux right bolitho was the last to climb into the launch he paused the sea surging around his waist slapping the old sword against his thigh one day he would meet with tuke no ruse no trick would save him then he allowed allday to haul him over the gunwale but this time it had been a defeat make the best of it james raymond ignored the seamen who were spreading awnings above the quarterdeck while others swayed out boats for lowering alongside he had come out to tempest within minutes of her dropping anchor in the mushroomshaped bay and was almost beside himself with anger bolitho watched him grimly seeing his efforts to build a picture for himself of what had happened not that it was difficult especially for one who travelled so far and so often as raymond i just will not accept it i cannot believe that a kings ship a thirtysixgun frigate to boot could be thwarted and almost sunk by a damned pirate there was no point in arguing bolitho thought wearily there was enough to do without trying to change raymonds opinion one he had been holding and preparing for some while probably since his lookout had first sighted the returning vessels the little schooner had hurried on ahead to prepare him then tempests silhouette her missing topgallant mast and yard which had left such an obvious gap to mar her beauty would have added more fuel to the fire he saw isaac toby the carpenter his owllike face almost as red as his familiar waistcoat rolling amongst his depleted crew pointing at damage marking a splintered timber with his knife or indicating something which needed immediate restoration he would be missing his mate sloper bolitho thought some of the more badly wounded had already been ferried ashore the rest had to work all the harder especially now he looked across the shining water knowing raymond had stopped his ranting to study his reactions poised above her reflection like one of a matched pair the french frigate narval swung easily at her cable her awnings were spread and there were boats in the water while a solitary cutter pulled around her on guard duty raymond snapped you may well look yonder captain you turn up your nose at a frenchman because his ideas are different from your own how dyou think i feel eh a representative of king george and a country which supposedly supports the worlds finest navy is made to ask for the service of aforeign manofwar god damn it bolitho if the emperor of china offered me a ship id take her and doublequick believe me he moved about the deck his shoes catching on splinters always the same i am expected to perform miracles opposed by hidebound fools and pigheaded soldiers he glared at him oblivious to the heat sailors too it seems herrick came aft and touched his hat all the wounded listed by the surgeon have gone ashore sir ive ordered the boatswain to begin work on the topgallant raymond interrupted sharply quite right too make her nice and pretty again so that mathias tuke can have another game with her bolitho jerked his head and herrick withdrew he said mr herrick does not warrant that sir he is a brave man and an excellent officer some good men died one just this morning it had been the wretched marine watt gwyther had said he was surprised he had survived that far with such a wound i command this ship and i am responsible he looked at raymond squarely tuke is cleverer than i thought perhaps i only saw what i wanted to see but either way it was my decision he dropped his voice as keen hurried past it will only make things worse if we allow personal feelings to become involved raymond replied i had not forgotten who commands the tempest and i shall make sure you get a full report when i send my despatches to london and you do not have to tell me how to behave i have made my feelings towards you quite clear i think so it is quite useless to start asking favours now that your stars are less agreeable eh is that all sir bolitho clenched his fists behind him realizing how neatly he had been goaded into the trap maybe he was just too tired or like le chaumareys was losing his grip on reality for the present raymond mopped his face i will be calling a conference shortly to plan a campaign against tuke and any of his associates if in the process we can recapture the french prisoner for de barras then all well and good under the circumstances it is the very least we can do he sounded less sure as he added de barras has the authority of his country and the means to execute his orders we are not at war and he at least seems to know what he is about bolitho thought of the cabin the rich carpets and the frightened boy with the wine above all de barrass indifference to brutal and sadistic treatment of his own men he made himself ask how did hardacre take the news raymond shrugged i am not certain which he grieves over the most his precious natives who killed his men as well as some of yours or the fact that he no longer has his own army to crow over ill be satisfied only when i get some proper soldiers here i cannot abide amateurs in any walk of life raymond moved to the gangway and paused looking down into his boat there will be a brig from england shortly she will call here on passage to new south wales she can take the guards back to sydney where they came from then there will be no excuse for not sending me some troops despite his hatred for the man his hurt over what had happened bolitho sensed an inner warning the burning village and what herrick had told him about the natives of north island made a mockery of hardacres hopes revenge for what tuke had done to them had killed finneys militiamen and had nearly done for herrick the old hatreds could soon come alive again and turn island against island tribe against tribe one of the most noticeable things he had seen when tempest had reentered the bay had been the absence of canoes and swimming villagers the same girls and young men had been there well enough on the beaches and below the thick green fronds but they had kept their distance as if fearful that by coming too close they would gain some infection and lose their simplicity and safety which they must have come to take for granted and until they arrive sir he already knew the answer the responsibility will be yours captain hardacre has enough men still to take care of the settlement the protection of its progress i am giving to you and will be saying as much in my report it is a heavy responsibility he looked round his eyes almost hidden in shadow i will be interested to watch your er success then with a curt nod to the side party he lowered himself into his boat herrick walked across the deck and said bluntly i could live very well without that one bolitho shaded his eyes to peer at the settlement with its palisades and rough blockhouses she might be watching the ship knowing of her husbands eagerness to get out to tempest if only to add weight to the captains burden apart from the lack of laughing islanders things seemed much as before the little schooner was already being loaded with bales and baskets and he guessed she would soon be sailing to other islands nearby to keep trade moving to regain confidence hardacre was taking a great chance but then he had done that for a long time now he said i want this ship ready for sea as quickly as possible work the hands while theres daylight and make sure you put a picket ashore if youre sending anyone for fruit or water herrick nodded i couldnt help but hear the last thing he said sir i think its damned unfair to hand you the extra role of guarding over the convicts bolitho smiled gravely the convicts will be no trouble i doubt if theyll want to stray far from the settlement he turned away to watch new cordage being hauled aloft however we do what we are paid to do he walked towards the companionway tell noddall he stopped short herrick looked at him sir nothing id forgotten he vanished below herrick walked slowly to the nettings and looked at the inviting beaches inviting he thought of the great bloody stain on the sand the human fragments rotting in the sun and shivered just to see st anthonys light in the english channel once more to walk beside the medway to smell the fruit trees and the farms he would not want to stay ashore too long but to know he would be able to see it again borlase joined him now sir about the promotion to quartermaster ive a good man in my division herrick moved his shoulders inside his coat like getting back into things men had to be moved a shortage of hands in one watch must be remedied from the other the whole watchbill would have to be rearranged with the unfit men put to work where they would find it less of a burden but still do a good job someone would have to be found to replace poor noddall he turned as the gangway sentry called jolly boat returnin borlase said harshly the pickets are bringing off the two who deserted they should be flogged senseless after what weve been through i think not herrick watched the approaching boat the two figures sitting dejectedly between some marines we need every fit man and by god are those two going to work he saw jury coming towards him with one of his petty officers and the carpenters red waistcoat looming from the opposite direction questions things wanted things destroyed he smiled all in a days work for any first lieutenant it was a mixed gathering raymond very composed and unsmiling sitting at a large locally carved table john hardacre his bushy hair and beard his strange loosely folded robe very much at odds with raymonds neat elegance seated at the far end of the room one leg negligently crossed over the other narvals captain the comte de barras with his senior lieutenant whose name was vicariot made bright figures of blue and white while de barrass curled wig added another touch of unreality both the frenchmen were so smartly attired that bolitho felt crumpled by comparison and when he glanced at herrick he guessed he was thinking much the same a scarfaced overseer from the settlement a halfcaste called kimura who looked more like an executioner than anything else completed the gathering bolitho tried to sit easily in the cane chair wondering how this place would have changed in a year or so a big wellbuilt house and a thriving community of traders and administrators clerks and managers experts on this and that from england or would it be like others he had seen in the great south sea overgrown again by the jungle deserted even by the natives who had once come to depend upon such outposts through a long window wellscreened with plaited mats he could see the end of the bay a dark green point of land with the sea rising beyond it like water penned in a dyke tempest had been at anchor for five days days of ceaseless work and short tempers three men had been flogged over incidents which at any other time would have been trivial enough to be overcome bolitho detested unnecessary punishment just as he despised those who preferred it to righting the wrongs it had been made worse by the nearness of the french ship the faces lining her gangways to watch the bitter ritual of punishment under the lash bolitho had been ashore several times to report progress to raymond to consult with the corps guards who had come with the convicts from sydney on the matter of security also he had had plenty of opportunity to meet the deported prisoners for himself even after all the long months awaiting trial and making the voyage to the opposite end of the earth they seemed dazed but they looked well enough and were not so cowed as when bolitho had seen some of them aboard the eurotas he wondered about the eurotas why she could be spared merely to lie idle in the bay accommodation ship she was not and apart from her depleted company she appeared to provide nothing but a possible way of escape if things went wrong bolitho knew that herrick had been across to her on two occasions to try and obtain men for tempest he had by means which bolitho could only guess at procured six new hands all seamen no matter what it had cost him in patience and humour they were worth their weight in gold no doubt like all the other hints and promises in sydney somebody would eventually arrive with a new warrant to work the eurotas in the governments service and she would sail away he tried to concentrate on the men around him to fit them into the puzzle but it was too easy to think instead of viola raymond he had seen her once only since his return while her husband had been aboard the french frigate enjoying de barrass hospitality just for an hour he had stayed with her but not alone to save her as best he could from further gossip bolitho had accompanied her to the new clearing where some of the convicts were building a line of huts for their own occupation her silent maid the only female deportee to be allowed in the levu islands had followed them looking neither right nor left as they had passed amongst the amateur builders he had said there is a brig coming from england soon he had looked at her the way she held her head the rich hair shining beneath her large straw hat if anything she was lovelier than ever if you insist on going in her to sydney her master cannot refuse and neither can your husband you obeyed his wishes the gesture was made nothing can be gained by your staying and ill not let him stand by and watch you endanger your health it was then that she had stopped and had taken his hands pulling him round to face her you dont understand at all do you richard she had smiled up at him her eyes shining what if i did as you suggest take the next available ship to england pack my belongings and go to your house in falmouth she had shaken her head before he could protest i love you dearly and because of that i want to stay i need to be here to be hundreds and hundreds of miles away wondering fearing for you and waiting for your ship to anchor would only add to my torment here at least i can see you touch you be near to you i know that if i allow us to be parted again it will be forever if you are ordered to new south wales to india to the ends of the globe then i will go to your falmouth and gladly she had shaken her head again but leave you at jamess hands never bolitho thought about it as he watched raymonds fingers leafing through his official papers she had been right he had not understood all he had considered had been her safety her freedom from raymond but love pushed caution aside and made a fool of prudence and now gentlemen raymond looked up this is what i believe to be our next objective for myself the expansion and protection of this settlement and its trade routes is important he smiled at de barrass finely chiselled features and you msieu le comte will wish to recover your renegade and return to your homeland as originally intended de barras nodded slightly his lips pursed cautious unwilling to show his hand too soon raymond looked at hardacre i know how you feel about what has happened but i imagine it has been coming for months those who live in the midst of a problem are often the last to be aware it exists a gentle smile however we are here and whether they like it or not a few natives are going to have to put up with us this is not one of john companys concessions now nor a private enterprise these islands are claimed by the crown and are entitled to its protection bolitho watched de barras that last part had made him glance quickly at his lieutenant raymond was making his own position very clear just supposing that the french might also have their eyes on the levu islands then he looked at herrick arms folded blue eyes on the opposite wall he was feeling out of place uncomfortable he was probably thinking of the ship repairs done and all that still awaited his attention for a moment he saw herrick again on that terrible beach sword in hand his face towards a pack of angry bloodmaddened natives a minuteno seconds longer and that chair would now be empty raymond went on smoothly with the assistance of the narval and her excellent crew i trust that all our objectives can be gained it is in our interest that the pirate mathias tuke and his men be excised and punished without further loss to us bolitho knew de barras was looking across at him to remind him no doubt of their other meeting they were almost his exact words raymond said in return we will do all we can to recapture the comtes prisoner he looked directly at the french captain i am certain that when i send my despatches to london to announce our success they will be equally well received in paris eh msieu le comte de barras stretched his legs and smiled i understand and so do i bolitho would not have believed it had he not been present de barras must have entertained raymond very well there was even a goodly supply of wine being carried into the settlement by some of his seamen as bolitho had arrived and yet like all tyrants de barras was still open for compliments ready to accept raymonds hint of a word in high places which could eventually benefit him in france if as bolitho suspected de barrashad been given his lonely command to keep him out of his own country until some trouble had been forgotten then raymonds casual offer would mean even more the door opened slightly and one of hardacres servant girlspeered inside obviously overwhelmed by the presence of so much authority raymond snapped see what she wants the halfcaste kimura muttered something and then said the chief is here he gestured to the window he waits in the yard let him wait raymond seemed ruffled by the interruption hardacre said tinah is a great chief mr raymond a good friend it would be wrong to treat him in this fashion oh very well you go to him if you must raymond eyed him coldly but none of your promises dyou hear hardacre strode out his big sandals flapping on the rush mats i hear ah well raymond realized the overseer was still present you can leave too he smiled it is hard for them to appreciate progress the smile disappeared the youth who came from north island with the news of the attack has not been found bolitho said he probably thought he would be seen as a traitor sir but it does prove that even on north island there are some who trust hardacre enough to come to him for aid maybe but the damage is done now tuke attacked your ship but that was the deed of a felon and a murderer those friendly natives tried to kill your people and butchered most of hardacres militia that in view of what you were trying to do at the time is unforgivable they did not understand any difference between tukes men and my own and why should they bolitho knew it was useless well they will now damn them raymond swung round in his chair as hardacre came in again what is it hardacre replied the chief says that his people are ashamed of what happened to my men he looked at bolitho and yours but the chief of north island was killed at the first attack less stable heads are in charge there now it has never been the most friendly of islands and now because their boats are burned they will be in hard times our people here are afraid to visit them raymond sniffed im not surprised and what did you promise them a ship full of fat pigs and new boats de barras chuckled i promised that you would give them help sir leave them unpunished you did what hardacre went on stubbornly in return they will bring news of tuke do all they can to help in his capture they have no cause to like him and every reason to fear your reprisals raymond dabbed his mouth help in his capture you say he looked at de barras well now he made up his mind captain bolitho go and speak with this er chief tell him you were a personal friend of captain cook anything you like but get him to talk with you hardacre followed bolitho out of the room and stood outside the door breathing heavily the planks creaking beneath his weight he is a great chief not an idiot child he turned to bolitho i could kill that man with less emotion than crushing a beetle bolitho went down the wooden stairway and towards the glaring sunlight in the middle of the compound yard on a small ornate stool the chief was sitting very erect and still his dark eyes fixed on the empty gibbet he was younger than bolitho had expected with thick bushy hair and a small beard his garment was of green cloth embroidered with coloured beads and around his neck he wore a simple loop of gold wire his eyes shifted to bolitho as hardacre said tinah this is the english captain from the ship he hesitated before adding a good man tinahs eyes had not flickered or moved from bolithos face during the introduction but now he smiled suddenly and disarmingly bolitho asked what you have told mr hardacre about the pirates is it possible you can find them for us everything is possible his voice was deep his accent halting but bolitho doubted if anyone could have looked more like a chief we have peace now we wish to keep it captain your men were attacked but what would your heart say if you saw your women being used and then killed your home burned before your eyes would you stop to say these men are good those are bad he raised a thick intricately carved rod and drove it hard into the ground no you say kill herrick came out of the building and looked at the seated chief and his small group of retainers who were waiting by the gates of the compound he said pardon the interruption sir but mr hardacre is wanted upstairs he smiled i almost said on deck sir it seems the gallant french captain wishes to enquire about water and provisions on the surrounding islands hardacre nodded grimly ill go it is vital that his ship enters each anchorage in a peaceful manner i dont want these people to see him as an enemy he added no matter what i think herrick looked hard at the chief there was a man taken prisoner his name was finney i knew finney tinah glanced at the building i did not tell my friend how he died just that he did die herrick asked harshly can you tell me if your captain wishes the chief sighed north island is not like this one finney was tied to a stake and covered with clay taken from the stream his breath was kept for him by a reed through the clay his eyes were fixed on herricks then his body was held over a very slow fire herrick turned away revolted baked alive for gods sake tinah shrugged my father told me of such things but in north island herrick nodded i know they are different from your people the chief watched herrick as he returned to the building that must be the strong one the man who stood alone he nodded yes i have heard of him hardacre came back and said it is done he looked at bolitho if thats all captain bolitho touched his hat yes hardacre and the chief obviously had things to discuss a rift to heal before it could destroy both of them in raymonds room again he found the others taking wine the other door opened and a servant stood aside to allow viola raymond to enter raymond introduced her to de barras who bowed from the waist and kissed her hand saying my dear lady i was so grieved that you did not come to my humble quarters with your husband the resident she replied thank youmsieu le comte perhaps another time the french lieutenant bowed stiffly and mumbled something in very broken english viola looked at herrick and held out her hand why lieutenant it is so nice to see you again herricks tan hid what must have been a blush er thank you maam its good to see you too indeed it is she crossed to bolitho and offered her hand captain bolitho touched her fingers with his lips mrs raymond their eyes met and he felt the gentle pressure of her fingers on his as she moved away to speak with the servant de barras walked to bolithos side and said softly ah now i think i know why she did not come to my ship oui he returned to his lieutenant laughing quietly to himself herrick whispered did you hear that sir impudent dog he turned his back to the others but you see how it goes sir you must take care bolitho looked past him watching her hair lying across her shoulders take care herrick did not know what it was like to stand meekly by and watch the one you loved so dearly held at arms length the only bright piece of news had been that brought by the young chief tinah if they could run the pirates to earth and destroy their power once and for all there was the very real possibility that tempest would be ordered home to england and then herrick watched his captain sadly it was hopeless it was like telling a bull not to charge a cat not to chase mice he saw a table being prepared in the adjoining room and counted the chairs well we might as well make the best of it while it lasts he decided the worst enemy the french frigate weighed and put to sea two days after the conference in raymonds spartan headquarters her departure seemed to restore some of the readily offered hospitality from the islanders and it was rare not to find some of them on tempests deck or alongside in their swiftmoving canoes bartering bringing gifts or merely watching the hands at work on the dwindling list of repairs it all helped to ease the tension the islanders had no cause to fear or dislike the french sailors and in fact they had had no opportunity of meeting many of them only small parties had gone ashore to gather fuel or supplies each escorted by heavily armed men bolitho had decided that despite or because of their simple standards and judgements the islanders had sensed the oppression aboard the narval as he had done and not understanding it had rejected it life aboard tempest was hard enough especially at anchor in a sheltered bay with the sun seeming to grow hotter each hour to add to the discomfort but in the dog watches it was rare not to hear the scrape of a shantymans fiddle or the slap of bare feet as offwatch seamen took part in one of their ritual hornpipes from the frenchman they had heard nothing just the chime of a watchbell the occasional order being piped between decks cowed humiliated the ability to seize even the smallest enjoyment had been crushed out of them with narval gone from the bay bolitho soon discovered that raymond intended to keep his word on the matter of responsibility when not being employed aboard tempests specialists like the carpenter and the cooper the sailmaker and the boatswain would be required on the island using their skills to help with the modest but much needed building programme both of huts and the blockhouses to defend them the surgeon too was more on land than in his sickbay tending to the wounded and the rarer illnesses amongst the villagers it was an arrangement which suited gwyther very well bolitho knew and when he returned to the ship he rarely appeared without some tropical find a violently coloured plant or some strangelooking fruit captain prideaux attended to the siting of the new blockhouses despite the obvious resentment of the two corps officers when they had protested to him he had snapped you keep telling me that this or that is not your job that you should not have been sent here by the governor of new south wales anyway and i am heartily sick of it in a kings ship you have to be ready to attempt anything no matter how you may feel about it one of them had replied hotly you insult us sir prideaux had looked almost happy then i will give satisfaction to both of you if need be to his disappointment they had retired with some haste as he had walked through the village or down along the glistening beach bolitho had wondered what narval was doing de barras had promised to make a long patrol around north island and on to the next group to see and be seen if he was lucky enough to flush out one or more of tukes vessels he would certainly exploit the victory and press on with his search bolitho had enough to keep him occupied for most hours of every day in mounting heat he went about his duties with impassive determination knowing raymond was waiting to complain to criticize if he lowered his guard it was common enough for sea officers to do what he was doing even the commander of a modest sloopofwar or brig was expected to show his kings authority when need be as prideaux had hotly remarked no matter how you may feel about it but he felt vulnerable knowing she was never far from him and yet rarely able to meet her without raymond being present was raymond trying to pretend that everything was as before as far as she was concerned or was he merely enjoying bolithos dismay and want whenever they met and although he tried to tell himself he was being too protective he was worried for her health she spent some of her time accompanying the surgeon on his rounds and did not spare herself or share the attitude of the islanderswhen it bears heavy on you stop work lieutenant keen was employed in charge of the shore parties and bolitho had seen him more than once with a native girl of slender beauty who seemed to regard him as one of the gods in his turn keen watched her with an expression of one completely lost bolitho had found himself feeling depressed and envious of their blissful understanding by the end of the month herrick took him on a tour of inspection of the ship and bolitho shared some of his welljustified satisfaction under the hands of his craftsmen the cunning uses of wood and tar paint and hemp tempest showed little sign of the terrible moment when she had been snared and mauled in tukes welllaid trap later he reported as much to raymond who for once had little complaint to make nor did he offer his usual comparison with the efficient de barras instead he said i am uneasy about the brig from england it is common enough to be delayed sir it is a demanding passage around the horn raymond did not seem to bear him i feel deaf and blind here i get no messages from sydney and nobody brings me the support i need if i am to make anything of this place bolitho watched him guardedly so that was it raymond was feeling left out abandoned as he himself had done more than once over the past years he was saying i do not want another eurotas incident nor do i want another anything until i am ready here it is as i suspected i am always learning how misguided i have been to trust others that damned chief hardacres friend for instance where is the intelligence he promised eh tukes head in exchange for my leniency my weakness he thinks no doubt and hardacre mooning about his affairs like the mad monk himself he sank into a chair and stared at a halfempty wine bottle bolitho said i understand that the expected brig is the pigeon sir yes he looked at him suspiciously what of it i know her master or did the last time i heard of her whereabouts william tremayne he comes from my home town used to be in one of the falmouth packets hed never allow himself to be hoodwinked by tuke when youve been master of a packet had to sail alone through every sort of sea to the ends of the globe you must learn to fight off everything to stay alive raymond shifted uneasily i hope you are correct about him i would like to take my ship and patrol to the soueast of the group sir no raymond glared at him i need your presence here when i have heard from de barras or the brig i will know what to do until then i will trouble you to continue with your work he said it so vehemently that bolitho wondered what else was worrying him suppose for instance the king of spain has not withdrawn his claims to possessions and trading facilities eh for all we know there might be six spanish sailoftheline sweeping right through these waters he shook his head no youll remain at anchor bolitho left the room if only there was some way of getting word to commodore sayer in sydney not that he could do much it was strange when you thought about it three ships the hebrus sayers elderly sixtyfour tempest and now the overdue brig pigeon as unmatched as any vessels could be and yet each of their senior officers was a cornishman and each was known to the other as he reached the pier he saw hardacre striding from his schooner good youd better come too he sounded troubled angry tinah has news of the pirates and that other bloody madman de barras once more in raymonds room hardacre exploded did you know that de barras has been amongst the islands in the north acting like caesar canoes have been fired on and the whole area is smouldering like a tinderbarrel in gods name what were you thinking of to leave him the field to do as he pleases control yourself raymond sounded startled nevertheless how did you hear of all this at least i am still trusted by some of them his massive chest heaved painfully the chief sent word tukes anchorage is at rutara he jerked his head towards the ceiling the sacred island he looked at bolitho do you know it only from sparse detail aye hardacre strode this way and that his hands clasped as if in prayer it is a harsh place without much water apart from rain pools just the sort of hole that a man like tuke would use for a short while he sounded worried no native would dare land there raymond licked his lips well that is good news surely if we can trust on it trust hardacre looked at him with unmasked contempt it has cost tinah several of his men to get it and will probably turn some of the other islands against him for helping you raymond looked down at the table his fingers drumming on it loud in the sudden silence de barras will anchor off north island after he has carried out his search you can send your schooner to him forthwith i will write a despatch for his immediate attention she is the only vessel i have here at my disposal that is not my affair this is raymond eyed him coldly i can commandeer the schooner you know hardacre turned to the door beaten i will see the master now he slammed the door raymond breathed out very slowly well captain moments ago we were in the dark now if it is to be believed the news sounds promising very he gave a thin smile perhaps it is as well that the role of tukes executioner falls to the french if there are repercussions in high places we are in a stronger position i would like to go too sir if not instead of then with de barras you think he will be unable to deal with tuke because of your own rough handling is that it his smile broadened really you disappoint me to show your pique so openly it is none of those things sir he looked away seeing the man dangling from narvals stern dying as he had watched two ships would be better than one i respect tukes cunning just as i mistrust de barrass ability to contain his own brutality these islands could become a battleground because of him you had your chance captain bolitho the objectives are clearer cut now and i think de barras will be eager to fulfil my requirements when he reads the despatch i will send to him more promises raymond ignored it see that you are in readiness to weigh anchor when i need you the trap is closing around the pirate but we still have our work to do here if only that damned brig would come as bolitho turned to leave raymond added casually the eurotas what is your er report on her bolitho paused she is guarded by her own people and my boats pull round her after dark i would have been displeased to hear the contrary raymond tapped the table again no i was referring to her readiness for sea as ordered bolitho watched him trying to see through his prim severity as ready as my own command good that helps me to plan bolitho returned to the pier and watched his gig pulling towards him raymonds attitude over the transport was a mystery eurotas had no master and a depleted company if raymond imagined she could be used beyond an extreme emergency he was going to be disappointed unless he rubbed his chin thoughtfully unless he intended to transfer his papers and plans on board her and leave the settlement to hardacre could it be he was inwardly afraid of the unseen events i feel deaf and blind here sailors were used to relying on their own meagre resources but perhaps men like raymond trained and educated to ways of parliament and government could not survive without news and guidance bolitho awoke violently from a heavy sleep fighting aside his sheet as he tried to discover what had disturbed him then he saw a pair of eyes glowing in the gloom like pale lamps and he remembered that orlando the giant negro had been given the chance of acting as his servant it had apparently been alldays idea soon after noddalls death and as he was still going about his new duties bolitho assumed his coxswain was satisfied although with the amount of cursing and blaspheming he had heard he might have expected otherwise what is it man he struggled to sit up his practised mind taking in that the cot was steady and unmoving and only the normal sounds of a vessel at anchor penetrated the cabin it was stuffy almost airless and the effort of moving made the sweat trickle across his bare skin orlando bobbed his head and dragged bolithos sheet from the cot bowing to feel for his shoes allday loomed through the darkness boat alongside captain he peered at the negro mr raymond wants you ashore the master of the pigeon is with him it seems bolitho lowered his legs to the deck grappling with the news yesterday his hilltop lookout had reported the sight of a sail to the southeast within hours it was recognized as the overdue brig pigeon and once more bolitho had felt the excitement run through his ship like a fresh breeze news from home keeping a memory alive all things to all men some of the interest had transmitted itself to the settlement and fires had been lit to bring the heavy scent of woodsmoke and cooked meat to the secluded bay and then the wind had dropped and when darkness had swept over the islands the brig had anchored to await the safety of the dawn and a secure passage through the reefs he heard feet on deck the rattle of blocks as a boat was hoisted outboard that would be herricks doing making sure his captain had his proper gig and not one of hardacres scarred longboats he asked what is the time allday said morning watch has just been called captain he rubbed his chin the pigeons master must have been brought in by boat bolitho stared at him how easily allday got to the bones of it it had to be something very urgent to bring a brigs captain ashore after such a long and wearying voyage from england was it war with spain would tempest be ordered home he thought of it carefully matching his need against that of his training she would be safe in cornwall while he he swore as orlando jabbed his stomach accidentally with a massive elbow allday lit one of the lanterns and grinned thats the best of being mute captain you never have to apologize bolitho peered at his reflection in a mirror naked and tousled his hair black across his forehead he looked more like a vagrant than a captain but orlando bustled about him fetching lukewarm water from the galley and while allday got busy with soap and razor laid out bolithos clothing as instructed he did it far better than he should after so brief a training and bolitho suspected the negro had once served in some great estate or had been in a position to watch others attending their masters perhaps like his ability to speak his memory had been cut short with some terrible experience herrick came aft and tapped the door gigs ready sir he watched the little scene in the cabin i see that i need not have worried bolitho slipped into his clean shirt and allowed allday to fasten the neckcloth no more new information no herrick looked tired but the pigeon has brought some bad news i think the good always seems to drag its feet bolitho snatched up his hat we will see he hesitated allowing allday to hurry on ahead to his gig be ready thomas we may have to weigh at dawn aye he had obviously thought of little else there are only the shore parties unaccounted for young valentine keen will have to manage bolitho ran lightly up the companion ladder and felt the cooler air on his cheek just past four in the morning and the decks moist under his shoes he peered up at the crossed yards and thought the stars were already fading between the shrouds and neatly furled sails men stood aside and others doffed their hats as he lowered himself into the boat through open gunports he saw blurred faces the watch below trying to guess what was happening where he was going in such haste as the gig rushed across the smooth water he sat in silence watching the trailing phosphorescence around the dipping blades the surge of foam from the stem he saw the eurotas loom above the fastmoving boat and heard the harsh challenge boat ahoy and alldays prompt reply passing with so many rumours of unrest and trouble amongst the islands the ships sentries were more alert than usual failure to acknowledge a challenge might bring a blast of canister into the boat bolitho saw the lights beyond the pier and knew the whole settlement must be awake oars bolitho watched the pier rising above him and heard the clink of metal as the bowman caught a ringbolt with his boathook then he was up and striding along the pier marvelling that the place had become so familiar to him after so short a stay he passed one of prideauxs pickets the marines crossbelts gleaming white in the darkness through the wide gates and past the gibbet where he saw the overseer kimura waiting for him well he could smell the man sweat and the pale drink which tasted like rum and which would kill if taken in quantity kimura said in his strange voice they wait upstairs sir they not tell me nawthin after the gig and the rough track from the pier raymonds room seemed blinding with light raymond was standing in an anklelength satin coat his hair ruffled as he glared at the open door hardacre was sitting in a chair his fingers interlaced across his belly face very grim and beside a screened window the pigeons master made a shaggy contrast bringing the ocean right into the room william tremayne had changed little bolitho decided as he strode towards him and gripped his hand broad and short with spiky grey hair and eyes so dark they glittered in the lanterns like black coals tremayne grinned dick bolitho he wrung his hand his palm as rough as timber how are ye me andsome still a captain eh he chuckled the sound coming out of the depths to bring bolitho instant memories id thought you master o the kings navy at least by now raymond said sharply yes yes please sit down the pair of you the fond greetings can wait tremayne peered round under his chair his dark eyes innocent now what is it raymond seemed to be verging on an explosion tremayne looked at him sadly i am sorry sir i thought you were talking to a dog an was looking for him like raymond cleared his throat and bolitho saw that his hands were shaking badly he said the news is serious bolitho tremayne interrupted cheerfully aye tis that dick the whole of europe is quaking fit to bust open bolitho watched raymonds hands spain worse raymond seemed to have difficulty in forming his words there has been a bloody revolution in france the mobs have taken the country thrown the king and his queen into prison and they may already be dead even as we sit here according to these despatches thousands are being hunted down and beheaded in the streets anyone of noble birth or touching on the smallest authority is being taken and butchered our channel ports are crammed with refugees bolitho felt his mouth go dry revolution in france it did not seem possible there had been food riots and disorders but so had there been in england after the war he could well imagine the effect of the news at home amongst the foolish and unthinking there would be shortlived enjoyment at seeing an old enemy brought down in confusion and then would come the cold logic and understanding the might of france separated only by the english channel and with the rule of terror at its head while he had been worrying about tempests role or had taken the news from timor to sydney about the bounty mutiny the real world had been put to the torch raymond said it will mean war he looked at the wall as if expecting to see an enemy but nothing like the last one by comparison that will be remembered as a skirmish tremayne eyed him curiously and then said to bolitho it all started last july may have turned into something worse bnow but still i reckon itll seem like good news to the frenchie genin or however you pronounces it bolitho looked at raymond genin yes yves genin one of the minds behind the revolution yesterday he had a price on his head as far as we were concerned now bolitho stared at him is that the man de barras wants to capture he saw the uncertainty change to guilt you knew all this while and you knew genin was no felon but a man wanted for political reasons de barras entrusted me with the news certainly raymond tried to recover his composure i do not have to tell my subordinates everything anyway what is it to you if de barras succeeds in taking genin alive it is his affair he will be serving new masters himself when he returns to france tremayne said gruffly hed be a fool to go theyd have his head in a basket before he could say knife if half the things ive heard are true it must be like hades in paris hardacre spoke for the first time his voice very slow and level you do not understand a word do you mr raymond he stood up and walked to the nearest window and threw aside the blind captain bolitho can see it even i a landsman can understand but you his voice rose slightly you are so full of your own greed and importance you see nothing there has been a revolution in france it may even spread to england and god knows there are some who will never get justice without it but out here in the islands which you only see as steppingstones to your damned future what does it really mean he strode across to the table and thrust his beard at raymond well tell me damn your eyes bolitho said quietly easy mr hardacre he turned to the table had you told me that genin was the man who had found sanctuary with tuke i might have foreseen some of this now it may be too late if tuke knows about the revolution he will see genin not merely as a useful hostage but as a means to an end genin is no longer a fugitive he represents his country as much as you or i do ours raymond looked up at him his eyes glazed the narval is that it bolitho looked away sickened when narvals people are told of the uprising in france theyll tear de barras and his lieutenants to pieces tremayne said bluntly i reckon hell know bnow i heard of two french packets which rounded the horn within days o me the news will be across the whole ocean if im any judge bolitho tried to think without emotion all the sea fights the names of captains french and english alike which had become a part of history history which he had helped to fashion as had le chaumareys this great sea was alive with countless craft of every kind from lordly indiamen to brigs and schooners and down further still to the tiny native vessels which abounded here like insects in a forest or minute sea creatures yes the news would spread quickly enough in the seven months since the revolution had begun the whole world might have changed yet again only one thing was clear and stark like a wreck on a reef tuke would capture the narval it was so simple it made him want to walk out into the darkness de barrass men would rise to their new banner willingly after the barbarous way they had been made to live and serve de barras it would be like a flood bursting and then tuke would emerge in his new role not merely a troublesome pirate but a real force to be reckoned with raymond was correct in one thing it would mean war england would never stand by and watch a new france expanding at her expense every ship would be needed desperately they had been unready for a clash with spain over trade concessions what would they do when confronted with a freshly blooded france tuke with his small but unchallenged flotilla of vessels would do as he pleased take what he wanted found an empire if he so wished he looked at raymond again and he had known about genin all the time tremayne said i will put to sea tomorrow he grinned today that is raymond said tonelessly pigeon is carrying despatches for the governor of new south wales tremayne winked and for commodore sayer hell be writing fresh orders for you dick doublequick hardacre leaned over the sill and sniffed the air light soon now without turning he said and my schooner is out looking for de barras if tuke already knows about these things hell come out of hiding hell not risk attack from a frigate the narval would pound his little vessels to boxwood before they got in range bolitho remembered the powerful guns tempests topgallant mast plunging down to the deck killing and maiming as it went almost to himself he said all tuke has to do is wait if de barras learns the news hell be even more desperate to recapture his prisoner his ship is all he has now without her he is as good as dead tremayne stood up his seaboots creaking ill be off directly dick if you have any despatches id be obliged to get em afore noon he tried to grin but youre all safe and snug here your fifthrate and th big transport in the bay you could hold off an army eh raymond spoke up sharply de barras is no longer our concern this settlement is i will be getting more men and supplies soon once they arrive tuke and his followers will sheer off and go to another huntingground tremayne regarded him calmly if you think that he turned away ill have a boat alongside tempest till an hour afore i upanchors send your despatches into her he gripped bolithos hand ill tell em about you when i drops the anchor in carrick road again i often sees your sister ill pass it kindly to her thank you william but i may be there before you as the other captain left the room bolitho felt suddenly heavy it was like an evil dream when nobody would listen or understand what you were trying to say with tuke on the rampage and the forces of authority unable or unwilling to contest his power the islands would fall on one anothers throats as in days past the spear and the war club would lay the islands open for traders and pirates to plunder as they thought fit he saw hardacre watching him he knew a betrayal there was no other word for it but would the french sailors rise against their officers no matter what tuke or yves genin told them could they bring themselves to mutiny and smash down all they had been disciplined to obey without question when a nation rose against its king and turned murder loose on the streets it could face up to almost anything bolitho decided grimly he said i am requesting permission to put to sea sir ill find de barras and tell him what we know it would be far better to send him and his ship away than to bring superior forces down on our heads by remaining silent no one word and yet it rebounded around the room like an iron shot hardacre said then ill be down to the village and speak with tinah there are things to prepare he glanced at bolitho ive no doubt you wish to discuss matters too as the door closed behind him raymond said i have my own responsibilities and you are here to support me to the best of your ability i know my orders sir was it possible to sound so calm when all he wanted to do was pull raymond by the lapels of his beautiful coat and shake him until his face was blue good in my opinion de barras will either defeat tuke or return to france if he learns what has happened either way it is no longer our affair war will come if it has not already begun and we must prepare the levu islands as instructed his mouth hardened and i imagine that you will be able to drive tukes schooners away should they come too close eh dyou know what i think sir bolitho leaned out of a window and gripped the sill to prevent his hands from shaking i believe that there will be no bases here not now nor any time in our lives the war we knew was a soundingbrass the one to come will be fought with giants there will be neither need nor time for islands and governors to control them he drew in a breath very slowly tasting the sea feeling it pull at him no supplies or soldiers will come either raymond exclaimed youre mad what do you think i was sent for bolitho did not face him think about it i was kept out here because of you because i challenged your authority five years ago and stood between you and a man you wronged and allowed to go into oblivion because of other more personal matters also you used your skills to maroon me here de barras is another but he was driven out of france too late by then his sort had created anger and hatred which in turn will try to destroy our world too and you do you not think it strange that you have joined our little world when he received no reply he turned and saw raymond staring at the table his open despatches spread between his outthrust arms then he said hoarsely you are wrong of course i will get support i have worked all my life for proper recognition i will not stand by and see it all he lurched to his feet his eyes blazing i am the governor here you will do as i say they stayed quite still facing each other like strangers then as bolitho made to leave he heard voices in the compound and feet on the stairs outside it was neither hardacre nor his overseer but lieutenant keen he was dressed only in shirt and breeches and he looked beside himself with anxiety i am sorry to disturb you sir he looked so wretched that bolitho took his arm and guided him out on to the stairway beside another window tell me i have a friend sir she she yes i have seen her he still could not even guess continue i was with her i had attended to my duties with the working party and seen them in their huts and then sweat ran down his face as he blurted out in the name of god sir i believe there is fever amongst us he turned away his shoulders shaking she just lies there she cannot speak i didnt know what to do he broke down completely bolitho stared past him at the trees and the glow of water beyond another dawn it was more like the day of reckoning i must think ill come with you he strode back into the room and searched amongst the litter of papers until he found something to write on i must send a message to the pier for allday raymond asked dully what are you muttering about bolitho said i would suggest you close the settlement gates sir there may be fever on the island raymonds jaw dropped impossible you are just trying to parry aside my orders he saw bolithos expression and added your lieutenant is mistaken he must be bolitho walked from the room revolution on the other side of the world and the islands waiting to watch their new masters fighting amongst themselves and now like a trident from hell had come the worst blow of all the one enemy which came from within and from which there might be no quarter volunteers bolitho knelt on a rush mat and looked at the young girl in the hut which had been erected a few days earlier by some of tempests working parties there was almost complete silence and bolitho was conscious of it as if the surrounding trees even the island were listening above his head he heard the quiet buzz of insects hitting keens lanterns and the young lieutenants irregular breathing as he looked over his shoulder he had the girls wrist in his hand but there was barely any movement in it her smooth skin felt wet and the beat of her heart was fast and urgent hardacre came into the hut brushing between a marine picket and two natives as he strode under the lantern light he ran his big hands across the girls body and then looked up at keens anxious face she has the fever how much do you care for her keen answered brokenly with everything i have she must live she must hardacre stood up cover her well no matter if she tries to throw it off keep her warm he looked at bolitho and walked with him out of the hut the sky was much paler and some birds had started to sing it has come to the islands before last year early many died they have little resistance he glanced at the hut door i am afraid your lieutenant will lose his friend his grim features softened they hardly know a word of each others language i have watched them together she is malua tinahs sister she will be much missed he studied bolitho gravely i will go to the village they have certain roots herbs also there might be a chance he shrugged but who knows what may follow bolitho heard feet on sand and saw allday hurrying towards him you were supposed to take my message to mr herrick allday looked at him calmly aye captain i sent my second coxswain with the gig hes a fair hand he squared his shoulders i know about the fever and ive seen what it can do an thats no error my place is here with you bolitho looked away deeply moved by alldays staunch loyalty despairing because of what it really meant for both of them keen came out of the hut his eyes very bright she seems easier sir bolitho nodded how we delude ourselves when the worst is about to happen hardacre has gone for aid he is the best hope keen sounded dazed i thought the surgeon would come sir bolitho turned towards the dawn sky you must know mr keen what might well happen to all of us the fever may be local and easily held again many diseases are new to these islands their cure unknown as they were brought by outsiders like ourselves but he watched the dismay clouding keens face we have to think of the ship and what we are ordered to do to bring mr gwyther ashore would deprive the ship of help should she need it for once he comes i cannot allow him to return until we know the worst he forced a smile or the best keen nodded jerkily yes sir yes i think i understand now bolitho watched his emotions his anguish how well he knew him to think it should come to this almost harshly he said so we must be about it you are my secondincommand i believe you have mr pyper ashore with you so from today he will be actinglieutenant see to it i have already passed word to mr herrick to appoint both mr swift and mr starling masters mate to the same positions we will need all our skills and it were better that we have as many with the proper authority as we can although from what i have learned from my people these past months i would promote every manjack if i were free to do so allday said here comes another captain he added hurriedly be easy with him he thinks he is doing the best he can orlandos tall figure came out of the grey light shining and running with water as he squelched over the sand towards the huts bolitho looked towards the bay but the ships were still hidden in shadows orlando had taken it on himself to swim ashore he must have heard herrick giving his new orders or someone spreading word of the fever either way he had come unable to speak or ask he was just standing there watching bolitho as if he expected a blow in the face bolitho said quietly i am afraid there will be no cabin for you to fuss over and precious little of anything else for a while he reached out impetuously as allday had seen him do many times and touched orlandos arm so i am placing you in charge of our food supplies the negro lowered himself noiselessly on to his knees and nodded very slowly as bolitho turned away allday touched the negro with his shoe stand up you ignorant bugger he grinned to hide his sadness cant you see what youre doing to him man by the time the first sunlight had touched the hills and filtered through the trees towards the bay bolitho had discovered the extent of his resources apart from keen and pyper he had sergeant quare and jack miller boatswains mate to support his authority two marines and six seamen only remained of the working party most of the wounded had recovered sufficiently to be returned to the ship leaving only the marine with the spearthrust in his leg and two seamen if things got worse even they would have to be put to work keen came back his eyes on the hut ive mustered the hands together sir they seem to know whats expected from them fortunately most of the shore parties had been chosen for their skills and reliability men like miller who had proved a firstclass hand even if he changed into a wildeyed killer in battle penneck ships caulker who had been putting finishing touches to one of the huts big tom fraser of the coopers crew trustworthy except where drink was concerned jenner the dreamy american and another wanderer lenoir who was of french birth and the exgamekeeper blissett the latter would most likely see this new isolation as yet another chance to obtain his corporals stripes thank you he smiled go to your malua ill not need you for a while he beckoned to allday we will walk to the settlement and speak with mr raymond i shall want the convicts kept separate from the village and from ourselves that way the corps guards can watch over them and also attend to the defence of the compound and anchorage he found himself marvelling at the easy way his ideas translated themselves into actions it was sheer madness what could he and a handful of men do here if the natives started to drop with fever the situation would get ugly and quickly it would not be a siege for long it would be a massacre he passed the long hut which gwyther had used as his hospital and saw the wounded marine and his two companions sitting by the entrance he could feel the uncertainty the new fear bolitho said dont worry youre not forgotten the marine known as billyboy asked wem in for troubles sir can you still hold a musket he bobbed can that sir im gettin better all the while just me leg bolitho smiled good youll be armed directly im mounting you as picket on the weapons he strode on with allday beside him weapons the compound had its swivels and a few sixpounders not exactly artillery but they could sweep any attackers from the pier like gravel from a road he paused on a slope and looked towards the sea tempest lay as before serene above her image distance hiding the confusion which his message must have created poor thomas he would be here too but for his sense of duty bolitho glanced at the eurotas it would be best to transfer the convicts into her rather than keep them ashore and add to any risk of infection he tried to scrape his mind further to discover some weakness or flaw in his hastily assembled plan just hours ago that was when it had all started like a line in a ships log a hint of some new disturbance on the seas face your life could change with the speed of light the merest whim of an idea the pier was deserted and below it hardacres longboats swung gently to their lines their gunwales so blistered they showed no trace of paint or colour they reached the big gates and bolitho saw two corps soldiers watching him from one of the little blockhouses allday shouted open the gates its captain bolitho an officer appeared on the rampart his coat like blood in the sunlight i am sorry captain but the governor has ordered me to keep them closed for the safety of my men and all those on duty within and for the security of the settlement it is considered the best arrangement bolitho looked at him steadily his mind like ice despite the enormity of raymonds betrayal he called we have to stand together the ships are one way of life the islands another if we are to meet any threat from attack or from sickness we must he stopped sickened his words had sounded like pleading allday said thickly let me get up at the bastard captain ill gut him like a herring no bolitho turned away raymond could do as he pleased there was an underground stream within the compound endless drinking water hardacre had chosen the site wisely they would have plenty of food far more than they needed with the militia scattered and less mouths to feed if every man outside the palisades died and the islanders were decimated raymonds stand his decision to save what he could might be seen as brilliant planning especially across a fine desk on the other side of the world with europe moving towards another conflict even the smallest deed might be welcome we will go back to the huts he glanced quickly at allday as they walked down the slope towards the trees when did you begin to see signs of fever in a man it was the dread of every sailor he could understand the feelings of the corps soldiers on the palisades but it was a fools protection tropical fever could soon scale a wall he found pyper making a list of supplies and said put a man by the pier to keep watch on the ship he said it briskly matter of fact there was no point in putting thoughts in pypers mind if they were not already there the mention of the ship security amongst ones own while here pyper nodded aye sir despite being made an actinglieutenant he looked very young vulnerable as keen had once done when he had first joined bolithos previous command it felt cool inside the hut and bolitho looked down at the girl shocked to see that she had changed in so short a time her face was drawn her mouth twitching as if she were in a trance hardacre was wiping her forehead with a cloth he stood up and said i heard about raymond might have guessed hed be useless government spy lackey bolitho said can you spare a few minutes outside again hardacre took a flask from his robe and offered it safer than water makes it easier to stay calm too bolitho let it trickle across his tongue it was fiery and yet took away his thirst he said i remembered what you said about rutara island about its being a good hiding place for tuke hardacre smiled how can you still think of such things they are beyond us now you described it as the sacred island true it is a rough rocky place not suitable for habitation superstition and fear grew out of it the people will not land there to do so is desecration a sign of war tuke would know this and de barras i think not bolitho remembered the false masts the pain and the shock of the bombardment he had known that tuke would have a plan maybe all the rest had been a rehearsal just for this de barras would drive into the anchorage guns firing whether he knew about genin and the revolution or not the wildness of battle would soon restore order in his ship and tukes destruction would keep de barrass security for a little longer but the islanders would see and care about none of these things to them tuke de barras and the english sailors were as one hostile alien feared but as soon as they knew of their trespass on to their sacred island the last control would snap tuke would stand off and await his chance as he had done before eurotas captured villages burned and pillaged people killed without mercy and after challenging a kings ship with no more than a simple ruse de barras would stand no chance at all he looked at the palm fronds moving gently in a soft breeze hardacres schooner was lively enough but tempest carried a tremendous spread of canvas he made up his mind allday get a boats crew together one of mr hardacres cutters i am going out to the ship he saw alldays disbelief and added well almost later as the boat rose and clipped in a slight swell bolitho knew what it was like to be parted from his command the boat kept station on tempests stern and he was aware of the many figures on the poop and in the mizzen shrouds silently watching as the oars held it in position in the cabin windows herrick and borlase were staring down at him and it was all he could do to remain outwardly calm even formal tell mr lakey to lay a course for rutara island i want you to weigh immediately and go there with every stitch you can carry he could see his clerk cheadle deeper within the cabin he would be writing it all down bolitho never transferred his authority without setting it in writing and even though his signature would not appear this time it would be enough to safeguard herrick if things went wrong and twothirds of the ships company were listening the best witnesses of all he added it is sacred to the other islanders i need you to anchor in the lagoon there but do not put a single man ashore do you understand herrick nodded firmly aye sir if tukes schooners are there destroy them do what you can to drive them away your actions will be seen it will be known that we are not here to smear their beliefs and bring a war amongst them and if i meet with narval sir bolitho looked up at him trying to feel his way you read my instructions if de barras is still in command you must tell him about his country if narval is under new colours you must stand off not fight sir like it or not mr herrick we are not known to be at war with france is there anything more i can do sir he sounded wretched send a short report in pigeons boat in your own words someone should know what we are about there was no point in mentioning that raymond had shut them out of the settlement compound even herrick might refuse to obey if he knew that and mr herrick he paused holding his gaze thomas you will stay at anchor off rutara until you get contrary orders we will be safe here the defences and the eurotass remaining guns still command the entrance quietly he said put her about allday this is easy for no one by the time the boat had reached the pier again there were men already swarming up tempests rigging and out along her yards that was good bolitho thought it would keep herrick too busy to think about those he was leaving astern he saw keen at the inner end of the pier his shirt open to his waist his arms hanging at his sides he waited for bolitho to reach him and then said huskily shes gone sir he looked at the sun just this moment allday said ill deal with it sir no keen swung on him i will in a gentler tone he added but thank you bolitho watched him go it had of course been a dream hopeless from the beginning in these beautiful surroundings he let his gaze move over the beach and nodding fronds the deep blue water but they had stood no real chance the young sea officer the native girl from a barely known island he quickened his pace but it had been their dream no one had had the right to break it richard he swung on his heel seeing her running down from the makeshift hospital towards him he seized her and held her against him oh viola why did you leave the compound but she was clinging to him laughing and weeping all at once i dont care dont you see my darling richard no matter what happens for the very first time we are together actinglieutenant francis pyper watched as they walked into the long hut he had been feeling afraid especially after seeing the activity aboard tempest even now she was shorteningin her cable and within the hour might have disappeared around the headland but he was no longer afraid sergeant quare crunched towards him sir message for the captain two natives sick in the village he should be told at once pyper nodded his mouth dry i will tell him quare removed his hat and wiped the inside with his hand poor little bastard he thought wont be long now theyll start to drop like flies he had seen it in the caribbean in india all over the bloody place he saw blissett walking towards the pier and bellowed do your tunic up where the hell dyou think you are man that made him feel slightly better halt who goes there bolitho stepped into a white patch of moonlight and showed himself sorry sir sergeant quare grounded his musket wasnt expectin you again all quiet he leaned against a tree and listened to the hissing roar of surf along the outer reef timeless confident yessir the marine sighed theyve been burnin some more poor devils in the village heard em chantin and wailin yes bolitho checked himself from sitting down he was tired out sick and weary from the constant work it had been eight days since tempest had set sail and there was still no word from anybody not that he expected much help from the village there had been several deaths and hardacre had told him that some more natives had been found dying in a canoe on the other side of the island they had been strangers and had probably brought the disease with them itak was the name given to the fever it wasted its victims away in no time at all threw them into a desperate struggle for breath while they burned up from within each day bolitho inspected his men searching for any sign of it but apart from weariness and strain they were behaving well which was more than could be said for the men inside the compound bolitho had sent keen to request that food and drink be lowered over the palisade in fact it had been thrown down and keen had heard sounds of drunken laughter as if the place was turning into a madhouse so next day bolitho had gone himself after waiting in the sun for a long time watched and he suspected covered by two guards in a blockhouse raymond had appeared above him bolitho had said we need help sir if the people in the village are left to themselves they may become too weak to burn their dead he had got no further so you have come to beg have you you thought you could override me by sending your ship away well youve got your new command now a native hut and a handful of ruffians to do your bidding my precious wife will soon come running back when she sees what she has thrown away he had sounded wild even jubilant bolitho had made another try if i take the watch off the eurotas i will have enough hands to manage until the fever is gone you keep your men away from my ship his voice had risen almost to a scream my men have orders to open fire if a single boat puts off to her youve lost your ship captain and ill not have you touch mine he had found keen and the others waiting for him with the news of another death it was pitiful the way the natives were accepting it the gods were angry tinah knew about tuke and the sacred island if the whole of his people discovered the truth too they would see their suffering as the direct result of intrusion he looked at the stars and shivered if he had acted sooner he might have been able to seize the eurotas under cover of night but that was too late raymonds threats and their own fear of the itak would make sure of a hot welcome from the loaded swivels if he could not get word to herrick and the schooner failed to return soon he would know narval had been taken in the name of the revolution or through an open mutiny made no difference now tuke would demand payment for his help to genins cause and the frenchman could hardly refuse but how would he do it a legalized position with the new regime a ship a letter of marque or the promise of gold when genin eventually reached paris to make the wound more bitter bolitho realized that as soon as narval had gone and tuke had obtained the reward he was seeking news would quite likely arrive to say that england and france had been at war for months it would be the end of bolithos career in raymond he had a deadly enemy and in london they would be looking for a scapegoat to cover their anger at losing both the french frigate and a pirate who would still need to be hunted by menofwar desperately required in the line of battle he thought of raymonds words when he had shouted down at him that was his only comfort viola had worked ceaselessly at his side carried encouragement from her makeshift hospital to the village where she had helped to nurse the sick and take care of the children left behind she was lying in the hut where he had just left her he had knelt over her listening to her regular breathing afraid to touch her and break her sleep the sergeant asked i hope youll pardon me sir but what are we goin to do do he ran his fingers up through his hair wait when the schooner comes ill get a message to her master at least we will know if narval is still hereabout this island sir the one you told us of ow far away is it rutara is well north of here some five hundred miles bolitho thought of it even as he said the words the winds had been light but favourable herrick should have taken up his station even if he had been unable to destroy tukes schooners he would certainly not run into the trap which had caught them before he watched the stars growing smaller and fainter it would soon be time to begin again issue rations make sure his men were clean and try to keep up their spirits at least the itak was not the pox which he had known to kill twothirds of a ships company in a matter of weeks on land they could build fires boil water and pursue some sort of routine he said walk with me to the pier it will be light very soon how quiet it was in the village it was hard to believe the beach and shallows had been full of laughing girls and youths like keens beautiful malua sir quares voice jerked him from his thoughts i think i saw a sail bolitho jumped on to a slab of rock straining his eyes into the gloom but all he saw between sky and sea were breakers a necklace of surf cut short where it met the headland but it was brightening fast and he could already see eurotass portly outline an anchor light still flickering bolitho looked towards the settlement but there was no sign of life quare said stubbornly there sir this time he did see it like a pale fin rising above the distant surf shivering through the spray but moving inshore even while he watched a schooner small and well handled he said go and rouse mr keen tell him i want a message sent to hardacre to say his schooner is returning the vessels master would take more notice of him than of raymond that was certain he heard quares boots crunching back up the slope and somewhere a child crying the sound strangely sad then from behind him she said i woke up youd gone she came to his side and he put his arm around her shoulders feeling her warmth its the schooner he tried to sound calm i wonder what news shell bring the sails were endon now tilting steeply to the wind it must be much stronger outside the bays protection he thought being ashore was like being crippled you had to wait for others he could even imagine how raymond felt about it he squeezed her shoulders please god let it be good news hazy light played across the horizon like smoky liquid spilling over the edge of the earth it touched the twin masts hardacres rag of a pendant as the vessel drove close to the reef and tacked expertly in a welter of spray and spindrift keen came along the path tucking his shirt into his breeches he saw viola raymond and said oh good morning maam hello val she smiled seeing the dark shadows under his eyes sharing his pain bolitho said hardacre will be here soon i expect he glanced at the palisades he would wait until the schooner was warped alongside the pier and then walk down to her deck nobody from the settlement would be able to prevent him and they were too frightened to leave the compounds protection the bay was opening up on either hand and they stood in silence watching the colours emerge from the darkness the still and threatening shadows come alive with movement and simple beauty keen would be thinking of her running down the beach into the sea with him laughing shes back then hardacre stood on the hard sand hands on hips watching his schooner take on personality and about time too bolitho shaded his eyes and watched for some sort of signal from the eurotas or from the palisades if raymond ordered her to anchor and await his pleasure he would have to think of something else hardacre remarked suddenly thats very unusual bolitho looked at him what the master knows this bay like his own soul he usually begins to wear ship at that point when the wind stands as it does today bolitho turned back to the little schooner a sudden chill of warning pricking his brain mr keen go to the gates and rouse the sentry tell the fools to challenge the schooner he watched the small vessel and then heard keen shouting up at the blockhouse by the gates he stiffened she was altering course yet again towards the eurotas hardacre said in gods name what is the madman doing bolitho snapped get me a musket he saw quare on the slope quick fire yours damp or overeagerness made the musket misfire and bolitho heard quare growling like an angry dog as he prepared another shot from the palisade came a thick unsteady voice full of sleep and protest and keen returned saying angrily that man should be he saw bolithos expression and turned to watch the ships even the crack of the musket did not break their fixed attention although the chorus of awakened birds was enough to alarm the whole island slowly faintly at first and next with terrible resolve a column of smoke erupted from the schooners deck then a flame licking out from a hatch like an orange tongue consuming the jib sail in ashes keen said with a gasp fireship rouse the men bolitho saw the schooner stagger as part of her maindeck collapsed in a great gust of flame and sparks like things released from hell the fires exploded across sails and tarred rigging hanging the little ship into one massive torch bolitho could even see the blaze reflected in eurotass furled canvas and shrouds as the wind carried it unwaveringly towards the anchored ships side a boats cast off sir quare was reloading frantically the buggers will get away he stopped loading as the schooner shuddered against the eurotass hull and hurled a fresh column of smoke and swirling sparks high over her mastheads bolitho could hear the fires taking hold could picture the tinderdry wood the tarred cordage all joining together in one terrible pyre he thought he saw some men jump into the sea and imagined the terror below decks as the offduty watch awoke to their own awful execution he felt her quivering sobbing quietly against his shoulder he said there is nothing we can do viola some will reach the beach but i fear that most will die so eurotas had been cut out right under raymonds guns his ship his lifeline if all else failed was blazing and crackling the smoke rolling downwind in a great choking bank masts and spars were consumed and fell into the sparks internal explosions hurled fragments high into the air to pockmark the surrounding water with feathers of spray one great bang rocked the gutted hulk and rolled an echo around the bay like thunder as it finally died away eurotas started to settle down the steam spouting and hissing to cover her last agony before she went to the bottom leaving her charred poop still visible above the surface keen asked quietly why sir it was our message mr keen bolitho turned away from the water his eyes smarting from smoke or was it the added bitterness of his discovery tuke has chosen his reward he looked at hardacre and added it is this place without eurotass protection we cannot hold it now once installed it would take a regiment of marines to flush him out again keen said in a small voice and we have no way of getting help sir as if to emphasize his words the schooners bows broke surface and floated away from the great frothing whirlpool of flotsam and charred remains bolitho said abruptly follow me he found pyper and the rest of the men grouped near the hospital hut the wounded beside them bolitho looked at them as individuals and then said it is my belief that mathias tuke has seized the means to attack this island and those others which depend on it otherwise he would not waste a schooner by using her as a fireship she is too valuable for his flotilla he saw his words hitting home he will kill any natives who oppose him and you have already seen his methods both aboard eurotas and ashore he knew she was watching him remembering her own torment when the transport had been captured she even touched her shoulder at the place where her gown hid the livid brand he had set on her he continued not one of us has caught the fever although many have died all around us so perhaps we are safe maybe we are too evil to go just yet bolitho saw miller and quare grin as he knew they would on the other side of the clearing allday was watching him calmly he had heard this sort of thing before bolitho said only one ship can offer battle to tuke and no matter what forces he now has i think tempest is more than a match for them blissett nodded and he noticed that lenoir the french seaman was crossing himself orlando stood apart from the rest arms folded one foot on the last case of biscuit he looked powerful and somehow regal he added slowly there are five hundred miles between us and tempest lads he could see their doubt what did the distance mean five hundred it might as well be five thousand miles bolitho looked along their intent faces wishing he could spare them i intend to take a cutter and as many volunteers who are willing and find our tempest there was a long drawnout stunned silence then as pyper stepped forward with a makeshift watchbill allday said wouldnt it be better to take both cutters captain he smiled lazily more of a chance i reckon pyper called all volunteers hold up your hands the boatswains mate miller replied no need well all go he bared his strong teeth like an animal two cutters eh lads they all crowded forward slapping each other and grinning as if they had just been offered something precious bolitho glanced at his hands expecting to see them shaking he heard her say you cannot leave me richard he looked at her his protest dying as she took his hands then he nodded better together my love allday cleared his throat beg pardon maam an open boat full of sailors is no place for a lady he sounded shocked i mean captain it would not be right she looked him up and down i have seen it all and i believe you need me to sustain your impudence allday she smiled when do we start bolitho took out the watch seeing her eyes on it as he opened the guard dusk if we attempt to leave earlier the guards may panic and open fire to stop us he led her away from the others and their strange released excitement i dont know viola im not sure i can do it five hundred miles and even then she took his elbow and turned him gently towards the huts look at the marine richard the one called billyboy he has been badly wounded but now he is on his feet and the other two are much better with men like these of course you can do it she made to leave him and then said quietly and do not ask hardacre to look after me until you return we go together she watched him steadily it is our promise he nodded if you are determined she tossed her head and he saw her as he had first done five years back all her strength and as he had thought then her arrogance despite her torn gown and scarred shoes that lady was still very much there never more so my darling richard about anything when not if bolitho eased the tiller bar slightly and said we will drift for a while mr pyper hail the other boat gratefully they hauled the long oars across the gunwales of the cutter and drooped over them like men at prayer getting the boats away from the pier without being seen or challenged had been childs play compared with making a safe passage through the reefs the undertow had been very strong and as if to taunt their puny efforts the wind had attacked them around the headland with unexpected vigour and it had taken every mans strength to reach open water now with the sun already high in an empty sky it was difficult to imagine it bolitho looked along the boat watching each mans reaction his adjustment close astern the other cutter was pulling towards them and he saw keen at the tiller pointing to one of the oarsmen or advising somebody on how to get better results from his stroke in his own boat bolitho could readily understand keens problems the two crews were as evenly matched as possible with the few seamen spread between the rest the marines and the injured he looked down at violas hand on the gunwale she had hardly said a word during their violent tossing progress through the broken water but when he had reached out for her she had looked up at him and had smiled just that and yet it had offered him more confidence more peace at that moment than he could remember he made himself think about his task five hundred miles at the very best with all in their favour and no one falling sick it would take over a week the boats had no sails but miller had discovered some scraps of canvas and had promised to try and rig something which might help steady the boat and spare the oarsmen some of the backbreaking strain what a mixed bunch he thought as he looked at each weary stubbly face miller and the marine blissett jenner and orlando and two of the injured the marine called billyboy and evans the ships painter he met alldays gaze from the stroke oar and nodded if allday showed resentment at crewing a boat instead of coxswaining it he did not show it at any other time it would make a fair sight captain bolitho looked abeam the islands all seemed the same blue and hazy in the morning sunlight he wondered if hardacre was even now shouting his message to raymond from the gates telling him what these men were trying to do to save him and his cowardly guards he thought too of the moment when the cutter had surged past the stillsmouldering wreck of the eurotas only her blackened poop and taffrail remained above the surface but it had been enough to make viola seize his hand and press it against her in the darkness the sight of that stark outline surrounded with breaking spray and trailing fragments of cordage must have brought it all back in an instant it had been in the poop where she had faced tuke where he had taunted and humiliated her boat your oars keen leaned over the gunwale of his boat as it nudged alongside the other one he said winds dropped sir he smiled at viola i hope you were able to sleep maam but the smile only made him look sadder bolitho thought i hope it remains so bolitho kept his voice level and relaxed unlike a ship there was nowhere he could hide from those who depended on him like this moment the beginning five hundred miles with neither chart nor sextant all he had was a small boats compass and the barest amount of food and water hardacre had managed to smuggle some wine and a flask of rum to him and this he would keep for anyone whose health wilted under the torment of heat and exposure they had six muskets between the two boats and apart from the officers pistols there were some cutlasses and a boarding axe which miller always carried in his belt it was not much but if they could keep up a regular daily total they had a chance any tropical storm or sudden fever amongst the boats and they had no chance at all to remind everyone of the need for care and vigilance a shark had joined them at dawn and even now was cruising lazily a cable or so astern bolitho fixed the islands in his mind like an unmarked chart the levu group and then north like the point of the compass to the navigator islands directly adjacent to which lay rutara and with luck the tempest he said we will keep our water ration the same in each boat mr keen but tomorrow i intend to beach in the bestlooking bay or cove and supplement our stores with coconuts we might even find some shellfish in the rocks he wanted to add that a hot meal no matter how frugal or coarse was better than anything to keep the men in good health and spirits as soon as they got ashore on one of the islands he would tell keen to shout it now over the lolling heads of his men would sound like an early acceptance of failure miller looked up from his efforts with needle and palm ive got some canvas left over sir he held a ragged piece about the size of a hammock across his knees itd make a fine shelter for you maam she smiled ill not refuse such kindness she ran one finger around the neck of her gown it is strange that it should be hotter on water than on land miller chuckled lord love you maam well make a seaman of you yet some of the men in the other boat nodded and grinned like unshaven galley slaves bolitho watched them and then touched her shoulder he said quietly you are worth a lot more than muscle you make them smile when they must be thinking of nothing but escape and sleep bolitho looked at the sun take the tiller mr pyper i will have a turn on the oars to the marine he said go aft and attend to the injured he waited for the man to look at him then examine the weapons and make sure our powder is protected the two boats drifted apart suddenly very small and frail on the great expanse of blue water across alldays broad shoulder he saw her watching him her eyes shaded by her straw hat speaking to him as if with her voice pyper cleared his throat nervous even with so much before him at the prospect of giving orders to his captain out oars he looked down at the little compass give way all with his shoulders propped against the side the wounded marine squinted up at viola raymond like everyone else he thought of her as the captains lady it had a good ring to it she was good to him had watched over his wounded leg better than any surgeon and was as gentle as an angel he could not distinguish her face because of the suns glare around the brim of her hat but he could see the grime on her gown and shoes which she had gathered from the pier a fresh pain lanced through his leg and he moved uneasily she asked how is it billyboy the marine grimaced fair maam just cramp the other injured man evans the painter said nothing he was watching the womans ankle below her gown and imagined the smoothness of her leg beyond then he thought of his wife in cardiff and wondered how she was managing without him she was a good girl and had given him four fine daughters he closed his eyes and let himself drift into sleep by pypers feet blissett made sure the powder and shot were well stowed and then looked up at the sleeping evans it was suddenly clear to him as if a voice had shouted it in his ear evans had started to die the realization frightened him and he did not know why blissett had seen many men go in battle in brawls or merely because they were taken by one bout of illness or another but seeing evanss face and knowing what he did was like falling on another mans secret and it disturbed him deeply behind bolitho the american called jenner pulled and thrust easily with his oar his mind lifting away on one of his many imaginary journeys when he was paid off he would buy a farm in new england miles from anywhere and settle down with a girl he tried to picture her and then started to create his perfect mate in his imagination next was orlando using his oar with clumsy precision taking his stroke from the others he ducked as miller stepped over his oar to take his place in the bow his sailmaking put aside until the next rest for with only five oars in use it needed all their strength miller laid back on his loom and grinned at the sky it was like a fight and to jack miller that was meat and drink in one and so it went on under a pitiless glare or partly masked in low haze the two boats crawled like ungainly beetles men changed round at the oars rations of biscuit and a cube of salt meat were issued and washed down with a pannikin of water from the barrico release from heat and torment came with the night but their efforts to make steady progress continued as before his back aching from the unfamiliar oar his palms blistered bolitho sat at the tiller violas head cushioned across his knees once she gripped him with her fingers and moaned softly in her sleep as bolitho brushed the hair from her mouth pyper had taken one of the oars and miller was bailing water from the bottom of the boat they sounded worn out half beaten already he tightened his jaw and this was the first full day after the cutters pitching motion the firm sand at the top of the beach felt as if it too was moving bolitho watched keen and miller making sure both boats were properly secured and heard sergeant quare ordering lookouts to either side of the small cove again it looked and felt idyllic lush greenery with the regular swish and gurgle of breakers along the pale sand but he knew how deceptive it could be just as he knew of the vital need for watchfulness pyper came to him his face seared by the sun shall we unload the boats sir not yet bolitho trained his small telescope on the far side of the cove suddenly tense but what he had thought to be a plume of smoke proved to be nothing more dangerous than a swaying cloud of insects we will wait a while and see if we are discovered here he wanted to unload the boats if only to lighten them and stop their unnecessary pounding in the surf but he felt uneasy apprehensive he tried to tell himself he was being overcautious that the need for rest before the challenge of the final haul to rutara was more important he saw evans and a seaman called colter lying beneath some shady palms the other injured man the marine was propped against a tree helping viola to unpack some dressings the rest of the small party moved about restlessly feeling their way recovering their wits after the hard work at the oars he watched her smiling at evans wiping his forehead and trying to make him comfortable looking back over their day and two nights in an open boat he was deeply moved she had not once complained nor had she asked for the slightest privilege before a boat half full of strained and anxious men she had performed her own needs with only millers crude screen to offer a pretence of privacy now she was on the beach with the wounded men if she knew evans was dying she was hiding her dismay very well quare strode across the sand all clear sir he gestured along the curving wall of trees ill put the hands to work getting nuts he forced a wry smile i could manage a gallon of devon ale right now sir keen joined them shall we start a fire sir he rubbed his hands and gave a great yawn maybe we could kill a bird or two frazer had the fine sense to bring a cooking pot with him from the village bolitho nodded directly shellfish and some cubes of salt pork any sort of fowl too it would not go down well at an admirals table but something hot no matter how doubtful will do our people a power of good he sat down and rested his head in his hands grappling with the problems of his journey the mounting strain it would make on all of them he looked at her again especially on a woman yet in some ways she had more inner reserves and courage than any of them he heard a man laugh and another respond with a stream of obscenity as a coconut was dropped on to his head the luckless man on the ground swung round and gasped i begs yer pardon maam she laughed at his confusion my father was a soldier ive heard worse from him her words struck another note for bolitho how little he really knew about her she had gained more knowledge of him by reading the gazette and speaking with his superiors and yet in five years of separation his love had gained rather than faded allday trudged towards the boats carrying a net of coconuts he paused drew out his cutlass and then selected a nut with great care here captain the blade flashed in the sunlight lopping off the top of the nut like a scalp a local brew it seemed to amuse him bolitho raised it to his lips and let the milk run over his tongue thank you it is like he put the nut on the sand between his legs his mind racing allday bolithos tone made him stiffen do not turn on the other side of the cove right by the water i saw a face allday nodded and called to frazer big tom put these in the boat he turned and walked back up the beach pausing only by viola raymond to pass a brief message bolitho stood up slowly and stretched his arms there it was again a quick movement amongst the thick fronds the suns glitter on something bright it was taking too long men were walking back towards the water stifflegged like players in a travelling band of mummers quare hurried towards bolitho his musket over his shoulder where sir as if to a signal several figures began to emerge from amongst the thick foliage fiercelooking natives totally unlike those bolitho had seen around the settlement from north island or elsewhere hardly mattered now they had probably hidden themselves much earlier even before the boats had been hauled ashore he counted them more than twenty and all armed with spears and short widebladed knives one obviously a leader of some kind was adorned with several strings of glass beads in the reflected sunlight they had betrayed his hiding place bolitho measured the distance from the top of the beach to the boats from the silent watching natives to his own men he said quietly stand still lads they are trying to discover what we are about if they think we are from a ship nearby they may go if not we could have a fight on our hands pyper said desperately there are some more yonder sir by the red flowers no wonder quares lookouts had not seen them they must have crept along the waters edge and through the surf itself to bypass the tired sentries the one with the beads raised his hand and called something in a thin voice then he pointed at bolitho recognizing him too as a leader and then very slowly turned his arm towards viola raymond he bobbed his head and grimaced then poked his bushy black hair while those around him did likewise and grinned he was fascinated by the colour of her hair and yet his simple mime was more menacing than any open attack bolitho held up his hand friend a few of the natives wandered vaguely by the hissing surf and bolitho saw the pattern changing even as he said fall back to the boats but do it slowly he had seen that the apparently aimless movement was an attempt to get between the sailors and the boats or separate them from the little group beneath the trees he thought suddenly of herrick this time there was no lastminute help or swivel guns to strike fear into the silent figures on the beach he said mr keen we will use my boat only take charge of it now and get it launched sergeant quare have some men aid the injured he saw allday and miller watching him we will stand here make no further move bolitho heard the cutters keel grating on sand the heavy gasps from those who were manhandling it into deeper water to try and escape with both boats would be madness it was probable the natives had canoes nearby and would soon overhaul the slow pulling boats and attack them individually you could not pull an oar and fight at the same time when you were so shorthanded the natives were starting to move nearer and he heard them murmuring between themselves the sound strangely inhuman like the twittering of birds allday said something to the left captain more of the buggers this lot must have been waiting for reinforcements just to be on the safe side bolitho called sharply lively lads then he turned as several figures separated from the main group and streaked across the sand towards viola and the helpless evans the wounded marine swung up his musket like a crutch and fired the ball hitting the first native in the stomach and hurling him down to spatter the pale sand with blood the sudden move and the crack of the musket acted like a clarion call and with a great whoop of frenzy and hatred the natives hurled themselves towards the boats the air instantly alive with spears and jagged pieces of stone sergeant quare dropped to one knee and fired followed immediately by the other muskets the effect was immediate and still yelling and whooping the attackers fell back into the green foliage leaving three of their number dead or dying bolitho drew his pistol and shouted to pyper get those men down here a spear flitted across his vision and stuck quivering in the wet sand the second wave would come at any moment he saw blissett and another marine reloading beside quare and their wounded comrade hopping down the slope towards the boats his face twisted with pain and exertion orlando was carrying evans who was moaning and struggling weakly in his arms while the other injured seaman was being bustled into the cutter by frazer and lenoir here they come again this time it was more determined the rocks and stones raining down on the reeling dazed seamen and marines and then spears from two angles at once but the muskets replied briskly and bolitho fired his pistol at a screaming native who had weaved around the crouching marines and was charging straight at the boat he was knocked sideways his limbs flailing as he fell into the surf turning it bright pink bolitho thrust the pistol away and drew his sword hurry he turned sickened as the marine with blissett gave a terrible shriek and fell on his side a spear driven hard into his chest this way sir keen was standing in the cutters bows firing his own pistol and waving for the others to clamber aboard bolitho saw violas hair blowing above the gunwale and realized that he and the marines were the only ones still on the beach blissett was trying to drag his companion towards the surf but quare punched his shoulder and yelled leave him hes done for get his musket and move yourself my lad he fired as he spoke and sent another dark figure sprawling the next few minutes were a confusion of desperate purpose mixed with revulsion as their attackers turned on the dead marine and started to slash and hack him into an unrecognizable bundle then the oars were out and the cutter was moving swiftly into deep water the speed of the stroke laying bare their horror and their fear no canoes in sight sir bolitho nodded unable to answer as he sucked in air by his feet he saw a net full of coconuts but by having to abandon the other boat they had lost half their supply of food and water sergeant quare said roughly marine corneck was a good hand sir came from the next village to me blissett lay across an oar his eyes smarting he had never liked the dead marine much but to see him cut apart like a carcass made him burn with anger and disgust bolitho watched their varying reactions and matched them against his own some small warning had prevented all of them ending up like corneck a few more minutes and he might have ordered the boats to be unloaded fires to be lit he met her gaze along the boat as she tied a bandage around jenners head he had been badly cut by a piece of rock she looked very calm but her eyes were misty with suppressed emotion but for the wounded marines swift action they might have seized her and dragged her away before anyone could intervene even the thought of it made him feel sick the only compensation was that there were more men to work the oars and so allow small snatches of respite for the others against that he looked at evans who was now barely conscious and at penneck the ships caulker who had received a bad gash on the neck from a spear he took out the flask of rum feeling their eyes on it seeing big tom frazer look away to hide his own want a tot each to evans and penneck he looked at her across their heads and i think for the lady keen said hoarsely aye sir she most of all but she shook her head no rum is something i have not been able to admire several of the men laughed haltingly at first and then in a tide of uncontrolled noise which none seemed able to stop bolitho touched keens shoulder let them get it out of their souls they have enough to face he saw pyper joining with the rest his laughter changing to helpless tears which ran unheeded down his face like rain after a while they pulled themselves together some surprised others ashamed but not one making any comment on their behaviour the oars began to move up and down again and within another hour the small cove was lost in a blur of haze which covered the islands astern like fine netting then they rested issued rations drank their water looked around at the sea and each other with dulled acceptance ahead and on either bow the islands were breaking up and growing smaller they would have to land again and find water gather supplies and all the time the sun pursued them seared down on them burning away their determination their will to survive and when night eventually found them it was without comfort for after the shock and fear of their experience on the island and the heat of the long day the air seemed like ice so that those not employed on the oars clung together in shivering cold the next day despite all their caution the same danger showed itself behind the lush vegetation of one island watching eyes followed their weary approach when they prepared to beach the boat they were attacked as before beaten and almost knocked senseless by rocks and flying stones until they were forced to pull into deeper water to find refuge bolitho watched keen and pyper issuing the rations and looked for resentment or mistrust in the faces of the others the rations had to be exact one sign of greed or favouritism and these same loyal and disciplined men might fall on each other like crazed wolves if only they had been able to get more food before leaving but if raymond had found out what they were intending either from his guards or from the village they would not even have reached the pier blissett picked up his musket permission to fire sir he was watching a circling seabird his eyes alive with sudden excitement bolitho nodded wait until it is closer otherwise our friend will have it he glanced astern at the telltale dorsal fin he could accept it now without fear or curiosity it was just part of the whole one more hazard the bird fell neatly to the first ball it was a booby about the size of a duck they all stood or crouched staring at it until bolitho said quietly we will divide it but the blood must be given to the weakest revolted at first the men took their little portions and then devoured them with sudden desperation the blood carried carefully through the swaying boat was given to evans the wounded seaman called colter and finally penneck just before sunset and another bitter night they sighted some fastmoving canoes to the northeast like harrying dogs bolitho thought running them down into weakness so they could be killed at leisure maybe they thought them to be some of tukes men and were trying to wreak a terrible vengeance or they might even be acting for tuke under threat or promise of reward miller had constructed a seaanchor with the last scrap of canvas and bolitho decided to give everyone a chance to have a brief rest unbroken by the groan and clatter of oars as the boat lifted and rolled across a succession of troughs bolitho sat in the sternsheets his coat around violas shoulders one arm encircling her and protecting her from the motion once she said i am not asleep i was looking at the stars he held her firmly needing her fearing for her then she said stop discovering blame richard i wanted to be here with you nothing is changed when he made to answer he found she was asleep again as the dawn opened up the sky once more they saw even fewer islands and the ocean seemed far greater and more invincible they found too that evans had died in the night bolitho trained his small glass on the nearest land it was very green but without any sign of a beach but it might be their last chance he looked at evans body lying on the bottom boards as if asleep they could bury him there it would prevent the shark from snatching him away and so save his men from seeing it happen to one of their own when they got ashore they were not attacked and although quares lookouts did find some old fire places it looked as if they had lain unused for years it was so difficult to get a boat inshore without pounding it against the rocks that perhaps native canoes stayed away too frail to take the risk they found a tiny pool with some fresh water it was from a rainfall and barely enough to fill frazers cooking pot but with some of their dwindling supply of salt pork a collection of small oysters which pyper discovered amongst the rocks and a few ships biscuits to give it body allday and miller set about preparing their first hot meal there was dried wood in plenty and with alldays tinderbox and a small magnifying glass which they removed from evans body they used the sun to get a good blaze going the little welshman was buried on a slope under some trees and the shallow grave covered with flat stones it was a strange resting place for the tempests painter bolitho thought as he sat with his back against a palm and wrote carefully in a small notebook which was now becoming his log he wondered how he would describe the place not that anyone would ever read about it viola was lying in the shade beside him the hat across her face call it evanss isle richard he smiled yes after all hes the only one who will be staying here keens voice came from the rocks where the boat was being watched and guarded just sighted some more canoes sir bolitho thrust the little book inside his shirt very well douse the fire and collect the men were safer in the boat than up here in grim silence they pulled away from the only place which had made them welcome sustained for a while by their meal and a brief rest they turned the stem towards the north once more leaving evans alone with his last and only possession like a dying waterbeetle the cutter her oars partly withdrawn and unmoving rolled across an unbroken swell which stretched as far as an eye could reach bolitho sat with his arm on the tiller bar breathing very slowly and trying not to look at the sky the heat was so fierce that the sea had no colour and merged into the sky like blinding silver he thought of writing something in his little book and knew it was getting harder every time to concentrate on the useless empty words the oarsmen lay across the looms faces pressed on their arms the others either crouched against the side of the hull to try and find some shade or slept where they sat like dead men viola raymond was beside and a little below him she was wearing his uniform coat having removed her torn and stained gown to wash it in salt water as he looked down at her seeing the autumncoloured hair tied back across the collar he thought she could have been a captain she seemed to feel him looking at her and reached out to touch his hand but she did not look up like her companions she found the glare too painful too demanding on whatever energy she still had how much rest will you give them her voice was low but it no longer mattered no eyes watched them together and when they touched or held hands it was accepted part of their total strength as it was part of his he slitted his eyes measuring the suns angle not much longer viola we are making less headway every day he wiped his forehead with his sleeve the movement making the sweat pour down his chest and thighs it had been four agonizing days since they had left the little island where they had buried evans days and nights of unrelenting sapping work pulling and bailing trying to snatch a few moments for sleep and then starting all over again he considered their present circumstances they had left the pier eight days ago it was incredible even to think of the slow wretched miles which marked their progress the water was down to a gallon if that the salt pork was merely a fistful of rockhard fragments he had issued most of the wine in small cupfuls and they had been lucky enough to hit and kill a noddy two days back the bird had been divided as before and the blood given to the worstoff the latter now included a seaman called robinson who was suffering severely from both sun and thirst and penneck whose spear wound showed signs of poisoning the ships caulker was the only one who was rarely silent day or night he moaned and sobbed feeling his dressing around his throat and occasionally falling into semiconsciousness still groaning bolitho tightened the grip on her fingers his eyes smarting as he thought of her husband and his callous indifference his refusal to think of anything but himself how do you feel he waited knowing she was preparing her reply then added the truth now she returned the pressure on his hand well enough captain she looked up at him shading her eyes do not fret so we will get there youll see allday stirred and shook himself like a dog ready lads penneck started to groan again and blissett said savagely stow it matey in the name of pity quare removed his red coat and folded it carefully before taking over an oar easy now blissett the poor devil cant help himself out oars bolitho watched them seeing their despair as they struggled with the long oars even thrusting them out through the rowlocks seemed as much as they could manage now give way all bolitho peered down at the compass north maybe they would all die and tuke would fall upon the settlement just as he had always intended bolitho had once found a drifting boat full of dead sailors he often wondered who was the last to die what it must have been like to drift helplessly with men you had known and having seen them go one by one wait for your own summons he tried to shake himself out of his depression and concentrated on millers makeshift sail it did little to add to their speed but by helping to steady the hull it made the oarsmens work a bit easier bolitho took out his glass and trained it across the starboard beam just over the seas edge he saw a hint of purple a long flat island he felt his heart quicken they were not lost he remembered it from the description on his chart she stirred against him what is it he kept his voice level another island many miles away and too far to use what strength we have to visit it but it means we are making progress once or twice i thought he looked down at her and smiled i should have trusted your judgement he turned his attention to his men again pyper was doing his best not to show it but he was in a bad way blistered by the sun his shoulder like raw meat through a rent in his shirt he looked near to collapse none of them had any moisture in their bodies perhaps evans was the lucky one after all quietly he said we must have water i cant ask these men to go on until they drop she nodded slowly i will pray he watched her bowed head the hot breeze ruffling her hair across the blue coat and almost broke down he had brought all of them to this she especially would suffer because of her love the remainder would die because he had decreed it there she looked up at him it is done now i will see to the dressings she touched her gown as it lay drying on the thwart i will use some of this after today poor penneck has used almost the last of the bandages she stood up swaying with the boat until keen put up his hand to steady her she smiled at him thank you val it was her special name for him and bolitho saw her receive the same grateful look next to himself keen had better cause than anyone to remember her kindness sergeant quare had to clear his parched throat twice before he could speak will i start to divide the rations sir even he looked dejected almost beaten bolitho felt suddenly desperate yes one cup per man half water half wine he nodded heavily i know sergeant it is the last of it as viola reached the sick and injured men penneck seized her borrowed coat and babbled wildly dont let me die please dont let me die he was pleading his voice rising to a thin shriek colter the wounded seaman snarled i wish to god e would die ell drive us all mad that e will that will do bolitho stood up his mind aching and throbbing orlando hold that mans arms while his dressing is changed he watched her above the slowmoving oars in her captains coat her legs as bare as any sailors she looked even more beautiful she paused with her work while orlando pushed penneck against the gunwale and thrust some loose hair from her face again their eyes met and she smiled at him blissett pulled his oar across the boat and snatched up a musket nother bird sir he fired but the bird continued as before quare flung another musket to him and with barely a pause blissett fired again the seabird dropped close abeam and within ten minutes had been divided and eaten as they sipped their watered wine and tried not to swallow it in one gulp pyper said brokenly when i get back to the ship ill never complain again bolitho watched him seeing how close he was to breaking almost gently he said you will be all right mr pyper you said when not if hold on to it with all your strength and that applies to the rest of us thank you mr pyper i feel somewhat better now allday looked up from his oar and smiled sadly inwardly he felt he could weep for the lady in his captains coat for young pyper for billyboy who was trying so desperately not to show his distress from his wounded leg but most of all for the captain he had watched him day after rotten day using every trick everything he had learned and experienced since first going to sea at the age of twelve just to hold them all together in the line of battle it was terrible but the suffering and hardship made some sort of sense to the survivors but this was a side of the navy which landsmen never knew of and cared about even less and yet the rules were the same and the burden to each commander just as definite bolitho looked at him perhaps feeling his thoughts ready for another pull allday allday smiled sharing the game aye captain if youd care to join us poor sailormen jenner managed to give a croaking laugh and miller said anyway sir you dont wear a captains coat no longer eh bolitho seated himself on the thwart beside allday while pyper took over the tiller he had to ask what dyou think allday the broad shoulders gave a slight shrug they say the devil looks after his own i reckon we stand a chance and thats no error bolitho laid back on the oar shutting his eyes to the pitiless sun no more water and just a few coconuts and some biscuits and yet they still trusted him it did not make any sense he thought of pypers pathetic courage and made himself say when not if his oar blade collided with another and he realized he had almost fallen asleep or into a daze the realization helped to sharpen his thoughts again and he heaved on the oar with unexpected vigour when next he glanced outboard he saw there was quite a sharp wash coming back from the stem to mark their efforts he closed his eyes tightly and thrust down on his loom when not if a power of strength two nights after bolitho had issued the last of the wine and water a storm broke over them with such ferocity he thought that everything was finished it hit the cutter shortly after nightfall and transformed the sea into a crazy torment of bursting waves with crests large enough to swamp almost anything hour after hour stumbling and failing in swirling water they fought to keep the boat from broaching to millers sail complete with its spar was torn away into the sprayfilled darkness within minutes while loose gear clothing and one of the oars followed soon after it was a frantic unyielding struggle for survival no orders were given and none expected the weary battered men bailed or stood to their oars blinded by spray almost deafened by the thunder of bursting crests and the jubilant wail of the wind and then as bolitho sensed a slight easing in the winds force the rain came slowly at first the heavy drops striking their heads and bodies like pellets and then with a hissing roar the very weight of which seemed to beat the waves into submission he yelled hoarsely quick lads the rain it was pitiful to watch as they floundered in the waterlogged boat groping for canvas pannikins anything which would catch the precious rain the sick and injured and the handful of men on the oars kept their faces turned into the downpour eyes tightly shut mouths wide to receive what must seem like a miracle bolitho dashed water from his face and hair and said viola your prayer was answered they reached out blindly their hands meeting and slipping in an onslaught of rain and sea if only it had come sooner and had spared them the last agonizing day they had drained the last of the coconuts and then broken the shells to try and suck moisture from the fruit itself in the afternoon while the boat had drifted beamon to the sea their torpor had been broken by an insane yell from penneck he had cried water in the name of jesus and before anyone could move he had dragged himself up and over the gunwale floundering wildly yelling and weeping while the boat had drifted away from him where he had gathered the strength bolitho had been unable to imagine but as he had swung the tiller and the blistered oarsmen had come back to life orlando had risen in the bows and had dived cleanly overboard penneck had been hauled roughly over the stemhead with little pity for his injury his thirstmaddened action had cost far more than a loss of strength and progress for even as orlando had paddled towards the boat supporting the raving penneck the shark had struck with the speed of a batteringram helpless the rest of them had watched the water frothing bright red and had seen orlandos upturned features contorted in agony his poor mouth open in a silent scream then mercifully he had been dragged down even as blissett had fired a ball at the telltale dorsal fin allday called th winds dropping captain like the rest he was wringing wet hair plastered across his forehead his shirt moulded to him like another skin yes bolitho came out of his thoughts slowly penneck now lay in the bottom of the boat his arms tied but his legs jerking in irregular convulsions as he gaped at the clouds and giggled while he let the rain sluice over him orlando was gone rather as he had first come amongst them from the sea and back to it nobody knew any more about him than when he had been rescued only that he was grateful to remain with them as his friend jenner had said brokenly at least the poor devil was happy while he was with us sir when he was given the job of being your servant he was fair bustin with pride bless him unconsciously bolitho spoke aloud aye bless him allday stared at him captain i was thinking adding another name to my list when dawn came up with its breathtaking haste it was as if little had changed during the night the clouds were gone and the seas face was as before in regular undulating swells as the sun rose and felt its way into the boat the woodwork and the dazed occupants steamed as if about to burst into flames they peered around at their tiny world examining each other looking for signs of hope or the opposite they had collected over ten gallons of water and there was still a little rum for those who needed it most the food was gone and unless blissett was able to shoot another bird things would quickly deteriorate the only noticeable change from yesterday was that the shark no longer followed them that too was strange and to some chilling it was as if it had been waiting to collect orlando for the ocean he had cheated for just a short while keen joined him during one of the short rests he looked fitter than most of them although his arms were burned by the sun and blotchy from salt sores he said we saved the compass sir bolitho kept his voice down have you noticed the driftwood he watched keen as he shaded his eyes towards the glittering horizon little pieces of flotsam floated towards the boat black in the harsh light there were birds too but too far off for even a lucky shot keen looked at him his face incredulous land sir bolitho wanted to contain it in case he was wrong but he looked along the boat and knew they could not last another day with good news they might be able to hang on he nodded close yes i believe so viola stood up and laid her hand on his shoulder the other on keen she did not speak but looked steadily towards the horizon her hair lifting and falling over the coat bolitho watched her loving her fascinated by her inner strength despite the sun and what she must have endured she looked pale compared with keen and the others he had only seen her break down once since leaving the islands and that had been when orlando had been killed she had said he could not speak he could not even cry out and yet i seem to remember his voice she said nothing more until the storm had burst over them they were all looking at him now and even penneck had fallen silent he saw that the marine called billyboy was sharing an oar with pyper his injured leg propped on a musket the other wounded seaman colter had drawn enough strength from his ration of water to help look after penneck and the one named robinson who was in a very low state but they were not so ill they could not sense something was happening bolitho said i believe we are near land whether we are close to rutara island i am uncertain for with storm and drift and denied even a sextant it is like groping in the dark but whatever island we sight we will land and secure food after what we have seen and suffered together i think it will take more than hostility to prevent us big tom frazer his eyes red with strain stood up and bellowed a cheer for the capn lads huzza bolitho could only stare at them it was terrible to witness these gaunt blistered unshaven men trying to stand at their oars and cheer he raised his voice enough save your strength he had to turn away but i thank you keen cleared his throat and said out oars he met violas gaze and smiled like a conspirator give way all by late afternoon blissett and then sergeant quare were luckier with their marksmanship one noddy and then a booby fell to their muskets and although it took longer this time to reach them they were retrieved and eaten with a full ration of water then as the sun touched the horizon miller shouted land sir fine on th starboard bow all thought of order and discipline broke down as they stood in the swaying boat as if by so doing they might see it more clearly bolitho held her arm and watched with the others land it was we will reach it tomorrow he nodded firmly then we shall see she answered simply i never doubted you could do it while keen restored the stroke to the oars and the cutter started to move ahead again bolitho sat beside her in the sternsheets as they had done every day since their journey had begun she leaned against him bolithos coat tightly drawn around her her own clothing like most of the articles in the boat had gone outboard in the storm hold me i feel cold richard he put his arm round her it would get even colder during the night and protest or not he would force her to take some rum but when he cradled her against him he could feel the heat from her body like fire he said soon now well build a fire then we will find the ship i know she moved closer and rested her head on his chest a big fire the boat settled down for another night quare and blissett examined the muskets and powder keen made certain penneck was still secured in case he should throw himself overboard again but there was a different air in the boat not the fear and dread of another dawn but a strange confidence in what it would bring for them lieutenant thomas herrick moved restlessly about tempests quarterdeck at anchor and despite the spread awnings and windsails the ship was like a furnace and only deep below on the orlop deck or in the holds could you find relief he had been in charge of the frigate for fifteen days and should have been satisfied with the way he had handled her and the fact that nothing untoward had occurred but being herrick he felt like half a man and even now whenever he heard a footfall on the companionway he almost expected to see bolitho emerge on deck his grey eyes moving automatically from one end of his ship to the other he walked to the nettings and looked at the island with something like hatred to most people it would appear much as any other small point of land in the great south sea to him it was a mocking challenge a millstone which held him helpless he saw tempests launch pulling lethargically between ship and shore the sunlight glinting on weapons for although they had found no sign of the french frigate or tukes schooners they had company just the same large war canoes crammed with dark figures had moved as near as they dared watching or waiting for tempests men to break the sanctity of their island by stepping ashore his mind returned frequently to the settlement and he wondered what was happening no sign of the fever had appeared on board so it seemed likely it was of a local nature and could bring down only those closely exposed to it and who lacked the toughness of the average sailor he had discussed it with the surgeon several times but he had been unhelpful he had explained to an impatient herrick that a sniff of a cold which would do no harm to a country parson in england could kill every man woman and child on one of the islands if the conditions were right for it on the other hand no european could withstand the terrible torture of some initiation ceremonies which were performed and accepted without a murmur gwyther had said it is all a question of balance you see herrick mopped his face question of balance indeed borlase appeared on deck and watched him guardedly have you made a decision mr herrick not yet herrick tried to turn it aside in his mind it was fifteen days since he had left the levu islands and had watched bolitho being pulled ashore he ought to have heard something by now he wondered what bolitho would say when he discovered about the letter in his own round handwriting herrick had written a private report for commodore sayer at sydney and had sent it across to the brig pigeon before she had weighed anchor herrick knew about courts martial and boards of enquiry he understood that something in writing put down at the time of the events under examination carried far more weight than a carefully worded document written much later when the man concerned knew which way the cat would jump although what notice anyone would take of the view of a lowly lieutenant was harder to understand but the thought of that pig raymond using his influence and guile to destroy bolitho was something he would not stand by and watch he looked at borlase waiting with his childlike smile i have carried out the captains orders but there has been not even a smell of narval or the pirates if there had been a sea fight wed have discovered something surely driftwood corpses something herrick forced himself to think back he had found hardacres small schooner off north island but her master had nothing to report he had been very glad to see herrick happier still to be ordered to the settlement there were too many war canoes in the vicinity for his liking it was more than probable bolitho would send the schooner back again here to rutara with fresh instructions he shook his head angrily no he was doing it again shutting his eyes turning from responsibility he considered it more calmly it could happen at any time in a manofwar by accident in battle or from disease a captain might die then his subordinate took charge and so on there was no other way and here thousands of miles from anywhere it was his own burden now he said abruptly i will weigh tomorrow he saw borlases eyes sharpen that schooner should have brought us news borlase let his lashes hide his eyes it is a heavy decision for you god damn it dyou think i dont know that you fool borlase flushed i am sorry you take that attitude sir good herrick saw actinglieutenant swift walking wearily along the larboard gangway he was on watch it was like having a wardroom full of children and old men herrick thought angrily mr swift he saw the youth jump recall the boat and change crews it is your job to remember these things ross the big masters mate who was also appointed actinglieutenant by bolithos order strolled across to him herrick glowered and dontyou start asking what i am going to do ross kept his face stiff och sir i had no such intention there was a scuffle of feet by the entry port and then swift ran aft his sunreddened face alive with excitement sir the sentry saw two men on the island as i hailed the guard boat they seemed to appear out of nowhere herrick snatched the glass and trained it on the shore for a moment he could not find anything because of a dancing haze which made the low hills quiver like jelly then he saw them two staggering bewildered figures lurching against one another sometimes falling only to rise up and continue towards the sea like two drunken scarecrows he thought ross said sharply those canoes have sighted em sir herrick swung his telescope round like a swivel gun masts rigging and then open water sweeping through the powerful lens and then settling on the nearest canoes a mile distant but there was no doubting their purpose they must have seen the men on the island too the closest canoe was a grand affair with a great castlelike structure in its stern decorated with manowar birds feathers and richly carved must be all of forty feet long he thought with professional interest he barked rouse the hands but dont send them to quarters tell mr brass to clear away whatever twelvepounder he thinks fit to bear on those fellows ill have no nonsense from them calls trilled below his feet and seamen and marines appeared from all directions borlase remarked theyre both white men anyway the guard boat still unaware of the two men ashore pulled gratefully into tempests shadow herrick ran to the gangway and as he leaned out under an awning felt the sun on his neck like a branding iron schultz the german boatswains mate was peering up at him herrick yelled go back and lie offshore tell those two men to swim out to you put one of yours overboard if need be but keep the boat away from the beach the heads in the launch swivelled from the island to the canoes and back again herrick added and schultz let somebody else do the hailing ja zur i understand he grinned god herrick went into the shade again this damned heat he looked up at the loosely brailed sails ready to release and set in minutes tempest was desperately shorthanded but as prepared to give fight as any ship could be a gunport opened and one of the twelvepounders trundled squeakily into the sunlight mr brass the gunner stood hands on hips watching the selected crew loading and ramming home a black shining ball beside the gunner midshipman romney small and delicate against the muscular seamen was trying not to get in anybodys way ready sir herrick nodded the canoes were much closer the paddles rising and dipping in perfect unison he shivered despite the heat he remembered other times when he had watched them without the stout timbers of a ship to protect him may i speak sir it was a young seaman called gwynne one of the volunteers herrick had signed on from the eurotas he had settled in well and seemed quite happy with his somewhat harsher surroundings yes gwynne the seaman shifted awkwardly on his bare feet as the officers clustered around him even prideaux was here now his foxy face set in disapproval them two fellows sir i knows em theym off eurotas same as me herrick stared at him take the glass man have another look prideaux said softly if it is true they must have changed sides when tuke captured the ship in the first place i know that herrick controlled his frayed temper bring them aft when they get on board gwynne nodded firmly aye sir tis them right nough tall ones latimer e was a foretopman a simple sort tother is mossel ablebodied seaman he grimaced a proper gallowsbird that one borlase puffed out his cheeks and that is precisely where he will end herrick nodded to gwynne thank you that is most helpful he looked at the two figures who were wading and suddenly swimming towards the boat the bottom shelved steeply and swiftly as herrick had discovered when he had anchored but schultz had reached the two struggling swimmers canoes sheering off sir herrick peered towards the sleek canoes and their busy paddles maybe they had been waiting to capture these two scarecrows for themselves herrick thought of what tinah had said about the militia lieutenant baked alive in clay it was too horrible even to consider he called secure the gun no sense in wasting a good ball brass touched his forehead he looked disappointed herrick thought he saw the surgeon and one of his loblolly boys waiting at the gangway bring them to me when youre satisfied gwyther stared at him they may be very ill sir you said there was no water on the island surely i said satisfied mr gwyther herrick was not prepared for another question of balance i did not mean when they have had a months rest in the cabin he sat at bolithos desk while cheadle the clerk knelt by a small chest sorting through papers like a ghoul over a coffin captain prideaux rapped on the door ready mr herrick the two men came into the cabin blinking dully and being half supported by pearse the ships corporal and scollay the masteratarms gwyther hovered in the rear like an anxious bird he said i suggest they be allowed to sit down sir herrick regarded the two men coldly when i am ready they were in a bad way gaunt and wildeyed their mouths and much of their skin were covered with sores their lips cracked by thirst he remembered what gwynne had said of mossel and could well believe it squat and beetlebrowed it could not have taken much to change him into a pirate herrick said you are from the eurotas he saw the dazed exchange of glances so you can spare me the story you were going to tell about being shipwrecked mariners and how you were the only survivors it has been tried before by cleverer and more believable rascals the tall gangling seaman called latimer tried to step towards the desk but scollay snarled stand still you bugger latimer said in a husky terrified voice it wasnt my fault sir prideaux was watching him fixedly his fingers stroking the hilt of his sword it never is the man continued wretchedly they took over the ship afore we could do anythin i was plannin to elp rescue the capn but the one called mossel grated hold yer tongue you fool herrick regarded him thoughtfully they must have been hiding on the island for days fearful of the watchful canoes and hoping against hope that a ship would pass close enough to rescue them but not a kings ship only thirst and the grim realization they would not stay alive much longer had forced them to reveal themselves he said quietly send for the boatswain he saw midshipman fitzmaurice in the doorway my compliments to mr jury tell him i wish to have a halter run out to the mainyard immediately the effect was immediate latimer fell on his knees sobbing its not right sir please dont ang me tothers forced me into it we ad no choice herrick said there are plenty of men who did not join the pirates and are alive to say so fitzmaurice asked politely shall i tell the boatswain sir let me consider herrick watched latimer being hauled to his feet mossel said well ang anyways so what the ell he winced as the ships corporal drove his fist into his side herrick stood up sickened at latimers grovelling and his own part in bringing it about but time was running out there was more at stake than the neck of a bloody mutineer he snapped take him outside to latimer he added and you sit on that chest ill not have your filth on the captains furniture as the door closed behind the other man latimer asked timidly you are not the capn then sir no so you see what my captain knows nothing of will not disturb him i can hang you here and now and no one will care a jot i can take you back to land and say that you er aided my enquiries and they will believe it the captain is bound by certain rules i am not he watched the lie exploring the mans mind then he shouted so tell me damn you or you will dance on air before eight bells the story which latimer blurted out was as fantastic as it was frightening in his cracked husky voice the man who had been a foretopman under the murdered captain lloyd told of his service aboard one of the pirate schooners the one which was commanded by mathias tuke feared and with good reason tuke nevertheless built a sort of respect amongst his men latimer told of his attack on an island how he had landed guns and set fire to a village he described acts of murder and bestial cruelty which by his example had spread to his crew so that death became almost too commonplace to mention he explained that the frenchman yves genin had also been aboard but had taken no part in the killing and plunder he seemed to have some sort of understanding with his brutal companion latimer heard them having an argument one night after a whole day of drinking tuke had raved that he did not need genin at all that just the rumour of his being aboard was enough to entice that madman de barras into a trap genin had replied just as hotly that his own men aboard the narval would not act without his word herrick listened spellbound so that was it almost as bolitho had described it would be genin was bait but he had some of his followers already hiding amongst the french frigates company they probably signed on when de barras was chasing after his escaped prisoner latimer left the worst part until the end he said in his failing voice just afore tuke put us ashore e fell on the schooner from the settlement e tortured er master and threw im to the sharks but not afore ed discovered all about your ship and where you was e laughed like a madman and all the while e was burnin the schooners master with a red ot blade herrick stared at him so the schooner had never even reached the settlement tempest was up here and known to be here he asked anything more latimer looked at his tarry hands we took a small trader dutch i think she was she ad letters aboard news about the trouble in france god almighty the fat was in the fire now and then me and mossel was caught stealin from the booty sir capn tuke marooned us ere knowin there was no water an that them black devils would kill us if we tried to leave herrick nodded your captain tuke is a clever man he knew that we would come that we would think those canoes were watching for us and remain at anchor he looked at prideaux so when he passes the word to genins people aboard narval there will be a mutiny and in many ways i can understand that but a pirate he will remain prideaux shook his head i think not if he can make use of narval effect one great capture with her assistance he might well seek respectability and recognition and genin could give it to him herrick bit his lip mebbe but were not in henry morgans times now latimer was looking at them anxiously i did ear tell of some supply ships sir the dutch trader told tuke theyre comin round the orn on passage for new south wales herrick turned to prideaux again so there you have it hell find a new base for himself mount his captured guns and prepare to make the biggest capture of his life he glanced at the stern windows seeing the purple shadows feeling out from the land he made up his mind damn it captain prideaux well weigh tomorrow and return to the settlement i darent upanchor now and work through these reefs in the dark it was bad enough getting into the place an us sir herrick studied latimer for several seconds your companion will hang though not at my hands ill see what i can do for you you may have saved many lives it could help he turned away as the man was bustled weeping from the cabin prideaux said bitterly save lives by god were incapable of being anywhere in time now i think we should return to sydney let the commodore take the responsibility herrick felt better now he had made a decision without the schooner bolitho could not get word to him it was up to tempest to rejoin her proper commander no matter at what risk from fever he said pass the word for mr lakey i wish to discuss tomorrows sailing plans after that we will hold a conference in here alone in the cabin herrick walked to the windows and stared out at the restless water a light wind but there had been quite a storm the previous night a long way off but the sea had been choppy even here you could never be certain of weather lakey stepped into the cabin herrick said were going for the captain mr lakey the sailing master regarded him and answered dryly about time blissett halfstood and halfcrouched right in the cutters bows gripping the stemhead with his hands to retain his balance he was desperately tired and his stomach ached so much from hunger he felt sick and lightheaded at his back the oars rose and fell very slowly the stroke ragged and uncertain he gritted his teeth against the bitter cold in a matter of an hour of so it would be sunup and after that he tried not to think of it to concentrate on anything to stop his head from lolling he heard the occasional squeak of the tiller and pictured lieutenant keen sitting there using the stars to hold the boat roughly on course the violent storm had swept away the lamp for the compass and it took every ounce of skill to keep the boat from veering away the oarsmen too fatigued to notice which was why blissett was posted in the bows apart from being one of the strongest men in the boat his past life as a gamekeeper used to peering over long distances of his masters estate had blessed him with excellent eyesight he had no idea if the island they had sighted before nightfall was the one they wanted nor did he much care but it was more than possible worn out as they were that they might pull right past it in the darkness he yawned and tried to stop his shivering he could feel penneck watching him from the bottom of the boat wild crazy eyes you start your raving again and ill drive my musket into your mouth he stiffened as something white moved in the darkness but it was not a bird just a dart of spindrift whipped from the crest of a wave the sea already seemed brighter he thought anxiously the sun would come soon the suffering someone climbed over the thwart behind him and asked huskily nothing it was the sergeant getting ready to do his stint on an oar blissett shook his head dawn coming up aye quare sounded very low never mind sergeant blissett suddenly needed quare to be the same as he always was confident hard well manage quare smiled wearily grimacing at the pain in his sore lips if you say so blissett turned from him if quare really thought he froze blinking rapidly as something upset the seas regular pattern in a small voice he said sergeant up ahead its land he gripped quares arm please god tell me im right quare swallowed hard and nodded youre right lad i see it he swivelled round towards the stern land ho oars went momentarily out of control as men struggled to their feet or fumbled blindly across the thwarts bolitho could not move as he had been drowsing one arm around violas shoulders he said mr keen what dyou see but it was allday who replied its the one captain im sure he looked around the boat all those bloody islands but we found it several of them tried to cheer others wanted to weep but were too parched even for that bolitho said quietly wake viola you were right it must be rutara although it has to be some form of magic allday heard him and gave a great sigh rubbing his sore palms on his trousers he wanted to say something special at this moment to hold them all together long after the boat and the misery of their endurance would be faded in memory he stared at bolitho and then at viola raymond he had been holding her against him as he had for most of the night but now as he tried to rouse her her arm slipped from his grasp and hung down to sway with the boats unsteady motion then allday was on his feet his voice harsh as he called mr keen see to the captain he scrambled aft knocking men aside ignoring all of them as he added just do as i ask sir then he was by the tiller his arms around both of them as he exclaimed here captain its no use let me take herplease and as bolitho started to struggle he called hold him he turned his head his voice breaking for gods sake mr keen only then did keen understand he gripped bolitho around the shoulders while jenner seized him from the opposite side all he could say was i must do it sir i must i cant let you go allday gathered her up in his arms feeling her hair blowing across his face as he carried her to the middle of the boat her body was still warm but against his neck her face felt like ice he murmured to miller the anchor jack miller nodded as if like the rest he was struck dumb by what was happening their suffering the discovery of land it all meant nothing bolitho shouted no and allday heard his shoes slipping on the wet boards as the others held him there gently allday slipped bolithos coat from her body and held her above the gunwale while miller passed a bowline around her and attached it to the cutters anchor no shark or scavenger would disturb her now she was so light she barely made a ripple as he slipped her into the water and even as he watched he saw her pale shape fading into the depths until it was gone altogether then allday went aft and stood in front of bolitho powerful against the paling sky he said wretchedly use me as you will captain but it was for the best he laid the coat beside him shell rest easy now bolitho reached out and gripped his hand i know he could barely see i know keen said heavily man your oars the boat began to move again and as the frail daylight felt its way across the water bolitho looked astern and said but for me she would not have been here keen replied quietly but for her sir none of us would have survived half an hour later the light laid bare the island and close inshore her awnings and sails very clear against the land they sighted the tempest but this time there was no cheering and as they moved nearer hearing the sudden excitement on board the trill of calls and the sounds of a boat being lowered they were cruelly aware of loss rather than survival a boat from tempest reached them in minutes and took them in tow her crew suddenly aware of the silence as bolitho pulled himself up and through the entry port he was only dimly conscious of the pressing figures around and above him only one face stood out and as he gripped herricks hand he was unable to speak or to let go herrick watched him anxiously you came all that way sir what he turned as keen said the lady has just died sir within sight of this damned island then he hurried away herrick said we will speak later sir he beckoned urgently to the boatswain but the shocked and bewildered men were already being helped or hoisted inboard bolitho nodded to each man in turn as they were aided or shuffled past actinglieutenant pyper being carried by two seamen billyboy hopping with an arm around someones neck jenner and miller sergeant quare and the unbreakable blissett the frenchman lenoir and big tom frazer allday touched his forehead all hoisted inboard captain he watched him searching for some sign then he said you can be proud of what you did captain an thats no error then he too walked slowly towards the companion herrick followed bolitho aft past the silent watching faces he noticed the way he was carrying his coat as if it was the most precious thing he possessed he asked hesitantly do you have any orders sir he fell back as bolitho looked at him it can wait of course but it cannot mr herrick again the impetuous grip on his arm thomas we have work to do get the ship under way if you please we are returning to the levu islands as bolitho lowered himself through the companion lakey said in a fierce whisper five hundred miles mr herrick in that boat and with nothing much to sustain them either he shook his head they must have found a power of strength from somewhere herrick nodded sadly aye they did and now shes dead i could shoot myself for some of the thoughts ive had some of the things ive said he saw the boatswain watching him from the gangway mr jury be so good as to sink that cutter before we weigh but sir a boat any boat is valuable out here he sounded shocked in this case i think it best to destroy it herrick glanced at the cabin skylight i would to god i could destroy its memory also no retreat on the morning of the first full day at sea the wind backed considerably and with the sudden change came a heavy downpour of rain bolitho leaned over the stern bench and stared emptily through the thick windows his vision twisting and swirling as the rain swept across the water and pounded over the deck above he heard feet hurrying to various parts of his ship men watching over sundried cordage to ensure it did not swell enough to foul the blocks others would be collecting the rainwater to supplement their stocks he sat down wearily letting the vessel move his body without resistance in his screened sleeping compartment he could hear hugoe the wardroom servant completing his tidying collecting clothing to be washed herrick had suggested several men who would be willing or suitable to replace orlando but bolitho could not bear the thought of beginning again not yet hugoe was always in demand in the wardroom and was grateful to be freed from the cabin and its brooding captain he suspected rain gurgled down the scuppers or pattered happily across the sealed skylight wateryou were less than nothing without it he pictured the thirstcrazed man leaping overboard to fill his stomach from the sea orlandos terrible agony as the shark had crushed him into a bloody pulp he forced himself to take out his watch and hesitated further before he could open the guard even the engraving seemed to stand out sharper hugoe stood in the screen door ive done sir less theres owt in ere no you can carry on he saw the curiosity in his eyes thank you the marine sentry at the outer door shouted midshipman o th watch sir enter it was young romney very nervous as he presented a list of the days work from his first lieutenant the visitors would soon be arriving questions needs he scanned through herricks round handwriting very well romney hesitated one foot scraping over the other may i speak sir yes bolitho turned his back as if to watch the water streaming down the tall windows ii that is we sir want you to know how sorry bolitho gripped his hands tightly to his sides until he could face him again thank you mr romney he barely recognized his own voice it was most thoughtful romney watched him his eyes full of warmth like a dogs bolitho thought despairingly the surgeon peered through the door and bolitho snapped come in he would immerse himself in his duties and what he must plan ahead but the small touches of kindness which came without warning shattered his guard like a cutlass on a badly cast rapier bolitho listened to gwythers sick report the marine is doing well sir gwythers welsh accent was very pronounced it always was when he intended to act out of character but you seem not to have slept sir theres bad it is if i may presume to say so you may not he hurried through the list of names and penneck the surgeon sighed i fear his mind has broken sir and mr pyper is very sick from his exposure and burns but another sigh he is young herrick was the next visitor his conversation full of technicalities and requirements for keeping a ship of war in proper order although he did not mention anything about viola his blue eyes were incapable of concealing his anxiety bolitho stood up and walked to the quarter windows birds dipped and wheeled beneath the ships counter waiting for scraps watching for incautious fish he thought of blissett his perfect aim despite his own suffering he asked did you tell prideaux that i expect him to promote blissett directly aye sir herrick shifted as bolitho turned to look at him in case he was about to argue the toss i told him it was neither a suggestion nor a request but that it was a bloody order sir i hope that was all right yes he looked up as more feet pounded overhead herrick explained i told mr lakey that you want as much sail as we can spread the hands are turning to in both watches he tried to smile to break through bolithos ache being the master of course he wasnt too pleased to drive her in this rain he waited wondering how to continue i can manage well enough sir no need to bother you until we sight the islands bolitho sat down on the bench and stared at the canvascovered deck we can exercise the twelvepounders as soon as the sails are trimmed as we are so shorthanded it will be necessary to shift the crews around again he pounded his hands together i want this ship ready to fight dyou understand look sir herrick stood his ground ive little love for the frogs as you well know but theyve been in their kings service too long to throw in their lot with a pirate surely bolitho eyed him gravely suppose i were to go on deck right now thomas and have all the hands lay aft and if i told them that we were already at war with france that england was depending on their courage and tenacity do you honestly believe there is one single man aboard including yourself who would dare to question it he shook his head do not bother to deny it it is on your face herrick watched him and marvelled how could he keep on worrying and altering the pattern of things uppermost in his thoughts he said if the frenchman genin can rouse the company against that tyrant of a captain theres nothing to prevent him telling them the same about us he pouted his lower lip but i still dont see why it will be his bargain with tuke the ships authority and genins safe passage set against tukes own reward supply ships gold patronage it matters little what does and will count is his need of a safe and powerful base herrick nodded glumly and there is nothing to prevent it cept us aye thomas one frigate against a flotilla our depleted company against seasoned maltreated veterans there was a cry from overhead and feet shuffled impatiently herrick was needed but he was unable to break the spell of bolithos icy determination as he added but we will prevent it we will use what we have to destroy the pirate and everyone who stands with him in months if not already we may be at war with france again and i have no intention of allowing narval the pleasure of fighting us in the future he looked away i should have seen it before much earlier but i was like le chaumareys too sure of my own capacity he smiled but the warmth avoided his eyes go to your men thomas i will be up when you begin the drills herrick replied simply i have not spoken before sir but i owe it to you now and to the lady more than ever i was wrong to criticize and had no place to act as i did your need of each other is made so plain to me now for i see what her loss has meant i am sorry not just as a loyal subordinate but still i hope as a firm friend bolitho nodded the lock of hair dropping over his eyes my wrong was the greater i should have taken your advice those five years back and again just months ago because of my want i put her life in danger because she trusted me she is now dead he turned his back please leave me herrick opened his mouth and closed it again he had never seen him like this before pale despite his tanned skin his eyes ringed with shadows like a man possessed on deck he could not even find reassurance in the way that the company was arranged to allow for the shortages he saw blissett standing with the marines at the hammock nettings his musket at his side apart from looking thinner he showed little sign of his ordeal he remarked i am glad to see you well corporal blissett blissett beamed sir for him life had suddenly expanded another step herrick walked to the quarterdeck rail the last heavy drops of rain tapping down on men and sails alike it would soon be as hot as hell he glanced at the upturned faces on the gundeck the barebacked topmen who waited on either gangway ready to swarm aloft and loose the topgallants when ordered a good company he thought as mixed as a crowd at a prizefight but none the worse for it they had somehow come together learned to accept if not agree with the manner in which they served he felt he should say something tell them just how much they would have to give and withstand if bolitho was right there was a step on the deck behind him and bolitho said there seems to be a delay mr herrick herrick looked at his eyes grey and steady but something else as well challenging or was it pleading he touched his hat i thought youd be staying below for a while sir bolitho looked slowly across the silent men and the ship herself as she laid over on the larboard tack my place is here he rested his hands on the rail feeling the ship trembling through it passing the unending messages to anyone who would listen he recalled violas expression when he had explained how a ship performed and responded at first he had been almost shy a boy again as he had described what to him was his everyday life and she had not been bored nor had she been politely interested in time they could have shared it planted something as firm and as lasting as the old house in falmouth but now he said abruptly carry on mr herrick hands aloft and loose tgallants if you please the shrouds and ratlines became alive with scurrying figures and the urgent shouts of petty officers shattered the calm and sent the seabirds screaming across tempests bubbling wake bolitho began to pace up and down the weather side a vital presence and to all but those who knew him intimately as outwardly calm as ever but each step was painful and although his men bustled around him or slithered down backstays to attend further tasks and while canvas boomed and hardened to the wind captain richard bolitho walked entirely alone tempest made a fast run south to the levu islands and although they sighted no craft larger than an occasional canoe bolitho had the feeling that every mile of their progress had been watched he knew that most of the ships company were trying to keep their distance and avoid his eye in many ways the isolation amongst his closely packed world suited him and yet he was equally conscious of his responsibility to them especially with what might be lying ahead tomorrow next week to be feared by the men whose lives he held in his hands was totally repugnant to him he saw the glances searching for his daily reaction to their needs sail and gun drill working aloft or about the decks he knew they watched after he had passed them by concerned or merely curious envious despite his grief for all his privileges compared with their spartan existence on the last day as tempest worked slowly towards the mushroomshaped bay her courses brailed up and two leadsmen in the chains he watched the island taking shape in the early light very aware of his own mixed feelings the masthead had reported smoke soon after dawn and as the light strengthened over the humped hills and brought reflections back to the water he saw a drifting pall above the bay like a low cloud deepbellied with rain herrick said from the settlement by the look of it sir bolitho said it would seem so he examined his feelings again did he want to find raymond already dead or was he merely seeing the smoke as proof that he was right about tuke and the narval above all about his own part yet to come he said abruptly give me a glass he took it from midshipman romney and trained it on the land as the telescopes eye passed over the bay he saw the remains of eurotas glistening above the surface like decayed teeth he had almost forgotten about it and the sight cut into him like a dirk it brought back too many memories of that night they had left the bay more afraid of being fired on by raymonds orders than the ordeal which they were only just beginning he moved the glass until he found the settlement the smoke was from some outbuildings probably the ones which had been built for the convicts there were several holes in the palisades too the work of heavy guns but the flag was still there he closed the glass angry with his acceptance never again send the hands to quarters mr herrick we will anchor two cables from the pier i need to be able to leave with haste he shut his ears to the squeal of calls the immediate rush of feet along gangways and decks on the forecastle peering over the bows was borlase with the anchor party he turned startled by the sudden commotion and bolitho wondered briefly if he thought his captain was going mad or had suffered so much in the open boat that he was beyond a proper decision herrick hurried across the quarterdeck and touched his hat hands at quarters sir he asked shall we clear for action not yet bolitho lifted the glass again and saw several barebacked figures ducking through the bushes above the nearest beach so tinahs village was not entirely destroyed he found he was giving thanks grateful they had been spared he lowered the glass and saw keen on the gundeck shading his eyes to stare ashore thinking of his beautiful malua remembering the dream lakey cleared his throat noisily were losing the wind sir bolitho turned and saw the land sliding out to shield them and heard the topsails banging restlessly overhead very well we will anchor now a long pull for the boats crews equally it gave tempests guns command of the whole bay man th lee braces hands wear ship bolitho took a few paces aft and watched his men even more shorthanded with the bulk of the company standing at quarters in case the guns were needed they had learned a great deal together in two years heavy she might be for a frigate but she had been good to them seamen worked feverishly at sheets and clewlines while others pulled on the braces to bring the yards round together helm alee bolitho crossed the deck so that he could keep a continued watch on the shore and the pier below the settlement let go he barely heard the anchor fall as he said i shall need my gig also the launch and full landing party of marines prideaux will take charge of them personally he beckoned to allday make sure the gigs crew are properly turned out he saw the surprise or was it hurt in his face and added i know youd already so ordered but this has to look right he saw the marines tramping from their stations on the poop and in the tops sergeant quare shouting commands his face so blistered from the open boat that it almost matched his coat herrick watched the boats being swayed over the nettings jury the boatswain urging the lowering party with a voice like an angry bullock it looks as if there has been an attack on the settlement sir yes bolitho lifted his arms as allday buckled on his sword it proves we were right tuke is after this place for himself he must have used the captured cannon to give raymond a warning herrick licked his lips he seems to have an edge on us every time sir bolitho walked to the gangway and looked down at the boats but for one thing he seized hardacres schooner and knows all about your message i am deeply sorry sir i thought bolitho took his arm no thomas it is our only strength tuke will think of you still anchored off rutara island afraid to disobey orders even fearful that the itak may have overrun the settlement also he will know that without the schooner there is no sensible way of carrying messages between ship and settlement herrick stared at him id have thought the same in his shoes he shook his head an open boat with barely enough water and food to last a few days and through dangerous islands at that well i can see his point of view it changes nothing bolitho watched the launch packed with marines as it pulled clear of the ship and waited for the gig to move alongside it does give us time but for this i fear the island would already have fallen borlase called all ready sir what are my instructions sir herrick walked with him to the entry port the usual a good lookout and with maybe six guns permanently manned if all is safe ashore i shall want a lookout posted on the hill he lowered himself into the boat while the trill of calls still hung on the humid air borlase asked irritably why all the show of strength the marines the gigs oarsmen in their best chequered shirts it is more like a courtesy visit than a preparation for evacuation herrick studied him calmly evacuation never this is the captains way of showing that no matter what others may think or dread tempest is as before a ship of war mr borlase not a hull full of frightened old women keen joined them by the entry port and asked who has gone with the captain herrick replied shortly mr swift good experience for him when he does pass for the rank he has borrowed he turned aside remembering bolithos words in the cabin before dawn not mr keen thomas it is too soon hell see his malua by every tree hear her voice no he needs time ill take young swift herrick sighed how typical he thought he watched the boats pulling into line and turning towards the pier and how much worse it will be for him bolitho stood beside one of the long windows in raymonds room and listened to the insane screech of birds in the dense undergrowth he was surprised at his own calm his inability to feel either disgust or hatred as he watched raymond sitting at his carved table below the window he heard some marines tramping across the compound their voices and boots unnaturally loud in the time while he had been away as he and his boatload of men had fought out each painful day the settlement itself had gathered a kind of decay stores had been broached and empty bottles and casks lay everywhere even raymond had changed holloweyed and dishevelled his appearance made worse by his soiled shirt of all people he had altered the most bolitho had almost expected the gates to be held shut in his face had that happened he knew he would have been unable to restrain his feelings or those of his men raymond had been sitting at the table as he was now staring at the door perhaps he had never moved since the two boats had left under the cover of night he had said so you survived after all what are you going to do now hardacre had met the tempests boats at the pier and as they had walked together towards the palisades he had described in grim detail what had happened over a third of the islanders had died from the fever and while the guards had cowered behind their defences and had gone through one drunken escapade after another hardacre had done his best to give the others the will to survive raymond had even driven the convicts from the settlement and had ordered them to remain in their huts and manage as best they could on their own hardacre had helped them also and had been rewarded by their willingness to ignore raymonds unjust order and to assist him in the villages and then just two dawns ago the island had awakened to the violent crash of artillery the splintering destruction of trees as the balls had smashed across the bay from the headland a schooner had been anchored offshore and during the night some of tukes men had ferried two big guns on to the island ready to open fire as soon as they could determine the range it seemed that raymond had failed to see that sentries were posted and as neither of his corps officers had been sober enough to have taken much part in matters the attack had been swift and completely unexpected hardacre said bitterly it went on for two hours some of tinahs people were hurt and two killed the settlement was also hit but more as a threat than to do damage then they withdrew it may be that they got warning that tempest was returning but they did leave a message for raymond the message had been pinned to the mutilated corpse of a french officer the one named vicariot who had been de barrass senior lieutenant it had stated that if raymond and his defenders were to withdraw from the settlement they would be given safe conduct to another island to await rescue if they did not they would suffer vicariots fate as would all those who resisted them bolitho stood silently by the window thinking and remembering if tuke had known about tempests return he would have attacked earlier without waiting for dramatic gestures it seemed to be as much a part of the man as his cunning the ability to use savage cruelty to break down resistance before it had begun one thing was no longer in doubt narval was taken and the flag she would wear was immaterial her thirtysix guns backed up by whatever other forces tuke could offer would more than swamp the defences he asked quietly did you know about the village the numbers who died it was incredible and unnerving but not once had raymond asked about viola something seemed to snap and he said and your wife she died at sea just to say it aloud was like a betrayal to share her memory with this selfish vindictive man was more than he could bear he added harshly she had great courage raymond turned slowly on his chair his eyes in shadow as he answered i guessed as much she would rather have died with you than live with me he stood up violently and an empty bottle rolled unheeded from beneath his pile of documents youve heard about vicariot of the attack raymond spoke quickly as if afraid of interruption theyll come again i saw the frenchman they had mutilated everything but his face so i would know be in no doubt he swung round his features working wildly i have written orders for hardacre he will take over the settlement until he scattered the documents searching for the one which would give back hardacre all that he had lost except that it would be for a very short time now my guards will take the convicts aboard your ship today now in sydney there may be fresh instructions hardacre had remained silent until that point youd leave quit the settlement and lay us open to massacre no militia not even a schooner thanks to you bolitho looked at him his mind suddenly clear like brittle ice we are not leaving i too have a document he turned to raymond again remember sir my orders from you as to my duties here he walked to the window again and watched the fronds moving in the breeze we are not running i do not care what forces come against us i have listened for too long about the stupidity of sea officers the ignorance of common sailors but when things get bad they are the ones who seem so important all of a sudden i have heard you talking of war as if it were a game of a just war or a wasted one it seems to me that a just war is when you in particular are in jeopardy mr raymond and i am heartily sick of it raymond stared at him his eyes watering youre mad i knew it he waved an arm towards the wall youd throw away your life your ship everything for this dunghill of a place bolitho smiled briefly a moment ago you were its governor things were different then he hardened his voice well not to me the door banged open and captain prideaux marched into the room his boots clashing across the rush mats like several men at once i have examined the perimeter sir he ignored raymond my men are setting the convicts to work the breach in the northern palisade was the worst sergeant quare is dealing with it hardacre said i will speak with tinah he may be able to help no bolitho faced him suddenly glad of hardacres presence his strength if we fail as well we might i want his people spared if it is known they were aiding us they would have less chance than they do now hardacre watched him gravely that was bravely said captain i told you you are mad raymond was shaking his fists in the air and spittle ran down his chin as he yelled when this is over i will hardacre interrupted hotly you saw that french officer you damned fool therell be nothing left to hate or destroy if captain bolitho cannot defend us he strode to the door i will see what i can do to assist the marines swift coughed by the open door beg pardon sir but id like some advice on the best siting of the swivels at once mr swift bolitho turned on his heel wondering if both prideaux and swift had lingered nearby by arrangement fearing that he might fall upon raymond and kill him he found his hatred for the man had gone raymond seemed already to have lost substance and reality at the darkest bend in the stairway he saw a quick movement and felt a girls hands gripping his arm as prideaux pushed between them cursing with surprise the hands slipped but still clung to bolithos legs then his shoes he said let her alone then he stooped and aided the girl to her feet the poor demented creature was staring at him her eyes brimming with tears bolitho said gently i loved her too it took all his strength to keep his voice level as you did but she shook her head and pressed her face against his hand allday was at the foot of the stairs she cant believe it captain he gestured to a marine take her to safety but dont touch her i cannot believe it either bolitho stood in the blazing sun his eyes smarting in the glare he realized dully that allday carried a bared cutlass he must have drawn it as the girl had hurled herself from the shadows to defend him he added simply who will take care of her allday i dunno captain he fell in step beside him there should be a place for everybody he looked away his voice suddenly husky the bloody world is big enough surely he sheathed his cutlass angrily im fair sorry about that captain i forgot myself bolitho said nothing i would have it no other way then he took the watch from his pocket and found he could do so without hesitation her strength was still with him he said come well go round the defences and see for ourselves allday grinned relieved and strangely moved aye captain as they walked towards the gates and a marine sentry stamped his boots together prideaux remarked gods teeth mr swift you would think they were on plymouth hoe the youth nodded aware he was seeing something fine and yet unable to put a name to it prideaux stared at him and exclaimed not you too be about your duties sir or actinglieutenant or not ill set my sword to your rump damme if i dont for the remainder of the day and all through the following one boats plied busily between tempest and the shore bolitho seemed to be everywhere listening to ideas which slow to come at first grew and became more adventurous at the slightest encouragement allday stayed with him the whole time guarding and worrying seeing the strain and determination laying firm hold in his captain he did not care that even the shamefaced members of the corps had returned to their duties at the settlement and had taken prideauxs orders without a murmur nor did he find comfort in the fact that even the laziest and most unreliable seaman was working through each watch without a rest and with little more than a grumble he knew better than most that without bolitho none of the plans would be worth more than a wet fuse as bolitho stood on the hillside watching the seamen gathering bales of dried grass and palm leaves or shoring up the battered palisade allday waited he saw the way he seemed to grow more content with each new challenge as if he was trying to please someone nobody else could see and he knew well enough who that was just before the darkness threw shadows over the bay the lookouts reported a sail to the east bolitho returned to his ship strangely calm and without any sort of tiredness the sand had run out and he was glad one way or the other they would end it here a stubborn man herrick hesitated by the screen door and watched bolitho for several seconds he must have fallen asleep at the desk and as he lay with his face pillowed on his arms the lantern which swung from the deckhead threw his shadow from side to side as if he and not the ship were moving its time sir herrick laid his hand on bolithos shoulder through the shirt his skin felt hot burning he hated disturbing him but even herrick would not risk his displeasure on this morning bolitho looked up slowly and then massaged his eyes thank you he stared around the dark cabin and then at the windows they too were black and held only the cabins reflections it will be dawn in half an hour sir ive sent the hands to breakfast like you said a hot meal and a tot to wash it down the cook will douse the galley fires when i pass the word he paused annoyed at the interruption as allday entered the cabin with a jug of steaming coffee bolitho stretched and waited for the coffee to burn through his stomach strong and bitter he imagined his men eating their extra ration of salt pork or beef jesting with each other about the unexpected issue of rum yet he had slept like the dead and had heard nothing when his ship had awakened to a new day for some if not all of them it might well be the last will i fetch hugoe captain allday poured some more coffee he had been out of his hammock and down to the galley for bolithos shaving water much earlier but showed little sign of fatigue no bolitho rubbed his hands vigorously up and down his arms he felt cold and yet his mind was crystalclear as if he had enjoyed a full nights sleep in his bed at falmouth hell be sorely needed in the wardroom allday showed his teeth knowing that was not the reason at all very well then ill get some breakfast for you bolitho stood up and walked to the windows i couldnt eat not today you must sir herrick gestured to allday and he left the cabin it may be a while before we get another chance true bolitho peered down at the water below the counter but there was only the merest glint to show the pull of the current it still surprised him at the speed with which the dawn broke many throughout the ship would be wishing it might never come he said quietly if we fail today thomas he stopped uncertain how to continue he did not wish herrick to accept a possibility of defeat but he needed him to know how much his friendship meant how it sustained him herrick protested bless you sir you mustnt talk like that bolitho turned and faced him there is a letter in the strongbox for you he held up his hand if i fall i want you to know that i have arranged some benefits for you herrick strode to him and exclaimed ill hear no more sir iill not have it bolitho smiled so be it he walked up and down the cabin i would it were as cold as this for a whole day a seafight is blistering enough without the suns distractions herrick dropped his gaze bolitho was shivering badly lack of sleep total exhaustion from the open boat it was all starting to show he said ill be off sir yes we will go to quarters as soon as they have eaten he saw herricks apparent satisfaction and waited for him to leave then he sat down and started to go over his plans again searching for flaws or improvements he poured another mug of coffee picturing his ship as she lay in darkness two guard boats pulled around her at all times while on shore prideaux had mounted pickets to patrol the beach and headland they would have to be withdrawn when it was light tempest was so shorthanded whereas the enemy he shivered and drained the last of the coffee enemy how easily the word came he recalled the french he had seen when he had visited narval with such cruel treatment they would probably have mutinied anyway revolted against de barras and his sadism the uprising in france gave them even wider scope for vengeance a battle would seem a small price to pay for their release bolitho tried to form an image of tuke but the memory of the livid brand on violas shoulder made him close his mind to him instead he thought of her hanging on to each detail afraid something might be lost in his memory allday brought his breakfast but said nothing as bolitho pushed it aside in silence he shaved him and brought a clean shirt from the chest as he had seen noddall do so many times the ship felt very quiet with just the sluggish motion and the creak of timbers to break the stillness light filtered through the windows and across the chequered canvas of the deck bolitho slipped into his coat and grimaced at himself in the bulkhead mirror in the weak light he looked pale so that his coat and breeches and the gold lace stood out in sharp contrast allday said quietly weve stood like this a few times captain he glanced up at the skylight as feet moved restlessly overhead i never get used to it bolitho felt his coat glad of it for once to hold the chill at bay until the sun rose above the islands once again nor i the door opened slightly and midshipman fitzmaurice poked his pugface around it the first lieutenants respects sir and he wishes to clear for action if it is convenient bolitho nodded conscious of the youths formality my compliments to mr herrick tell him i am ready moments later the stillness was broken by the twitter of calls the stamp of running feet and all the preparation for battle which to a landsman would appear no better than chaos the staccato beat of the two drums on the quarterdeck echoed around the bay reaching the settlement and further still to the village to the tired sentries on the headland and to the wounded marine called billyboy who had been given his own special task ashore and also to a wildeyed girl who lay alone in her hut her mind destroyed but her memory hanging on to the one person who had helped and protected her as the sun found the tempests main topgallant masthead and made the whipping pendant change from white to copper herrick touched his hat and reported cleared for action sir he said it proudly for despite his shortages the operation had been completed in less than fifteen minutes bolitho walked to the quarterdeck rail and looked down at the silent figures he recalled alldays remark weve stood like this a few times and his own response the shadowy figures below him and crouched around the quarterdeck would they understand when the call came he wondered if de barras was still alive how it must have been for him when the latent hatred had exploded into mutiny deck there ship to the eastrd at anchor sir bolitho walked to the nettings his hands behind his back still just the one bait perhaps to draw him into another trap a watchdog while others prepared a different form of attack it was too early even to guess he saw fitzmaurice speaking to the signals party and considered the change which had affected all of them swift now walked the gundeck with borlase and keen stood aft watching over the quarterdeck sixpounders he saw pyper too doubled up with pain from his burns and salt sores standing with the carronade crews on the forecastle he heard the american jenner say something to another seaman and half expected to see orlando with him he shivered boys into men men into oblivion the masthead again tis a schooner sir he would have a perfect view the strengthening glow directly behind the other vessel while tempest still lay in deep shadow bolitho said we will know soon what to expect aye sir herrick was on the opposite side of the deck and raised his voice so that it would carry more easily not really worth our while is she sir it brought a few laughs as both of them knew it would bolitho turned and saw ross watching him closely get aloft with a glass mr ross i want you to take your time examine the schooner as you have never done before he watched him thrust through the boarding nets and climb nimbly up the main shrouds the telescope bobbing on his shoulder like a poachers gun then he looked at the masthead pendant the wind had backed during the night but was steady enough from the northwest it was well sheltered in the bay but the schooner would not venture inside the reef and risk being grounded for she would be anchored right in the winds path everything must happen here hardacre had added his knowledge to lakeys and it was quite impossible for an attack to be launched overland from the other side of the island there was no safe landing place and the threat of attack from hostile natives no matter what tinah had promised would need treble the force which tuke and his men possessed sunlight slipped gently across the upper yards and sails and the hill above the settlement stood out from shadow as if detached from all else ross onetime masters mate now actinglieutenant called sharply from his high perch theyre lowering a boat sir more dragging minutes and then the boats standing in towards the reef his scottish voice was indignant as he added a flag o truce bgod bolitho looked at herrick the first move was about to begin the boat hoisted a small scrap of sail as soon as it was clear of the schooners side and as it gathered way bolitho recognized their intention to pass through the reef and enter the bay gig allday bolitho looked at herrick as the gigs crew scampered from their various stations i dont want them to see how thin we are on the ground signal the shore party they must act quicker than i had planned he knew herrick was forming a protest but brushed him aside and almost tumbled into the gig in his haste to get away quick as you can he gripped the gunwale as the oars dug into the water and sent the boat over a trough like an excited dolphin allday said god look at them he chuckled theyve just seen tempest the boat had certainly slowed its approach but after a momentary pause started to move again towards the surging water between the reefs as it drew closer bolitho saw it was crewed by a motley collection of men mostly bearded and as dirty as their boat but they were well armed and the tattered white flag which flew from the mast made the contrast more evident bolitho snapped tell them to heave to theyre near enough alldays hail and the fact the gigs crew were resting on their oars made the other boat rock dangerously in the steep swell as she idled beam on to the nearest spur of reef a powerful bearded figure with two crossbelts of pistols and pouches stood and cupped his hands he sounded english but was certainly not tuke bolitho wished he had brought a telescope but knew it was doubtful if he would have been able to use it the violent pitching of the gig and the rising nausea in his stomach would have seen to that the voice shouted harshly so you got here capn almost what raymond had said bolitho raised one hand his eyes watering in the pale sunlight the man continued the message stands as before you carry your people away an be damned to ye we are taking the island an you too if you stay an fight his words brought growls of anger from the gigs crew bolitho stood up carefully his hand gripping alldays shoulder then he shouted under what flag will you hoist your own cowardly rag or shall you hide under french colours despite the boom of surf on the reef he heard the confusion of voices from the other boat then the man called we have the narval youll live to regret your bloody arrogance capn he waved his fist and another figure was hauled upright from the bottom of the boat for an instant bolitho thought it might be de barras and then saw it was a young lieutenant his arms pinioned his face almost black with bruises another visual proof of victory bolitho glanced at his oarsmen seeing their mixed expressions of disbelief and horror bolitho shouted release him none of this is his doing and you know it the man laughed the sound distorted on the offshore wind dyou not know of the revolution capn he waved his hand over the boat these lads do an with bloody good cause eh so tuke had put some of the french sailors in each of his vessels it would be safer that way with the french officers killed or in irons tuke would have had to take command of narval himself not that he would need much encouragement and his experience as master of a privateer would have provided him with as many skills as any seaofficer in the kings service allday said quietly theyre going to kill him captain as he spoke one of the men in the other boat seized the lieutenants hair and pulled his head backwards so that they could see his eyes glittering in the light his face distorted with pain and terror a knife rose and flitted across the frenchmans throat with such speed that there was neither a cry nor a struggle then the corpse was flung overboard leaving a scarlet smear on the boats planking bolitho snapped a pistol thats no damned truce flag but the shot went wide and by the time he had reloaded the schooners boat was already moving swiftly away from the reef from seaward came a sudden bang and seconds later a tall waterspout lifted between reef and headland the spray from the heavy ball spreading out in a great white circle return to the ship bolitho seized the gunwale and tried to control his sick hatred that might be their intention to lure him from the bay before he knew the enemys exact strength while the gig pulled swiftly towards the tempest bolitho looked across at the settlement picturing the defences which now seemed so puny when set against what he had just witnessed fires had been lit to give an impression that the settlement was occupied by far more men than the small force there actually was some red tunics had been placed on the palisades and from a distance would be seen as vigilant sentries at their posts a deception and that was all it was he winced as another ball whimpered overhead and cracked into some rocks below the headland when he reached the tempests quarterdeck he found herrick armed with a telescope watching the other vessel out of range of tempests twelvepounders yet she was slamming shots into the land without effort when the shadows eventually departed from the beach and settlement they would start to shoot in earnest herrick observed twentyfour pounder sir at least must have got it off the eurotas i reckon he looked at bolitho worriedly i was bothered by those devils in the boat they might have opened fire on you crash bolitho heard the ball ploughing through the trees on the far side of the bay and saw enraged birds spreading out above them like splinters herrick persisted we will have to upanchor if they shift their aim to us they could dismast the ship and leave us crippled no moren a floating battery bolitho removed his hat and wiped his forehead it was what the enemy intended draw him out leave the bay undefended the schooner might not be able to outsail tempest but she could lose her amongst the litter of islets and reefs without difficulty he looked up at the masthead pendant steady as before from the northwest he took a telescope and walked to the nettings his mind grappling with the danger with what he was asking of his men he said over his shoulder send word ashore when we make the signal they must start the fire he heard herrick sigh i know it was for a last hope we just have to reverse things bolitho steadied his glass against the hammock nettings and trained it on the anchored schooner he was in time to see a puff of smoke from her forecastle as she loosed off another ball the schooner was in direct line with the headland and the wind he heard a boat pulling towards the shore and then a violent splintering noise as another ball landed on the little pier and brought down the outer end in a welter of broken woodwork and lashings it was luck for no gun captain could see through shadows but it told very clearly of what would happen soon if they did nothing to stop it he said boarding party mr herrick launch and cutter if the wind holds we will fire the headland as planned the smoke will drift down on the schooner that is when the attack must begin bolitho thought of the long pull and pictured the wounded marine on the hillside with his collected heaps of dried grass and underbrush liberally dosed with coconut husks and grease with luck the enemy gunner would think that one of his shots has started a fire ashore if it failed both boats crews would be slaughtered before they could lay a finger on the schooners hull a moment later fitzmaurice called quarter boats reached the shore sir bolitho nodded man your boats mr herrick keep them on the concealed side until the fire begins he made himself take a few paces back and forth his feet stepping over gun tackles and rammers without conscious effort it would take ten minutes for the word to be passed to the makeshift beacon he heard men clattering into the boats the clink of weapons bend on the signal mr fitzmaurice bolitho wiped his face he was sweating badly but without warmth quarter boats shoved off again sir the message had been passed bolitho snapped hoist the signal now the flag broke from the mainyard its appearance timed by coincidence with the next bang from the schooners heavy cannon bolitho trained a glass on the headland and the hillside beyond faintly at first rising from some lingering shadows like dirty stains against the sky the smoke began to roll downwind the filthy concoction of grease oakum and waste which they had mixed with the tinderdry grass and rushes held the smoke down towards the water in a thickening evillooking pall the marine called billyboy was exceeding even the bravest hope and a short explosion echoed from the hillside to add to the deception they would hear it in the schooner and might think it was a magazine exploding herrick asked quietly permission to leave sir bolitho looked past him at the two boats alongside their crews peering up at the ship like strangers handpicked every one and some of the best men in the ship if the worst happened it would strip tempest of hands so sorely that her defences would be halved he held herricks gazeand he was the best of all but he could not let anyone else command the attack now they needed every ounce of confidence every bit of experience and to the ships company herrick had all of it and more to spare was this the time which he had dreaded for so long it must come one day but surely not here in this godforsaken corner of the world where so much pain had already been suffered even as he thought about it he knew it could happen anywhere he said take care thomas have the swivels ready to shoot retire if you are sighted before you can grapple herrick took off his coat and hat and handed them to a marine in the boats there was no mark of rank or station either they had planned it this way in the short reprieve they had been given by bolithos five hundred mile passage in the boat herrick turned to watch the spreading fog of smoke it had already reached the reef and the schooners outline faded suddenly in the manmade haze maybe he was thinking the same what they had done in so short a time like the fire oakum and tar from the ship pigs fat and grease from the village coconut husks and fibres even molasses which the purser had been hoarding for an emergency plus all the other combustible material it was making an impressive screen it should have been for later if and when narval tried to force the entrance to the bay the smoke was to have confused her gun crews so that tempest could draw her to close action while she was near the reef but that was before this had happened anyway the wind might have changed and reversed the advantage herrick said lady luck is with us sir then with a wave to the quarterdeck he lowered himself into the big launch the two boats began to pull away immediately the oars speed indicating the measure of time and survival in the cutter jack miller boatswains mate crouched intently by the tiller a boarding axe protruding from his belt allday said softly god help those buggers if he gets amongst em it would take over half an hour for the boats to get anywhere near the anchored vessel the smoke had to stay as thick as ever until then also the schooners crew must not suspect that anything untoward was happening bolitho said mr borlase we will commence firing with the starboard battery load and run out if you please borlase stared at him anxiously a nerve jumping in his neck at what target sir to the right of the schooner i want them to see our shots dropping short it will make them believe in their safety also that we are not attempting to weigh anchor and use the smoke ourselves minutes later the starboard twelvepounders crashed out one by one in a slow broadside the smoke rolling downwind to join the rest the schooner had all but vanished beyond it now and when bolitho looked for the two boats he saw only the wake of the rearmost one the hulls like the headland completely hidden he pulled out his watch the sun was well up and no longer could they rely on shadows to protect the settlement he wondered briefly what raymond was doing if he was thinking of viola signal from the hilltop lookout sir fitzmaurice had his telescope to his eye bolitho walked beneath the mizzen shrouds and shaded his face against the growing glare the stench from the burning hillside was bad enough here what it was like in the boats was hard to imagine he felt sick and suddenly dizzy and wished he had taken alldays offer of breakfast he felt angry with himself well it was too late now he saw the flash of light from near the hilltop the reflected sun caught in a mirror as he had seen the foot soldiers do it in america it was limited but very quick provided you had invented enough simple signals well in advance fitzmaurice said in his haughty voice sail to the north sir bolitho nodded it was like the start of a great drama in which no one was certain of his role the sail must be the narval sweeping down from some hiding place in the north expecting to find the schooner in sole possession of the bay or its approaches he tried to remember the time on his watch where the two boats would be how long before the other ship hove in sight around the headland he moved to the rail above the gundeck and watched the twelvepounders being hauled up to their ports again swift was looking aft towards him again sir bolitho heard lakey say cant see nothing of the schooner or the reef now god what a fog allday was standing by the companion his arms folded as he watched the idle crews around the quarterdeck guns he turned to watch the captain and saw him stagger and almost fall everyone else was watching the smoke or the men at the twelvepounders he reached bolithos side in three strides im here captain easy now he looked at bolithos face it was shining with sweat and his eyes were halfclosed as if in terrible pain bolitho gasped dont let them see me like this he swallowed hard his arms and legs shivering violently in gusts of icy cold as if he were on the deck of a north atlantic patrol allday murmured desperately the fever it must be ill fetch the surgeon he saw one of the seamen staring and barked watch your front damn you bolitho gripped his arm and steadied himself no must hold on this is the worst time you must see that but captain allday was pleading itll kill you ill not stand by and let it happen bolitho took a breath and thrust himself away from alldays support between his teeth he said deliberately you will do as i tell you he made himself walk slowly to the nettings and curled his fingers into them as he tried to control his shaking body he said tell them to continue firing the din might help if only to keep their minds off him the crash of the broadside thundered across the water the balls going downwind into the smoke he heard himself say please god let thomas succeed we cannot move with so few hands the words spilled out of him and he could not prevent it no way to die he let go of the hammock nettings and walked carefully to the compass well have to lie here and fight a blurred shape hurried past carrying a shotcradle it paused and then turned towards him it was jenner the american couldnt help but hear what you said capn he seemed to swim in bolithos vision as if under water i heard tell of somethin durin th war of an english captain who was so shorthanded his sloop was almost run ashore and taken by the frenchies i also heard tell that the captain was you sir he ignored alldays threatening look and added you used wounded soldiers instead right sir bolitho tried to see him properly i remember in the sparrow he was going mad it had to be that speaking like this about the past well i got to thinkin why not use them convicts what bolitho stepped forward and would have fallen but for allday i just thought bolitho seized his wrist fetch mr keen keens voice came from his side im here sir he sounded worried send the other boats ashore immediately and go with them you worked at the settlement they know you better than the rest of us he leaned closer and added fervently i must have men val he saw keens expression and knew he had used violas name for him without realizing it do what you can keen said despairingly youre ill sir he glanced at alldays grim features you must have caught youre delaying he pushed him away get them here tell them ill try and obtain their passage back to england but dont lie to them the guns crashed out again the trucks hurling themselves inboard on their tackles enough bolitho tugged at his neckcloth cease firing sponge out and reload he saw the surgeon standing directly in his path his face grave as he snapped you will go below sir as the surgeon it is my duty your duty is on the orlop he dropped his voice just fetch some drops anything to keep my mind alive a few more hours it will certainly kill you gwyther shrugged you are a stubborn man bolitho walked unaided to the weather side and stared at the nearest land im so cold allday some brandy then i will be myself again aye captain allday watched him helplessly at once lakey had been near the wheel with his quartermaster and had seen keens anxiety and the hasty arrival of the surgeon as allday hurried to the companion he opened his mouth to ask what was happening allday always knew instead he turned away unable to believe what he had seen mackay his quartermaster spoke his own thoughts aloud in gods name mr lakey there were tears in his eyes avast mr herrick i can hear the buggers herrick lifted his arm and the muffled oars rose dripping on either side of the launch he hoped that miller following closely astern would have his eyes open and not collide with them he heard the distant murmur of voices then the clang of metal he swallowed hard and made a circular motion above his head with his sword they must be almost up to the schooner but because of the smoke could see nothing earlier they had seen her masts poking through the drifting fog and herrick had been thankful that nobody had had the sense to send up a lookout the men in the boat shifted uneasily watching his face their eyes were redrimmed from the smoke and their bodies stank from its filth and greasy persistence herrick looked at those nearest him grant a senior gunners mate who came from canterbury not that far from his own home nielsen a fairhaired dane who shared an oar with gwynne the young recruit he had got from the eurotas he knew them all as he did those in the other boat something tall and dark loomed above them and as they drifted beneath the schooners long jib boom they almost became entangled in her anchor cable not a second left for hesitation herrick snapped grapnel boarders away then pushed and jostled by his men herrick fought his way up and over the bulwark seeing faces above him and hearing the muffled voices change just as quickly into violent yells and oaths pistols banged and a seaman fell back into the launch knocking another down with him herrick sat astride the bulwark seeing it all through the drifting smoke the massive gun the additional tackle it had needed to restrain it on the narrow deck a man ran at him with a cutlass but herrick twisted it with his hilt and flicked it clattering into the scuppers now he had both feet inboard and slashed the man across the face and neck before he could pull out of his charge they were outnumbered but with trained determination the tempests men made a tight little wedge backs to the bulwark their feet already slipping in blood as they clashed together with their enemy the clang of steel the fierce wild cries of the men were matched by the screams of the wounded and dying but from right aft came the thud of another grapnel and millers men swarmed over the taffrail yelling and cursing like fiends steel on steel the pentup fear and hatred bursting in a tide of unrestrained killing men rolled upon one another fighting with dirks cutlasses axes or anything which would beat a man into submission herrick parried a sword aside and realized it was the bearded man who had met bolitho under a flag of truce he was even bigger near to but herrick had endured enough he had never had much time for the fancy swordsmanship of men like prideaux or from what he had heard bolithos dead brother hugh he was a fighter and relied on his strength and stayingpower to carry him through he took the mans heavy sword just six inches above his hilt forcing him round but keeping both blades crossed the bearded giant shouted you bloody bastard this time you die herricks eye flickered to a patch of blood on the deck and thrust his hilt away from him with all his strength he saw the cruel grin of triumph on the mans face as he was allowed to draw back the full length of his blade then it altered to sudden alarm as his heel slipped on the fresh blood and for a mere second he was off balance herrick thought suddenly of the tiny scene he had watched through his telescope the terrified french officer his throat cut in the twinkling of an eye like a slaughtered pig no you die his short fightingsword seared diagonally across the mans stomach just above the belt and as he dropped his weapon and clutched the torn wound with both hands herrick hacked him once and hard on the neck there was a wild cheer and miller his axe red in his filthy fist yelled shes ours lads it was done the cheers altered to cries of alarm as the deck gave a violent shiver and threw several men kicking amongst the dead and wounded herrick yelled the reef they cut the cable there was another great lurch and part of the mainmast thundered across the deck and crushed gwynne dead his mouth still open from calling herrick waved his sword fall back man the boats he heard the water swilling through a nearby hold the sounds of loose cargo and stores being hurled against the bulkhead the reef would make short work of her and anyone stupid enough to remain aboard carrying the wounded and kicking the pirates weapons into the water the seamen retreated to their boats halfmad at the swift change of events some of the pirates and several whom herrick guessed to be frenchmen from the narval turned on each other while with each violent lurch the schooner lifted and ground still further on to the reef millers cutter discharged its swivel gun for good measure as they pulled away herrick shouted to the ship give way all he held his breath as a great shoulder of shellencrusted reef rose out of the sea almost under the bows he waited for the crash the inrush of water and then as the boat pulled clear he turned his thoughts to his men poor gwynne a volunteer for so short a time he looked at nielsen the young dane rocking from side to side his face ashen with agony he had dropped his cutlass and one of the pirates had lunged at him with a sword nielsen had seized the swinging blade with both hands and had hung on even as his attacker had pulled the razoredged weapon through his palms and fingers grant the old gunners mate showed his tobaccostained teeth in a tired grin we done it sir one down he turned as the schooner rolled over in a welter of spray nother to go aye herrick looked along the boat sharing their pain and their pride well done he thought of bolitho and what he would say it was only a beginning but they had shown what they could achieve on this day bolitho made himself stand very still as herrick hurried aft towards him the nausea came and went and several times he thought he was going to fall to the deck and yet he was acutely aware of what was happening around him as if he could see without being seen as if he were already dead even his voice seemed to come from far away thank god you are safe thomas he looked towards the gangway where the boatswains party were helping some of the scarred and battered seamen up from the boats herrick said they did well when that smoke clears youll see naught but a few spars across the reef i lost three good hands though he stopped short and saw lakey trying to signal him then as the exhaustion and fury of the fight left him he looked closer at bolitho he said iim sorry sir i was thinking of myself he did not know how to continue you must go below at once he studied the firm line of bolithos jaw like that of a man preparing for the first touch of a surgeons blade how could this have happened voices called from forward and he turned off guard and confused as he saw the remainder of the ships boats moving slowly from the shore they were packed beyond capacity bodies lumped over the oars and gunwales like sacks of grain with only inches of freeboard above the water borlase said hoarsely convicts he sent for them yes bolitho walked slowly to the side to watch the first boat hook on the drops which the surgeon had allowed him had given him a small relief and alldays brandy lingered on his throat like fire he had to blink to clear his vision as the convicts scrambled awkwardly on to the gangway and through the boarding nets against his own men he could see little difference he felt a sudden sense of urgency he must talk with them tell them he saw keen coming towards him and waited for him to speak first he felt he had to save every breath each small effort brought the sweat across his body in a flood keen said the marine sentries think that the schooner may have landed spies in the night sir he glanced helplessly at herrick theyre not certain but its possible bolitho waited for the next spasm of giddiness to pass i feared as much they could lie hidden for hours days the bitterness crowded into his tone they will soon see through our pathetic disguises he walked to the rail and looked at the gundeck at the jostling figures below him herrick said quickly let me sir ill tell them what they must do no he did not see the despair on herricks face i am asking too much of them already without he swayed and added thomas old friend if the enemy knows of our weakness we are done for they will pound us to pieces while we lie at anchor we must meet them in open water to do that we need men any men he looked at the sky the streaming pendant high above the deck there is little time when i have spoken to these people you will withdraw our remaining pickets from the island he spoke slowly and with great care whichever of these people wishes to go ashore have them taken there before we weigh with this wind the narval will be around the headland before noon by then i intend to be in the best position i can find he swung away and raised his voice listen to me all of you a french frigate is coming to engage this ship and she will most likely have another vessel to support her i am shorthanded more so now because of losses against that pirate schooner you have no cause to love the authority which brought you to this place nor have you a firm promise that i can get you passage home to england if that is what you want he turned slightly towards the sun so that they would think he was shutting his eyes against the glare and not to control a bout of nausea but you have seen what tuke and his men have done and will do if they overwhelm this ship your support may do no more than delay a defeat but without that aid we are already dead men there was a pause and he could almost feel their torn emotions then a voice called all i done was steal a pig sir they sent me to botany bay for that me family was starvin what else could a man do another said hotly my woman was slaughtered by that bastard tuke after im an is devils ad done with er as they wanted his voice shook i got nothin to go back to englandfor capn but by the livin jesus ill fight for you if you tells me what to do uproar broke out on the gundeck and while the seamen and marines watched spellbound the jostling convicts faced each other in argument and anger bolitho said heavily it did not work thomas i cannot find it in my heart to blame them herrick snapped have the boats ready mr keen mr fitzmaurice make a last signal to the settlement they turned as a man called we know what you done for us capn an what you tried to do when youve been used to little bettern kicks and curses you soon gets to know what you values aye capn ill fight for you too an be damned to tomorrow a few voices still yelled out in protest but they were drowned by a great wave of cheering which even jurys resonant voice could do nothing to quell as it slowly died down bolitho said quietly put them on the gun tackles and braces their strength and our skills are all we have we must use them well he turned away retching violently move yourself thomas herrick tore his eyes away man the boats he watched as several of the convicts clambered down into them pursued by ironic cheers from their companions mr keen this will be the last time so be as quick as you can he saw the small red figures by the smashed pier one hopping on a crutch sick and wounded convicts everyone who could draw breath was needed today but all he could see in his mind was bolitho fighting his own war hanging on as his life swayed between reality and total collapse bolitho did not move or speak again until the last boat came alongside and offloaded some marines he had expected to see raymond come aboard although he could find no reason for it so he intended to remain behind his frail defences to the end to take credit for the victory or as was more likely barter for his life yet again with the attackers he saw herrick waiting by the quarterdeck rail his face full of anxiety drop a buoy here and moor all but the quarter boat if you please herrick understood aye sir this was one day when they would need no boats and if all failed they might help hardacre and some of the others to escape very well bolitho looked around the crowded quarterdeck we will weigh directly have the capstan manned he nodded to lakey lay a course to weather the headland and the reef as close as you can manage he turned and saw midshipman romney waiting to assist fitzmaurice run up the colours and tell sergeant quare to have his fifers play us out as tempest weighed anchor once more and tilted reluctantly to the wind figures moved slowly from the trees along the beach and ran to the waters edge to watch they saw the sails breaking out from the great yards the minute figures scrambling above the deck like monkeys the mounting foam beneath the gilded figurehead and though most of them did not understand why it was so many were deeply moved by what they saw their young chief tinah stood beside hardacres massive figure and raised one hand to his ear as faintly at first then more strongly he heard the strains of music he looked enquiringly at the big man by his side hardacre said quietly portsmouth lass i never thought to hear it in these islands hardacre who hated the signs of authority and spreading power from a land he had almost forgotten who had sought only security and peace amongst the people who had grown to trust him was unable to control his voice as he added god bless them well not see their like again once free of the lands protection the northwesterly wind laid into tempests canvas and held her hard over on the larboard tack east noreast sir full and bye bolitho nodded and walked up the tilting deck to the weather side the rising din of shrouds and canvas the clatter of blocks and the hiss of the sea were joined in his mind as one great tumult he felt the deck quivering to the wind and when he peered along the larboard twelvepounders he saw them hanging on taut tackles as the ship heeled further and further to the thrust spray spurted over the nettings and stung his cheeks but he barely flinched he saw faces he did not know being hustled to various parts of the ship some gazing at him as they hurried past he no longer thought of them as convicts but found himself wondering what they had once been again much like his own men driven from the land by necessity or lured to the sea by impossible dreams but for their circumstances they might have ended in a kings ship anyway the impartial callousness of a pressgang a need to escape like jenner or starling it might be fate after all which set the stage for man more brandy captain he turned holding firmly to the hammock nettings and saw allday watching him later he forced a smile youll have me three sheets to the wind allday did not smile help me captain i dont know what to do i cant stop you an i cant aid you either bolitho reached out and gripped his arm you are helping me as you have always done he saw alldays face fade momentarily as if a mist had formed over it and added tightly just by being here deck there sail on th larboard quarter herrick swore damn they will hold the weathergage bolitho beckoned to romney and seized the telescope from him his heart was going like a smiths hammer and it took time and effort to steady the glass he saw the blurred outline of the headland falling rapidly away on the quarter its silhouette made more confused by the spray which was bursting across the reef in wild abandon there she was just as he remembered thrusting towards him with all but her royals set to the following wind her beakhead vanished repeatedly in great swooping plunges and he could imagine the sea sluicing over her guns as she was driven to her capacity he heard lakey say pity the wind dont shift and dismast the bastard bolitho forgot the voices around him as he concentrated on a sliver of sail which had appeared almost astern of the other frigate the second schooner he lowered the glass biting his lip to control his reeling thoughts viola had told him about the other schooner when she had been tukes captive there would probably be another heavy cannon aboard her too some may have been transferred to narval also he pulled himself along the spraysoaked planking until he had reached the tail above the nearest twelvepounders he saw borlase and swift pause in their walking between the guns and called to them i want you to doubleshot the guns he held up his hand to silence borlases protest after the first broadside therell be no time itll be gun for gun he felt the grin prising his lips apart what say lads give him a headache from the start somebody gave a cheer and he saw blissett his corporals chevron very bright against his scarlet tunic waving his hat in the air sprawled in the maintop the marine called billyboy examined his long musket and eased the stiffness in his leg behind him the captain of the maintop asked uneasily what dyou reckon the marine shrugged two to one i seen worse anyroad id rather be here than on some poxy island the other man looked at the mast trembling to the great weight of spars and rigging he was thinking of the man he had replaced blasted to bloody pulp by one of those iron balls bolitho said prepare to shorten sail mr herrick well have the tgallants off her directly he pictured the other ship in his mind flying downwind towards their quarter tuke would be expecting a fight and would need to get to grips while he held the wind against that tempests heavier build would slow her when she came about on the opposite tack it would be a temporary advantage but it was all they had they would never match the french ship for agility he knew herrick was thinking the same herrick raised his speaking trumpet hands aloft take in the tgansls romney peered up at the tightly braced yards it would be no easy work up there today with the wind buffeting the bulging canvas and trying to dislodge the topmen one by one bolitho felt the deck trying to level off as the sails were fisted and hauled into submission and lashed to the yards he made himself look towards the narval again and saw she was much closer no more than a league away he saw a brief puff of smoke and flinched as a ball moaned overhead to raise a feather of spray on the opposite beam keen said they must have one of eurotass twentyfourpounders as a bow chaser no one answered him bolitho concentrated on the other ship expecting her to follow his example and shorten sail there was some activity on her upper yards but not enough to hold her headlong attack if tuke tried to make a violent alteration of course in either direction to follow tempest or to track her round on a new tack altogether he would as lakey remarked tear the masts out of the ship stand by to come about bolitho had to cup his hands because of the boom of canvas mr borlase are you ready to engage with the starboard battery he saw him nod confused no doubt by the fact that the enemy was on the opposite side bolitho added well tell me in future i am not a magician he walked back to the nettings fighting for breath angry with himself for wasting energy with borlase for being so stupid herrick looked up the slanting deck his eyes very clear in the light ready sir he glanced up with a start as a ball whipped between the main and mizzen without hitting even a halliard he had not even heard the gun fire bolitho glanced quickly aft to the helm and the leaning group of men around it lakey dependable and as steady as a rock keen with his gun crews and the marines spread along the nettings behind him their muskets already cradled over the tightly packed hammocks he turned to look forward seeing the new men at the braces grimfaced some no doubt wondering if their momentary heroics were worth all this the older men were waiting to let go the headsail sheets so that tempest would swing unhindered across the winds eye and near them he saw pyper and the crews of the two carronades waiting for a chance to pour their murderous charges into the enemys stern if a chance offered itself ready put the helm down slowly and noisily tempest started to swing to windward the air shaking to the onslaught of shrouds and vibrating rigging he saw men hauling at the braces one falling in a confused heap as he lost his footing only to be chased and pushed back to his position by schultz the boatswains mate round and further still the tossing panorama of breaking crests and glasssided troughs swinging across and under the jib boom while every stitch of canvas protested noisily and there like an hitherto unseen vessel was the narval rising above the starboard bow instead of the opposite quarter her pyramid of sails creamy white in the suns glare bolitho saw the deep shadows on her forecourse and topsail and knew she was trying to alter course the sails hardened again and he guessed tuke knew it was impossible to match his opponents manoeuvre bolitho ignored the confusion on deck the whine of blocks and the overwhelming groan of spars as the yards were hauled still further round to lay tempest on the opposite tack he watched intently seeing the other ship forging towards his jib boom making an arrowhead between them it was the best part of a mile away although it looked from aft as if both bowsprits would lock like tusks as you bear mr borlase he felt unsteady and sick borlase sliced the air with his hanger fire doubleshotted the starboard guns crashed out in one tremendous broadside the trucks hurling themselves inboard while dense smoke funnelled through the open ports in a choking cloud above the receding echo of the broadside bolitho heard a terrible scream and saw blood splashed across the deck close to where borlase was standing one of the convicts had changed his position at the moment of recoil and had been smashed in the chest by one of the guns as it came hurtling inboard borlase tore his eyes from the droplets of blood which had spattered across his legs and yelled stop your vents sponge out load his voice as shrill as a distraught womans as he peered through the swirling smoke bolitho saw the smoke swirl and quiver as the french frigate fired back iron hammered into the lower hull and he heard the whine of more balls passing overhead tempests sudden change of tack had confused their aim the smoke thinned and billowed away downwind and bolitho caught his breath as he stared at the enemy sails punctured in several places and at least two gun ports empty of muzzles herrick yelled well done lads prideaux said well not surprise that one a second time bolitho strode to the compass ignoring the stained faces of the men who watched him pass at the compass he consulted the set of the sails the position of the other ship as she carried on downwind her topmen already reducing her show of canvas he tried to hold the sickness aside but it was dragging at him pulling him down with relentless strength it was all suddenly quite clear he was going to die this day on this deck it was merely a matter of time he dashed the sweat from his eyes and peered at the compass southwest and there were two islands overlapping across the bows misty and beckoning as in a dream let her fall off two points mr lakey we will follow narval round steady she goes sir sou souwest there was a rumble of cannonfire and men ducked in confusion as narvals next broadside swept over the water a different sound this time chain and bar shot in an effort to cripple tempests rigging the nets above the gundeck bucked and rebounded under an onslaught of severed cordage blocks and a man who had lost both legs yet was still trying to drag himself to safety fire tempest shook violently the guns spitting out their long orange tongues deadly and vivid in the choking smoke the frigates were a bare halfmile apart now with tempests bowsprit level with the others mainmast again and again the guns thundered across the water the passage of their shots marked on the sea by burning wads and by the force of their wind above the waves tempests forecourse and main were punctured in several places and above the sweating gun crews the torn rigging trailed in the wind with few men spare to repair it a violent flash exploded from tempests poop as if a magazine had ignited deep in the hull bolitho slipped and fell to the deck as splintered planks upended cannon men and pieces of men were flung about him voices called and screamed and as he struggled to his feet he saw that half of the helm had been smashed to fragments the quartermaster and his mates strewn around it like bloody rags lakey was unmarked and unharmed although he had been standing just inches away as others ran to assist him he croaked that schooner the buggers put a shot through our counter herrick pointed to the smoke which billowed up through the shattered skylight and companion must have been doubleshotted with a load of grape for good measure he hurried aft as jury his legs and shoes splashed with blood yelled steerins carried away true enough with power gone from her rudder tempest was already falling away downwind exposing her stern towards the other frigate more shots tore into the hull and others raised fountains of spray against the side bolitho shouted must get steeringway he turned sickened as a ball crashed through a port and took the head from a crouching gun captain leaving the torso standing for just a few terrible seconds herrick shouted whatll we do sir bolitho squinted through the smoke watching the narvals yards swinging round as she halted her charge and began to turn in pursuit he saw the schooner closing from the opposite quarter her captured gun firing again the ball shrieking through the rigging breaking the maintopsail yard like a carrot the great spar and all the weight of rigging and sail plunged through the smoke and across the gundeck ripping the maincourse into flapping streamers as it fell men cried out in terror as they were pinned or trapped by the wreckage others searched for friends or struggled to free their guns and train them on the enemy swift his mind and body reeling with horror as he stared at borlase crushed and mangled beneath the broken yard one arm still moving frantically fought to stop himself from running below to hide then he saw something pale across the larboard quarter and shouted desperately the schooner standto he raised his arm and saw with astonishment that he had lost two fingers but had felt nothing fire the ragged badly aimed broadside spouted from tempests side although less than half of the twelvepounders would bear or were still able to shoot the schooners foremast quivered the sails all in torment and slid down into the smoke slewing the vessel round and rendering her helpless bolitho saw it and more beside although faces and events were all somehow merged in his cringing mind the schooner was out of the fight but for her he would have been able to take on the enemy ship to ship but now he stared at the havoc the struggling filthy figures who were trying to clear the wreckage from the decks dead and dying were everywhere and there was blood running down the foremast while high above the torn body of a topman dangled and swayed with the wind snared in some of the broken rigging its no use sir lakeys lean face swam before him well never get the helm rigged afore that buggers up to us bolitho looked at herrick you know what you always said about this ship he drew his sword and tied the lanyard around his wrist aye herrick watched him fascinated and aghast shes stout enough to take the heaviest battering shes not taken a drop of water in the well in spite of all he ducked as more iron smashed through the nettings hurling men and hammocks aside in scarlet profusion bolitho nodded gritting his teeth the sight of the men nearest him of midshipman fitzmaurice lying on his side staring wideeyed at the blood which was soaking out and around his slight body had decided him tell the hands to reload and then stand down he shook herricks arm its our only chance narval can get on our stern and pound us to pieces without steerageway i can do nothing to stop it arm the people be ready herrick stared at him seeing the torment and the feverish wildness in his grey eyes but there was nothing he could do to stop him now he turned to allday keep with him then a silence seemed to engulf the drifting ship as the tattered sails whipped and curled without effect while from astern the merciless bombardment ceased it was replaced by a mingled roar of voices rising above the cries of the wounded and dying until it was like one great savage bellow of triumph unaware of their own strength or numbers tempests company crouched or lay beneath the fallen debris or hid under gangways beside the guns which were still hot from their firing pikes and cutlasses axes and belaying pins the men deafened by cannonfire almost out of their senses by the sights and horrors all around them stared at the stout timbers which had protected them and waited for the nightmare to end a few muskets hammered across the water and bolitho could hear billyboy yelling abuse as he shot again and again at the enemy he could tell from his voice that he was badly wounded dying even as he kept up his firing slowly and then with frightening suddenness the narvals sails and yards lifted over the starboard quarter bolitho stood by the rail his sword dangling from his wrist so the horror was not yet done he watched the other ships jib boom rise high above the nettings the broken yard and the untidy cluster of corpses dangling from the bowsprit bobbing to the motion as if still alive was the severed head of de barras bolitho felt the brittle strength coursing through him he yelled fire as you bear like rats and moles his blackened seamen scrambled from hiding and down the tempests battered side every gun which could find a target exploded in an earshattering crescendo the noise made twinfold by the doubleshotted charges and the closeness of the other ship he felt the deck lurch as narvals jib boom drove through the foremast shrouds the grinding crash of the two hulls dulled by the terrible screams of those who had been caught in the murderous broadside boarders away yelling and cheering like madmen what was left of tempests company hacked their way across to the other ship some falling before they could find a handhold others held and crushed between the two swaying hulls bolitho found himself on narvals gangway with steel clanging on every side he slipped on blood left by that last onslaught and knew allday had saved him from pitching over the side marines ran past with prideaux leading the attack sergeant quare waved his musket at em marines then he took a full charge of canister in the chest and stomach ripping him to fragments blissett saw the marines hesitate their faces like stone as they stared at quares corpse he yelled charge he was mad exhilarated and sad for quare all in one brief second then he was amongst the defenders on the forecastle his bayonet lunging and stabbing while his companions closed around him in a tight merciless group bolitho reached the frigates quarterdeck his mind clear again as he saw his own ship through the drifting smoke all around him men were reeling and staggering crossing cutlasses or fighting with fists and anything they could find he saw miller slashing a path towards the poop with his axe watched him suddenly fall pinioned by a pike and covered by his killer as a british seaman hacked him down and then beside the abandoned wheel his legs astride two dying seamen he saw mathias tuke he was amazed to find that he felt no sense of surprise tuke was exactly as he had imagined as she had described him now with his chest heaving his fist bright red from the blood which ran from his sword tuke was staring at him his eyes blazing with hatred he said harshly well well captain we meet at last did she tell you of the mark i put on her soft body eh his mouth opened in his thick beard like an obscene hole and he laughed throwing back his head but keeping his eyes fixed on bolitho from the opposite side of the deck herrick saw it clearly even as he cut down a screaming pirate and waited for his party of seamen to establish their hold of the gangway above the gundeck from two crews they had broken into separate parties then into groups now into individual fragments of defence and attack he saw bolitho step towards tuke watched the two blades circling each other warily could feel the tension he barked haul down their flag follow me with his fighting sword swinging before him herrick charged to the attack bolitho saw none of them only tuke and even he seemed to be growing in size and stature his body surrounded by enclosing darkness tuke took a deep breath startled by bolithos failure to respond then he bellowed now and with a wild yell he lunged forward bolitho saw the blade slicing towards his stomach and knew he could do nothing the strength was gone from his arm and he felt the deck jar his legs as he stumbled on to his knees men were cheering from the other end of the ship and he knew the flag which was being waved and then thrown over the side was that of the enemy but he could feel and do nothing his vision was obstructed by a whiteclad leg and he heard alldays voice break in a sob as he shouted back there was a cling of steel and back i say more clangs and bolitho was able to see allday driving tuke towards the side he was holding the cutlass with both hands like a broadsword something he had not seen before he wanted to call to him to stop his fury before he was cut down allday was almost incoherent with anger and grief oblivious to a cut on his shoulder and to everything but the towering man before him between blows he gasped you bloody cowardly murdering bastard he saw the man show fear for the first time and brought the heavy cutlass against tukes hilt with all his strength hurling him to the deck then as he made a shadow fall across tukes head and neck he sobbed i wish to god this was not so quick for you the cutlass swung down once then twice as herrick and the others rushed to drag him away allday hurled his cutlass over the nettings and ran to bolithos side bolitho gripped his arm wanting more than anything to reassure him but he was shaking violently and could barely whisper allday said youll be all right captain he looked wretchedly at herrick wont he sir herrick replied help him up we must get him aboard tempest he saw keen running towards him take command here with herrick and allday guiding and halfcarrying him bolitho returned to his own ship there were no more cheers and his men parted to let him pass their strained faces looking and searching for something bolitho saw the shattered companion and knew he had somehow reached the tempest but the companion and the place where he could hide his final shame from his men still seemed a mile away he heard himself murmur see to the people thomas after that well herrick looked at him despairingly as the surgeon hurried to meet them his butchers apron covered with the stains of his trade after that sir well be going home gwyther watched allday lower the captain on to a cot he does not hear you mr herrick he knelt down and loosened bolithos neckcloth allday looked at herrick you go sir hed want it its your responsibility now ill tell you when the captains feeling better he said it so fervently that herrick could only reply im depending on it above the cheering was beginning at last as the two drifting ships were secured and those who had expected to die were made to accept that they had won a victory but to herrick as he paused in the square of sunlight below the companion there was no such feeling and only a sense of stricken disbelief gwyther said there is little i can do he was needed in a dozen places at once and had already operated on more men than he could have believed possible in so short a time yet he could not move and was held here by alldays simple belief he added quietly we can only wait and hope no man in his condition should have done what he has today allday looked at him and replied firmly but hes not just any man he nodded ill watch over him he heard the muffled cheering and said to bolitho brokenly see captain we did it just like we said silently gwyther turned and made for the orlop again the surgeon had served with bolitho for several years but had never really got to know him after this live or die he knew he could never forget him epilogue on a bright summers day in almost eighteen months since he had been carried more dead than alive to his ship from the captured narval captain richard bolitho knew he had won the greatest fight of all only those who had been with him who had watched over his daily struggle against the fever knew the whole story to bolitho it had been like one long nightmare with brief moments of clarity and others of overwhelming suffering he remembered little of the voyage to new south wales and his stay in the governors house or of his farewells to herrick and the others who had visited him before tempest had sailed for england at a slower and less demanding pace bolitho with allday ever at his side had taken passage in an indiaman again the pictures in his mind were blurred and painful of his married sister nancy organizing his reception in the old grey house below pendennis castle being very brave and hiding her dismay at his gaunt appearance and inability to speak more than a few words to her of mrs ferguson his housekeeper redeyed and fussing over him between bouts of weeping of ferguson his onearmed steward helping allday to settle him in the great bed the one where if you sat up you could see the blue line of the horizon and a corner of the castle on the headland except that nobody had really thought he would be able to leave his bed again nobody but allday that is but as the months dragged past days and weeks of emptiness and nausea he realized he was gaining new strength he was able to ask about people of what was happening in the world outside his bedroom at the first hint of better weather he took a few short walks using allday like a prop for most of the time and he had a visitor captain william tremayne of the brig pigeon came to the house within an hour of dropping anchor in carrick roads it was like rolling back the months bolitho sat in a highbacked chair by the window while tremayne sat nearby a goblet of wine in his big fist pigeon had come home with despatches tremayne had brought it all back the islands the swaying palms and laughing girls it seemed that hardacre had been given permanent control of the levu islands as government agent there had not been much choice in the matter for raymond had been found dead apparently by his own hand the most unexpected news had been about yves genin seized with the rest when tempest had won her bloody battle against the narval although the frigate had been handed over to a prize court genin had been allowed to return to france more because he was an embarrassment than as a mark of goodwill towards the revolutionary government genin who had done so much to pave the way for rebellion was rewarded by a quick end on the guillotine the new government took the view that a man who could plan a major uprising might well do it a second time and on this particular day bolitho was standing by the open window watching the various hues of green the rippling fields which ran down the hillside towards the sea he thought a lot about tempest and wondered where she was he had heard she had been at plymouth completing a refit and preparing to commission with a new company his one wish was that he could have been with her before she had paid off a few of the old hands were still aboard and her captain should be grateful to have them lakey the taciturn sailing master toby the carpenter jury the boatswain and a few more beside the rest had scattered to the needs of a growing fleet to ships which would be desperately needed again when the
