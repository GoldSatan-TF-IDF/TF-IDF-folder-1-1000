jeffery deaver hard news the third book in the rune series journalism without a moral position is impossible every journalist is a moralist she cannot do her work without judging what she sees marguerite duras they moved on him just after dinner he didnt know for sure how many but that didnt matter all he thought was please dont let them have a knife he didnt want to get cut swing the baseball bat swing the pipe drop the cinder block on his hands but not a knife please he was walking down the corridor from the prison dining hall to the library the gray corridor that had a smell hed never been able to place sour rotten and behind him the footsteps growing closer the thin man whod eaten hardly any of the fried meat and bread and green beans ladled on his tray walked more quickly he was sixty feet from a guard station and none of the department of corrections officers at the far end of the corridor were looking his way footsteps whispering oh lord the thin man thought i can take one out maybe im strong and i can move fast but if they have a knife theres no way randy boggs glanced back three men were close behind him not a knife please he started to run where you goin boy the latino voice called as they broke into a trot after him ascipio it was ascipio and that meant he was going to die yo boggs ain no use ain no use at all you runnin but keep running he did foot after foot head down now only forty feet from the guard station i can make it ill be there just before they get me please let them have a club or use their fists but no knife no sliced flesh of course wordd get out immediately in general population how boggs had run to the guards and then everybody even the guards themselves would wail on him every chance they got because if your nerve breaks theres no hope for you inside it means youre going to die and its just a question of how long it takes for the rest of the inmates to strip away your body from your cowardly soul shit man another voice called breathing hard from the effort of running get him you got the glass one of them called to another it was a whisper but boggs heard it glass ascipios friend would mean a glass knife which was the most popular weapon in prison because you could wrap it in tape hide it in you pass through the metal detector and shit it out into your hand and none of the guards would ever know give it up man we gonna cut you one way or thother give us your blood boggs thin but not in good shape ran like a track star but he realized that he wasnt going to make it the guards were in station seven a room separating the communal facilities from the cells the windows were an inch and a half thick and someone could stand directly in front of the window and pound with his bleeding bare hands on the glass and if the guard inside didnt happen to look up at the slashed prisoner hed never know a thing and continue to enjoy hisnew york post and pizza slice and coffee hed never know a man was bleeding to death two feet behind him boggs saw the guards inside the fortress they were concentrating on an important episode ofst elsewhere on a small tv boggs sprinted as fast as he could calling help me help me go go go okay hed turn hed face ascipio and his buddies butt his long head into the closest one break his nose try to grab the knife maybe the guards would notice by then a commercial on the tv the guards were pointing at it and laughing a big basketball player was saying something boggs raced directly toward him wondering why were ascipio and his baddies doing this why just because he was white because he wasnt a bodybuilder because he hadnt picked up a whittled broomstick along with the ten other inmates and stepped up to kill rano the snitch ten feet to the guard station a hand grabbed his collar from behind no randy boggs cried and he felt himself start to tumble to the concrete floor under the tackle he saw the characters on the hospital show on tv looking gravely at a body on the operating room he saw the gray concrete rising up to slam him in the head he saw a sparkle of the glass in the hand of a young latino man ascipio whispered do it the young man stepped forward with the glass knife but then boggs saw another motion a shadow coming out of a deeper shadow a huge shadow a hand reached down and gripped the wrist of the man holding the knife snick the attacker screamed as his wrist turned sideways in the shadows huge hand the glass fell to the concrete floor and broke bless you the shadow said in a slow reverent voice you know not what you do then the voice snapped now get the fuck outta here try this again and you be dead ascipio and the third of the trio helped the wounded attacker to his feet they hurried down the corridor the huge shadow whose name was severn washington fifteen to twentyfive for a murder committed before he accepted allah into his heart helped boggs to his feet the thin man closed his eyes and breathed deeply then together they silently started back to the library boggs hands shaking desperately glanced into the guard station inside of which the guards nodded and smiled as the body on the operating room on the tv screen was miraculously revived and the previews for next weeks show came on four hours later randy boggs sat on his bunk listening to his roommate wilker james doc eight years for receiving second felony offense hear they moved on you man that ascipio man he one mean fucker what he want to do that for i cant figure it not like you have anything on him man wilker james kept talking like he always did on and on and goddamn on but randy boggs wasnt listening he sat hunched over apeople magazine on his bunk he wasnt reading the periodical though he was using it as a lap desk on top of which was a piece of cheap widelined writing paper you gotta understand me man wilker james said im not saying anything about the hispanic race i mean you know the problem is they just dont see things the way normal people do i man like life isnt boggs ignored the mans crazy rambling and finally touched pen to paper in the upper lefthand corner of the paper he wrote harrison mens correctional facility he wrote the date then he wrote dear to who it may concern you have to help me please after this careful beginning randy boggs paused thought for a long moment and started to write once more rune watched the tape once and then a second time and then once more she sat in a deserted corner of the networks newsroom a huge open space twenty feet high three thousand square feet divided up by movable partitions headhigh and covered with gray cloth the oncamera sets were bright and immaculate the rest of the walls and floors were scuffed and chipped and streaked with old dirt to get from one side of the studio to the other you had to dance over a million wires and around monitors and cameras and computers and desks a huge control booth like the bridge of the starshipenterprise looked out over the room a dozen people stood in clusters around desks or monitors others carried sheets of paper and blue cardboard cups of coffee and videocassettes some sat at computers typing or editing news stories everyone wore casual clothing but no one behaved casually rune was hunched over the sony inch tape player and small color tv that served as a monitor a tinny voice came out of the small speaker itold them back then just what im telling you now i didn t do it the man on the screen was a gaunt thirtysomething with high cheekbones and sideburns his hair was slicked back and crowned with a kewpiedoll curl above his forehead his face was very pale when rune had first cued up the tape and started it running ten minutes before shed thought this dude is a total nerd he wore a tight gray jumpsuit which under other circumstances say on west broadway in soho mighthave been chic except that the name of the designer on the label wasnt giorgio armani or calvin klein but the new york state department of correctional services rune paused the tape and looked at the letter once again read the mans unsteady handwriting turned back to the tv screen and heard the interviewer ask himyoull be up for parole when parole maybe a few years but hell the thin man looked at the camera quickly then awaya mans innocent he shouldn t be out on parole he should just be out rune watched the rest of the tape listened to him tell about how bad life in prison was how nobody in the wardens office or the court would listen to him how incompetent his lawyer had been she was surprised though that he didnt sound bitter he was more baffledlike somebody who cant understand the justice behind a plane crash or car wreck she liked that about him if anybody had a right to be obnoxious or sarcastic it was an innocent man who was in prison but he just talked calmly and wistfully occasionally lifting a finger to touch a glistening sideburn he seemed scared of the camera or modest or embarrassed she paused the tape and turned to the letter that had ended up on her desk that morning she had no clue how shed happened to receive it other than her being your typical lowlevelpersonofindeterminatejobdescription at a major television network which meant she often got bizarre letters dumped on her deskanything from publishers clearing house award notices to fan mail for captain kangaroo and edward r murrow written by wackos it was this letter that had motivated her to go into the archives and dig up these old interview tapes she read it again dear to who it may concern you have to help me please it sounded so desperate pathetic but the tone wasnt what affected her as much as the third paragraph of the letter she read it again and what it was was that the police which i have nothing against normally didnt talk to all the witnesses or ask the ones they did talk to the questions they should of asked if they had done that then i feel in my opinion they would have found that i was innocent of the charges but they didnt do this rune looked at the image freezeframed on the screen a tight closeup of randy boggs just after his trial several years ago where was he born she wondered what was his history in high school had he been a what did her mother call thema hood a greaser did he have family a wife somewhere maybe children how would it be to have to visit your husband once a month was she faithful to him did she bake him cookies and send them to prison rune started the tape again and watched the dullcolored grain on the screen you want to hear what its like to be in herenow at last bitterness was creeping into the thin mans voicelet me tell you bout the start of my day do you want to hear about that tell me whatever you want the invisible interviewer asked you wake up at six and the first thing you think is hell im still here a voice from across the room rune where are you come on lets go weve got an overturned something on the brooklynqueens expressway the model was standing up from his desk pulling on a tan london fog trench coat that would keep him ten degrees warmer than he needed to be on this april afternoon but that would be okay because this was areporters coat he was an upandcomerone of the hotshots covering metro news for the local o ampo the networks ownedandoperated new york tv station runes present employer as well twentyseven a round face midwest handsome the word sandy seemed to apply to him in a vague way he spent a lot of time in front of mirrors nobody shaved like the model rune worked as a cameraman for him occasionally and when shed first been assigned to him he hadnt been quite sure what to make of this auburnponytailed girl who looked a bit like audrey hepburn and was just a little over five feet a couple ounces over a hundred pounds the model probably would have preferred a pickled chainsmoking technician whod worked the city desk from the days when they used sixteenmillimeter bolex cameras but she shot damn good footage and there was nobody better than rune when it came to blustering her way through police barricades and past backstage security guards at madison square garden whatve you got there he asked nodding at monitor i found this letter on my desk from this guy in prison you know him the model asked absently he carefully made sure the belt wasnt twisted then fitted it through the plastic buckle nope it was just addressed to the network just showed up here maybe he wrote it a while ago nodding toward the screen where randy boggs was freezeframed looks like you could carbondate him nineteen sixtyfive nope she tapped the paper its dated two days ago the model read it quickly sounds like the guys having a shitty time of it the prison in harrison huh better than attica but its still no country club so suit up lets go the first thing you think is hell im still here the model took a call he nodded looked at rune this is great its an overturned ammonia tanker on the bqe boy that is gonna screw up rush hour real nice ammonia are we lucky or are we lucky rune shut the monitor off and joined the model at his cluttered desk i think i want to see her her who you know who i mean the models face broke into a wrinkleless smile not her capital h yeah the model laughed why rune had learned one thing about tv news keep your back covered and your ideas to yourselfunless the station pays you to come up with ideas which in her case they didnt so she said career development the model was at the door you miss this assignment you wont have any career to develop its ammonia you understand what im saying ammonia rune repeated she wound a paisley elastic silkie around her ponytail then pulled on a black leather jacket the rest of her outfit was a black tshirt yellow stretch pants and cowboy boots just give me ten minutes with capital h her he took her by the arm aimed her toward the door you think youre just going to walk into piper suttons office id knock first uhuh lets go sweetheart double time you can visit the lions den after we get back and wrap the edits a figure stepped out of the corridor a young man in jeans and an expensive black shirt he wore his hair long and floppy bradford simpson was an intern a journalismschool senior at columbia whod started out in the mailroom his freshman year and was by now doing slightly more glamorous jobs around the station like fetching coffee handling deliveries of tapes and occasionally actually assisting a cameraman or sound crew he was one of those madly ambitious sortsrune could identify withthat part of himbut his ambition was clearly to get his degree don a brooks brothers suit and plunge into the ranks of corporate journalism sincere and well liked around the o ampo and the network bradford dont really care for brad was also cute as hell in a preppy connecticut way rune had been shocked when he had actually asked her out a few days ago but while she appreciated the offer rune had found she didnt do well dating people like mr dockers topsider and instead of his offer for dinner at the yale club shed opted to go film a fire in lower manhattan for thelive at eleven newscast still she wondered if hed ask her out again no invitations were forthcoming at the moment however and he now merely looked at the screen saw randy boggss lean face on the monitor and asked whos that hes in jail rune explained but i think hes innocent bradford asked how come just a feeling rune said the model we dont have time lets go she said to them thatd be a pretty good storygetting an innocent man out of jail the young man nodded and said journalists doing good deedsthats what its all about but the model wasnt interested in good deeds he was interested in ammonia brooklynqueens expressway rune he said like an impatient professor now oh the tanker truck bradford said see the model said to runeeverybody knows about it letsmove its a goddamn traffic accident rune protested im talking about an innocent man in jail for murder bradford said thereis something about him nodding at the screen he looks more like a victim than a killer if you ask me but before she could agree the model took runes arm and led her firmly to the elevator they descended to the ground floor of the fourstory building that occupied a whole square block on the upper west side the building had been an armory at one time then had been bought by the network gutted and rebuilt outside it was scabby and dark and looked like it ought to be housing a thousand homeless people inside was a halfbillion dollars worth of electronic equipment and tv celebrities a lot of the space was leased to the local o ampo station but most of it was for the network which recorded a couple of soap operas here some talk shows several sitcoms and of course network news in the equipment room beside the parking garage rune checked out an ikegami video camera with an ampex deck and a battery pack rune and the model climbed into an econoline van she grabbed the lip of the doorway and swung up and in the way she liked to do feeling like a pilot about to take off on a mission the driver a scrawny young man with a long thin braid of blond hair gave a thumbsup to rune and started the van explosive strains of black sabbath filled the van shut that crap off the model shouted then lets moveweve got ammonia on the bqe go go go which the kid did turning down the tape player and then squealing into the street hostilely as if he was striking a blow for classic rock music as they drove through manhattan rune looked absently out the window at the people on the street as they in turn watched the van with its scifi transmission dish on top and the call letters of the tv station on the side stenciled at an angle people always paused and watched these vans drive past probably wondering if it was going to stop nearby if something newsworthy was happening if they themselves might even get to appear in the background of a news report sometimes rune would wave at them but today she was distracted she kept hearing randy boggss voice the first thing you think is hell im still here im still here im still here so why cant i just walk into her office and talk to her the model snapped because shes the anchor as if nothing more need be said rune trudged beside him through the scuffed corridor that led from the elevator back to the newsroom the worn carpet was seablue the parent companys corporate color so what shes an anchorwoman shes not going to fire me for talking to her well why dont you quit talking about it and make an appointment the model was in a bad mood because yes it had been an ammonia truck and yes it had tipped over but no one had told the station that the truck was empty so no spill it had even had the courtesy to roll over onto the shoulder so that rushhour traffic wasnt disrupted much at all they arrived in the studio and rune replayed the tape shed shot of the truck the model looked at the footage and seemed to be trying to think of something unpleasantly critical to say about her work she said enthusiastically look i got the sunset there on the side of the truck that ridge of red see i see it do you like it i like it do you mean it rune as the tape was rewinding rune said but pipers like ultimately my boss isnt she well in a way she works for the network you work for the local ownedandoperated station its a strange relationship im a single woman living in manhattan im used to strange relationships look he said patiently the president of the united states is in charge of the army and navy okay but do you see him talking to every pfcs got a problem this isnt a problem its an opportunity uhhuh piper sutton doesnt care diddlysquat for your opportunities sweetheart you have an idea you should talk to stan hes head of local news this is national nothing personal but youare just a camera girl girl cameraperson youre atechnician rune continued cheerfully what do you know about her her with a capital h again the model looked at rune for a moment in silence rune smiled coyly come on please he said piper sutton started out where i am right herea reporter for the local o ampo in new york she went to the university of missouri journalism school anyway she did beat reporting then she moved up in the ranks and became head of radio news then executive producer for radio then she got tapped as a reporter for the network she was overseas a lot i know she was in the mideast and she got an award for covering the sadat assassination then she came back here and anchored the weekend program then moved on towake up with the news finally they tried to move her into the parent they offered her something pretty big like executive vp in charge of o ampos but she didnt want a desk job she wanted to be on camera she finagled her way intocurrent events and there she is she makes a million dollars a year lives on park avenue that lady is ground zero in the world of broadcast journalism and aint gonna want to spend time having a confab with the likes of you she hasnt met me yet rune said and she devoutly wants to keep it that way believe me how come everybody talks about her like shes some kind of dragon lady the model exhaled a sharp laugh through his nose i like you rune which is why im not going to ruin your evening by telling you anything more about piper sutton what do you want the womans raspy alto v v voice barked whoare you she was in her early forties with a handsome broad stern face her skin was dry and she wore subtle powdery makeup eyes deep grayblue her hair was mostly blonde though it was masterfully highlighted with silver streaks the strands were frozen in place with spray rune walked up to the desk and crossed her arms ithe phone rang and piper sutton turned away snagged the receiver she listened frowning no she said emphatically listened a moment more uttered a more ominous no rune glanced at her creamcolored suit and burgundy silk blouse her shoes were black and glistening names like bergdorf bendel and ferragamo came to mind but rune had no idea which name went with which article of clothing the woman sat behind a large antique desk under a wall filled with blotched and squiggly modern paintings and framed photos of her shaking hands with or embracing a couple of presidents and some other distinguished grayhaired men the phone conversation continued and rune was completely ignored she looked around two of the walls in the office were floortoceiling windows looking west and south it was on the fortyfifth floor of the networks parent company building a block away from the studio rune stared at a distant horizon that might have been pennsylvania across from the desk was a bank of five inch nec monitors each one tuned to a different network station though the volume was down their busy screens fired an electronic hum into the air then do it the woman snapped and dropped the phone into the cradle she looked back at rune cocked an eyebrow okay what it is is this im a cameraman for the local station and i suttons voice rose with gritty irritation why are you here how did you get in questions delivered so fast it was clear she had a lot more where they came from rune could have told her she snuck in after suttons secretary went into the corridor to buy tea from the tenam coffee service cart but all she said was there was nobody outside and i sutton waved a hand to silence her she grabbed the telephone receiver and stabbed the intercom button there was a faint buzz from the outer office no one answered she hung up the phone rune said anyway i sutton said anyway nothing leave she looked down at the sheet of paper shed been reading brows narrowing in concentration after a moment she looked up again genuinely surprised rune was still there miss sutton ms sutton rune began ive got this like idea alike idea what is alike idea rune felt a blush crawl across her face i have an idea for a story id like to do for your show i wait sutton slapped her mont blanc pen onto the desk i dont understand what youre doing here i dont know you rune said just give me a minute please i dont have time for this i dont care if you work here or not you want me to call security the phone rose once more rune paused a moment took a figurative breath okay she told herself do it she said quicklycurrent events came in at number nine in nationwide viewership according to the cbstime poll last week she struggled to keep her voice from quavering three months ago it was rated five in the same poll thats quite a drop suttons unreadable eyes bore into runes oh christ am i really saying these things but there was nothing to do but keep going i can turn those ratings in the other direction sutton looked at runes necklace id badge oh brother im going to get fired rune got fired with great regularity usually her reaction was to say thems the breaks and head off to unemployment today she prayed none of this would happen the telephone went back into the cradle sutton said youve got three minutes thank you thank you thank you okay what it is i want to do a story about what do you meanyou want to do a story you said youre a cameraman give the idea to a producer i want to produce it myself suttons eyes swept over her again this time not recording her name for referral to the termination division of the human resources department but examining her closely studying the young makeupless face her black tshirt black spandex miniskirt blue tights and fringy red cowboy boots dangling from her lobes were earrings in the shape of sushi on her left wrist were three wristwatches with battered leather straps painted gold and silver on her right were two bracelets one silver in the shape of two hands gripped together the other a string friendship bracelet from her shoulder dangled a leopardskin bag out of one cracked corner it bled an inkstained kleenex you dont look like a producer ive already produced one film a documentary it was on pbs last year so do a lot of film students the lucky ones maybe you were lucky why dont you like me youre assuming i dont well do you rune asked sutton considered whatever the conclusion was she kept it to herself youve got to understand this she waved her hand vaguely toward rune is deja vu it happens all the time somebody blusters their way in usually after hiding by the filing cabinet until sandy goes to get coffee sutton lifted an eyebrow and says oh ive got thislike idea for a great new news program or game show or special or god knows and of course the idea is very veryboring because young enthusiastic people are very veryboring and nine times out tenno ninetynine times out of a hundred their great idea has been thought of and discarded by people who really work in the business you think hundreds of people just like you havent come in here and said exactly the same thing to me oh note the proper use of the word like as a preposition not an adjective or adverb both phones rang at once and sutton spun around to take the calls she juggled them for a while jamming her shortnailed finger down on the hold button as she switched from one to the other when she hung up she found rune sitting in a chair across from her swinging her legs back and forth sutton gave a harsh sigh didnt i make my point rune said i want to do a story on a murderer who was convicted only he didnt do it i want my story to get him released suttons hand paused over the phone here in new york yep thats metro not national talk to the local news director you shouldve known that in the first place i want it be on current events sutton blinked then she laughed honey thats the nets flagship news magazine ive got veteran producers lined up for two years with programs theyd kill to air onc e yourlike story aint getting slotted in my show in this lifetime rune leaned forward but this guy has served three years in harrison state prisonthree years for a crime he didnt commit sutton looked at her for a moment whered you get the tip he sent a letter to the station its really sad he said hes going to die if he doesnt get out other prisoners are going to kill him anyway i went to the archives and looked through some of the old tapes about his trial and who told you to no one i did it myself your time or our time huh huh sutton repeated sarcastically then as if explaining to a child were you onyour time or onour time when you were doing this homework sort of on my lunch hour sutton saidsort of uhhuh well so this man is innocent a lot of innocent people get convicted thats not news unless hes famous is he famous a politician an actor rune blinked she felt very young under the womans probing eyes tonguetied its sort of its not so muchwho he is as it is the fact he was convicted of a crime he didnt commit and hes sort of going to just rot in jail or get killed or something you think hes innocent then go to law school or set up a defense fund and get him out were a news department were not in the business of social services no itll be a really good story and itll be sort of like rune heard her clumsy words and froze she must think im a total idiot sutton raised her eyebrows and rune continued carefully if we get him released then all the other stations and newspapersll coverus us well you andcurrent events for getting the guy out of jail sutton waved her hand its a small story its a local story sutton began writing on the sheet of paper in front of her her handwriting was elegant thats all well if you could maybe just keep this rune opened her bag and handed sutton a sheet of paper with a synopsis of the story the anchor woman slipped it underneath her china coffee cup on the far side of her desk and returned to the document shed been reading outside the womans office the secretary looked up at rune in horror who are you her voice was high in panic how did you get in here sorry got lost rune said gloomily and continued toward the darkpaneled elevator bank the elevator doors had just opened when rune heard a voice like steel on stone you piper sutton shouted pointed at rune back in here now rune hurried back to the office sutton close to six feet towered over her she hadnt realized the anchorwoman was so tall she hated tall women sutton slammed the door shut behind them sit rune did when she too was seated sutton said you didnt tell me it was randy boggs rune said hes not famous you said you werent interested in somebody who wasnt you shouldve given me all the facts rune looked contrite sorry i didnt think all right boggscould be news tell me what youve found out i read the letter and i watched those tapesof the trial and one somebody did of him in prison a year ago he says hes innocent sutton snapped and and thats it what do you mean thats it thats why you think hes innocent because hesaid so he said the police didnt really investigate the crime they didnt try to find many witnesses and they didnt really spend any time talking to the ones they did find didnt he tell that to his lawyer i dont know and thatsall sutton asked its just that i i dont know i looked at his face on the tape and i believe him youbelieve him sutton laughed again she opened her desk and took out a pack of cigarettes she lit one with a silver lighter inhaled for a long moment rune looked around the room trying to think up an answer to defend herself being studied by piper sutton knocked most of the thoughts out of her head all she said was read the letter rune nodded toward the file shed given the woman sutton found it and read she asked this is a copy you have the original i thought the police might need it for evidence if he ever got a new trial the originals locked in my desk sutton closed the file said i guess im looking at quite a judge of human character youre what some justice psychic you get the vibes that this mans innocent and thats that listen dear at the risk of sounding like a journalism professor let me tell you something theres only one thing that matters in news the truth thats all youve got a goddamn feeling this man is innocent well good for you but you go asking questions based on rumors just because you get some kind of psychic fax that boggs is innocent well that bullshit sink a news department real fast not to mention your career unsupported claimsre cyanide in this business rune said i was going to do the story right i know how to research i know how to interview i wasnt going to go with anything that wasnt oh hell corroborated orcollaborated which was it rune wasnt good with soundalike words backed up sutton calmed all right what youre saying is you have a hunch and you want to check it out i guess i am you guess you are sutton nodded then pointed her cigarette at rune let me ask you a question shoot im not suggesting that you not pursue this story rune tried to sort out thenots sutton continued id never suggest that a reporter shouldnt go after a story he feels strongly about rune nodded wrestling withthis batch of negatives but i just wonder if your efforts arent a little misplaced boggs had his day in court and even if there were some minor irregularities at trial well so what but i just have this feeling hes innocent what can it hurt to look into it suttons matte face scanned the room slowly then homed in on the young woman she said in a low voice are you sure youre not doing a story aboutyou rune blinked me are you doing a story about randy boggs or about a young ambitious journalist sutton smiled again a smile with a childs fake innocence and said whatre you concerned with mosttelling the truth about boggs or making a name for yourself rune didnt speak for a minute i think hes innocent im not going to debate the matter with you im simply asking the question only you can answer it and i think youve got to do a lot of soulsearching to answer it honestly what happens ifi wont say it turns out hes innocent because i dont think he is but if you find some new evidence that can convince a judge to grant him a new trial and boggs gets released pending that trial and what if he robs a convenience store and kills the clerk or a customer in the process rune looked away unable to sort out her thoughts too many tough questions what the anchorwoman said made a lot of sense she said i think hes innocent but her voice was uncertain she hated the sound then she said firmly its a story thats got to be done sutton gazed at her for a long moment then asked you ever budgeted a segment on a news program you ever assigned personnel you ever worked with unions im union im a camera suttons voice rose dont be stupid i knowyoure union im asking if youve ever dealt with the trades as management no sutton said abruptly okay whatever you do it isnt going to be as sole producer youre too inexperienced dont worry im like real suttons mouth twisted enthusiastic a fast learner hard working is that what you were going to say im good thats what i was going to say miracles can happen sutton said pointing a long rudder finger at rune you can be assistant producer you can report and you can sutton grinned like write the story assuming you write more articulately than you speak but i want somebody whos been around for a while to be in charge youre way too rune stood up and put her hands on the desktop sutton leaned back and blinked rune said im not a child i came here to tell you about a story i think is going to be good for you and for the network and all you do is insult me i didnthave to come here i couldve gone to the competition i couldve just sat on the story and done it myself but sutton laughed and held her hand up come on babes spare me please i dont need to see your balls everybody in this business has em or theyd be out on their ear in five minutes im not impressed she picked up her pen glancing down at the document in front of her you want to do the story go see lee maisel youll work for him rune stayed where she was for a moment her heart pounding she watched as sutton read a contract as dense as the classified section in the sundaytimes anything else sutton glanced up rune said no i just want to say ill do a super job wonderful sutton said without enthusiasm then what was your name again rune is that a stage name sort of well rune if youre really going to do this story and you dont give up halfway through because its too much work or too tough or you dont have enough chutzpah im not going to give up im going to get him released no youre going to find thetruth whatever it is whether it gets him released or proves he kidnapped the lindbergh baby too right rune said the truth if youre really going to do it dont talk to anybody about it except lee maisel and me i want status reports regularly verbally none of this memo bullshit got it no leaks to anyone thats the most important thing you can do right now the competition isnt going to find out sutton was sighing and shaking her head the same way runes algebra teacher had when shed flunked for the second time its not the competition im worried about im worried that youre wrong that he really is guilty if we lose a story to another network well that happens its part of the game but if theres rumors flying around about a segment were doing and it turns out to be wrong its my ass on the line comprende honey rune nodded and quickly lost the staring contest sutton broke the tension with a question she sounded amused as she asked im curious about one thing do you know who randy boggs was convicted of killing i read his name but i dont exactly remember but what ill do sutton held up a hand to cut her off his name was lance hopper does that mean anything to you not really it ought to he was head of network news here he was our boss now you see why youre playing with fire lee maisel was a large balding bearded man in his fifties he wore brown slacks and a tweed jacket over a tieless buttondown dress shirt and a worn burgundyandbeige argyle sweater he smoked a meerschaum pipe yellowed from smoke and age the pipe was one of a dozen scattered over his desk he didnt look like a man who made as executive producer of one of the countrys most popular tv newsmagazines over one million dollars a year i mean how was i supposed to know who lance hopper was how indeed maisel and rune sat in his large office in the networks portion of the old armory building unlike piper suttons office in the parents highrise maisels was only thirty feet in the air and overlooked a bowling alley rune liked it that he was down here with his troops maisel even looked like a general she could picture him in khaki shorts and a pith helmet sending tanks after nazis in north africa rune was next to a large mr coffee machine she looked at it uncertainlyas if the pot contained nuclear sludge that the coffee resembled he said turkish he poured a cup for himself and raised an eyebrow she shook her head piper really rides on hyper doesnt she rune asked then it occurred to her that maybe she shouldnt be talking about sutton this way at least not to him maisel didnt say anything though he asked you dont grasp the significance about hopper all i know is piper said he was head of the network our boss maisel turned and dug through a stack of glossy magazines on his credenza he found one and handed it to her it wasnt a magazine though but an annual report of the networks parent company maisel leaned forward and opened it to a page near the center then rested a thick yellow fingertip on one picture thats lance hopper rune read lawrence w hopper executive vice president she was looking at a tall jowly businessman in a dark suit and white shirt he wore a red bow tie he was in his fifties handsome in a businessman sort of way rockhard eyes you understand what youve done maisel said no not exactly maisels tongue touched the corner of his mouth he toyed with one of his pipes replaced it boggs was convicted of killing a man i knew and worked with a man piper knew and worked with lance could be a son of a bitch but he was one hell of a journalist and he turned the network around he fell into the walter cronkite and david brinkley and mike wallace pantheon of broadcast journalism gods he was that good everybody respected lance hopper when boggs was convicted of killing him you shouldve heard the applause in the newsroom now hereyou come and say boggs isnt guilty thats going to cause problems around here loyalty problems and it could get you and everybody involved in the project in a lot of trouble maisel continued look i interviewed boggs myself hes a drifter hes never had a decent job in his life everybody agrees with the jury that he did it if youre right and hes innocent youre going to be pretty unpopular around here and you arent going to win any awards from the judge and prosecutor either and if youre wrong youll still be pretty unpopular but not around here because you wont beworking here anymore see the significance but what difference does popularity make if hes innocent hes innocent are you as naive as you seem to be peter pansmy favorite play maisel smiled maybe itis better to have balls than brains rune smelled sweetsour whisky on his breath yes maisel certainly fit the mold of an oldtime journalist why dont you find anice criminal whos been wrongly imprisoned and get him out of jail why do you have to crusade for an asshole rune said innocent assholes shouldnt be in jail any more than innocent saints which earned an outright laugh rune could tell he didnt want to smile but he did he looked at her for a minute piper called me and said there was a well an eager young thing from the local station who rune asked is that how she described me eager maisel dug into his pipe with a silver tool that looked like a large flattened nail not exactly but lets let it go at that and when she told me i thought oh boy another one eager obnoxious ambitious but she wont have grit i have grit maisel said i think you may and i have to tell you even though i think hes guilty the boggs case went a little too smoothly too fast did the media hang him out to dry before the trial rune asked maisel leaned back the media hangsall defendants out to dry before the trial thats a constant im just speaking of the cops and the court system i think this may bemaybea story worth telling if you do it right i can do it i really can piper said youre a cameraman you have any other experience i did a documentary it was on pbs public broadcasting he asked derisively well current events is a hell of a lot different from pbs it costs over a halfmillion dollars a week to produce we dont get grants we survive because of advertising revenue geared to our nielsen and arbitron we earn our way last week we had tenpointseven rating points you know what a point represents not exactly each point means that nine hundred and twentyone thousand homes are watching us awesome rune said losing the math but thinking that a lot of people were going to see her program were fighting against some of the biggestdrawing shows in the history of television this season were up againstnext door neighbors andborder patrol rune nodded looking impressed even though shed only seen one episodeof neighborsthe seasons big hit sitcomand thought it was the stupidest thing on tv full of wisecracking and mugging for the camera and idiotic oneliners border patrol had great visuals and a super sound track though all that ever happened was the cute young agent and the older wiser agent argued about departmental procedures then saved each others ass on alternate weeks while administering large doses of political correctness to the audience current events on the other hand she watched all the time maisel continued weve got four twelveminute segments each week surrounded by millions of dollars of commercials you dont have time to be leisurely you dont have time to develop subjects and give the audience mood shots youll shoot ten thousand feet of tape and use five hundred were classy weve got computer graphics coming out of our ears we paid ninety thousand dollars for synthesized theme music by this hotshot new age musician this is the big time our stories arent about sexchange operations dolphins saving fishermens lives threeyearold crack dealers we reportnews its a magazine the way the oldlife orlook were magazines remember that rune nodded magazine maisel continued as in pictures ill want lots of visuals tape of the original crime scene old footage new interviews rune sat forward oh yeah and how about claustrophobic prison scenes you know small green rooms and bars maybe the rooms where they hose down prisoners beforeandafter pictures of boggsto see how thin and pale hes gotten good i like that maisel looked at a slip of paper piper said youre with the local station ill have you assigned to me you mean ill be on staff ofcurrent events her pulse picked up exponentially temporarily thats fantastic maybe and maybe not maisel said lets see how you feel about it after youve interviewed a hundred people and been up all night i stay up late all the time editing tape rune conceded dancing usually maisel said dancing he seemed amused he said okay heres the situation normally we assign a staff producer but for some reason piper wants you to work directly with me nobody else i dont have anybody to spare for camera work so youre on your own there but you know how the hardware works im saving up to buy my own betacam wonderful he said with a bored sigh then selected a pipe and took a leather pouch of tobacco from his desk a secretarys spunhaired head appeared she said that maisels eleven oclock appointment had arrived his phone started ringing his attention was elsewhere now one thing he said to rune what ill support you a hundred percent if you stick to the rules wherever the story takes you but you fuck with the facts you try tocreate a story when there isnt one there you speculate you lie to me piper or the audience and ill cut you loose in a second and youll never work in journalism in this city again got that yessir so get to work rune blinked thats it i thought you were going to like tell me what to do or something as he turned to the phone maisel said abruptly okay ill tell you what to do you think theres a story out there well go get it this ain you sure it is only what i did with my hair was i used henna and this kind of purple stuff then id use mousse to get it spiky the security guard at the new york state department of correctional services manhattan office looked at runes laminated press pass from the network dangling a chrome chain tail it showed a picture of her with a woodpeckery glossy hairdo and wearing round tinted john lennon glasses this ain you no really she dug the glasses out of her purse and put them on then grabbed her hair and pulled it straight up see the guard looked back and forth for a moment from the id to the person then nodded and handed the pass back to her you want my opinion keep that stuff outta yo hair that ain healthy for nobody rune put the chain necklace over her head she walked into the main office looking at the bulletin boards the governmentissue desks the battered water fountains it seemed like a place where people in charge of prisons should work claustrophobic colorless quiet she thought about poor randy boggs serving three years in his tiny cell the first thing you think is hell im still here a tall man in a rumpled creamcolored suit walked past her glancing down at her pass he paused youre press rune didnt understand him at first oh press yeah im a reporter current events you know the news he laughed everybody knowscurrent events he stuck his hand out im bill swenson head of press relations here she shook his hand and introduced herself then she said i guess im looking for you i have to talk to somebody about interviewing a prisoner is this for a story rune said uhhuh not a problem but you dont have to go through us you can contact the wardens office directly for permission and then the prisoner himself to arrange a time to meet if the warden agrees thats all yes swenson said what facility harrison doing hard time huh yeah i guess it would be whos the prisoner she was hesitating well swenson said weve got to know dont worryi wont leak it i didnt get where i am by screwing journalists she said okay its randy boggs he was convicted of killing lance hopper swenson nodded oh sure i remember that case three years ago hopper worked for your company right wait he was head of the network thats right only the thing is i think boggs is innocent innocent really rune nodded and im going to try to get the case reopened and get him released or a new trial thats going to make one hell of a story swenson glanced up and down the halls off the record sure rune felt a chill of excitement here was her first confidential source every year therere dozens of people wrongly convicted in new york sometimes they get out sometimes they dont its a scary thing to think it could happen i think itll make a good story swenson started down the hall back toward the exit rune followed him he said theyll give you the phone number of the warden in harrison at the main desk he escorted her through the security gate and to the door she said im glad i ran into you good luck he said ill look for the show when rune climbed up the gangway onto her houseboat which was rocking gently in the hudson river off the western part of greenwich village she heard crying inside a childs crying her hand hesitated at the deadbolt then she unlocked the door and walked inside claire rune said uncertainly then because she couldnt think of anything else to say she added youre still here in the middle of the living room the young woman was on her knees comforting threeyearold courtney claire nodded at rune and gave her a sullen smile then turned back to the little girl its okay honey what happened she just fell shes okay claire was a few years older than rune they looked a lot alike except that claire was into a beatnik phase while rune shunned the antique look for new wave claire dyed her hair black and pulled it straight back in a severe pony tail she often wore pedal pushers and blackandwhitestriped pullovers her face was deathly white and on her lips was the loudest crimson lipstick max factor dared sell her only advantage in her rooming here since shed stopped paying rent was that her fashion statement added to the houseboats decor which was eisenhowererce suburban after claire had lost her job at celestial crystals on broadway and been evicted from her fifthfloor east village walkup shed begged rune to take her and her daughter in claire had said come on just a day or two itll be fun like a pajama party that had been six weeks agoand what had followed had been like no pajama party rune had ever been to that morning before rune went to work claire had told her that shed gotten a new job and promised that she and courtney would be gone by dinnertime now claire stood up and shook her head in disgust what it is that guy he backed out some people some effing people rune didnt exactly remember who that guy was or what he was backing out of but rune was now even madder at him than claire was shes gotta go talk now or later now she decided but her courage broke shit she dropped her leopardskin bag on the purple shag kidneyshaped scrap of carpet that shed found on the street then bent down and kissed the threeyearolds forehead courtney stopped crying rune she said story read me a story she was dressed in blue jeans and a dirty yellow pullover later honey its time for dinner rune said crouching down and smoothing the girls curly dark hair this hair is like totally audacious she stood up and walked into the galley of the houseboat as she poured grapenuts into a large bowl and added chocolate chips and cashews she shouted to claire her hair i was saying what it is is all that garbage we use we dye it and we mousse it and we perm it ill bet if you never touch your hair itd be as nice as that forever claire said sourly well sure but that would like be so boring rune came back into the living room eating the cereal and drinking a molson golden you eaten we ate chinese courtney too is that good for her claire said are you kidding there are a billion people in china and whatta you think they grew up on i dont know youreeating that crap claire glanced at the cereal im not a threeyearold dont you watch commercials shes supposed to be eating that gross stuff that comes in jars you know like pureed carrots and spinach rune claire said shes not an infant shes got teeth i like spinch courtney said rune said i was you id get that book spock the guy on the oldstar trek claire asked different spock claire said the vulcan nerve pinch thats what id like to learn put em right to sleep whats a vulcan courtney asked then she disappeared into the bedroom without waiting for an answer she returned a few minutes later pulling a stuffed dragon by the tail rune made the dragon dance then hug courtney she asked the little girl whats her name do you remember persephy very good persephone and who was persephone courtney held up the dragon no i mean in real life claire said real life she was a goddess courtney answered she was zeuss little girl claire said i dont think its a good idea youre teaching her that stuff like its true what isnt true about it about the gods and goddesses and fairies and all that shit shit said courtney rune said to claire youre saying its not true you believe in roman goddesses persephone was greek im not saying i believe and im not saying i dont i want her to grow up to be a highly grounded person claire said oh get real rune said your goal in life is to get to every club in downtown manhattan and never pay for a drink yourself thats reality i want her to be an adult rune whispered shes three years old shell grow up fast enough claire cocked an eyebrow at rune some people i know have resisted adulthood totally successfully she smiled sweetly favor please im broke naw what it is is i gotta go out tonight babysit will you claire i met this guy and he was talking about a job he might hire me whichclubre you going to meet him at rune asked wryly s o bs claire admitted but he really thinks he can get me work come on please nodding at her daughter you two get along so good rune looked at courtney wedo get along dont we dude gimme five high she held up her hand and courtney crawled forward they slapped upraised palms dude the little girl said then crawled back to persephone rune looked at her face and didnt see much of claire in it she wondered who the father was claire she knew occasionally wondered the same after a moment rune said you know im not like too good with saying things like this rune paused hoping claire would pick up on the hint but she was concentrating on putting a fake diamond earring into one of the holes on the side of her nose rune continued what im saying is you reallyvegot to find a place to live i didnt plan on staying this long its not that easy to find a place to live in manhattan i know rune said look i dont want to kick you out claire got solemn for a moment the truth is im thinking about going back to boston just to get my act together for a while what do you think hallelujah rune said i think thats a very mature thing to do really i do absolutely ill stay with my mother shes got a nice house i can have the upstairs to myself the only thing that bothers me is i dont know what i could do there exactly rune wasnt sure what claire could do here in manhattan either except hang out and go to clubs which she could probably do in boston just as easily and for a lot less money but she said boston s supposed to be a wonderful place history lots of history yeah history but excuse me what do you do with history you dont have todo anything with it its just neat rune hefted courtney to the windowsill propped her on her hip just look out there honey and picture it three hundred years ago you know who lived there indians the canarsie indians and there were bears and deer and everything like the zoo the girl said can we go to the zoo sure we can maybe tomorrow and see over there all those roads they used to be tobacco fields they called the place sapokanikan it means the tobacco plantation then the settlers came up here from new york city which was all down by the battery then they came up here because they had all these terrible plagues or epidemics and they saw all these fields and farmland and the place got called green village and now its greenwich village and its got bagels and coffeehouses and atm machines and the antique clothes boutique rune shook her head oh youre just so sitcom its disgusting claire said so boston you mind if i spend some time there mind rune felt as if shed just gotten a package in a turquoise tiffanys box id say do it then i will claire said lethargically she yawned and pulled a vial out of her purse you want some coke coke said courtney rune took claire by the arm roughly whispering viciously are you crazy look what youre teaching her she snatched the vial and spoon away from claire and tossed them back into the purse claire pulled away angrily coke is real dragons and goddesses arent you keep your reality rune stood up and took courtney by the hand and led her up onto the outer deck come on honey ill read you a story an hour later courtney asked one more please rune debated flipping through the book of fairy stories she glanced down into the galley and saw claire doing a small line of coke off her compact mirror okay rune said one more then off to bed she looked at the story the book had fallen open to and laughedthe snow princess which seemed like a good choice since claire had a nose blizzard going at the moment once upon a time in a land far away courtney yawned and lay down with her head in runes lap thats right in a land far away there lived an old couple who never had any children im a children the man and woman loved each other dearly but dreamed about how happy they would be if only they had a daughter to share their life with then one winter as the husband was walking home through the forest he saw a snowman that some children had built and he had an idea he went home and together with his wife they built a little princess out of snow whats snow last winter that white stuff i dont remember the girl said frowning it comes out of the sky and its white feathers no its like wet milk never mind anyway the couple went to bed and all night long they wished and wished real hard and what do you think happened they got a little girl rune nodded in the morning when they woke up there was the most beautiful little princess who looked just like the girl the couple had made out of snow the night before they hugged her and kissed her and they spent all their time playing with her and taking the little girl for walks in the forest the couple was so happy then one day a handsome prince came riding along through the snow and saw the snow princess playing in a snowfilled field beside the couples house they looked at each other and fell in love whats courtney began never mind that the thing is he wanted the snow princess to come live with him in his castle at the foot of the mountain the snow princesss parents were very sad and begged her not to go but she married the prince and went off to live with him in the castle they were very happy throughout the winter then one day in early spring the sun came out strong and hot as the snow princess was walking with her husband rune paused and read ahead in the story to the part where the sun gets hotter and hotter and the princess melts the water running through her husbands fingers into the ground until theres nothing left of her she looked up at the girls expectant face and thought weve got a problem here go on courtney said pretending to read rune said well the sun was so hot that the snow princess remembered how much she missed her parents and she kissed her husband goodbye and climbed back up to the mountain village where she moved back in with her parents and got a job and met a neat guy who was also made out of snow and they lived happily ever after i like that story courtney said in her tone of an official pronouncement claire came out on deck time for bed courtney didnt complain much rune kissed her good night then helped claire put her pajamas on her and get her into bed you know if youre interested claire said its much easier to meet men in boston you want me to go to boston with you just to meet men sure why not because most men are damaged to start with why should i go somewhere where itseasier to meet men id think youd want to go where its harder whats wrong with men havent you noticed something rune asked how many men do you know whose iq matches their age you gonna marry sam hes a great guy rune said defensively uneasy with the m word we have a good time claire sighed hes twenty years older than you hes going bald hes married hes separated rune said anyway what twentyfiveyearolds with hair have you met thatre such good catches admitting to herself though that the married part was definitely an ongoing problem you move to boston youll be married in six months i guarantee it claire pirouetted how do i look like a hooker circa rune said stunning claire grabbed her bag and slung it over her shoulder i owe you one i know you do rune said and watched her clatter unsteadily down the gangplank on highheeled saddle shoes the note on her desk the next morning from maisel was to the point sutton s office the minute you come in lee rune had received a lot of notes like this and they were usually the preface to flunking a course getting fired or getting yelled at heart pounding she left her morning thunder tea on her desk and walked out of the studio in ten minutes she was standing in front of piper suttons secretary yesterdays look of terror at runes unauthorized entry had been replaced by a subtle gloat rune said im supposed to see theyre waiting for you is it okay to theyre waiting for you the woman repeated cheerfully inside sutton and maisel turned their heads and stared as she approached rune stopped halfway into the big office close the door sutton ordered rune obeyed then walked into the room she smiled at maisel who avoided her eyes oh boy she thought oh boy suttons eyes were flint she said sit down just as rune was dropping into the chair across from the desk rune felt a shiver down her back and the hairs on her neck stirred sutton tossed a copy of one of the citys tabloids on her desk rune picked it up and read a story circled in thick red ink that bled into the fibers of the newsprint network wants to free killer of its exec by bill stevens the story was short just a few paragraphs it recounted how a reporter fromcurrent events was investigating randy boggss conviction for lance hoppers murder boggss defense lawyer fred megler had no comment other than to say that his client has always maintained his innocence oh shit she muttered how sutton tapped her glossy fingernails on the desktop they were as red and hard as the finish on a porsche howd it happen its not my fault he lied to me bill stevens that wasnt the name he gave me i was at the department of corrections and this guy came up and said he worked for the press department and could he help me and he was real nice and he even told me things off the record so i assumed it was okay to assumed it was okay suttons voice rose she lifted her eyes to the ceiling i dont believe it maisel sighed thiss the oldest trick in the book jesus rune you fucked this one up stevens is a beat reporter for the paper he covers the government agencies when he sees a reporter whos new and doesnt recognize him he finds out what their assignment is then scoops them you walked right into his arms sutton lit a cigarette and slapped the lighter down on the desktop a fucking babe in the woods he seemed like a nice guy what the hell does nice have to do with anything maisel asked exasperated this is journalism all ruined my one big chance and i blew it right out of the gate sutton asked maisel damage assessment none of the other nets are that interested he touched the tabloid even stevens didnt follow up on boggs the focus of the story was thatwere trying to get him out so we look like idiots if it doesnt pan out he toyed with an unlit pipe and stared at the ceiling the storys hit some syndicated news services but so far all weve had are a couple junior reporters call publicity for statements nobody on wallaces or rathers level nobody frommedia in review its a pain in the ass but i dont think its critical sutton kept her eyes on rune as she said ive already gotten a call from semple maisel closed his eyes ouch i thought he was in paris he is theherald tribune picked up the story in their third edition dan semple was the current head of network news hed taken over when lance hopper was killed he was give or take a few miracles god one of the reasons that hopper was so sorely missed was that he was an angel compared with semple who was known for his vicious temper and cutthroat business practices hed even punched a junior producer whod carelessly lost an exclusive to cnn maisel asked what was his reaction not fit for human consumption sutton said hell be back in a few days and he wants to talk about it she sighed corporate politics just what we need now and with the budgets coming up in a monthsutton looked at the newspaper gestured at it then glanced at rune but the big danger of this is what maisel was nodding but rune didnt get it think sutton snapped i dont know im sorry maisel supplied the answer that another magazine or feature programll pick up the lead and bring out the story at the same time we do its a news policy we dont spend time and money on a story if theres a chance well be preempted rune rocked forward in the chair it wont happen again i promise ill be so skeptical you wont believe it rune sutton began look what ill do is ask people when i interview them if anybody from any other station has been asking them questions if they have been ill tell you i promise that way you can decide if you want to go ahead with the story or not maisel said the only weapon journalists have is their minds youve got to start using yours i will just like the scarecrow sutton asked the what you know the wizard of oz he wanted a brain and enough sutton waved her hand managing to make her face both blank and hostile at the same time finally she said all right keep on it but if anybody beats us to the punch im talkinganybody a rap station mtv columbia s student station we drop the project lee okay with me maisel said lighting another cigarette sutton nodded and said all right but this was your last strike babes i thought you got three rune said standing up retreating to the door sutton tossed the lighter onto her desk it skidded into a crystal ashtray we play by my rules around here not the american leagues the chameleon sat on the wall at an angle frozen in space hardly breathing jack nestor lay in bed and watched it he liked chameleons not the way they changed color which wasnt so spectacular when it came right down to it it was more the way they were fragile and soft he sometimes could get up real close to them the ones around the miami beach starlite motor lodge were used to people hed pick one up and let it walk along his massive tanned forearm he liked feeling the babyskin of the lizard and the pleasant tickle of its feet sometimes hed plop one down on his dark blurred tattoo hoping it would turn to that deep blue color but it never did they didnt change to flesh color either what they did was they jumped the hell off his arm and scurried away like long roaches nestor was fortyeight years old but looked younger he still had a thick wavy mass of hair which he kept in place with vitalis and spray it was dark blond though with some timid streaks of gray nestor had a squarish head and a hint of a double chin but the only thing about his body that bothered him was his belly nestor was fat his legs were strong and thin and he had good shoulders but his large chest sat above a round belly that jutted out and curled over his waistband hiding his marine corps belt buckle nestor didnt understand why he had this problem he couldnt remember the last time hed sat down to a proper meal roast beef and potatoes and bread and vegetables and pie for dessert he thought it was probably christmas day six years ago when the prison cooks had laid out a really good spread what he ate now was just kentucky fried and whoppers and big macs he missed arthur treachers fish n chips and wondered if they were still in business anywhere anyway he thought it wasnt fair that all he was eating was these fucking tiny meals and he was still gaining weight nestor noticed two redandwhitestriped boxes in bed the colonel grinned at him nestor kicked the boxes onto the floor they tumbled open and bones and coleslaw shreds scattered on the floor the chameleon took off ooops nestor said he pulled on his tshirt and smoothed his hair back he yawned and groped on the bedside table for a cigarette the pack was empty but he found a used one still an inch long lit it and stacked the cheap pillows against the headboard he sat back yawned again and coughed flashes of sun shot off speeding car windows and burst against the wall the rooms window as advertised did overlook the beach that much was true however the view had to get across six lanes of highway two access roads and the hotel parking lot before it eased through the streaked window of room nestor listened to the sticky rush of the traffic for a few minutes then reached over and squeezed the butt of the young woman lying next to him the third time when he got a little rougher she stirred no she mumbled with a thick cuban accent rise and shine nestor said she was in her midthirties with a body that looked ten years younger and a face that went ten years the other way her eye shadow and mascara were smeared the lipstick too was a mess and it looked as if her lips had slid to the side of her face she opened her eyes briefly rolled over on her back and pulled a thin sheet up to her navel no not again what not again it hurt last night you didnt say nothing about it hurting so you wouldnt have stopped that was true but he would at least have asked if she felt better before they went to sleep you all right now i just dont wanna nestor didnt want to either what he wanted was breakfast two egg mcmuffins and a large coffee he crushed out the cigarette and bent down and kissed her breast mumbling eyes closed she said no jacky i dont wanta i have to go to the bathroom well i gotta have either you or breakfast so whats it gonna be after a moment what you want for breakfast he told her and five minutes later she was in her orange spandex miniskirt struggling along the glisteningly hot sidewalk to the mcdonalds up the street nestor took a shower spending most of the time rubbing his stomach with this greenhandled pad with bumps on it somebodyd told him that if you did that it broke up the fat cells and flushed them away he thought he noticed a difference already even though on the scale he hadnt lost any weight yet he kneaded the large glossy starshaped scar six inches to the left of his navel a memento of the time a hollowpoint mm slug had made a journey through his abdomen nestor had never gotten used to the leathery feel of the flesh he had a habit of squeezing and running his fingers over it he rinsed off stepped out of the shower and spent a lot of time shaving then getting his hair into shape he dressed in a darkgreen shortsleeve knit shirt and the gray pants he always wore dungarees he wondered why anybody would call pants anything that started indung shitarees craparees he pulled on thin black nylon socks sheer like womens stockings then strapped on black sandals he stepped out of the bathroom which was filled with steam and hair spray mist and smelled the food which was resting on the tv the woman was sitting at the chipped desk putting on her makeup for a minute looking at her buoyant breasts in the tight yellow sweater nestors hunger for food wavered but then the mcmuffins won and he sat on the bed to eat he ate the first one quickly and then with the edge off his appetite lay back on the bed to read the paper and sip his coffee while he worked on the second one he noticed shed bought some insurance a third mcmuffin was also in the bag to keep his appetites and his hands occupied he laughed but she pretended she didnt know hed caught on hed gotten halfway through the front section of themiami herald reading the national news when he sat upright in bed oh shit she was curling her eyelashes huh but nestor was standing up walking to his dresser wiping his mouth with the back of his hand he pulled out a jumble of underwear and socks and knit shirts hey iron these for me he handed her the shirts jacky what is it just get the iron out okay she did and spread a thin towel on the desk for an ironing board she ironed each shirt then folded it precisely whatsa matter ive got to go away for a little while yeah where you going can i come too new york oh jacky ive never been forget about it thiss business she handed him the shirts then snorted what business you got no business i got a business i just never told you about it yeah so what do you do nestor began to pack a suitcase ill be back in a week or two he hesitated then took out his wallet and handed her two hundred and ten dollars im not back then pay seppie for the room for next couple weeks okay sure ill do that he looked at the dresser again then said to her hey check in the bathroom see if i left my razor she did this and when she wasnt looking nestor reached way back into the bottom drawer of the dresser and took out a darkblue steyr gb mm pistol and two full clips of bullets he slipped these into his bag then he said hey never mind i found it i packed it already she came up to him you gonna miss me he picked up the paper and tore out the story he read it again she came up and read over his shoulder what that about somebody getting some guy outta jail in new york he looked at her with irritation and put the scrap in his wallet she said who is that guy randy boggs nestor smiled in an unamused way and kissed her on the mouth then he said ill call you he picked up the bag and walked outside into the blast of humid heat glancing at a tiny chameleon sitting motionless in a band of shade on the peeling banister if he didnt do this crime he didsomething the mans voice went high at the end of the sentence and threatened to break apart he was in his late forties so skinny that his worn cowhide belt made pleats in slacks that were supposed to be straightcut and if he didsomething the jury says what the hell lets convict him ofthis rune nodded at the taut words randy boggss lawyer sat at his desk which was piled high yellow sheets court briefs redweld folders letters photographs of crime scenes an empty yogurt carton crusty on the rim a dozen cans of diet pepsi a shoe box she wondered if it contained a mafia clients fee the office was near broadway on maiden lane in lower manhattan where the streets were grimy dark crowded inside the building was a network of dirty green corridors the office of frederick t megler jd pc was at the end of a particularly dirty and particularly green corridor he sat back in his old leather chair his face was gray and mottled and would make occasional forays into exaggerated expressions wonder hatred surprise then snap back into its waiting state of innocent incredulity punctuated with a breathy nasal snort thats what i have to deal with the bony fingers of his right hand made a circuit of the air as he explained the judicial system in new york to rune the way the system works he looked at rune and his voice rose in volume for emphasis the way the system works is that the jury canonly convict you for the crime for which youve been accused they cant convict you because youre an asshole or because of the three guys you wasted last year or because of the old lady youregoing to mug tomorrow for her social security check just for the particular crime got it rune said meglers other set of bony fingers joined in they pointed at her you get things like this true story my clients arrested for killing some poor son of a bitch an ada assistant district attorney bless her young virginal soul brings him up on four counts murder two manslaughter one and two criminally negligent homicide those last three counts are what they call lesserincluded offenses theyre easier to prove if you cant get a conviction on murder which is hard to prove to the jury maybe you can get the manslaughter if you cant get that maybe youll get criminally negligent homicide okay so my client whos got a rap sheet a mile long had a grudge against the victim when the cops arrested him based on an informer he was in a bar in times square where four witnesses swore hed been drinking for the past five hours the victim was killed two hours before shot five times in the head at close range no murder weapon so your client had a perfect alibi rune said and no gun exactly the voice dipped from its screech and sounded earnest i grill the informant in court and by the time im through his storys as riddled as the vics forehead okay but what happens the juryconvicts my guy not of murder which is what they shouldve done if they believed the informant but of criminally negligent homicide which is total bullshit you dontnegligently shoot five bullets into somebodys head either you dont believe the alibi and convict him of murder or you let him off completely the chickenshit jury didnt have the balls to get him on murder but they couldnt let him walk because hes a black kid from the bronx who had a record andd said on a number of occasions he wanted to cut the vics spleen out of his body rune sat forward in her chair see thats just what im doing my story on an innocent man got convicted whoa honey who said my client was innocent she blinked and went through the facts for a moment i thoughtyou did what about the gun what about the alibi naw he killed the vic ditched the gun then paid four buddies a couple sixpacks of crack to perjure themselves but but the point is not is he guilty the point is you gotta play by the rules and the jury didnt you can only convict on the evidence that was presented the jury didnt do that whats so wrong with that he was guilty and the jury convicted him that sounds okay to me lets change the facts a little lets pretend that young black fred williams national merit scholar with a ticket to harvard medical school who all hes ever done bad is get a parking ticket is walking down a hundred and thirtyfifth street when two of new yorks finest screech up behind him get him in a choke hold then drag him to the precinct and book him for rape he gets picked out of a lineup because they all look alike et cetera and the case goes to trial there the da describes to a predominantly caucasian middleclass jury how this kid beat raped and sodomized a mother of two then a predominantly caucasian middleclass witness describes the perp as a black kid with razornotched hair and basketball sneakers and the predominantly caucasian middleclass doctor gets up and describes the victims injuries in horrifying detail what the fuck do you think is going to happen to fred hes going to jail and he aint gonna be just visiting rune was quiet so every time a shooter who clocks some poor asshole five times in the head gets convicted by a cheating jury ie a flawed legal system that means theres a risk that fred williams is gonna go down for something hedidnt do and as long as thats a risk then the worlds got to put up with people like me rune gave him a coy look sos that your closing argument megler laughed a variation on one of them ive got a great repertoire blows the jury away i dont really believe what youre saying but it looks like you do oh i do indeed and as soon as i stop believing it then im out of the business ill go into handicapping or professional blackjack the odds are better and you still get paid in cash now ive got some truly innocent clients arriving in about a half hour you said you wanted to ask me about the boggs case anything about that article i read this morning yes youre doing the story right can i tape you his thin face twisted he looked like ichabod crane in her illustrated copy ofsleepy hollow why dont you just take notes if youd feel more comfortable i would she pulled out a notebook she asked you represented boggs by yourself yep he was a section eighteen case indigent so the state paid my fee to represent him i really think hes innocent uhhuh no i really really think so you say so you dont my opinion of my clients innocence or guilt is completely totally irrelevant she asked could you tell me what happened about hoppers death i mean megler sat back in a thoughtful pose he studied the grimy ceiling the window was open a crack and exhaustscented april air wafted through the space and riffled stacks of paper the district attorneys case was that boggs was in manhattan just driving through from i dont know upstate someplace some witness said boggs was standing on the sidewalk talking with hopper and then they got into a fight over something hopperd just gotten home from work and had just pulled into the courtyard of his building on the upper west side the prosecutor speculated it was a traffic dispute runes eyes made a sardonic circuit of the room traffic but he was on the sidewalk you said maybe he parked after hopper cut him off and got out of the car i dont know but hey you asked what the assistant district attorney said im telling you im trying to be helpful am i being helpful helpful rune said what was randys story part of the problem was that hehad a story huh i tell all my clients if youre arrested dont take the stand under any circumstances the jury cant the judge tells them this the jury cant draw any conclusions from the defendants not taking the stand but randy against my advice i wanta point out did if you do that the prosecutor can introduce evidence of prior convictions for the purpose of attacking your honesty only that not to prove you have a criminal tendency just to show that you might lie but what does the jury hear fuck credibility all they hear is his string of arrests for petty crimes next thing you know boggs whos really a pretty decent guy whos had some bad luck is sounding like hitler hes got a petty larceny bust in ohio some juvie bullshit down in florida gta in whats that grand theft auto so suddenly the ada s making him sound like hes head of the gambino family he where was the gun let me finish willya he said he was with this guy picked him up hitchhiking a guy who was into some kind of credit card scam this guy goes to buy some hot plastic and boggs is waiting in the car he hears a shot up the street he gets out of the car he sees hopper lying there dead he turns and runs smack into a police car he had the gun the gun was off a ways in some bushes no prints but they traced it to a theft in miami about a year before the killing boggs had spent time in miami who was this other guy boggs didnt know he was hitchhiking along the taconic and the man picked him up they drove into the city together good rune said a witness excellent did you find him megler looked at her as if enthusiasm and the flu were pretty much the same thing yeah right even if hes real which he isnt a guy whos involved in a credit card boosts gonna come forward and testify i dont think so honey did randy describe him not very well all he said was his name was jimmy was a big guy but it was late it was dark et cetera et cetera you dont believe him believe not believe what difference does it make any other witnesses good question you want to go to law school if youre the end product i dont think you want to hear my answer megler she motioned for him to continue the lawyer said that was the big problem what fucked him excuse me what did him in was this witness the cops found someone in the building who described boggs and then later she ided him in a lineup she saw him pull out a gun and ice hopper ouch yeah ouch what was the name how would i know megler opened a file cabinet and retrieved a thick stack of paper he tossed it on the desk pepsi cans shook and dust rose its in there someplace you can have it you want what is it the trial transcript i ordered it as a matter of course but boggs didnt want to appeal so i just filed it he didnt want to appeal he kept claiming he was innocent but he said he wanted to get the clock running get his sentence over with and get on with his life rune said i saw in the story that the conviction was for manslaughter the jury convicted on manslaughter one he showed reckless disregard for human life got sentenced to fifteen years hes served almost three hell be eligible for parole in two and hell probably get it i hear hes a good boy what do you think about what is he one of your guilty clients of course the old iwasjusthitchhiking story you hear it all the time theres always a mysterious driver or girl or hit man or somebody who pulled the trigger and then disappears bullshit is what it is yeah boggs is guilty i can read them all but if i found new evidence ive heard this before no really he wrote me a letter he said the police dropped the ball on the investigation they found the witnesses they wanted and didnt look any further megler snorted cynically look in new york its almost impossible to get a conviction overturned because of new evidence he squinted recalling the law its got to be the kind of evidence that wouldve changed the outcome of the case in the first place and even then you have to be able to show you made diligent efforts to find the evidence at the time of the trial but if i do find something would you handle the case me he laughed im available but youre talking a lot of hours i bill at two twenty per and the state aint picking upthis tab but i really think hes innocent so you say come up with fifteen twenty thousand for a retainer ill talk to you i was hoping youd do it for free megler laughed again since he had no belly it seemed to be his bones that were jiggling under the slick polyester skin of his shirt free i dont believe im familiar with that word for the first time in her life rune had an assistant bradford simpson volunteered to help her she suspected he was motivated partly by his desire to go out with her though she couldnt for the life of her guess why hed want her and not some beautiful debutante who was tall and blonde two of her leastfavorite adjectives when applied to other women on the other hand he hadnt exactly asked her out again after the first rejection and she supposed that his reappearance had more to do with journalistic crusading than romance what can i do to help hed asked and shed gotten a little flustered since she didnt have a clue never having had anyone work for her hmm let me think hed offered how about if i dig through the archives for information about hopper that sounds good shed said he was now at her cubicle with another armful of files he laid them out on her desk as neatly as his robert redford hair was combed and his penny loafers were polished did you know lance hopper she asked him not real well he was killed a month after i started my first summer internship here but i worked for him once or twice youworked for the head of network news well i wasnt exactly an anchorman but he gave assignments to all the interns scut work usually but he also spent a lot of time with us telling us about journalism getting stories editing hes the one who started the intern program i think he wouldve made a good professor bradford fell quiet for a moment he did a lot for me for all of us interns rune broke the somber spell by saying dont worry well pay him back bradford turned his blue eyes toward her questioningly she said were going to find who really killed him whats that rune opened her eyes stared up at the ceiling of her houseboats bedroom watching the ripples of the morning sun reflecting onto the offwhite paint she turned her head squinting whats wrong she felt the boat gently rocking in the hudson water lapping against the hull heard the baritone grind of a boat engine that seemed near but was probably two hundred yards away shed learned how noise carries on the water the sound of rushhour traffic too so what was it what was missing what wasnt here that ought to be the tiedye sheet had tangled around her feet a percale gordian knot her white joy of movement tshirt had ridden up to her neck and her hair was in her face rune was a restless sleeper she untangled her feet and pulled the shirt down she brushed a crescent of pizza crust out of the bed and sat upright well part of it was the silence a special kind of silence the sort that comes from theabsence of a human being rune realized that claire was gone the young woman always had her walkman plugged in by nineam even upstairs in the houseboats bedroom rune usually could hear the raspy chunk of decibels murdering claires ears but today nothing rune went into the whiteenameled head thinking maybe she got up early to go shopping but no none of her stores clothing and cosmetics opened before ten or eleven which meant that maybe shed already moved up to boston which is exactly what happened rune downstairs stood in the middle of the living room and read the note claire had left as she scanned the words she grinned like a kid on christmas eve excellent she thought thank you thank you thank you the note was all about how claire appreciated spelled wrong everything rune had done for her in the past couple of weeks six and a half even though she was a moody bitch a lot but that was good because if she could live with her she could live with anybody rune trying to figure v ho theshes were and not liking the conclusion claire explained that she was going home to her mothers in boston like shed said and how she was going to think about going back to school she spent a long paragraph the last one talking about how happy she was that rune and courtney were such good friends and how theyd gotten along so well because the smile vanished she knew rune would take good care of the girl oh shit rune ran into the small storeroom in the bow of the boat the room that claire and courtney had shared goddamm it the little girl was lying asleep on top of claires futon clutching a mutant stuffed animal that might at one time have been a rabbit son of a bitch claire how could you rune did a fast survey the room was pretty much cleared out claire had taken her clothes and jewelry and whatever other objects had filled the dustfree squares and circles and trapezoids on the top of the dresser everything gone except for courtneys toys and clothes and a poster of the jackson that claire had kept waiting for it to become chic enough to put up again son of a rune ran outside to find the letter again bitch the closing paragraph of the letter said only that she hoped to be back to pick up courtney sometime and to give her the home she needed and deserved sometime rune was sweating she actually felt her scalp prickle her fingers left stains on the paper no address no phone number she didnt even remember claires real last name the girl kept trying on stage names for the day when she became a professional model rune went back to the room and searched carefully the only clue she found was a bra under the bed with initials penned on the side cs but rune thought it looked a little small for claire and remembered that one of her boyfriends had been a transvestite hopeless rune sat down in the middle of the room and picked up a toy a wooden penguin on a stick his broad plastic feet were on wheels she ran him back and forth the webbed feet slapping on the wooden deck i dont want to be a mother claire slap slap slap the jogging penguin woke up courtney rune sat down on the futon kissed the girls cheek honey did you talk to your mommy this morning uhhuh the little girl rubbed her eyes oh theyre so damn cute when they do that come on kid get ugly did she say where she was going uhhuh can i have some juice honey did your mother say where she was going bawden boston i know but where uhhuh juice sure well get some ocean spray in a minute where in boston grandmas house where is your grandmothers house bowden i want some juice honey whats your mothers name mommy the little girl started to squirm no i mean her last name mommy i want some juice rune said did she say anything before she left courtney stood up in bed pulled away from rune zoo the zoo she said youd take me to the zoo thats what your mommy said uhhuh i want juice did she say how long shed be gone courtney frowned for a moment then extended her arms as wide as theyd go she said long long time rune picked up the stuffed rabbit oh shit courtney stuck her lower lip out threateningly and said juice sam healy was in his late thirties over six feet tall and lean his thinning hair was combed straight back and his moustache drooped over the corners of his mouth he resembled a cowboy at least when he was wearing what he now wore a plaid shirt jeans and black boots his profession a detective with the nypd bomb squad they sat in runes houseboat where he spent an occasional night and she leaned forward listening to him as intensely as if he were telling a rookie how to dismantle a c demolition charge she asked how often should i feed her healy said youre too nervous about this rune three times a dayll work fine how about medicine runes palms were glistening with sweat should she be taking medicine well is she sick no then why would she need medicine rune said shes a baby i thought you always gave medicine to babies not if shes not sick rune gazed out over the river oh sam it was fun playing with her and reading to her but this this is like really really serious theyre very resilient oh god what if she falls she asked panicked healy sighed pick her up comfort her dust her off im not ready for this sam i cant be a mother im trying to do my story im oh god does she wear diapers ask her i cant ask her id be embarrassed shes what about three shes probably toilettrained if not you should start pretty soon me no way forget about it rune kids are wonderful when you and adam and i go out we have a great time but hesyour son thats different i dont want one of my own im too young to be a mother my life is over with already its only temporary isnt it thats the part im not too sure about rune looked toward courtneys room her voice was panicky when she said you think she drinks too much juice rune she drinks a lot of juice you should worry a lot less sam i cant have a kid with me when i interview people what am i im going to give you the name of the daycare center cheryl and i used to take adam to its a good place and some of the women there work nights as babysitters yeah look at the bright side you didnt have to go through labor rune sat close to him and laid her head on his chest why do i get myself into things like this shes a sweet little girl rune put her arms around him theyre all sweet when theyre asleep the thing is they wake up after a while he began rubbing her shoulders thats nice yeah he said it is he rubbed for five minutes his strong fingers working down her spine she moaned then he untucked her tshirt and began working his way up under the cloth thats nicer she said and rolled over on her back he kissed her forehead she kissed his mouth feeling the tickle of the moustache it was a sensation shed gotten used to one she liked a lot healy kissed her back his hand still inside her tshirt worked its way up he disarmed bombs he had a very smooth touch rune courtney shouted in a shrill voice they both jumped read me a story rune her hands covered her face jesus sam whatm i going to do the train up to harrison new york left on time and sailed out of the tunnel under park avenue rising up on the elevated tracks like an old airplane slowly gaining altitude runes head swiveled as she watched the redbrick projects clusters of young men on the street no one wore colorful clothing it was all gray and brown a woman pushed a grocery cart filled with rags two men stood over the open hood of a beige sedan hands on their wide hips and seemed to be confirming a terminal diagnosis the train sped north through harlem and the scenes flipped past more quickly rune leaning forward climbing onto her knees felt the lurch as the wheels danced sideways like a bullfighters hips and they crossed the harlem river bridge she waved to passengers on a dayliner tour boat as they looked up at the bridge no one noticed her then they were in the bronx passing plumbing supply houses and lumberyards and in the distance abandoned apartments and warehouses daylight showed through the upperstory windows you wake up in the morning and you think rune tried to doze but she kept seeing the tape of boggs face broken into scan lines and each scan line a thousand pixels of red blue and green dots hell im still here the way their eyes looked at her was weird shed figured the prisoners would lay lot of crap on her catcalls or whoops or yo honey or long slimy stares but nope they looked at her the way assembly line workers would glance at a plant visitor someone walking timidly between tall machines careful not to get grease on her good shoes they looked they ignored they went back to mopping floors or talking to buddies and visitors or not doing much of anything the wardens office had checked her press credentials and guards had searched her bag and the camera case she was then escorted into the visitors area by a tall guard a handsome black man with a moustache that looked like it was drawn above his lip in mascara visitors and inmates at the state prison in harrison were separated by thick glass partitions and talked to each other on old heavy black telephones rune stood for a moment watching them all picturing what it would be like to visit a husband in prison so sad only talking to him holding the thick receiver reaching out and touching the glass never feeling the weight or warmth of his skin in here miss the guard led her into a small room she guessed it was reserved for private meetings between lawyers and their prisoners the guard disappeared rune sat at a gray table she studied the battered bars on the window and decided that this particular metal seemed stronger than anything shed ever seen she was looking out the greasy glass when randy boggs entered the room he was thinner than shed expected he looked best straight on when he turned his head to glance at a guard his head became birdish like a woodpeckers his hair was longer than in the tape shed studied and the dairy queen twist was gone it still glistened from the oil or cream he used to keep it in place his ears were long and narrow and he had tufts of blond wiry hair growing out of them she observed dark eyes darkened by an overhang of bone and thick eyebrows that reached toward each other his skin wasnt good in his face were patches of wrinkles like cities in satellite photos but rune thought it was a temporary unhealthiness the kind that good food and sun and sleep can erase boggs looked at the guard and said could you leave us the man answered no rune said to the guard i dont mind no sure boggs said as cheerful as if hed been picked for first baseman in a softball game he sat down and said what for dyou want to see me miss as she told him about receiving his letter and about the story she grew agitated it wasnt the surroundings it was boggs himself the intensity of his calmness which didnt really make sense but she thought about it and decided that was what she sensed he was so peaceful that she felt her own pulse rising her breath coming quickly as if her body were behaving this natural way because his couldnt still she ignored her own feelings and got to work rune had interviewed people before shed put the camera in front of them washed them in the hot light from redhead lamps and then asked them a hundred questions shed gotten tonguetied some and maybe asked the wrong questions but her talent was in getting people to open up boggs though took a lot of work even though hed written the letter to the station he was uneasy around reporters dont think im not grateful he spoke in a soft voice a slight southern accent licked at his words but im well i dont mean this personal directed at you miss but youre the people convicted me how well miss you know the expression media circus id never heard that before but when i read about my trial afterwards i found out what they mean i wasnt the only person who felt that way somebody who got interviewed intime said thats what my trial was i wrote a letter to mr megler and to the judge saying that i thought it was a media circus neither of them wrote back what was a circus about it he smiled and looked off as if he was arranging his thoughts the way i see it there was so many of you reporters all over the place writing things about me that the jury got it into their head that i was guilty but dont they there was a word she was looking for you know dont they keep the jury in hotel rooms away from papers and tv sequester boggs said you think that works i was onlive at five the day i was arrested and probably every other day up till the trial you think there was one person in the area that didnt know about me i doubt it very much rune had told him she worked forcurrent events but there was no visible reaction either he didnt watch the program or he didnt know that it was on the network the employer of the man hed supposedly killed or maybe he just wasnt impressed he glanced at the betacam sitting on the table beside rune had a film crew in the other day were shooting some kind of cop movie everybody was real excited about it they used some of the boys as extras i didnt get picked they wanted people looked like convicts i guess i looked more like a clerk i guess or what would you say i look like a man who got wrongly convicted boggs smiled an interstate cloverleaf into his face you got some good lines i like that yeah thats a role ive been acting for a long time nobodys bought it yet i want to get you released well miss seems like weve got a lot in common he was definitely warming up to her i talked to fred megler boggs nodded and his face showed disappointment but not anger or contempt if i had money to hire me a real lawyer like those inside traders and you know those coke kingfishers you see on tv i think things mightve been different fred isnt a bad man i just dont believe his heart was in my case i reckon id say he shouldve listened to some of my advice ive had a little experience with the law not a lot of which im proud of but the fact remains ive seen the inside of a courtroom several occasions he shouldve listened to me rune said he told me your story but i knew you were innocent when i saw you when would thatve been on film an interview the smile was now wistful he kept evading her eyes which bothered her she believed this was shyness not guile but she didnt want shifty eyes on tape boggs was saying i appreciate your opinion miss but if thats all you have to go on im still feeling like a sixounce bluegill on a twentypound line look at me and tell me did you do it or not his eyes were no longer evasive they locked onto hers and answered as clearly as his words i did not kill lance hopper thats enough for me and boggs wasnt smiling when he said trouble is it dont seem to be enough for the people of the state of new york two hours later randy boggs got to thats when i decided to hitch to new york and that was the biggest mistake of my life you were tired of maine the lobster business didnt work out like id hoped my partner see im not much for figures he kept the books and all this cash coming in didnt no way equal the cash going out i suspicioned he kept the numbers pretty obscured and when he sold the business he told me he was letting it go to a couple creditors but i think he got paid good money anyways i had me maybe two three hundred bucks was all and two new pair of jeans some shirts i figured id be leaving that part of the country before another winter come snow belongs in movies and in paper cones with syrup on it so i begun thumbing south rides were scarces hens teeth but finally i got me some rides and ended up in purchase new york if that isnt a name i dont know what is he grinned purchase it was raining and i had my thumb out so long it was looking like a bleached prune nobody stopped except this one fellow he pulled over in a we call them a chinese tenement car big old chevy twelve or so years old you know could ride a family of ten he said hop in and i did biggest mistake of my life miss ill tell you that jimmy right but then i told him my name was dave i just had a feeling this wasnt a person i wanted to open up with a real lot what happened after you got in we drove south toward the city making small talk bout women mostly the way men do telling how you get put down by women all the time and how you dont understand them but what youre really doing is bragging that youve had a ton of em that sort of thing where was jimmy going further south he said he was only going so far as new york city but i was thankful i was getting a ride at all i figured i could buy a greyhound ticket to get me on my way to atlanta in fact i was thinking just that very thing when he looks over at me in the car and says hey son howd you like to earn yourself a hundred bucks and i said id like that pretty well particularly if its legal but even if not id still like it pretty well he said it wasntreal illegal just picking up something and dropping it off i told him right away ive got a problem if thatd be drugs you were talking about he said it was credit cards and since ive done a little with them in the past i said that wasnt so bad but could he maybe consider two hundred he said hed more than consider it and said if i drove hed make it two hundred fifty and i agreed was what i did we drive to this place somewhere i didnt know new york but at the trial i found out it was on the upper west side we stopped and he got out and i scooted over behind the wheel jimmy or whatever his name was walked into this courtyard rune asked what did he look like well i wasnt too sure i oughta be wearing glasses but id lost them overboard in maine and couldnt afford to get new ones he was a big fellow though he sat big the way a bear would sit a moustache i remember it was all in profile the look i got white yesm describe his clothing he wore blue jeans with cuffs turned up engineer boots what are those short buckled boots you know black and a navy watch coat werent you a little nervous about this credit card thing boggs paused for a minute ill tell you miss thereve been times in my life not a lot but a few when two hundred fifty dollars hasnt been a lot of money but had then it was just like it would be now and when somebody is going to give you a lot of money youd be surprised what stops becoming funny or suspicious anyway i sat for about ten minutes in the car i had me a cigarette or two i was real hungry and was looking around for a burger king thats what i really wanted one of those whoppers there i am feeling hungry and i hear this shot ive fired me enough pistols in my life to know a gunshot they dont boom like in the movies theres this crack i know gunshots rune said yeah you shoot been shot at matter of fact she told him this wasnt ego it was to let him know more about her make him trust her more boggs glanced at her decided she wasnt kidding and nodded slowly he continued i walk carefully into the courtyard theres a man lying on the ground i thought it was jimmy i run up to him and see itsnot jimmy and i lean down and say mister you okay and of course he isnt i see hes dead i stand up fast and i just panic and run boggs smiled with a shallow twist of his lips and what happens the story of my life i run into a police car cruising by outside i mean i really run right into it bang i fall over and they pick me up and collar me and thats it what about jimmy i glanced around and seen the car but jimmy wasnt inside he was gone did you see any gun no maam i heard they found it in the bushes there wasnt any of my prints on it but i was wearing gloves the da made a big deal out of it that i was wearing gloves in april but i got me small hands he held one up i dont have a lot of meat on me it was real cold you think jimmy shot mr hopper i pondered that a lot but i dont see why he would have he didnt have any gun that i saw and if it was just a credit card scam mr hopper wouldntve been in on that credit cardsre small potatoes i think jimmy had the cards on him and just panicked when he heard the shot then he just took off but you told the cops about jimmy well not the credit card part it didnt seem that was too smart so i kept mum on that but sure i told them about jimmy not one of them to a man believed me not even your own lawyer rune thought assuming jimmy didnt shoot hopper you think he mightveseen the killer couldve there isnt a lot to go on what youve told me i understand that he sighed i was just biding my time waiting for parole but therere people here i got on the bad side of somehow im really worried theyre going to move on me again move on you kill me you know they triedence i dont know why but thats life here in prison dont need to be a reason rune asked how bad do you want to get out boggs glanced at the camera rune stood up and looked through the viewfinder to frame him better what she saw troubled her because she wasnt looking at animal eyes or criminals eyes which would have been scary but expected she saw gentleness and pain and even harder to bear a portion of him that was still a lonely frightened young boy he said ill answer that by telling you what its like in here its like your heart is tied round and round with clothesline its like every day is waking up the morning after a funeral its like you welcome fear because when youre afraid you cant think about being free its a sadness so bad you want to howl when you see a plane flying by going to a place you can imagine but cant ever get to no matter how close it might be randy boggs stopped and cleared his throat do what you can for me miss please rune gave motherhood her best shot she really did courtney was probably threefourths toilettrained the remaining quarter was tough to cope with but rune managed as best she could she bought healthy food for the girl she bathed her twice a day she also leapt right in to improve the little girls wardrobe claire who had supercrucial taste in her own fashion had bought the poor kid mostly sweats blouses with bears or disney cartoon characters on them and corduroy jeans corduroy in new york rune took her straight down to soho to a kids store where rune knew one of the salesclerks she dropped some bucks on real clothes a black naugahyde miniskirt and a couple of black tshirts yellow and limegreen tights a wad of lacy tooling for her hair jewelry was risky you never knew what kids would swallow but rune found an outrageous studded belt and black cowboy boots which were slightly too big but she figured there was only one way the girls feet were going to grow and why not buy something that would last more than a month the finishing touch was a plastic leopardskin jacket rune paid the two hundred twentyseven dollars but decided the results were worth it she said all right dude youre looking crazy good crazy courtney said but it wasnt long before problems developed theyd left the store bought some ice cream and gone windowshopping then rune wondered if you could take threeyearolds dancing there was a super latenight club just opening up down on hudson in the old building where the famous area had been years before a totally historical place she hadnt seen too many children there none in fact but she wondered if you could sneak one in early say just after work about six or seven it seemed a shame to have a kid who looked like a miniature madonna and not expose her to some real new york life you want to go dancing i want to go to the zoo the girl said fiercely well the zoos closed now honey we can go in a day or so i wanta see the animals in a day or two no courtney started to scream and ran into comme de garcon where she threw the ice cream into a rack of eighthundreddollar suits the daycare center didnt work out either rune did the math and figured out that if she dropped courtney off at eight and picked her up at seven the hours piper sutton suggested her crew work at a minimum and then got a night sitter twice a week she would have one hundred and eight dollars a month left out of her paycheck so the little girl spent a half the week at day care half at the network and when piper sutton called rune one night at what was for the rest of the world quitting time and demanded an update on the boggs story now rune now now now rune had to park the little girl with bradford simpson who took up the task sportingly even though she could tell by the furtive phone call he made that he was breaking a date to help her out it was clear that shed soon run out of friends if she tried to enlist lastminute baby sitters very often but what finally did it was the honey rune had spent all thursday taking footage of the exteriors of the building where lance hopper had been killed and of the crime scene itself shed picked up courtney just before the daycare center closed and had to spring for a cab to get fifty pounds of equipment and thirty pounds of child back to the houseboat rune plopped her in front of the old motorola console tv cued upthe wizard of oz and took a shower courtney who didnt like the blackandwhite kansas portion of the film wandered off to find something to play with what she located was a jar of clover honey sitting on the galley table she climbed up on a chair and pulled it down carefully then sat on the floor and opened it courtney loved honey not so much because of the taste but because of the great way it poured so slowly down the stairs which was a lot of fun but what was even better was the way she could use it to paste together runes videotape cassettes she made a wall out of them and pretended it was the wicked witchs castle then the water in the shower shut off and it occurred to courtney that playing with the honey might be one of those things she shouldnt be doing so she hid the rest of the evidence pouring it into the ikegami video camera case courtney closed the door then slipped the empty jar under the coffee table at that point dorothy arrived in fullcolor oz and the little girl settled down to watch the film rune surprised herself by actually screaming when she saw the camera she was trying to shout that the camera had cost fifty thousand dollars but the words werent even getting out of her mouth courtney looked down at the camera bleeding honey and started to cry rune then dropped to her knees and surveyed the ruined tapes she cradled the camera like a hurt pet oh god oh no ohoh courtney said i cant take it rune gasped only two phone calls she was surprised to find that when it came to children you could cut through city bureaucracy pretty fast the administrator she was speaking to told her that a protective diagnostic caseworker could be on her way in half hour rune said not to bother shed come totheir offices tomorrow the woman gave rune the address the next morning she packed up the girls few possessions and they walked to the subway after transferring three times they got off at the bleecker street stop and climbed to the sidewalk wherere we going courtney asked to see some nice people oh where at the zoo im sure theyll take you to the zoo good the building looked like one of those massive grimy factories in ten shades of gray a set from a s movie about a tough slickhaired industrialist who learns that life with floozy blondes and martinis can be pretty unsatisfying but when rune considered it again she decided that the building on laguardia place looked more like a prison she almost turned around but then she freeassociated prison randy boggs and she realized that she had a responsibility to do her story and save him and that having courtney in her life was going to make that impossible she shifted the girls fingers still slightly sticky from the honey into her left hand and led her toward the squat dark building rune glanced at the graniteslab above the front door to the building which would have been a good place to carve the words abandon hope all ye who enter instead of new york child welfare administration rune and courtney walked slowly toward the main office through green corridors over green linoleum through fluorescent light that started life white but turned green when it hit the skin it reminded her of the shade of lawyer megler s office a guard pointed to a thin black woman in a red linen suit sitting behind a desk covered with recycled files and empty cardboard coffee cups may i help you the woman asked youre ms johnson the woman smiled and they shook hands sit down youre rune right you called last night paper appeared and civil servant johnson uncapped a bic pen whats your address west village johnson paused could you be more specific than that not really its hard to explain phone number rune said no beg pardon i dont have a phone oh so far she hadnt written anything is this courtney thats right were going to the zoo the little girl said what it is is this i have a roommate i mean had a roommate her mother and i dont know her last name and she left me with courtney she just took off can you believe it i mean i woke up and she was gone johnson was frowning painfully more mom than civil servant for the moment anyway she went to boston and what she did she runes voice fell ditched you know who and im like what am i going to do see i wouldnt mind if i wasnt working which is usually what im doing not working i mean only now i johnson had stopped writing apparent abandonment happens more often than youd think courtney said rune im hungry rune dug into her shoulder bag and pulled out a can of sardines johnson watched her a can opener appeared and rune began cranking i liked it better when they had that little key on them courtney watched the process hungrily rune looked at a bewildered ms johnson you know the key on the cans like in the cartoons you always see cartoons johnson asked then you think those are good for her waterpacked i wouldnt give her oil she held up the can rune tucked a napkin into courtneys collar then handed her a plastic fork anyway her mothers gone and i dont know how to find her you dont have any idea no last name nope just know shes in boston bawden johnson said usually what happens in cases like these is the police get involved theyll contact the boston police and do a standard missing person search first name claire right i just dont have any leads claire took everything with her except this toodisgusting old poster and some underwear you could fingerprint it maybe but they probably wouldnt beher fingerprints on it whos courtneys father rune frowned and shook her head johnson asked unknown highly describe her mother to me claires about my height her hairs dark now but were talking it started life pretty light kind of dirty brownish rune thought for a minute shes got a narrow face she isnt pretty id say more cute im really more interested in a general description thatll help the police locate her okay sure fivethree jetblack hair about a hundred and ten wears black mostly grandparents or other relations i cant even find her mother howm i going to know the aunts and uncles johnson said shes really adorable does she have any health problems is there any medicine she takes no shes pretty healthy all she takes is vitamins in the shape of animals she likes the bears best but i think thats only because theyre cherryflavored you like bears dont you honey courtney had finished the sardines she nodded okay well let me tell you a little about the procedure from here on out thiss the child welfare administration which is part of the citys human resources administration weve got a network of emergency foster homes where shell be placed for a week or so until we can get her into a permanent foster home hopefully by then well have found the mother runes stomach thudded foster home thats right uhm you know what you hear on the news about the foster homes johnson asked its the press that made up most of those stories her voice was crisp and rune had a flash of a different ms johnson beneath the ruby lipstick and pseudo ann taylor did not beat a delicate heart she probably had a tattoo of a gangs trademark on the slope of her left breast the woman continued we spend weeks investigating foster parents if you think about it who scrutinizes natural parents good point rune thought can i visit her the answer was no rune could see that but johnson said probably what happens now we have a diagnostic caseworker on call shell take courtney to the emergency home tonight i dont have to do anything else that will be the end of your involvement rune hated civilservant language as if they took the words and quickfroze them she turned to courtney and said will you miss me the girl said no no johnson said to her honey would you like to go stay with a nice mommy and daddy they have some children just like you and theyd love for you to visit yeah rune said to her youll be happy there why isnt she sobbing johnson said ill take her now you have her things rune handed over the bag containing the ratty stuffed animals and her new clothes johnson looked at runes face and said i know how you feel but believe me you did the right thing there wasnt any choice rune squatted down and hugged the girl ill come visit you it was then that courtney sized up what was happening rune she asked uncertainly johnson took her by the hand and led her down the corridor courtney started to cry rune started to cry johnson remained dryeyed come on honey courtney looked back once and called zoo well go to the zoo i promise rune left the ugly slab of a building feeling an intense freedom and feeling too the weight of a guilt that matched her own pounds ounce for ounce but that was okay she had a story to do spring in prison is like spring in the city weak almost unnoticeable you only sense it because of the air you smell it you taste it you feel an extra portion of warmth it flirts with you once or twice then thats it back to work or back to the prison yard crocuses cant break through concrete randy boggs was waiting for severn washington in the prison gym when the smell of spring hit him and damn it made him feel bad hed never been to college school for him meant high school and this battered prison gym reminded him a lot of the one at washington irving high where twenty years earlier hed have been working out on the parallel bars or struggling to do an iron cross on the rings and bang there would be that smell in the air that meant theyd soon be out of school and hed have a summer ahead of him along with a couple of weeks pure freedom before the job at the kresge warehouse or damn what a smell spring has he thought about a dozen memories released by that smell girls small boobs and hot grass and the chainsaw rumble of a chevy engine and beer man he loved beer now as much as then though he knew there was no taste like the taste of beer when you were a teenager randy boggs squinted across the gym and could see the loping figure of severn washington two hundred thirty pounds worth a broad face in between a scalp of tight cornrows and a neck thick as boggss thigh washington had laughed and told boggs not long after they met that hed never had a white friend in all of his fortythree years hed missed nam because of his eyesight and always stayed pretty close to home which in his familys case had been a hundred and thirtyseventh street where there were not many whites at all let alone any that hed befriend thats why washington had been uncomfortable when one day in the yard boggs began talking to him just bullshitting in that soft shy voice he had at first washington later told him he thought boggs wanted to be his maytag his loverboy then washington had decided boggs was just another whiteass crazy maybe method or angeldusted out but when boggs kept it up talking away funny making more sense than most people inside washington and boggs became friends boggs told him that hed been through raleigh and durham a bunch of times and learned that washington s family had come from north carolina though hed never been there washington wanted to hear all about the state and boggs was glad to tell him from there they talked about sylvias harlem dizzy gillespie dexter gordon eddie murphy denzel washington no relation class d felonies beer traveling around hitchhiking but there was another foundation for the friendship between the two one day washington had sought boggs out in the yard and said know why you come up and talked to me nope severn i sure dont why was that allah whats that again boggs asked the huge man explained that allah had come to washington in a dream and told him it was his job to befriend boggs and eventually convert him he told all this to boggs who felt himself blushing and said damn if thats not the craziest thing i ever heard no man thats the way it is your asss safe me and allah gonna watch out for you which boggs thought was even crazier the allah part at least but perfectly fine with him from the start though washington s job wasnt easy boggs was animal feed in harrison prison scrawny shy quiet a loner he didnt deal he didnt fuck he didnt side instantly unpopular the sort that ends up accidentally dead like not paying attention and driving a inch drill press bit through his neck then bleeding to death before somebody notices the blood or the sort that does it himself they may take your belt away from you but if you want to get dead in prison you can get yourself dead no problem but severn washington did his job and when it became clear that boggs was under the wing of one of the most devout muslims in all of harrison who also happened to be one of the largest when that news made the rounds of the cell blocks randy boggs was left pretty much alone pretty much however didnt mean completely washington disposing of the fast muslim greeting marhaba sardeek now frowned as he whispered yo man you got trouble what boggs asked feeling his heart sink word up they gonna move on you again serious this time i axed a moneygrip o mine from the home block and he say he heard it for fucking certain randy boggs frowned why man thats what i dont get you hear anything washington shrugged make no sense to me okay boggss face twisted a little shit im putting out some inquiries washington said emphasizing the second syllable of the word well find ourselves out what the fucks going on boggs considered this he didnt go out of his way to look for trouble he didnt give steely killer eyes to blacks he didnt eye anybodys dick in the shower he didnt get cartons of marlboros from the guards didnt look sideways at the aryan brotherhood there was no reason he could think of that somebodyd want to move on him i dont know what i did i dont think hey be cool man washington grinned hey you walk in what twentyfour months shouldnt be too hard to keep yo ass intact that long this place man i hate it so much severn washington laughed the way he always did when somebody expressed the obvious got the antidote less play us some ball and randy boggs said sure thinking as he saw his reflection in a chickenwirelaced window that what he was looking at with the redsocketed eyes wasnt his living body at all but something else something horrible lying cold and dead as his blood fled from the flesh thinking that despite this huge mans reassurance the only hope he now had was that slip of girl with the ponytail and the big camera this city was a playground you never got tired of once you took the element of fear out of it and there wasnt anything jack nestor feared new york was the biggest playground in the world he felt the excitement the instant he stepped out of the port authority bus terminal the feeling of electricity and for a moment he thought what was he doing wasting his time in pissant florida he smelled fishy river charcoal smoke from pretzel vendors shit exhaust then he got a whiff of some gross incense three black guys dressed up like arabs were selling from a folding table hed never seen this before he walked up to them there were pictures of men from ancient times it looked like dressed the same the twelve true tribes of israel only they were all black black rabbis what a crazy town this was neslor walked along fortysecond street stopped in a couple peep shows he left and wandered some more looking at the old movie theaters the play theaters the angry drivers the suicidal pedestrians horns blared like mad as if everybody driving a car had a wife in labor in the backseat already the energy was exhausting him but he knew hed be up to speed in a day or two he stopped and bought a hot dog and ate it in three bites at the next street corner he bought another one this time he asked for onions too on the third counter he bought two more hot dogs without onions and stood eating them and drinking a sprite which wasnt a sprite at all which hed asked for but some brand of lemonlime soda hed never heard of it tasted like medicine as the vendor split a sausage to fill with sauerkraut nestor asked him where there was a hotel in the area the man shrugged donoe huh donoe thats a hotel i donoe why dont you try learning fucking english nestor walked off two blocks later he saw a sign kings court hotel which was the same name as a motel hed been to in miami beach once and which wasnt a bad place he remembered it being clean and cheap it must have been a chain nestor walked up to the door which opened suddenly he hadnt noticed a tall young man dressed in black standing inside the man said hello sir take your bag the miami branch didnt nestor recalled have a doorman just wanted to ask the desk guy a question she wasnt a guy but a young blonde woman with a french accent and teeth that were absolutely perfect she smiled at him yessir uh he looked around him bizarre it looked like a warehouse with a low ceiling stone and metal furniture everywhere and a lot of the furniture was wrapped up in white cloth uh i was wondering you have a room certainly sir how long will you be staying uhhow much would that be for a single a computer was consulted four hundred forty for aweek are these people fucking insane the question now was how to get out of here without the blonde with the rulerstraight teeth thinking he was a complete asshole i mean by the night a moments pause actually thatis the daily rate sir sure i was joking nestor grinned saw no way to salvage the situation and simply walked out only one block away he found the royalton arms which he knew was okay because there were a couple of dirtylooking tourists standing out in front looking at a michelin guide to new york city the desk clerk here didnt even have straight teeth let alone white ones and he was behind a plexiglas bulletproof divider nestor checked into a room and took the elevator up to the seventh floor the room was okay he felt good as soon as he walked inside it didnt overlook any oceans or expressways or anything else except an air shaft but that didnt bother nestor he lowered the window blinds then lay down on the bed and listened to the argument his stomach was having with the hot dogs he clicked on the tv and watched somemiami vice rerun for a while flipped through the channels once then shut off the set it was irritating not to have a remote control he stripped down to his boxer shorts and sleeveless tshirt brushed his teeth powerfully and got into bed he closed his eyes snap the pictures began nestor often had trouble sleeping hed thought a long time ago it was something physical well hoped more thanthought but he knew now that wasnt the case at all the reason for his insomnia was the pictures the minute his head hit the pillow unless there was someone next to him distracting him or at least promising distraction the minute he was prepared to sleep the pictures began he supposed he could call them memories because they really were nothing more than scenes from his past but memories were different memories were like the impressions he had of his family or his childhood his first car his first fuck maybe they were accurate probably not but the pictures man every detail perfect a philippine revolutionary he picked off at three hundred yards using an m with metal sights the man just dropping like a sack a black south african who thought he was safely across the border in botswana a coat hanger binding the hands of a salvadorian nestor thinking why bother to tie him up hell have a bullet in his head in sixty seconds anyway hundreds of others they were in black and white they were in color they were mute they were in dolby stereo sound the pictures they didnt haunt him of course he didnt have any emotional response he wasnt tormented by guilt he wasnt moved to lust they just wouldnt go away the pictures came into his head and they wouldnt let him sleep tonight nestor energized by the city and troubled by its fast food lay in a toosoft bed and fielded the pictures pushed one away then he did the same with the one that took its place then the next for an hour then two he wanted celine next to him he thought about her but the pictures pushedher away he thought about what he was in town to do that kept the pictures away for a while but they came back finally it was close to threeam he began to think about the french girl the one with the straight teeth with the thought of her and a little bit of effort on his part elbow grease was the way he thought of it jack nestor finally began to relax it was enough of a date to keep bradford simpson happy and not enough of one to worry rune they were at an outdoor table at a mexican restaurant near the west side highway the table filled with red cans of tecate beer and chips and salsa and a ton of material about lance hopper and randy boggs hehad wanted to ask her out again as it happened but rune was content to keep the evening mostly professional bradford scooted his chair closer to hers and rune endured a little knee contact while they read through the hopper files wheres courtney brad asked lets not go there rune said sure shes okay yes no probably not shes fine shes really cute lets notgo there she thought and turned back to the files on lance hopper that bradford had found in the archives as they read she began to form a clearer picture of the late head of network news hopper was a difficult man demanding that everyone at the network work as hard as he did and not let their personal lives interfere with the job he was also greedy and jealous and petty and wildly ambitious and several times when his contract was up virtually extorted the parent company for stock options that increased his worth by hundreds of millions of dollars yet he was also a man with a heart for instance spending as much time with the interns as he did as bradford had mentioned he advocated educational programming for youngsters on the network even though shows like that produced far less revenue than afterschool cartoons and adventure shows hopper regularly appeared in washington before the fcc and congressional committees testifying about the importance of unfettered media he was often vilified by conservative familyoriented groups who thought there should be more censorship in the media hopper also took responsibility for the worst black eye in the history of the network three years ago just before his death the network had run an awardwinning story as part of the coverage of a un peacekeeping mission in lebanon the story was an exclusive about a village outside of beirut that appeared to be liberalminded and prowestern but was in fact a stronghold for fundamentalist militants but when a un force made a sweep of the village to look for suspected terrorists they were so prepared to meet resistance that the operation turned into a bloodbath after a solitary sniper fired one shot near the convoy a chain reaction of shooting followed there were twentyeight deaths all by friendly fire including some soldiers the sniper was a tenyearold boy shooting at rocks the militants it seemed had left a week before some blamed the un for relying on a news story for its intelligence but most people thought it was the networks fault for doing the story in the first place or for not at least following up and reporting that the terrorists were no longer there hopper took responsibility for the incident and personally went to beirut to attend the funerals of the slain villagers bradford and rune continued to pore over the files and though a portrait of hopper as a complex ambitious and ruthless man appeared no evident motive for his death emerged from there they turned to the transcripts of interviews rune had made over the past week as shed traveled around the east coast and the south talking to people who knew randy boggs yeah randy boggs worked for me for close to two years he come in and was looking for a job good boy dependable he wasnt no killer he pushed a broom with the best of them im sure it was the sixties we had the negro problem then course we still have the negro problem bout that id like to say a few words seeing how you have a camera next randy boggs yeah i knew the boggs family boys i dont remember father was a mean motherfucker man the next randy yeah we had this lobster business but you got the camera rolling okay let me tell you this story the wife and i were one time over to portland and we were driving in the chevy we always buy american cars even if they re a pile of you know what so we were driving along and there were these three lights in the sky and we knew they werent planes because they were so bright then one of them next rune yawned violently you okay bradford asked moreorless she opened another file her life had become an endless circle of long hours by herself of flying on airplanes and staying in hotels that somebody else paid for of tense meetings at the network of interviews that sometimes careened out of control and sometimes worked of a lonely houseboat of a chaotic editing room one morning she woke up to find that shed fallen asleep with the betacam next to her which wasnt so scary as the fact that shed slept with her arm around it all night she gave up latenight clubs she gave up west village writers bars even gave up seeing sam healy much piper sutton would occasionally swoop by runes cubicle for a status report like an eagle grabbing a squirming trout in its talons as she and bradford pored over all this material now amid the raucous laughter and boasting and flirting of dozens of young lawyers and businesspeople drunk on tequila and the thrill of life in manhattan rune felt both more and more incensed that such a vital and important man as lance hopper had been killed and more and more certain that randy boggs hadnt done it come on sam please shed tried charm and now she was trying pleading but sam healy was a detective who disposed of bombs for a living it was tough to talk someone like that into anything he didnt want to do they were sitting on the back deck of the boathouse drinking beers and eating microwave popcorn i just want to look at it one little file i cant get access to the files in the twentieth precinct im bomb squad why would they even talk to me rune had spent a lot of time trying to decide if she was in love with this man she thought she was in a way but today wasnt like the old days whenever they were when you were either in love or you werent love was a lot more complicated now there were degrees there werephases of love it kicked in and out like a compressor in an air conditioner she and healy could talk easily and laugh she liked the way he looked like a man in a marlboro ad she liked the way his eyes were completely calm and deeper than any mans eyes shed ever seen but what she missed was that guttwist that weightlosing obsession with the object of your desire that was runes favorite kind of love even though it was totally rare also healy was married which oddly didnt bother rune that much at least he was separated and had no problem being bluntly honest about the times he saw cheryl rune looked at his marriage like an air bag in a car a safety feature maybe when she got older if they were still together shed force him to make a decision but for now his marriage was his business all she wanted was honesty and a boyfriend who kept you guessing and no boyfriend kept you guessing like one on the new york city bomb squad rune said they got the wrong man i know your theory about boggs i dont need to prowl around the evidence room i just want to read one file i thought you wanted to be a reporter iam a reporter reporters dont cheat itd be unethical to use me to get information of course it wouldnt you know about unnamed sources come on you can be my deep throat its a murder investigation id get suspended for leaking information its a murderconviction its a closed case the transcript is public record why dont you ive got the transcript i need the police report its got the names of all the witnesses and the bullet angles and pictures of the exit wounds all the good stuff come on sam she kissed his neck theres nothing i can do sorry the mans innocent hes serving time for something he didnt do thats terrible you can talk to the public information officer theyll give you the departments side of the case bullshit is all hell tell me shehealy said not he he stood up and walked into the galley you have anything substantial well first everybody ive interviewed said that no way in the world could randy boggs kill anyone then i mean to eat oh she squinted into the galley no dont mope im not she said quickly i just dont have anything substantial sorry maybe some fruit n fiber cereal rune a banana its pretty old i cant get the report im sorry a can of tuna thats a pretty icky combination though if you mix it with the cereal even with the high fiber healy wasnt buying it no file give it up he walked back with pretzels and cottage cheese so wheres your little girl she was hesitating i took her to social services oh he was looking at her his face blank not saying anything eating the cottage cheese he offered her a forkful she wasnt interested in she said defensively they were a really really good bunch of people there they were you know real professional uhhuh what theyll do is keep her in a foster home for a while then theyll track down her mother she was avoiding his eyes looking everywhere else studying his buttons the stitching of his shirt seams the trapezoid of floor between his shoes well it was a good idea wasnt it i dont know was it i had to when i was a portable walking a beat we found kids sometimes theres any suspicion of neglect or abuse you have to bring them in or get a caseworker out to see them rune said those people are okay arent they i guess so she stood up and paced slowly what was i supposed to do i cant take care of a baby im not saying healy began yes you are youre saying i guess so i dont know you did what you thought was right clench loosen her short unpolished nails dug into her palm then relaxed you make it sound like i gave her away to the gypsies im just a little surprised is all what am i going to do keep her with me all the time it cost five hundred dollars to fix the camera because of her i had to reshoot eight hours of film i cant afford a babysitter rune volume and indignation rose you make it sound like i abandoned her im not her mother i dont even want her healy smiled dont be so paranoid about it im sure theyll take fine care of her have some cottage cheese whats in here rune looked apple pear wait i think its a zucchini should it be that color she said its only until they find claire healy said just a couple days probably rune stood at the round porthole looking out over the water at the way the lights in hoboken made lines in the waves like runway approach lights with her eyes she traced them to the land and back again she watched them for a few minutes until they were shattered by a passing speedboat when the colors began to regroup she turned to healy and said i did the right thing didnt i sam sure you did he capped the cottage cheese lets go get something to eat piper sutton sensed the power she had over him and it made her uncomfortable because it was purely the power of sex and therefore a power she couldnt exercise or rather wouldntlet herself exercise as she looked at the man across the desk from her she crossed her legs and her creamcolored stockings whispered in a reminder of that power she was sitting in an office exactly two floors above hers the penthouse of the parent companys monolith well have coffee the man said no thank you then i will dan semple was a trim fortyfour compact with short saltandpepper hair curling over his forehead in bangs he was not like piper sutton or lee maisel or his predecessor lance hopper a newsman hed sold advertising time for local stations then for the network and eventually he had moved into entertainment and then news programming the lack of reporting experience was irrelevant semples talent was for money making it and saving it no one in the television business was naive enough to believe that highquality journalism alone was enough to make a network a success and with a few exceptions no one was surprised when semple was given hoppers job as director of network news the similarities were obvious hopper had been a great newsman in the incarnation of a son of a bitch dan semple was a great businessman in the body of a cruel megalomaniac although one thing he wasnt the least bit cold about was piper sutton she had had affairs with various network executives in the past only those men however who were on a corporate level equal to hers and only those men whom she desired physically or because she truly enjoyed their company sutton didnt give a shit about rumors and gossip but one of her few rules of ethics was that she wouldnt use her body to advance her career there were plenty of other ways to fuck those you worked for the affair with semple had lasted one year when they were both on the ascendancy in the network but that had been four years ago then came hoppers death one consequence of which was what sutton had predicted would happen semple was named hoppers replacement the day after the board announced the appointment she walked into his office to say how happy she was for him and how shed known how much hed wanted the job sutton had then taken semples hand kissed his cheek and ended the affair since then sempled waged an almost adolescent campaign to win her back although they saw each other often and dined together and attended benefits and formal functions shed decided that their intimate days were over he didnt believe her when she said it was a hard decision for her as well though it was she was attracted to him physically and she was attracted to him for his strength and brilliance and decisiveness sutton had settled for weak men in the past and had learned her lesson she had a number of exes to prove it this romantic tension was an undercurrent in every conversation she and semple had it troubled her that although semple respected her immensely for her ability hedesired her only on the lowest level the power she had over him was the power of a courtier not a reigning queen and that infuriated her at the same time her continual refusal to resume the affair stung him how was paris she asked comme ci comme fa how is it always the same paris never changes the coffee arrived the executive vice presidents had their own dining room which delivered their requests for food or beverages on villeroy amp bosch china carried on parentcompanylogoed lacquer trays semple poured a cup and sipped it tell me about this story sutton did quickly without emotion her name is rune first or last some kind of stage name bullshit she a cameraman with the o ampo here in manhattan what does lee think semple asked slightly more in favor of doing the story than i am but not much why are we doing it then he asked coolly semples dark eyes scanned suttons blouse she was glad shed worn the wool suit jacket over the white silk but only a part of his eyes was seeing her body what the other part was considering and what was happening in the brain behind those eyes was a complete mystery to her it was one of his most magnetic qualities that she hadnt been able to fathom him it was also one of his more frightening she answered the girl said in effect that if she didnt produce it forcurrent events shed do it independently and sell it elsewhere blackmail he snapped closer to youthful fervor i dont like it semple said theres no point to the story he sipped more coffee sutton remembered that he liked to sit naked in bed in the morning a tray resting on his lap the cup and saucer directly over his penis did he like the warmth she used to wonder he asked what does she have so far anything nope nothing substantial lots of background footage thats all so you think theres a chance itll just go away sutton avoided his eyes shes young im keeping a close eye on her im hoping she gets tired of the whole thing semple had the power to make this story go away forever leaving behind fewer traces than a couple of pixels on a tv monitor he glanced at sutton and said keep me informed on what she finds okay i mean daily semple looked out the window for moment i dined at a wonderful restaurant it was off st germain really i wish youd been there with me it sounds nice michelin was wrong i have to write and urge them to give it another star and he uncapped a fountain pen and wrote a note on his calendar reminding himself to do just that rune was sleepwalking at least thats what it felt like shed been sitting at her desk in the same curvatureofthespine pose for seven hours looking over tapes the close air of the studio was filled with the buzz of a dozen yellow jackets which shed thought was the video monitor in front of her until shed shut it off and realized that the buzzing had continued the sound was originating from somewhere inside her head enough is enough she stood up and stretched a series of pops from her joints momentarily replaced the buzzing she left bradford in charge of logging in the recent tapes shed shot and headed outside rune walked through the complicated maze of corridors and into the spring evening she removed the chrome chain necklace of her id from around her neck and slipped it in her leopardskin bag outside a harried woman employee of the network stood on the sidewalk her husband a young professional walked up to her with their two young children in tow it had apparently been his turn to pick up the kids tonight the mother gave them perfunctory hugs and then started making weekend plans with her husband their daughter a redhead about courtneys age tugged on her mothers norma kamali skirt mommy just aminute the woman said sternly im speaking to your father the little girl looked sullenly off rune gave the kid a smile but she didnt respond the family walked off man im beat she thought but as she walked she felt the cool electricscented city night air waking her up and she saw from the clock on the mony tower that it was early only eightpm early rune remembered when quitting time had been five she continued down broadway past the pastel carnival of lincoln center pausing listening for music but not hearing any then she continued south deciding to walk home a couple miles to get the blood back in her legs thinking of what she needed to do for the story getting her hands on the police report of the hopper case was the number one item then shed have to talk to all the witnesses get megler on tape maybe interview the judge find some jurors she wondered if there was an old priest who knew boggs a spencer tracy sort of guy ah well now sure id be knowing the boy randy and ill tell you he helped out in soup kitchens and took care of his mother and left half his allowance in the collection plate every sunday when he was an altar boy a lot to do she walked through hells kitchen her head swiveled as she went down ninth avenue disappointed the developers were doing a number on the area boxy highrises and slick restaurants and coops what she liked best about the neighborhood was that it had been the home of the gophers one of the toughest of the nineteenthcentury gangs in new york rune had been reading about old gangs lately before she got waylaid by the boggs story shed been planning a documentary on them the featured thugs were going to be the gophers and their sister gang the battle row ladies social and athletic club also known as the lady gophers not a single producer had been very interested in the subject the mafia and colombians and jamaicans with machine guns were still the current superstars of crime according to the media and there wasnt much demand for stories about people like onelung curran and sadie the goat and stumpy malarky her feet were aching by the time she got to her neighborhood she stopped outside the houseboat looked at the dark windows for a moment behind her another family walked past a mother and father and their child a cute boy of about five or six he was asking questions where does the hudson river go what kind of fish are in it and together the mother and father were making up silly answers for the boy all three of them were laughing hard rune felt an urge to join in but she resisted realizing that she was an outsider when they had passed she walked up the gangplank and inside the houseboat she dropped her bag by the door and stood listening her head cocked sideways a car horn a helicopter a backfire all the sounds were distant none of what she heard was coming from inside the houseboat nothing except her own heartbeat and the creak of boards beneath her feet she reached for the lamp but slowly lowered her hand and instead felt her way to the couch and lay down on it staring up at the ceiling at the psychedelic swirls of lights reflecting off the turbulent surface of the hudson she lay that way for a long time an hour later rune was sitting in an overheated subway car as it stammered along the tracks she did an inventory of the tools of the trade in her bag a claw hammer a canister of military tear gas two screwdrivers phillips head and straight masking tape and rubber gloves her other accessories included a large bucket a string mop and a plastic container of windex she was thinking about the law too and wondered if the crime was less if it wasnt breakingand entering if you just entered and didnt break it was the kind of question that sam couldve answered real fast but of course he was the last person in the world she would ask that particular question she imagined though that it was a distinction somebodyd thought of already and just because you didnt jimmy any locks or crack any plate glass the punishment wasnt going to be a hell of a lot less severe maybe the judge would sentence her to one year instead of three or ten instead of twenty the longer term probably it wasnt going to help her case that it was government property she had her eyes on the building was only a few doors from the subway stop she climbed out and paused a cop walked past his walkietalkie sputtering with a hiss she pressed her face against a lamp post which was covered with layers and layers of paint and wondered what color it had been in earlier years maybe some gang members from the gophers or hudson dusters had paused under this very same post a hundred years ago scoping out a job the street was empty and she strolled casually into the old governmentissue building and up to the night guard cover story and faked credentials all prepared in twenty minutes she was out having exchanged the mop and pail for the bulky manila folder that rested in her bag she paused at a phone stand and pretended to make a call while she flipped through the file she found the address she was looking for and walked quickly back to the subway after a tenminute wait she got on board an old number four train heading toward brooklyn rune liked the outer boroughs brooklyn especially she thought of it as caught in a time warp a place where the dodgers were always playing and muscular boys in tshirts sipped egg creams and flirted with tough girls who snapped gum and answered them back in sexy lazy drawls big immigrant families crammed into narrow shotgun tenements argued and made up and laughed and hugged with hearts full of love and loyalty the neighborhood that she now slipped into along with the crowd exiting the subway was quiet and residential she paused getting her bearings she had to walk only three blocks before she found the row house red brick with yellow trim twostory a narrow moat of anemic lawn bursts of red covered the front of the building geraniums sprouting everywhere they escaped from flowerpots from terracotta statues in the shape of donkeys and fat mexican peasants from green plastic window boxes from milk containers they bothered her the flowers someone whod appreciate flowers like this was probably a very nice person this meant rune would feel pretty guilty about what she was about to do which didnt stop her however from walking onto the front porch dropping a paper bag on the concrete stoop and setting fire to it she rang the doorbell and ran into the alley behind the house and listened to the voices oh hell what the boys again thats it this time i call the cops dont call the fire department its just rune raced up the back stairs and through the open kitchen door she saw a man leaping forward fiercely and stomping on the burning bag sparks flying smoke pouring out a chubby woman held a longspouted watering can dousing his feet then rune was past them unnoticed taking the carpeted stairs two at a time upstairs she found herself in a small hallway first room nobody second nobody third chaos six children were staring out the window at the excitement below them squealing and dancing around they all turned to the doorway as rune walked into the room and flipped the light switch on one of them cried rune hi honey she said to courtney the little girl ran toward her a chubby boy of about ten looked at her whatsis jailbreak shh dont tell anybody yeah right like im a snitch got a cigarette rune gave him five dollars forget you saw anything right i know the drill rune said to courtney come on lets go home she pulled the girls jacket off a hook and slipped it on her are we playing a game the little girl asked yeah rune said hustling her out into the corridor its called kidnapping the prison yard was segregated just like the city randy boggs thought hanging out there at nine the next morning just like life blacks one side whites the other except on the basketball halfcourt the blacks were mostly young a lot were dorags or stockings over their hair or they had cornrows they stood together strong big sleek yo homes quit that noise wassup mah crib i ever tell you bout mah crib hells yeah the whites were older crueler humorless they looked bad it was the longer unclean hair the pale skin they too stood together black white just like the city a lot of the men were exercising there were weights here though the hierarchy didnt allow for democratic use among all prisoners still there were always pushups and situps muscles develop in prison but boggs hadnt made a fetish of exercise doing thatd be an acknowledgment of where he was and what he was if he didnt stand in line for the thirtypound dumbbells then maybe he was somewhere else maybe he wassomeone else amazing grace how sweet thou art an a cappella black gospel group was practicing in the yard they were really good boggs when he first heard them wanted to cry now he just listened the group wouldnt be together much longer theyd walk in two months four months and thirteen months respectively i once was lost but now im found the singers started a second verse and someone nearby yelled yo shut the fuck up he smelled fireplace wood smoke he tried not to think of the last time hed sat in front of a fireplace thought about that girl from new york the little girl with the big camera he sat quietly he smoked some though since hed been in hed lost his taste for smoking hed lost his taste for a lot of things he sat for five minutes thinking about the girl about the story about prison about the sky before he realized that the prisoners hed been sitting with were no longer next to him boggs knew why theyd moved and he felt his skin crackle with fear severn washington was sick got the flu bad was puking all night and was in the infirmary if boggs knew it everybody knew it he looked around the yard and saw the man immediately juan ascipio was back he wore a red headband and a fatigue jacket over his jumpsuit two other prisoners walked beside him boggs had no idea why ascipio wanted to kill him he was a newcomer a dealer whod been convicted of the assassination of two rivals he wasnt a big man and he had a face that when it smiled might make children comfortable a kind face the sort you want to please but the eyes boggs had noticed were grinnymean and chill the three of them stopped about fifteen feet from where boggs sat next to a tall wall of red brick ascipio said yo man here now boggs looked at him but didnt get up ascipio pointed to a small shaded area out of sight of the towers the prisoners called it lovers lane ascipio stepped into the nook and unzipped his fly yo man im talking to you you deaf or what his friend said you man on your fucking knees gonna turn you out man turn you out you do that an youll live big nigger ain here to save your pretty cheeks the other come on man now boggs looked back at them he said dont believe i will he measured the distance to the nearest guard it was a long long way the other inmates were all studying very important things in the opposite direction from boggs thiss going to be bad ascipio spit out dontbelieve you will motherfucker say he dont believe he will then boggss eyes lowered to his own right hand which rested on his knee he glanced down at it ascipio followed his gaze a long fingernail it kept growing one inch two three four six boggs looked back into their eyes one by one his head swiveling seven washington had given it to him last night this piece of doublestrength glass a clear stiletto honed on one side so sharp it would shave hair the handle was taped metaldetectorproof the fingernail could do the most damage glass could ever do boggs had said would allah you know approve of this washington had reassured him allah say its okay to fuck up assholes try to move on you i heard him say that personally ascipio laughed put that way man get you pretty white mouth over here man theyd get him on his knees then the other two would hold him and ascipio would beat him to death and then theyd find the body in the laundry room where the official word would be hed died by falling down the stairs boggs shook his head ascipio said three of us man more i want that he nodded at the knife that do you shit man one of the others growled at the insubordination boggs didnt move the blade blasted light off its point ascipio walked close slowly and he looked into boggss eyes he stopped he stood for a long moment as they stared at each other finally the latino smiled and shook his head okay man you know you got balls i like that boggs didnt move you okay my friend ascipio said admiration in his voice nobody else ever try that shit with me you fuckin all right he extended his hand boggs looked down at it a bird swooping in boggs half turned as the fist of a fourth man whod come up behind him silently caught him under the ear a loudthwock as knuckles bounced off bone and he felt ascipios hand grabbing his right wrist with fingers that wanted to pierce the skin the knife fell to the ground and boggs saw it tumble appearing and disappearing as it fell no the word didnt come out as a shout though it was muffled by the meaty forearm of the man whod hit him there were no guards there were no aryan brotherhood protectors no severn washington there was no one in lovers lane except the five men five men and a glass knife ascipio leaned forward boggs smelled garlic on his breath garlic from his private stocks of food tobacco from the endless supply of cigarettes yo man you a stupid motherfucker no boggs thought in despair dont cut me not the knife not that please as the blade went in boggs felt much less pain than hed expected but the sense of horror was far worse than hed thought the knife retreated and returned into his body and he felt a terrifying loosening inside him then there were other shouts from a dozen yards away or a hundred but boggs didnt pay any attention they didnt mean anything to him all he was aware of was ascipios face the grinnymean eyes that never flinched or narrowed and the smile one that might please children she heard the news on another station not even a network o ampo but one of the locals the one that broadcastmash reruns and whose bestseller was a talk show that did stories about sexual surrogates and discrimination against overweight women runes own network news hadnt even thought randy boggss stabbing was worth mentioning rune sweettalked healy into taking courtney for a few hours she figured this was a major abuse of the relationship but he was so happy shed gotten the girl back she was a little vague abouthow exactly that he didnt complain at all a half hour later she was on the train to harrison wondering if maybe she should buy a monthly commutation pass the infirmary surprised her she expected it to be totally grim more big house more edward g robinson but it was just a clean welllit hospital ward a guard accompanied her a large black man with a broad chest his uniform didnt fit well the glossy blue collar buttons one a d one a c for department of corrections came just to the level of her eyes he was silent randy boggs didnt look good at all he was shellwhite and the spray or cream that he used on his hair glued it out in all directions the eyes were what bothered rune most though they were unfocused and still god they were eerie corpse eyes its you miss he nodded you come all the way up to see me you going to be all right got me a pretty nicelooking scar but the knife missed all the important stuff what happened dont rightly know i was in the yard and i get pulled over backwards and somebody stuck me you must have seen him nope not a glimpse was it daytime yep this morning how could somebody stab you and you not see it boggs tried a smile but it didnt take people get invisible here she said but look his eyes came to life for a moment then faded back to lifeless this is prison not the real world we got ourselves a whole different set of rules he lifted his hand to his stomach and touched a large while pad under his tattered overlaundered dressing gown he leaned his head back into his pillows and pressed his thin sinewy forearm over his eyes damn he whispered she watched him in this still pose for a long minute wishing shed brought the camera but then decided that no it was better to keep this private he was the sort of man whod never want to be seen crying i brought you something she opened her bag and removed an old book flaky and scabbed she held it out the pages were edged in gold boggs lowered his arm and looked at it uneasily as if no one had ever given him a present before and he was wondering what would be expected in return its a book she said figured that out he opened it looks like an old one he flipped open to the copyright page nineteen oh four yep that goes back a ways year my grandmother was born how bout that its not like its worth a lot of money or anything what is it like fairy tales greek and roman myths at least his eyes were reviving he even had a slight smile on his face as he turned the pages glancing at the pictures which were protected with tissue the smile of somebody who receives a present he likes but doesnt know what to do with rune said theres a story i want you to read one in particular she flipped through the pages here he looked at it prometheus wasnt he the guy made the wings out of wax or something uh nope that was another dude boggs squinted hey lookit there she followed his eyes to the old plate yeah she said laughing and sitting forward prometheus chained to a rock a hug bird swooping down and tearing at his side just like you getting stabbed isnt that crazy wild he closed the book and picked a couple chips of spine off the thin blanket so tell me miss you a college girl me nope how come you know this kind of stuff he held up the book she shrugged i just like to read i kind of regretted i never was smart enough to go naw i wouldnt feel that way if i was you she said you go to college get a real job get married what happens is you dont ever get a chance to play chicken with life thats the fun part he nodded never could sit still long enough to go to school anyway he looked at her for a moment eyes roving up and down tell me bout yourself me she was suddenly embarrassed sure i told you bout me remind me what lifes like on the outside been a while i dont know she thought so this is what the people i interview feel like boggs asked where you live houseboats took a lot of explaining in manhattan she said you can stand it there its a crazy place i cant stand it anyplace else never spent much time there never could get a handle on it why would you want to live somewhere you can get a handle on she asked maybe youve got a point there but youre talking to somebody whos a little prejudiced i come to town and what happens i get myself arrested for murder he smiled then looked at her closely so youre a reporter is that what you want to do i have this thing about films i think i want to make documentaries right now im working for this tv station ill do it for as long as it excites me the day i wake up and say id rather go have a picnic on the top of the chrysler building than go to work thats the day i quit and do something else boggs said you and mere kind of alike ive done me a lot of different things too i keep looking always been looking for that nest egg just to get a leg up hey before this job i spent six months at a bagel restaurant and before that i was a storewindow dresser most of my close friends are people i met at the unemployment office pretty girl like you i thinkd be considering settling down you have a boyfriend hes not exactly the marrying kind youre young im not in any hurry i think my mothers got this bridal shop in shaker heights on call in case i tell her im engaged shell be like sac you know red alert but i have trouble seeing me married like some things you can imagine and some you cant thats one that doesnt compute wheres shaker heights outside cleveland youre from ohio i spent some time in indiana then he laughed maybe i shouldnt put it that way not like i wasdoing time i lived about a year there working a real job as real as day labor can be steel mills in gary miss the guard said i let you stay a little longer than you should she stood up and said to boggs im working really really hard on the story im going to get you out of here boggs was running his finger along the edge of his book touching it in awe like it was solid gold ill keep this he said it as if that was the best thing he could think of to say to thank her as rune and the guard walked back to the prison exit the guard without looking at her said miss word been around about what youre trying to do she looked up at him her eyes didnt get much past the huge biceps about you maybe getting him a new trial yeah i like randy he keeps to himself and doesnt give us any grief but therere some people here dont like him much other prisoners he didnt answer but said instead im not supposed to be telling you this and im hoping it wont go any further than here sure but if you dont get him out soon hes not going to live to parole the people who did that she nodded back to the infirmary theres nothing we can do to stop them they arrived at the gate and the guard stopped but what did he do what did he do the guard didnt understand her i mean why did somebody stab him the guards face snapped into a brief frown he ended up here miss thats what he did the place was pretty easy to get into like water through a sieve jack nestor thought then laughed thinking that probably wasnt the best word to describe a houseboat the only problem had been there was a parking lot nearby and a booth with a security guard whod glance at the boat every so often like he was keeping an eye on it but nestor waited until the man made a phone call then walked past him and jogged up the yellow gangplank once he was inside he pulled on brown cotton gloves and started at the back he took his time hed never been on a houseboat before and he was pretty curious about it hed done some charters and been on more party boats than he could count and of course hed done time in military lsts and landing craft but this wasnt like anything else hed ever seen the decor sucked for one thing it looked like his nutzo stepmothers place but he admired the pilothouse if thats what youd call it which had beautiful brass fixtures and levers and grainy oak all yellow with old varnish beautiful all the controls except the wheel were frozen and he guessed the motor was kaput he resisted a temptation to pull the horn rope downstairs he carefully went through the bookshelves and the cheap sprungfiberboard desk that was a sea of papers and pictures mostly of dragons and knights and fairies that sort of shit there were a couple of dozen videocassettes they were mostly that makebelieve stuff too fairy stories dragonslayers the stuff he never watched some dirty films too lusty cousins and something calledepitaph for a blue movie star so this chick had a kinky side to her then he rummaged through the closets and drawers in the bedroom and in the little supply room that had another dresser in it he went through the kitchen and the refrigerator which was the first place that most people who thought they were clever hid things and which was the first place most professional thieves looked after an hour he was convinced she didnt have anything here that interested or worried him which meant the files would be at her office and that was a pain in the ass nestor looked around and sat down on the couch he had a decision to make he could wait here until she came back and just waste her get it over with make it look like a robbery the cops would probably buy that he was always surprised how people craved to accept the most obvious explanations easier all the way around robbery and murder or rape and murder on the other hand that might leave a lot of material floating around somewhere material that shouldnt be floating around still a car door slammed he was up fast glancing out the window he saw her not a badlooking girl if she didnt wear those stupid clothes like the striped blackandyellow tights and red miniskirt it turned him off and made him resent her oh he knew that emotion the feeling that hed get looking at a wiry brownskinned man in a khaki uniform looking at him through a telescopic sight feeling the hatred working up a wild spiraling fury maybe because nestor was sweating like a steam pipe in the heat or because bugs were digging into his skin or because he had a glossy starshaped scar on his belly resentment hate he needed those feelings to help him pull the trigger or press the knife in as deeply as he could boots scraped on the asphalt outside nestor felt a low itching and rubbed his scar he felt the weight of the steyr automatic in his pocket but he left it where it was and climbed out onto the deck he watched her open the door clumsy tilting against the weight of a movie camera and cassettes and a leather belt of batteries or whatever which looked like a bandolier of m clips she stacked it all by the door and disappeared into the bedroom he waited a few minutes to see if hed get a glimpse of skin but when she came out in a boring work shirt and stretch pants he silently left the boat and disappeared into the west village a genius but always controversial click a genius but always controversial lance hopper click rune hit the rewind button again it was a good shot of him lance hopper or a good shot of his mortal remains at any rate the gurney holding his body as it was wheeled out of the deadly courtyard three years before she wished she could use the footage unfortunately it had been filmed by another station controversial lance hopper was disliked by coworkers and competitors alike although under his brief leadership the sevenpm national news program rose to number one in the ratings he managed to embroil the network in several major scandals among them was an uproar caused by numerous firings of staff members massive and his critics said arbitrary budgetary cutbacks and intense scrutiny of the networks news programs and their content perhaps the incident that gave his network the blackest eye however was an equal employment opportunity suit brought by five women employees who claimed that hoppers hiring and promotion practices discriminated against them hopper denied the charges and the suit was settled out of court associates of the late executive though admitted that he preferred men in executive positions and felt that a woman had no business in the higher echelons of network news his flamboyant personal life belied that reputed prejudice however and he was often seen in the company of attractive women from society and the entertainment industry there were rumors of bisexual behavior and of his having had several young male models as companions his penchant however was for tall blondes click tall blondes why is it always tall blondes rune was at her desk surrounded by piles of newspapers magazines computer printouts videocassettes and the refuse from a dozen fastfood meals it was fourthirty in the afternoon and everyone was gearing up for the news at seven she felt that she was in the eye of a hurricane motion everywhere frantic crazed motion rune had also learned that while hoppers internship program had indeed launched many a career in journalism he himself was maybe a bit more interested in the young people than he should have been in the archives rune found a confidential memo in which the networks ethics committee heard complaints from two interns eighteen and nineteen that hed made improper advances toward them the names werent given and there seemed to be no followup references to the incidents she asked bradford about the reports but he said he knew nothing about them and didnt believe the stories for a minute powerful people he explained attract rumors he obviously didnt want his idol to have feet of clay and rune wondered if it had been purely an oversight that the young man had missed the memo about the investigation when he was digging through the archives in search of material on hopper click rune watched the tape of hoppers body rolling out into the spring night the snakes of afterimage etched into the screen by the revolving lights on the ems vans and police cars the crowds pale in the video cameras radiance of light that looked curious and bored at the same time rune a calm voice a womans voice oh hi it was piper sutton shouldve cleaned up my desk she thought remembering how neat the anchorwomans was and seeing how neat she looked now standing here in a dark red suit with black velvet tabs on the collar and a white highnecked blouse and and dark fleshy stockings disappearing into the slickest patentleather shoes runed ever seen shoes with high heels sand one red stripe along the side shoes thatd put me on my ass i tried to wear them but man they looked cool youre busy suttons eyes scanned the desk i was just working on the story rune casually picked up several of the closest paper bags one kentucky fried and two burger kings and dropped them into well onto an overflowing wastebasket you want to like sit down sutton looked at a ketchup packet that rested on the one unoccupied chair no i dont she leaned forward and ejected the tape that was in the sony player then read the label brand x she said its from a competitor you cant use this footage you know im not putting a super in any of my news programs that says courtesy of another network she handed the tape back to rune i know im just using it for background background sutton said the word softly i want to talk to you but not here are you doing anything for dinner i was just going to johns for pizza theyre like real generous with their anchovies sutton walked away no youll have dinner with me the thing is theres this person can they come with us i want to talk to you in private anything you can say to me you can say in front of her shes you know discreet sutton shrugged took one last look at the desk and didnt seem to like what she saw whatever then she scanned runes pink tshirt and miniskirt and fishnet stockings and ankle boots and she said you do have a dress dont you rune said defensively ive got two as a matter of fact she wondered what she was missing when sutton laughed the anchorwoman wrote out an address and handed it to rune thats between madison and fifth be there at sixthirty well do the pretheater dont want to spend more than we need to do we thats okay my friend likes to eat early you couldnt call it a tip it was a bribe jacques the maitre d took the money sutton offered him and slipped it into the pocket of his perfectly pressed black tuxedo however much it was rune didnt see the cash might have bought them access to the dining room but it did nothing to cheer up the poor sullen man he sat them at a table off to the side of the main dining room then surveyed courtney he said maybe a phone book rune said yellowand white pages jacques pursed his unhappy gallic lips and went off in search of the best childseating device new york telephone could offer rune looked around the room this is like really really amazing i could get into it living this way i mean uhm the theme of lescargot seemed to be flowers and probably as with the food excess was in the center of the room was dominated by a twisty vined centerpiece sprouting orchids and roses and babys breath the walls held huge paintings of flowers rune liked them they were what monet would have done if all hed used electriccolored crayolas instead of oil paint rune more or less matched the decor shed raced home to change into one of the two dresses a purpleandwhite laura ashley floral which was her spring and summer dress it was several years old but had very little mileage on it on the table in front of them was a bird of paradise in a tall glass vase and some kinkylooking green thing like a pinecone which if you were to see it innational geographic you wouldnt be able to tell whether it was a plant or fish or huge insect rune pointed at the bird of paradise i love these dudes she petted it i dont think it looks like a bird at all i think it looks like a dragon courtney said i like dragons sutton stared at them blankly dragons the little girl added im going to be a knight but i wouldnt kill any dragons id have them for pets runes going to take me to the zoo and were going to look at dragons through teeth that never separated more than a quarter inch sutton said how wonderful jacques returned with two bulky phone directories and set them on the third chair at the table courtney smiled as he lifted her up and set her on top he turned to sutton this really cannot be uh habitue i nonl jacques have someone bring the little girl some she looked at rune with a raised eyebrow she loves pizza we are a french restaurant miss she also likes pickles clam chowder smoked oysters rice anchovies huitresjacques said they are poached and served with pesto and beurre blanc sutton said fine just have somebody cut them up into little pieces i dont want to watch her mauling food and have the sommelier bring me a pulignymontrachet she looked at rune do you drink wine im over twentyone im not asking for a drivers license i want to know if an eightydollar bottle of wine will be wasted on you maybe a white russian would be more my speed sutton nodded to the maitre d and said find me a half bottle jacques a mersault if theres no puligny oui miss sutton huge menus appeared sutton scanned hers i dont think we want anything too adventurous well have scallops to start she asked rune do you swell up or turn red when you eat seafood no i get fish sticks all the time at this korean deli and sutton waved an abrupt hand and then the pigeon runes eyes went wide pigeon jacques saidsalades after please runes eyes danced around the room then settled on the arsenal of silverware and empty plates in front of her the procedures here seemed as complicated as catholic liturgy and the downside if you blew it seemed worse be cool now she told herself thiss your boss and she already thinks youre damaged rune resisted the fierce impulse to scratch under her bra strap the first course arrived along with the little girls oysters gross dudes courtney said but she began to eat them eagerly can we buy these for breakfast i like them rune was thankful courtney was with them the girl gave her something to do besides feeling uncomfortable picking spoons up off the floor wiping oyster off her face keeping the vase vertical sutton watched them and for the first time since rune had known her the anchorwomans face softened so thats what its like what rune asked kids you dont have children i do only i call them exhusbands three of them im sorry sutton blinked and stared at rune for a minute yes i believe you are she laughed but thats one thing i regret children i its not too late no i think it is maybe in my next life thats the worst phrase ever made sutton continued to study her with curiosity you just barge right through life dont you pretty much i guess suttons eyes settled on courtney then she reached forward and with a napkin as big as the girls dress wiped her cheek messy little things arent they yeah that parts kind of a drag and she isnt really into being sloppy tonight i told her to behave for lunch the other day okay were eating bananas and hamburger all kind of mixed together and suttons hand swept across the table enough two waiters brought the main courses rune blinked oh god little birds sutton saw her face and said dont worry theyre not your kind of pigeons my kind theyre more like quail no what they were like was little hostages with their hands tied behind their backs courtney squealed happily birdies birdies a halfdozen diners turned rune picked up a fork and the leastoffensive knife and started in they ate in silence for a few moments the birdies werent too bad actually the problem was that they still had the bones in them and using a knife as big as a sword meant there was a lot of meat you couldnt get to rune surveyed the room but didnt see a single person sucking on a drumstick there was a pause sutton looked at her and said where are you with the story rune had figured this was on the agenda and shed already planned what she was going to say the words didnt come out quite as organized as shed hoped but she kept the likes and the sortofs to a minimum she told sutton about the interviews with megler and with boggs and with the friends and family members and told her about getting all the background footage and she said ive sort of put in a request to get the police file on the case sutton laughed youll never get a police file no journalist can get a police file its like a special request but sutton just shook her head wont happen then she asked have you found anything that proves hes innocent not like real evidence but have you or havent you no all right sutton sat back half her food was uneaten but when the busboy appeared she gave him a subtle nod of the head and the plate vanished let me tell you why i asked you here i need some help from me look sutton was frowning ill be frank youre not my first choice but there just isnt anybody else like what are you talking about i want to offer you a promotion rune poked at a white square of vegetable some kind shed never run into before sutton gazed off across the restaurant as she mused sometimes we have to do things for the good of the news we have to put our own interests aside when i started out i was a crime reporter they didnt want women in the newsroom food reporting society the arts those were fine but hard news nope forget it so the chief gave me the shit jobs sutton glanced at courtney but the girl didnt notice the lapse into adult vocabulary the ancherwoman continued i covered autopsies i chased ambulances i did arraignments i walked through pools of blood at a mass shooting to get pictures when the photographer was kneeling behind the press car puking i did all of that crap and it worked out for me but at the time it was a sacrifice something in the matteroffact tone of suttons voice was thrilling to rune this is just what shed sound like when talking to another executive at the network an equal sutton and dan semple or lee maisel would talk this way in low voices surrounded by people wearing huge geometric shapes of jewelry sitting over the tiny bones of hostage birds and drinking eightydollarabottle wine like you want me to be a crime reporter i dont sutton said let me finish rune sat back her plate was cleared away and a young man in a white jacket cleaned the crumbs off the table with a little thing that looked like a miniature carpet sweeper most of the mess was on runes side i like you rune youve got street smarts and youre tough thats something i dont see enough of in reporters nowadays its one or the other and usually more ego than either of them heres my problem weve just lost the associate producer of the london bureau he quit to work for reuters and they were in the midst of production on three programs i need someone over there now runes skin bristled as if a wave of painless flame had passed over her associate producer no youd be an assistant not associate at first at least the bureaus in london paris rome berlin and moscow feed you leads and you and the executive producer will make your decisions on what you want to go after what does lee think hes given me the job of filling the spot i havent mentioned you to him but hell go with whoever i recommend this is pretty wild i mean i never thought thats what you were going to say how long would i be over there a year minimum if you like it something more permanent might be arranged that would be up to lee but usually we like to shift people around it could be paris or rome after that youd have to learn the language oh i took french in high schoolvoulezvous couchez sutton said i get the idea rune asked a passing waiter for a glass of milk for courtney and a straw the kind with the bend in them he didnt grasp the concept and rune let it drop she said to sutton i dont want you to think i mean im grateful and all but what about randy boggs you said yourself you dont have any evidence i still know hes innocent no emotion in suttons face rune said somebody tried to kill him in prison they stabbed him if we dont get him out theyll try again sutton shrugged ill assign a local reporter to pick up for you you would uhhuh so how bout it uh would you mind if i thought about it sutton blinked and seemed about to ask what the fuck is there to think about but she just nodded and said its a big decision maybe you should sleep on it i wont ask the other people im considering until tomorrow thanks sutton motioned for the last of her wine a young waiter scurried over and with alternate glances at her freckled chest and the crystal glass in front of her emptied the bottle she looked at her watch she said and the check please outside the restaurant the three of them paused that is one amazing car rune said as a glossy midnightblue stretch lincoln town car turned the corner and slowed dont you wonder who rides in those things sutton didnt answer the car eased to a stop in front of them the driver hopped out and ran to the door opened it for piper sutton oh sutton said youll give me your answer tomorrow sure piper were late a mans voice called from the limo good night the anchorwoman said briskly to rune and started toward the lincoln a man leaned forward to help her in it was dan semple himself in a beautiful gray doublebreasted suit he glanced at rune then kissed sutton on the cheek they disappeared into the blackness of the car thanks the door closed and rune and courtney were left looking at their mirrored images for the few seconds it took for the driver to get back inside and speed the limo away from the curb for dinner london was the problem ever since shed readlord of the rings the first of four times runed wanted to go to the united kingdom the country of pubs and hedgerows and shires and hobbits and dragons whoa and loch ness too shed thought about it for a couple hours and decided that any sane person in the world would accept piper suttons offer in ten seconds flat so rune was a bit curious why she was dropping courtney at one of her loyal expensive babysitters and then giving the cabdriver an address on the upper east side he took her to an old apartment building dark brick with lion basreliefs in dirty limestone trim she walked into the immaculate lobby hit the intercom and announced herself the door opened she took the elevator to the fourteenth floor when she stepped into a tiny corridor she realized there were only four apartments on the whole floor lee maisel opened the door to one waved and let her into a rambling darkpaneled apartment he didnt shake her hand he was dripping wet she followed noticing an elephants foot in the corner inside were a halfdozen umbrellas and canes several of them ended in carved faces a lion an old man rune thought he was a wizard some kind of bird maisel had been doing dishes he was wearing a blue denim apron waterstained with rorschach patterns and taut over his belly when i called well i hope i didnt interrupt anything id have told you i didnt want to be interrupted maisel returned to the cumulonimbus of suds the bars over there he nodded food uhm i just ate maisel dove into the dishwater again surrounded by implements scrapers sponges metallic scrubbers like tiny steel wigs a typhoon crashed over the granite countertop a pan surfaced and beached itself on the rubbermaid and he examined it carefully his face was pure contentment she envied him cooking and cleaning were loves that rune knew she would never cultivate in the living room a projection tv set was showing an old movie the sound low bette davis who was the dude tyrone power maybe what a name what a face whoa men looked good back then she could watch him for hours finally maisel wiped his hands and said come on they walked into the living room rune paused looking at a framed newspaper article on the wall from thetimes the headline was tv correspondent wins pulitzer excellent rune said what was it for a story in beirut a few years ago she asked acurrent events segment no it was before we developed the show he looked at the article slowly what a beautiful city that used to be thats one of the crimes of the century what happened there rune skimmed the article it says you got an exclusive but he was troubled it was a mixed victory he said we did what journalists should do we looked under the surface and reported the truth but some people died because of that rune recalled the incident from the information bradford had brought her remembered too that lance hopper had stood up to the criticism and defended his news team come here maisel said his face brightening he led rune down a long corridor lit by overhead spotlights it was like an art gallery hey this is pretty cool there were dozens of framed maps most of them antique maisel paused at each one told her where hed found it how hed dickered with the booksellers and vendors how hed been taken by some and gypped others she liked the new york maps best maisel pointed to a couple of them describing what buildings were now on the spots that the maps showed as just fields or hills her favorite was a map of greenwich village in the s that is fantastic i love old new york doesnt it just do something to you okay youre out on the street eating a nedicks with onions i really love those pickled onions and you suddenly think wow maybe im standing right on the very spot where they rubbed out a gangster or where two hundred years ago there was an indian war or something i dont eat hot dogs maisel said absently and she caught him glancing at his watch they walked into a lowlit den filled with leather furniture and more maps and framed photos of maisel on assignment they sat he asked so whats up rune said i got an offer for something and i dont know what to do about it publishers clearing house he asked wryly better than that she told him what piper sutton had said maisel listened she got almost all the way through before she realized that his face was growing a frown so she offeredyou the brit spot huh i was kind of surprised she could see in his face that he was surprised too rune i want to be honest no reflection on you but its a tough assignment i had a couple people more senior in mind im not saying you couldnt get up to speed but your experience is like pretty much not there maisel didnt agree or disagree he said youre a good cameraman and youre learning a lot with the hopper story but producing involves a lot more than that he shrugged but i asked piper to fill the spot its her call if she wants you in the job its yours he looked across the room more antique maps she wondered what country he was focusing on im pretty tempted she said wonder why he said wryly couldnt be more than ten fifteen thousand reporters in the country thatd kill to have that assignment maisel stretched his feet out straight then curled one up under himself he was wearing bright yellow socks but he said youre worried about the boggs story she noddedthats the problem hows it coming slow i dont really have any leads nothing solid but you still think hes innocent yeah i guess i do the storyd still get done piper said shed assign someone local to finish it did she yeah she promised me maisel nodded after a moment rune said she doesnt want me to do this story does she shes afraid afraid piper sutton its not as funny as it seems her job is her whole life shes had three disastrous marriages theres nothing else she can do professionally nothing she wants to do if this story goes south she and i and dan semple to some extent will take the flak you know how fickle audiences are dan and i are worried about news piper is too but shes an anchor shes also got public image to sweat i cant imagine her being afraid of anything i mean im terrified of her shes not going to have you rubbed out if you tell her youre going to stay and do the story but shes my boss maisel laughed youre too young to know that bosses like wives arent necessarily matched to us in heaven okay but sheis piper sutton thats a different issue and i dont envy you having to call her up and tell her that youre declining her offer but so what youre an adult more or less rune thought she said i dont know what to do lee whats your totally totally honest opinion about my story maisel was considering a gold clock began pinging off the hours to tenpm when it hit eight he said im not going to do you any favors by being delicate the boggs story you take it way too personally and thats unprofessional i get the impression that youre on some kind of holy quest you but hes innocent and nobody else rune he said harshly you asked my opinion let me finish sorry youre not looking at the whole picture youve got to understand that journalism has a responsibility to be totally unbiased youre not with boggs youre one of the most goddamn biased reporters ive ever worked with true she said that makes for a noble person maybe but its not journalism thats sort of what piper told me too theres government corruption and incompetence everywhere therere human rights violations in america africa and china theres homelessness theres child abuse in daycare centers there are so many important issues that media has to choose from and so few minutes to broadcast news or newspaper columns to talk about them in what youve done is pick a very small story its not a bad story its just an insignificant one she looked off scanning maisels wall absently she wondered if shed find an omen an old map of england maybe she didnt a minute passed he said its got to be your decision i think the best advice i can give you is sleep on it you mean stay up all night tossing and turning and stewing about it that might work too the twentieth precinct on the upper west side was considered a plum by a lot of cops the hispanic gangs had been squeezed north the black panthers were nothing more than a bit of nostalgia and nomansland central park had its very own precinct to take care of the muggings and drug dealers what you had in the twentieth mostly were domestic disputes shopliftings an occasional rape the piles of auto glass like tiny greenblue ice cubes marked what was maybe the most common crime stealing blaupunkts or panasonics from dashboards two yuppies whod scrunched honda accord or bmw fenders might get into a shoving match in front of zabars an insider trader suicide or two occasionally but things didnt get much worse than that there was a lot of traffic in and out of the low s decor brickandglass building community relations was a priority here and more people came through the doors of the twentieth to attend meetings or just hang out with the cops than to report muggings so the desk sergeant a beefy moustachioed blond cop didnt think twice about her this young miniskirted mother about twenty who had a cuteasabutton threeor fouryearold in tow on this warm afternoon she walked right up to him and said she had a complaint about the quality of police protection in the neighborhood the cop didnt really care of course he liked concerned citizens about as much as he liked his hemorrhoids and he almost felt sorry for the petty street dealers and hangersout and drunks who got pushed around by these wildeyed lecturing upstanding taxpaying citizens the women being the worst but hed studied community relations at the police academy and so now though he couldnt bring himself to smile pleasantly at this short woman he nodded as if he were interested in what she had to say you guys arent doing a good job patrolling my little girl and i were out on the street just taking a walk yes miss did someone hassle you she gave him a glare for the interruption we were taking a walk and do you know what we found on the street nade the little girl said the cop infinitely preferred to talk to the little girl he may have hated intense short concerned citizens but he loved kids he leaned forward grinning like a departmentstore santa the first day on the job honey is that your name nade uhhuh thats a pretty name oh she was so goddamn cute he couldnt believe it the way she was digging in her own little patentleather purse trying to look grown up he didnt like the limegreen miniskirt she was wearing and he was thinking maybe the sunglasses around the girls neck on that yellow strap might be dangerous her mother oughtnt to be dressing her in that crap little girls should be wearing that frilly stuff like his wife bought for their nieces the goodcitizen mother said show him what we found baby the cop talked the singsongy language that adults think children respond to my brothers little girl has a purse like that what do you have in there honey your dolly it wasnt it was a us armyissue fragmentation hand grenade nade the girl said and held it out in both hands holy mary the cop gasped the mother said there look at that just lying on the street we he hit the fire alarm and grabbed the phone calling nypd central and reporting a ied an improvised explosive device and a then it occurred to him that the fire alarm wasnt such a good idea because the forty or fifty officers in the building could get out only one of three ways a back exit a side exit and the front door and most were choosing the front door not eight feet from a child with a pound of tnt in her hands what happened next was kind of a blur a couple of detectives got the thing away from the girl and onto the floor in the far corner of the lobby but then nobody knew exactly what to do six cops stood gawking at it but the pin hadnt been pulled and they got to talking about whether there was a hole drilled in the bottom of the grenade and how if there was that meant it was a dummy like they sold at armynavy stores and in ads in the back offield and stream but whoever had put the thing in the corner had left it so that you couldnt see the butt end and since the bomb squad got paid extra money to do that sort of thing they decided just to wait but then somebody noticed it was in the sun and they thought that maybe that might set it off they got into an argument because one of the cops had been in nam where it was a hundred and ten degrees in the sun and their grenades never went off but yeah this might be an old one and unstable and if it did go theyd lose all their windows and the trophy case and somebody was bound to get fragged finally the desk sergeant had the idea to cover the thing with a halfdozen kevlar bulletproof vests and they made a great project out of dancing up and carefully dropping vests on the grenade one by one each cop making a run not knowing whether to cover his eyes or ears or balls with his free hand then there they stood these large cops staring at a pile of vests until the bomb squad detectives arrived fifteen minutes later it was about then that the concerned mother and the little girl who nobody had noticed walk past the desk sergeant and into the file room of the deserted precinct house slipped outside through the back door the mother shoving some papers into her ugly leopardskin shoulder bag holding her daughters hand she walked through the small parking lot full of blueandwhites and past the cop car gas pump then turned toward columbus avenue a few cops and passersby glanced at them but no one paid her much attention there was still way too much excitement going on at the station house itself rune filled sam healys kitchen basin with water and gave courtney a bath then she dried the girl and put on the diaper she wore to bed by now shed gotten the routine down pretty well and though she wouldnt admit it to anybody she liked the smell of baby powder the little girl asked story rune said ive got a good one we can read come on in here she checked outside to make sure healys bomb squad station wagon wasnt back yet then they walked into the family room and sat on an old musty couch with tired springs she sank down into it courtney climbed into her lap can we read about ducks courtney asked the duck story is really crucial this is even better rune said its a police report excellent the girl nodded as rune began to read through sheets of paper stamped property of the th precinct there were some photos of hoppers dead body but they were totally gross and rune slipped them to the back before courtney saw them she read until her throat ached from keeping her voice in a childentertaining low register shed pause occasionally and watch courtneys eyes scan the cheap white paper the meaning of the words was totally lost on the child of course but she was fascinated finding some secret delight in the abstract designs of the black letters after twenty minutes courtney closed her eyes and lay heavily against runes shoulder the subject of the reading matter apparently didnt matter much to courtney ducks and police procedures lulled her to sleep equally quickly rune put her into bed pulled the blankets around her she looked at the u poster that healys son adam had bought healy for his birthday a great father the cap had immediately framed and mounted it in a nice prominent location she decided to sink some money into a maxfield parrish or wyeth reproduction for courtneys room on the houseboat thats what kids needed giants in clouds or magic castles maybe one of rackhams illustrations froma midsummer nights dream rune returned to the report id just come back from zabars i walked past my living room window i see these two men standing there then one pulls out this gun there was a flash and one of the men fell over i ran to the phone to dial but ill admit i hesitated i was worried it might be a mafia thing all these witnesses you hear about getting killed or a drug shooting i go back to the window to see if they were just kidding around maybe it was young people you know but by then theres a police car the report contained the names of three people interviewed by the police all three lived on the first floor of the building the first two hadnt been home the third was the woman whod given the report a clerk at bloomingdales who lived on the first floor of hoppers building overlooking the courtyard that was all the cops had talked to onlythree people and onlyone eyewitness at least thirty or forty apartments would open onto the courtyard why hadnt they been interviewed coverup she thought conspiracy grassy knolls the warren commission she finished the report there wasnt much else helpful rune heard healys car pull into the driveway and hid the file she looked in on courtney kissed her forehead the girl woke up and said love you rune blinked and didnt speak for a moment then managed like sure me too but courtney seemed to be asleep again by the time she said it funny thing sam healy was saying the next morning funny this practice grenade disappeared from the bomb squad and next thing theres a report of one found on the street near the twentieth funny hed just come in from mowing the lawn she smelled grass and gasoline it reminded her of her childhood in the suburbs of cleveland saturday morning when her father would trim the boxwood and mow and spread mulch around the dogwoods dont think i heard anything about it on the radio rune offered the report said a young woman and a baby found it i seem to remember you stopping by the bomb squad yesterday didnt you you and courtney sort of i think im not too clear healy said youre sounding like those defendants yeah i was standing over the body with the gun but i dont remember how i got there you dont thinki had anything to do with it occurred to me you want my solemn word will you swear on the grimm brothers absolutely she raised her hand rune didnt you think it was dangerous for a child to pull a stunt like that not that idid walk around with a grenade but if i had i wouldve made sure it was a dummy you could get me fired and you could get arrested she tried to look miserable and contrite and unjustly accused at the same time he popped open two pabsts he was stern when he said just dont forget youve got more to think about than yourself which gave her a little thrill his saying remember me im in your life too but he tromped on that pretty fast by nodding toward the bedroom and saying think about her you dont want her to lose two mothers in one month do you no they sipped the beers in silence for a minute then she said sam i got a question you ever do any homicide investigations no when i was in emergency services we ran crime scenes a lot but i never did the legwork boring but you know something about them a little whats up say theres somebody killed okay hypothetically yeah this guy is hypothetically killed and theres an eyewitness the cops find and he gives a statement would the cops just stop there and not interview anybody else sure why not if its a solid witness real solid sure detectivesve got more murders than they know what to do with an eyewitness which you hardly ever get in a homicide sure theyd take the statement and turn em over to the prosecutor then on to another case id think theyd do more an eyewitness rune it doesnt get any better than that the sites of tragedy it had happened three years ago but as she placed each foot on the worn crest of a cobblestone slowly a mourners hopscotch rune felt the macabre queasy pull of lance hoppers killing it was eightpm an overcast humid evening she and courtney stood in the courtyard at the bottom of the four sides of the building a square of graypink citylit sky was above them where exactly had hopper died she wondered in the dim triangle of light falling into the courtyard from the leadedglass lamp by the canopied doorway or had it been in the negative space the shadows had he crawled toward the light rune found that this bothered her not knowing exactly where the man had lain as he died she thought there should be some kind of marker some indication of where that moment had occurred the instant between life and no life but there was nothing no reminder at all hopper would have to be content with whatever his gravestone said hed been rich she was sure it was an eloquent sentiment rune led courtney into the stuccoed lobby an entryway of a medieval castle she expected at least a suit of armor a collection of pikes and broadswords and maces but she saw only a bulletin board with a faded sign coop news and a stack of takeout menus from a chinese restaurant she pressed a button what a cute little girl youre young to be a mother rune said you know how it is the woman said i had andrew when i was twentysix beth when i was twentynine that was old for then for that generation let me show you the pictures the apartment was irritating it reminded rune of a movie shed seen one time about these laser beams that crisscrossed the control room in a spaceship and if you broke one of them youd set off this alarm here though no laser beams but instead little china dishes animal figurines cups commemorative plates a franklin mint ceramic thimble collection vases and a thousand other artifacts most of them flowery and ugly all poised on the edges of fake teak shelves and tables just waiting to fall to the floor and shatter courtneys eyes glinted at these many opportunities for destruction and rune kept a death grip on the belt of the little girls jumpsuit the womans name was miss breckman she was handsome a born salesclerk reserved helpful organized polite rune remembered she was in her late fifties though she looked younger she was stocky with a double chin handsome though it was and a cylindrical frame have a seat please they maneuvered through the ceramic land mines and sat on doilycovered chairs rune tamped down her pride and complimented miss breckman on her fine collection of things the woman glowed i got them mostly from my mother we had the same thoughts about decoration genetic i suppose from there they talked about children about boyfriends and husbands miss breckmans had left her ten years before she was she said currently in the market mostly what miss breckman wanted to talk about though was the news so youre a real reporter her eyes focused on rune like a scientist discovering a new kind of bug more of a producer really not like a newspaper reporter its different in tv news oh i know i watch every news program on the air i always try to work the day shift so i can be home in time to watchlive at five its a bit gossipy but arent we all i dont care for the sixpm report thats mostly business so i fix my dinner then and i watch theworld news at seven while i eat she frowned i hope you wont be offended if i tell you your networks nightly news isnt all that good jim eustice the anchorman i think hes funnylooking and sometimes doesnt pronounce those polish and japanese names right butcurrent events is simply the best do you know piper sutton sure you do of course is she as charming as she seems smart sweet if you only knew lady rune began steering toward the boggs story not quite sure how much to say if rune was right about boggss innocence of course she was pretty much calling ms figurine here a liar and come to think of it a perjurer too she opted for the indirect approach im doing a followup story on the hopper killing and id like to ask you a few questions id be happy to help it was one of the most exciting times of my life i was in that courtroom and there was this killer right there and he was looking at me miss breckman closed her eyes for a moment i was pretty darn scared but i did my duty i was kind of hoping that after i came out of the courtroom thered be all these reporters shoving microphones at me you know i love those microphones with the names of the stations on them uhhuh maybe i could set up my equipment while rune did that miss breckman hoisted courtney into her lap and rattled on nonstop bringing the little girl was a great idea she was like a pacifier for adults when the portable light clicked on and the red dot on the ikegami flashed miss breckmans eyes took on an intense shine to a degree rune figured they would never reach ringing up an american express charge in junior sportswear rune said could you move over there nodding at a queen anne chair upholstered in forestgreen needlepoint ill sit wherever you like honey miss breckman moved and then composed herself for a moment now could you tell me exactly what happened sure she told the camera about the murder coming home from shopping seeing the men argue the gun appearing the muffled shot hopper falling running to the phone hesitating you saw him pull the trigger well i saw this flash and the gun was right up against the poor mans body could you see what kind of gun it was no it was too dark and you couldnt hear what they were saying no her head turned eyes gazing into the courtyard you can see beautiful shot rune zoomed past her and focused on the cobblestones its pretty far away rune dug into her purse and pulled out a piece of paper she looked at it then said the police report said you werent interviewed until the day after the shooting is that right uhhuh the next night two men showed up detectives but they didnt look like kojak or anything though i was kind of disappointed you didnt contact them right away no like i told you i was pretty shaken by the whole thing i was scared what if it was a drug killing you know what you see on the news practically every day mothers and children are being murdered because theyre witnesses but the next morning i saw a news report onwake up with the news that said theyd arrested this drifter not a hit man or anything so when the detectives came to me i didnt hesitate to tell them what i saw it also says that the police asked you if youd seen anything and you said tm sorry i didnt talk to you sooner but idid see it i mean i saw the shooting and the detective asked did you see the man who did it and you answered sure i did it was randy boggs was that pretty much what you said nope not pretty much at all thatsexactly what i said rune just smiled and resisted an urge to say no further questions she suddenly felt a shadow over her didnt like the vibrations rune looked sideways to see what angel of death was hovering over her in the newsroom and found she was staring into piper suttons eyes hi rune said sutton didnt answer runes eyes skipped around the room wondering why exactly the woman was frowning so intensely rune said guess what ive got she touched the tape i talked to the witness and the flash of anger was like a fast shutter on a camera and so fiene and brutal that rune gasped then piper sutton regained control though her eyes were still cold youve got a little bit to learn about life she seemed to swallow something at the end of the sentence probably young lady rune began what did i then it hit her oh shit the london assignment nobodys forcing you to work for a network like ours now the temper was once again on the move the patented sutton temper it was rolling downhill an avalanche and rune was about to get buried you have your choice but if youre going to work here goddammit youve got to behave like an adult or i was going to tell you about the london job im sorry you can go pick up paychecks at some fucking restaurant the voice dropped threateningly i take you out to dinner where you and that urchin of yours embarrass the hell out of me and i make you a proposition that no one your age hasever been offered before now the screeching began rune blinked and sat back her eyes wide and do you even give me the courtesy of an answer heads perked up throughout the studio no one dared look and no one didnt listen im sorry but sutton cranked up a few more decibels do you even show me the respect youd show a cabdriver did you say thank you but ive decided not to accept your offer did you say piper could you please give me a few days to think about it some more no you goddamn well didnt what you did was say zip thats what you said and then you went on your merry way im sorry rune heard herself whining and didnt like it she cleared her throat i got caught up in the story i was going to tell you sutton waved her hand i hate apologies its a sign of weakness rune wanted to cry but sat hard on the tears sutton was speaking to the ceilingeverything about this story has been wrong i knew it was a mistake stupid of me stupid stupid rune swallowed she touched the file just let me explain please what happened was i talked to the witness sutton smiled coldly and shook her head exaggerating her lack of comprehension what witness the one who convicted randy oh sure that explains your behavior suttons sarcasm was thick no i can prove that she didnt see randy boggs how shes a real like newshound a newshound what the fuck is that she watches all the news programs every day she didnt give any description of boggs untilafter shed seen him arrested on tv when the suttons hands raised like a martyrs what exactly are you getting at listen when the police showed up to interview her she said i saw who did it and it was randy boggs silence pinresounding silence sutton gave a short bark of a laugh thats your proof you cant see into the courtyard clearly from her place its too dark miss breckman saw randy on thenews she saw him being arrested thats where she got the description from tv otherwise how would she know his name she didnt describe him first she said right off it was randy boggs media circus sutton considered this with a splinter of interest but then she laughed keep at it honey youve got a long way to go but doesnt this prove that shes a bad witness a piece in the puzzle thats all it is keep digging i thought that wed go with it i guess a brittle nail leveled at runes face like a bright red dagger this is the big time you keep forgetting that we dont run a story untilits completely buttoned up she walked stridently through the newsroom on her clattering heels while employees moved quickly but unobtrusively as far out of her way as they could downstairs in the lobby rune surveyed the job and didnt like what she saw a directory of residents containing over a hundred names help you the doormans accent seemed to be russian but then rune decided she didnt know what a russian accent sounded like the man wearing an old gray uniform shiny on the butt might have been czech or rumanian or yugoslavian or even greek or argentine whatever his ethnic origin he was big and snide and unfriendly i was just looking at the directory who you wanna see nobody really i was just he smiled slyly as if hed just caught on that threecard monte games were rigged i know they done that before im a student yeah student he worked a spot on the inside of his mouth with his tongue how long you worked here she asked six months i just came over here this country lived with my cousin for a while who worked here before you he shrugged i dunno how would i know you make good money doing it you know what im saying what do you mean im a student ive heard it all you think i havent heard it im an art student architecture i yeah the smile was staying put the tongue foraged what you make make rune asked how much you sell them for what the names he nodded you sell them to companies send everybody that junk mail no junk mail in my country here its everywhere what im doing is id like to talk to some people who live here about the design of their apartments a nod joined the smile there was nothing worse than being accused of something you hadnt done even if you were doing something you shouldntve been doing she rummaged for a minute in the dark recesses of her bag until she came up with a stiff bill a twenty hot out of the atm she handed it to him zip it vanished into his pocket how much you make another twenty joined its friend ah he walked off pressing his hand to the pocket that held the crisp nonreimbursable bills and rune turned back to her task the smart thing would have been to find out which rows of apartments looked out over the courtyard where lance hopper had been shot but she didnt know how soon the slavicruskie south american capitalist would be back to suck up another bribe so she started at the top left of the directory from myron zuckerman in ib she speed wrote straight down to mr or ms l peters in k twenty minutes later the doorman returned just as she finished still studying he asked snidely i just finished so tell me yeah which company you with one of the big ones am i right its a big one rune said is in jersey right howd you guess ive been around i seen a lot you cant fool me i wouldnt even try scorching pain roamed around in her back the inside of her ear was sweating her voice had gone from low soprano to throaty alto and shed have to clear her windpipe with a stinging snap every few minutes rune had been sitting in her cubicle at the studio speaking into a phone for nearly eight hours straight hello im a producer forcurrent eventsthe news program mr zuckerman norris williams roth gelinker were doing a segment about the lance hopper killing you probably remember the man killed in the courtyard of your building several years ago im hoping you can help me what im looking for is it was late edging beyond eight oclock past bedtime for courtney the little girl sat at runes feet tearing scheduling sheets into the shape of easter bunnies how long have you lived in apartment b c d e f rune bunny whispering hand over mouthpiece beautiful honey im on the phone make a momma easter bunny now thatis the mommy then make a daddy runes poll of the tenants so far one was miss breckman eight had unlisted numbers twenty werent home when she called thirtythree had moved into their apartments after hoppers death eighteen hadnt been home the night of the killing or said they hadnt nineteen were home but didnt see anything related to the murder or said they didnt that left twelve on her list a bad number if thered been only three she wouldve called them twenty shed have given up and gone home to sleep but twelve rune sighed and stretched hearing some remote bone protest with a pop courtney yawned and tore a bunny in half with fidgety glee quitting time rune thought im going home then she thought of suttons raspy bitchy voice and fuming eyes and she picked up the phone which was fortunate because when she asked mr frost b if he knew anything about the lance hopper killing he paused for only a moment then responded actually i saw it happen you put that in a bottle and youve got yourself something she said rune had walked into the apartment right past the elderly man whod opened the door and stepped up to a glass case inside was an elaborate model of a ship not a rigged clipper ship or manofwar but a modern cargo ship it was four feet long she said audacious thank you ive never made ships in bottles to tell you the truth i dont like hobbies she introduced herself bennett frost he said he was about seventyfive years old he wore a cardigan sweater with a moth hole on the shoulder and cheap gray pants he was balding and had dark moles on his face and head he leaned forward a vestigial bow as he shook her hand he held it for a moment longer than one normally would have and looked at her closely the touch and the examination though were not sexual he was appraising her when he was done he released her hand and nodded at the glass case theminnesota princess odd name dont you think for a ship that spent most of her time in the mediterranean and the atlantic my very first ship no i shouldnt say that my veryfirst profitable ship which is i suppose better than my first ship i named herminnesota because i was born there he walked into the large apartment rune studied the squarish ship the deck was covered with tiny boxes then she followed him in the cluttered living room she noticed suitcases you going on a trip i have a place in bermuda haiti was my favorite the oloffson what a hotel that was not true any longer of course i never used to go to british colonies but you know how things are elsewhere he looked at her with slits of eyes a shared secret she nodded his eyes fell on her camera you have a press pass or something she showed him her network id he scanned her up and down again a cat scan of her soul youre young younger than some older than others he gave that a curly smile and said iwas young when i got started in business what did you do he gazed at the model that was my contribution to the shipping industry and the aesthetics of the sea she isnt beautiful she isnt a stately ship i think she looks pretty nifty frost said and the stately ships go onto their haven under the hillbut o for the touch of a vanished handand the sound of a voice that is still tennyson nobody knows poetry anymore rune knew some nursery rhymes and some shakespeare but she remained silent he continued but she made money hand over fist for a lot of people he lifted a heavy decanter and started pouring two glasses of purple liquor as he asked would you like some port she accepted the glass and sipped it was cloying as honey and tasted like cough medicine i started out as a ships chandler do you know what that is a candle maker rune shrugged no a provisioner a supplier anything a captain wanted from a ratchet to a side of beef i would get it i started when i was seventeen rowing out to the ships as soon as they dropped anchor even before the agents arrived or theyd started offloading i gave them cut prices demanded half as a deposit gave them fancylooking receipts for the cash and always returned with what they wanted or a substitute that was better or cheaper i was wondering sir she began frost held up a hand listen this is important during the thirties i moved into the shipping myself rune didnt see what was important but she let him talk and talk he did fifteen minutes later shed learned about his growing fortune in the shipping business he was talking about ship propellers hed designed himself they called them frost efficiency screws i got such a kick out of that efficiency screws so my ships could make the run from the strait of hormuz around the horn to the abrose light in thirtythree days of course i was wrong about the suez canal but i still had the fastest oil carriers in the world thirtythree days rune said if i could ask you a few questions about the hopper killing theres a point im trying to make sorry i got out of shipping i could see what would happen to oil i could see the balance of trade shift i didnt want to leave my ships oh that hurt me but have to think ahead did you hear about the buggywhip manufacturers who went out of business when autos were developed you know what their problem was they didnt think of themselves as being in theaccelerator business ha he loved the story had probably told it a thousand times so what did i go into airlines frost laughed derisivelypublic transportation regulations ad nauseam i thought about it but i knew that it would take one democrat two at the most to ruin the industry no i diversified financial services mining manufacturing and i became the fourthrichest man in the world youre skeptical i can see that youve never heard of me some old crackpot youre thinking whos lured me in here for who knows what nefarious prospects but its true in the seventies i had three billion dollars he paused and those were the days when a billion meant something he sat forward and rune sensed he was getting to his point but what could i do with money like that provide for my wife and children buy comfortable shoes a good set of golf clubs a warm coat an apartment where the plumbing worked i dont smoke rich food makes me ill mistresses i was contentedly married for fortyone years i put my children through school set up trust funds for the grandchildren though not very fat ones and he smiled significantly i gave most of the rest away hence you me what exactly does all that have to do with the hopper killing frost considered this for a moment im confessing she blinked but he said you have to understand it didnt make any difference you know uh like how exactly do you mean they had the other witness you cant blame me really could you explain please at the time when he was killed i had rny fortune i was giving money away i had people who worked for me who depended on me for their livelihood their families you people in the media a man never has any privacy around you he pronounced it with a short i privacy like privileged he continued i was simply scared back then i was afraid to tell the police that id seen hopper killed id be on news programs id be in court thered be stories about my wealth kidnappers might come after my family or me dogooders would start hounding me for money for their causes i felt guilty at first but then i heard that that breckman woman downstairs saw the whole thing and told the police about the killer it took the pressure off me but now you dont mind telling me what you saw whats different now frost walked to the window and looked into the gloomy courtyard i have a different attitude toward life oh please rune was praying do it now tell me what you saw and please make it good may i she gestured toward the camera a pause then he nodded the lights clicked on the camera hummed she aimed it at frosts long face its odd he said wistfully what giving away your fortune does its a marvelous thing i dont know why it hasnt caught on he looked at her seriously let me ask you you know anybody else giving away a billion dollars none ofmy friends rune said unfortunately rune and piper sutton sat in front of the anchor womans desk watching the monitor out of it came two tinny voices mr frost did you see the shooting plain as the nose on my face or your face however that expression goes it was horrible i saw this man come up to mr hopper and pull out this little gun and shoot him just push the pistol at him it reminded me of the pictures of ruby you know jack ruby when he shot oswald mr hopper held his hands out like he was trying to catch the bullet sutton stirred but didnt say anything could you describe him he was a fat man not fat all over but with a beer belly like a timpani a what a drum dark blandish hair a moustache whats that sure im positive about the moustache and sideburns a light jacket powderblue rune said to sutton thats jimmy the man who picked up randy and drove him to new york sutton frowned and waved her silent why didnt you go to the police i told you if you could tell me again please i was afraid of retaliation of publicity i was very wealthy i was scared for me and my family anyway the killer was caught and identified that woman downstairs identified the man and i read that the police caught him practically redhanded why would they need me im going to show you a picture of someone could you tell me if this is the man you saw in the courtyard who this skinny fellow no that wasnt him at all youd swear to it sure i would click rune kept staring at the monitor a proud schoolkid waiting for the teachers praise but suttons only comment was a breathy damn rune tried not to smile with pleasure and unadulterated pride sutton looked at her watch then added im late for a meeting with lee did you make a dupe of that tape sure rune said i always make dupes its locked in my credenza sutton said weve got a story conference on friday bring your proposed script youll present to both of us and be prepared to defend every goddamn line got it you bet sutton started to leave the office she paused and said in a soft voice im not very good at praise just let me say that there arent many people who wouldve stuck with it long enough to do what you did then she frowned and the old sutton returned now get some sleep you look awful this is the story of a man convicted of a crime he didn t commit unjustly uh no of a man unjustly convicted of a crime he didnt commit well sure if he didnt commit it its unjust the story of a man convicted of a crime he didnt commit words were definitely the hard part rune spun around in her desk chair and let out a soft anguished scream of frustration words she hated words runesaw things and sheliked seeing things she remembered things she saw and forgot things she was told words were real tricky little dudes this is the story of a man convicted of a crime he didn t commit a man who lost two years of his life because why why because the system of justice in this country is like a big dog a dog justice is like adog are you insane crap she shouted crap crap crap half the newsroom looked at her what is lee maisel going to say when he reads this stuff whats piper going to say because the system of no because the justice system in this country no because the american justice system is like a bird with an injured wing crap crap crap fred megler was as enthusiastic as could be expected considering that his lunch was three hot dogs with kraut and limp onions and a diet pepsi and considering too that his view while he was eating was the criminal courts building the darkest grimiest courthouse in all of manhattan and considering finally that one of his clients he explained to rune was about to be sentenced on a threecount conviction for murder two stupid shmuck he fucking put himself away what can i say megler still skinny still gray was chewing drinking and talking simultaneously rune stood back out of the trajectory of flecks of hot dog that occasionally catapulted from behind his thick wet lips he was impressed with her story about frost even as he tried not to be he said yeah sounds like boggs might have a shot at it not enough to reverse the conviction probably but the judge might go for a new trial im not saying yes im not saying no theres new evidence then theres newevidence what youre telling me this was evidence that could have been discovered at the time of the trial i was sort of wondering about that how comeyou didnt find frost hey i was making minimum wage on that case i dont have an expense account like you newspeople do i dont sit around at five oclock drinking manhattans in the algonquin whats a manhattan a drink you know rye and vermouth and bitters look the boggs trial i did what i could i had limited resources that was his problem he didnt have any money the tail of the last hot dog disappeared rune had an image of a big fish eating a small fish doesnt sound like justice to me justice megler asked you want to know what justice is rune sure did and as she pressed the record button on the little jvc camcorder hidden from his view in her leopardskin bag megler who could probably have cited all kinds of laws on being taped surreptitiously was polite enough to finish chewing and to take on a reflective expression before he spoke again justice in this country is luck and fate and circumstances and expedience and as long as thats true people like randy boggsre going to serve time they shouldnt will you handle the case we had a conversation about my fee come on hes innocent dont you want to help him out not particularly i dont give money to homeless people why should i be more generous with my time i dont believe you runes voice went high you would your network pay my bill something sounded wrong about it she said i dont think thatd be ethical what ethical i wouldnt get into hot water for that i meant journalists ethics oh your ethics he swilled the last of the pepsi glanced down and noticed a spot on his navyblue tie he took a pen from his pocket and scribbed back and forth on the tie until the smudge was obscured well thats the netnet i work i get paid thats carved in stone but you got some options theres legal aid or aclu those dips get orgasmic they get a case like this one of those threepiece dogooders from yale or columbia or hahvahd might get wind of it and pick up the case so you run your story ill guarantee you some scrawny little nyu graduatell be banging on your door begging to get boggss phone number but that could take months hes got to get out now his lifes in danger look ive got to walk back to that hellhole in twenty minutes and stand next to a man who it is alleged machinegunned three rival gang members while he told polack jokes to one of his mistresses i have to stand there and listen to the judge explain to him that hes going to spend at least fifteen years in a tenbytwenty cell when he came to me he said fred i hear good things boutchu you get me off you do that you get me off he laughed and slapped his chest hey ididnt get him off hes not happy and he and his friends are killers what im saying is boggss in danger im in danger think about it youre in danger too you re the one saying the cops the prosecutor and your own networkre a bunch of dickheads life is dangerous what can i say megler looked at his watch time to do my bit to beautify america and get some more garbage off the street ive got an offer rune said the lawyer looked over his shoulder make it fast you dont keep drug lords waiting she said you know how many people watchcurrent events no and i dont know the average annual rainfall in the amazon either do i care he started up the stairs depends on whether or not you want ten million people to see your name and face and hear what kind of incredible work you do fred megler stopped rune repeated ten million megler glanced at the courthouse door he muttered something to himself and walked back down the steps me okay i was born in atlanta and we lived there for ten years before our daddy decided he was going to the land of greater opportunity which was the way he put it and i can still remember him saying that from inside a thirteeninch japanese television monitor the color unbalanced too heavy in red randy boggs was telling his life story greater opportunity i was scared because i thought we were going to die because i got greater opportunity confused with promised land which i remembered from day of the ascension baptist church meant heaven at the time i was close to eleven and religious okay i got myself into some pretty fair scrapes at school somebody some older kidd cuss jesus christ and id get madder n a damp cat and make him say he was sorry and what happened was i got the hell beat out of me more times n i can recall or care to editing videotape was a hundred times easier than film it was an electronic not mechanical process and rune thought that this represented some incredible advancement in civilization going from things that you could see how they worked to things that you couldnt see what made them tick rune liked this because it was similar to magic which she believed in the only difference being that with magic you didnt need batteries the ease of editing though didnt solve her problem that she had so much good tape thousands and thousands of feet this particular footage was from the first time shed interviewed boggs and it was all so pithy that she had no idea what to cut anyway it wasnt heaven we ended up in but miami and some opportunity thatturned out to be man that was just like daddy this was right after batista and the place was lousy with cubans for years i didnt like you know spanish people but that was stupid cause a few years ago i went down to central america the only time i was ever out of the country and i loved it anyway i was talking about before when i was a kid and i saw these wealthy cubans who were no longer wealthy and thats the saddest kind of man there is you can see that loss in his walk and the way he looks at the car hes driving now which isn t nearly so nice as the kind he used to have but what happened was they begun sucking up the jobs us white folks oughta ve been having not that i mean it in a racial way but these cubans worked for next to nothing they had to just to get work and feed their families which were huge ive never seen so many little shifters in one family i thought my daddy was bad hed practically roll over on momma and bang she was carrying home i had six sisters and two brothers and i lost a brother in nam and a sister to ovarian cancer daddy had a head for mechanics but he never applied himself im just the opposite you pay me and ill sweat for you i like the feel of working my muscles get all nervous when i dont work but i have problems with calculating my daddy was out of work many days running my eldest brother signed up marines and i was coming up on sixteen so naturally i considered doing the same but started working instead the careers of randy boggs warehouse picker then carny hawker then ride operator then sweeper at a piggly wiggly then selling hot dogs on the highway near cape kennedy where he saw the apollo moon launching and thought he might like to be a pilot then a stock boy then fisherman then janitor then cook then thief iwas to clearwater once with boonie that was my brother what i called him and a friend from the service and we went to this drivein and they were talking about the money they were making and how boonie was going to buy himself a bulltaco motorcycle the kind with the low handlebars and here i was oh heavens i was nineteen and my brother had to pay my way into the theater i was pretty embarrassed by that so that night they went to a well you know whorehouse which wasn t all that easy to find in clearwater and they let me keep the car for a couple hours what i did i was feeling so bad about being busted flat i drove back to the drivein which was just closing up and i did this distraction set fire to some brush near the screen and when everybody ran out to see what was going on i ran into the booth and was going to grab the money only what happened was there was no money itd been packed up and taken somewhere already probably the night deposit at the bank i run out right into one of the owners im a thin man now and i was a thin boy then and he saw what was happening and laid me right out you know what they got me for i have to laugh now they couldn t arrest me for stealing and they couldnt arrest me for burglary they arrested me for arson for burning a plant that wasnt more n a weed you believe that the tapes went on and on and on endlessly the format of thecurrent events stories made runes job tough piper sutton insisted that she herself be on camera for a good portion of each segment most of the story would be the interviews rune was now editing but every three minutes or so would be a cut back to sutton who would continue with the story reading off a teleprompter then back to more tapes the crime scene atmosphere footage interviews the bennett frost revelation coordinating everything the voiceover and the dialogue on the tape segments and piper suttons script was overwhelming and lee maisel had warned her if you put a mixed metaphor or string of sibilants into her mouth not even god can help you but so what if it was tough rune was ecstatic here she was three in the morning courtney and a stuffed bear dozing near her feet editing tape into what was going to be a sensational news story on the numberonerated primetime newsmagazine on network television best of all the story would get seen by ten million people who unless they made a snack or john run immediately after the fade out would also see her name and she considered for a moment the best part of all shed be responsible for getting an innocent man released from prison a man whose muscles got nervous when he couldnt move prometheus about to be unbound the conference room the legendary conference room on the fortieth floor of the networks skyscraper it was here that the executives and senior newsmen planned the special coverage for martin luther kings assassination and bobby kennedys and nixons resignation and the taking of the hostages in iran and thechallenger explosion it didnt look very impressive yellowpainted walls a chipped and stained oval table and ten swivel chairs whose upholstery had faded to babyblue from the parent company cerulean but the shabbiness didnt detract from the fact that history had been chronicled and sometimes even made in this room rune paused outside the teak door bradford simpson who hadnt been invited to the meeting handed her the files hed helped carry from her desk break aleg he said and gave her a kiss on the cheek one that lasted a bit longer than your standard goodluck buss she thought he disappeared back to the lowly newsroom rune looked inside lee maisel and piper sutton sat at the table behind them was a map of the world with red stickers showing where the network had permanent bureaus no more than a couple inches of space separated any of the red dots except in the oceans and at the north and south poles this was a room rune never thought shed be in when shed applied at the network for a job as assistant cameraman theyd told her there was no chance to move into news producing stories herself those slots were all reserved for newsmen with experience or star journalism school students but here she was a line producer working for lee maisel and holding in her nervous hands a draft script one shed actually written for piper sutton rune fought down the assault of anxiety she shifted the huge stacks of notes and tapes from one arm to the other her heart was beating wildly and her palms left sweaty stains on the black cassettes she held sutton noticed her and nodded her in come on she said abruptly whatre you waiting for maisel gave rune a fast distracted glance lets get on with it sutton said lets see the script come on rune distributed them and they both read in silence except for the tapping of piper suttons gold cross pen impatient on the table stonefaced they skimmed the sixteen pages first sutton then maisel slid the sheets into the center of the table all right sutton said why is it so important that you do this story this was right out of left field rune hadnt expected a question like that she swallowed looked at maisel but he didnt offer anything she thought for a moment and began to speak sheknew better than she couldsay words goddamn words again as she responded to sutton a lot of uhms and what i means slipped in she corrected herself said the same things twice she sounded defensive she tried to look into suttons eyes as she spoke but that just turned her mind to jam words came out about justice and journalisms responsibility which was all true but rune didnt of course tell sutton one tiny piece of the answer she never once said why am i dying to do this story because part of me wants to be you i want to be tall and have crisp blonde hair that stays where put it and walk on high heels and not look like a klutz i want presidents of networks and corporations to look at me with envy and lust i want a mind thats as cool and sharp as a black belts body i want to try your kind of power not mine not like magic in fairy stories but the power to cast the strongest kind of spells the ones that make it seem like you know exactly what to do every minute exactly what to say but she talked about the press about innocence about boggs when shed finished she sat back sutton must have been satisfied with the response she said all right let me ask you a few specific questions these were even worse though because they were about things rune should have thought of herself did you interview the original crime scene team good idea never occurred to herdid you talk to any of boggss earlier lawyers rune didnt know hed had anydid he ever see a shrink about his criminal tendencies she never asked the three of them debated for ten minutes and in the end both maisel and sutton nodded and said that the program should go forward as long as the show didnt claim boggs was innocent only that there were some serious questions about his guilt that left only the question of when the story should air they asked her opinion rune cleared her throat shuffled papers then said next weeks show maisel said no seriously and the battle began the thing is rune said hes got to get out of prison as soon as possible they dont like him in there theyve already tried to kill him i told you that sutton said they whos they other prisoners maisel asked why i dont know a guard told me he isnt popular hes a loner he todays friday maisel barked rune to air next tuesday the whole program should have been shot and edited by now it has to be in the computer by monday that just cant be done i dont think hell last another week they tried to kill him once and theyll try again sutton and maisel looked at each other sutton looked back to her and said our job is to report the news not save anybodys ass boggs gets killed the storys still valid we could thats a horrible thing to say oh come off it sutton said maisel said pipers right rune the story is the important thing not springing a prisoner and i dont see how we can do it there just isnt time the scripts all written she said and ive spent the last three nights editing ive got everything timed to the second the second sutton said in a tired sigh maisel said piperd have to tape on sunday night or monday morning in a soft spiny voice rune said i want the story to air next week she folded her hands and put them in her lap they both looked at her rune continued whats going to happen if somebody finds out that we could have saved his life and we just didnt get around to doing the story in time silence as sutton and maisel exchanged glances maisel broke the tension asking the anchorwoman what do you think rune felt her teeth squeeze together with tension sutton responded by asking what else was scheduled for that show the arabs in queens maisel said its half edited i never liked that story rune offered sutton shrugged its soft news i hate soft news she was frowning apparently because she found herself agreeing with rune my story isnt rune said its hard news sutton said i suppose youll want a credit for ten million people to see you bet i do the anchorwoman continued but that name of yours youll have to change it not to worry rune said i have a professional name a professional name maisel was fighting to keep down the smile irene dodd simons is that your real name the anchorwoman asked sort of sutton said sort of and shook her head then added at least it sounds like the name of somebody who knows what shes doing she pulled her personal calendar out of her purse the scents of perfume and suede followed it okay honey first well get together and do a script a script rune blinked but its all finished she nodded at the sheets in front of them sutton laughed no babes i mean areal script well meet at sixthirty tomorrow morning in thecurrent events newsroom runes first thought was shit a babysitter wherem i going to get a sitter she smiled and said six if you want sixthirtyll be fine you dont have a right to talk on the phone but they usually let you a privilege not a right one day boggsd heard some prisoner yelling gimme the phone we got rights a guard had answered pretty politely under the circumstances you got what we give you asshole but maybe because boggs had been knifed or maybe because he wasnt a punk or just maybe because it was a nice warm day the guard in charge of the mail and telephone room sent somebody to find him so he could take the call randy how you feeling rune asked that you miss you out of the infirmary kicked my butt out yesterday no pain to speak of unless i stretch i read that story in the book you give me i like it dont think i look much like him though and if i ever stole fire from the gods i sure dont know a fence whod handle it he paused and she laughed like she knew she was supposed to thinking hed probably spent a good amount of time thinking up the joke which he had guess what she asked dont know i found a new witness new witness sure did well my tell me about it she did from start to finish all about bennett frost and randy boggs didnt utter a single word the entire time she was speaking in fact not a single syllable or grunt or even it seemed a breath when she was through there was silence for a long moment well she said youre not saying anything im grinning though ill tell you that damn i cant believe it you done yourself something miss whats going to happen now is im going to try to get the program on the air next week megler said that if he gets his name and picture on the air hell do the motion for a new trial for free mr megler said that it hurt him to i could see the pain but he said he would he said if the judge buys it and grants the motion you could be out right away the judge might not grant it though i suppose fred said that having the program oncurrent events would really help the judged be like more inclined to release you especially if he was up for reelection well damn goddamn what do i do now you just take care of yourself for the next week dont go getting knifed anymore no maam one thing what you did silence i guess im trying to say thank you i guess you just did after they hung up randy boggs the grin still on his face left the administration building to go find severn washington and tell him the news as boggs left the building another prisoner a short colombian followed then overtook him prisoners like this were what used to be called trusties in the prisons of the forties and fifties and were now generally known as pricks or assholes or scum hed just had a short conversation with the guard he worked for the guard who randomly monitored prisoners phone conversations the prisoner smiled at boggs saidbuenos dias and walked ahead not hearing what boggs said in reply he didnt particularly care what the response was he was in a hurry he wanted to get to juan ascipio as soon as he could rune decided shed found a great new drug one that was completely legal and cheap it was called awake and you didnt even take it all you did was not sleep for thirty hours straight and it sent you right on the most excellent psychedelic trip you could imagine gremlins climbed out of the sony dragons swooped down from redhead lights and trolls had abandoned bridges and were foxtrotting on the misty dance floor of her desk weird amoeba were floating everywhere it was sixpm on tuesday and the reason for the hallucinations and sleeplessness was a small plastic cassette containing a oneinch videotape master of a news story to be shown in a few hours on that nightscurrent events program the story was called easy justice the voiceovers were mixed the leads and countdown added the live portions of piper suttons commentary added the tape which ran the exact time allocated for the segment rested somewhere in the bowels of the networks computer system which acted like a brilliant neversleeping stage manager and would start the segment rolling exactly on time at pm the system would then automatically broadcast the randy boggs story for its precise length of eleven minutes fourteen seconds which was the networks version of a quarter hour a bit shorter than in edward r murrows time but back then each additional minute of advertising didnt mean another halfmillion dollars in revenue the way it did today rune squinted away a few apparitions and sat back in her chair the last few days had been a nightmare piper sutton had been satisfactionproof whats this what do you call this shed shouted pacing back and forth behind rune who sat terrified willing her hands not to shake as she typed is this supposed to be fuckingpoetry is it supposed to beart sutton would walk another ten feet leaving behind a wake of cigarette smoke and chanel no nothing shed write could please sutton is that a fact is it supported whos your attribution what the fuck is this a figure of speech justice is like a lumbering bear sure i know alot of lumbering bears our audience is really going to relate to lumbering bears just look out on broadway rune you see many bears come on babes rune would write some more then sutton would lean over and look at the word processor screen focusing on the words like a sniper here let me sutton would say and practically elbow rune aside tap tap tap the delete code would chop another dozen sentences suttons nails never chipped they were like red kevlar but finally the story was finished sutton and maisel approved the completed script monday night the twentyeighth draft sutton had recorded her oncamera portions and sent those to editing along with the clips from runes interviews and atmosphere footage as she was leaving the studio tuesday morning at oneam rune asked her you like always spend this kind of time with producers no i dontlike spend this kind of time most producers can spell oh now though rune had nothing to do but try to stay awake and watch the show itself while she fought the sensation that she was levitating there were a couple options her first choice she wanted to be home watching it with healy but hed gone to investigate a package sitting in front of an abortion clinic in brooklyn another possibility there was a bar not far from the houseboat rune was a regular there and everybody there would be glad to watch her program fortunately this was tuesday so no monday night sports programs would create difficult choices for some of the regulars but that involved standing up and walking somewhere which at the moment was a feat rune believed she was incapable of so she sat where she was at her desk there was a nice color monitor in front of her and maybe just maybe piper and lee would come and join her theyd all watch the show together and theyd tell her what a good job shed done then take her out for a drink at some fancy bar afterwards her thoughts shifted and she found she was thinking of randy boggs she hoped the guards were letting him watchcurrent events that thought sounded funny lettinghim watch like when she was a kid and shed begged her parents to let her stay up to read more fairy stories or watch tv hey rune she looked up thinking the hallucinations were getting stranger some heavyset guy was disattaching himself from a camera and coming toward her how did he do that like the monster inmien climbing out of the pipes to eat sigourney weaver rune he said again she squinted it was morrie weinberg the chief engineer of the show he wore engineer clothes blue jeans and a black shirt and a tweed jacket morrie she said he was frowning the first time shed ever seen him do this engineers are usually rolaidspoppers but morrie didnt understand the concept of stress she had an image of him as a lumbering bear and she wanted to laugh out loud whats up your segment she giggled uhhuh what happened his voice fluttered the humor was leaving quickly happened jesus how come you didnt get your segment in easy justice it shouldve gone into the computer by three it was already a day late wehad to have it there by three you know that her eyes swept around the studio was he saying what she was hearing i did i gave it to charlie around four but he said that was all right morrie looked at a clipboard this is a problem it aint in there now we got eleven minutes of blank airtime starting at eightohfourthirtysix check again her voice was edged with panic i just did check five minutes ago check again check again no laughing no lumbering bears no amoebae adrenaline had wakened her completely morrie shrugged and made a call he held his hand over the mouthpiece and said to her zip how did it happen the way it usually happens is the producer doesnt get the tape in on time but igot it in she ran through her vague memory she didnt think shed screwed up it was too major a mistake even for her it was like the pilot forgetting to lower the airplanes wheels before landing anyway there were other tapes she had a dupe of the final cut this was an inconvenience not a tragedy her hands were shaking morrie listened into the phone again he looked up and said to her all right your butt is safe so far charlie says he remembers you delivering it he put it in the computer but somehow its vanished you have a dupe sure he said into the phone well get another one up to you in five minutes he hung up thiss never happened before thank you dear lord for dupes the gratitude was premature the dupe was missing too runes voice was shrill in panic i put it there on my desk she pointed frantically to an empty corner oh man i put it rightthere he stared skeptically at the bald spot she said im not making this up rough cuts morrie was looking at his watch shit we dont have time but we maybe she opened a drawer oh no she muttered breathlessly he said theyre gone too rune was nodding she couldnt speak oh boy oh shit eleven minutes of blank air thiss never happened before thiss never happened then she thought of something else and ripped open her credenza theoriginal tape shed done of bennett frost the new witness and the dupe ofthat were also gone all that remained of the story about randy boggs were scripts and notes and background interview tapes weve been robbed rune whispered she looked around in panic feeling a terrible sense of violation who was it she looked at morrie whod you see on the set today whod i see he echoed shrilly a dozen reporters a hundred staffers that intern kid with the blond hair who was helping you with the story piper was here jim eustice dan semple i mean half the network walked through here today morries eyes strayed uneasily toward the phone and she knew what he was thinking somebody had to call piper sutton the large quartz wall clock timed for all rune knew to the pulse of the universe showed that they had fortyfour minutes until to air fortyfour minutes until it became the first primetime television program in history to air eleven minutes and fourteen seconds of blank space the only thing that kept piper sutton from exploding through the double doors into the newsroom was the live broadcast ofnighttime news with jim eustice the networks flagship world news show now onair thirty feet behind rune but still she stormed up to runes desk during the broadcast the veteran anchorman was so damn reassuring and smooth that even the crew enjoyed watching him tonight though only the head engineer and the producer kept their eyes on his craggy square face everyone else in the huge studio gazed at sutton and maisel as they hurried toward thecurrent events desks like surgeons answering a code blue what the fuck happened sutton asked in a shrill whisper i dont know rune felt the tears start she dug her short nails into her palms furiously with the pain the urge to cry lessened somebody robbed me they took everything maisel looked at the clock above the control booth we dont haveanything nothing at all i dont know what happened i turned the tape in morrie said delicately she did charlie got it he programmed it in sometime after four it disappeared son of a bitch how long was that segment morrie consulted his clipboard but rune answered from memory eleven minutes fourteen sutton whispered furiously you should always make backups you should i did they were stolen too everything even the original tapes fuck sutton spat out then she turned to maisel whose mind must have been in the same place and known what she was thinking there were three other stories programmed forcurrent events that evening but maisel said they had nothing else finished that could be used as a replacement for easy justice he said well have to cancel the show can we go with arabs in queens she asked he said we never finished editing we stopped all postpro for the boggs story what about the formermayor profile mostly unshot and a lot of unattributed quotes its legally hot the guardian angels piece she snapped weve got footage but theres no script its outlined well in general but i know the story she waved her hand well do that what do you mean maisel asked frowning do what we do the original three stories plus the guardian angels maisels voice rasped piper well have to cancel we can slot a rerun he turned to morrie and started to say something but she said lee a rerun of a news show well go with the angels i dont understand what youre saying piper we dont have a script we dont have footage of you we well go live she said live yep maisel looked at morrie its too late isnt it he answered calmly we cant do half and half we can shut off the computer and queue up the tapes by hand using a stopwatch like in the old days youll have to be live in all of your oncamera commentary hell the commercials too and you know how many fifteensecond buys there are duringcurrent events itll be a nightmare then itll be a nightmare the anchor woman said but piper maisel said we can slot something else she said evenly lee every tv guide cable guide and newspaper in america shows that were running a newcurrent events tonight you know what kind of questions itll raise about the program if we go to a rerun or slip in something from syndication well say technical difficulties there are no technical difficulties on my show piper rune began but sutton didnt even hear her she and maisel hurried off and rune uninvited stayed behind in her cubicle she curled up in her chair the way courtney did sometimes drawing her legs up she thought of all the work shed have to do over again she felt numbed stunned like somebody had died uhuh she thought like someone wasabout to die randy boggs at pm lee maisel was sitting in the huge control booth overlooking thecurrent events set the booth was filled with three times its normal staff most of whom were from the jim eustice crew and had experience with the rare and demanding art of live production maisel hadnt done live producing for years and he sat forward sweating and uneasy like the captain of a torpedoed ship still doing battle with an enemy destroyer he was holding an expensive digital stopwatch in his hand gripping it tightly maisel and sutton had managed to write half the guardian angels piece and get it handwritten into the teleprompter but at theyd had to break off so sutton had said ill adlib maisel called over the loudspeaker you got a tensecond countdown and a fivesecond cheat sutton in full makeup under the hot lights gave him a fast nod and sat down in the black leather chair behind the desk bearing thecurrent events logo a technician clipped the lavaliere mike onto her lapel and inserted the small earphone into her left ear the one hidden under the flop of hair where it was less visible and no one would absently think she was wearing a hearing aid maisel called all right this is it she gave another nod and fixed her eyes on the teleprompter that a floor producer pointed at in the control booth lee maisel shut off the loud speaker and began talking into the microphone that would carry his words to suttons and the rest of the crews earphones he glanced at the big clock on the control room wall and began counting down seven six five four three two one graphics up now theme running exactly four seconds later he said graphics dissolve camera one fade in theme down okay piper youre on piper suttons eyes locked directly into those of ten million people she gave a sincere smile and said in the low comforting voice that so many people had come to trust more than that of their own spouses parents children and friends good evening welcome tocurrent events for tuesday april twentieth im piper sutton the program began exactly fiftysix minutes later the credits rolling at a breakneck pace viewers around the country stood or stretched arguing about some of the stories or critiquing piper suttons fashion selection of the week or wondering which sitcom to turn to now all unaware that theyd just seen tv history morrie weinberg oversaw the passing of the scepter back to the computer and the fiftymilliondollar system began sending the spurious art of television advertising into american households as soon as the studio mikes were shut off the newsroom applauded sutton was far too diplomatic to ignore it and she gave a brief smile and offered a bow not a curtsy to her audience maisel left the booth and walked straight up to her hugging her and kissing her on the cheek both dan semple and jim eustice had been watching from the control booth they now joined her eustice shook her hand formally and complimented her then left with maisel semple kissed sutton quickly and the two of them walked into the corridor not a single one of them glanced at rune who sat in her desk chair and stared at the monitor where her program would have run the next morning courtney woke her up by climbing into bed can we go to the zoo rune had collected the girl just after the program was over the night before theyd gone home had tuna sandwiches for dinner and raisin bran for dessert they both went to bed at ten rune rolled over and sat up the what the zoo first coffee then well think about the zoo i want some juice coffees icky rune was feeling better now that shed gotten some sleep the horror of last night had faded true the tapes had been stolen but there were some upsides to whatd happened for one thing it was clear proof that somebody else had killed hopper randy obviously hadnt stolen the tapes the real killer must have also there was now another dimension to the story somebodys breaking into a major television network studio and stealing a news program that was a story in itself anyway it turned out that the damage wasnt as bad as shed thought all that was missing was the master tape and the dupes and the tape of bennett frost bradford bless his heart had managed to find copies of almost everything else the program could be remixed from that material although shed have to retape bennett frost what worried her most was that randy was still in danger but then she wondered if maybe the story didnt have to run to get his release process started true the impact wouldnt be so neat her story actually getting him released but what had her goal been anyway to get him out no current events could easily redo the story after he was released that might be a nice touch shed add footage of him wandering around new york a free man maybe reuniting with his brother or sisters in the galley rune poured cranberry juice for courtney and made her some instant oatmeal i want to go to the zoo okay honey well try but theres something i have to do first were going to go visit somebody a man who is he is he a nice man not really rune said and looked up fred meglers address in her book poker megler said i thought there was that show running last night what happened i missed poker to stay home i really hate to miss poker he lifted up a series of soda cans looking for one that was full it got stolen stolen somebody stole a tv show the tape it got lifted no shit then he winced and glanced at courtney shit the little girl said rune said im going to do the story over again but i was thinking maybe you could start the the what do you call it to get randy out the motion papers right i thought you could get mr frost to go into court and she paused meglers face was blank for a moment you didnt hear hear what the accident his voice thin as his body rose sounding as if everybody in the city were supposed to know oh no rune closed her eyes what happened frost slipped in the bathtub he drowned what oh god when did it happen a couple days ago megler found a nearly full can of diet pepsi his face brightened at the discovery sure is a good thing you made that tape of him otherwise wed be up he glanced at courtney you know which creek without a paddle allah tells us those who do good will find the best reward in heaven and more neither dust nor ignominy touch their faces such are the rightful owners of the garden and they will abide therein late thursday morning severn washington was waiting for randy boggs to come out of the library he sat on a concrete step and read the koran he frequently did this like praying five times a day and ritual washing and forsaking liquor and pork reading the holy book gave him great personal satisfaction he kept it with him at all times the typeface of the copy he owned was dense under the repeated touch of his huge nubby fingers the delicate onionskin paper of the small volume had become even more translucent than when it was new he liked that he had an image of allah reaching down and making the book more and more invisible every time washington read it eventually it would become transparent would become just a spirit vanished and gone to heaven and then washington would follow and his sins all of them the liquor store shooting in particular would be forgiven his new life would begin washington didnt want to go too fast however there were certain aspects of his present life that hed come to enjoy even here in harrison prison life wasnt much different from that in his prior residence instead of a brick project he had a stone cell block to live in a building that wasnt graffitied and didnt smell of shit instead of his commonlaw wifes bland macaroni and chicken and potatoes he had the department of correctionss bland macaroni and hamburger and potatoes instead of hanging out on the street and doing occasional construction work he hung out in the yard and worked in the machine shop instead of getting dissed and threatened by dealers and gangs who had macs he got dissed and threatened by the aryan brotherhood who had clubs and shivs on the whole it wasbetter inside maybe you didnt get paychecks but you didntneed paychecks like when you were doing straight time he had friends like randy boggs he had his koran no couldnt complain he looked down at his holy book once more if allah afflict thee with some hurt there is none who can remove it save him if he desireth good for thee there is none who can repel his bounty he the sentiment in that passage was the last thought severn washington ever had and the last sound he ever heard was the hiss of the steel barbell pole that swung into the back of his head he didnt even live long enough to hear the delicate flutter of his koran as it pitched from his convulsing fingers and lay open on dirt the book which it turned out wasnt going to precede washington into heaven after all the conversation was hushed whatever you thinking man fuck it said juan ascipio we had to do the nigger i told you he was talking rapidly to one of his hispanic brothers in the area beside the library where theyd just dragged washingtons body we move on boggs put the bar in his hand and knife in the niggers looks like the nigger wanted to fuck boggs and boggs moved on him and then the nigger did boggs i know man the second man said hey im not saying nothing you dont look happy man but it had to be that way yeah its just man theyknow its us fuck ascipio spat out what they know aint what they can prove after the first time man they know its us he coulda talked motherfucker didnt talk he coulda said who it was did him he didnt say nothing ascipio laughed yeah a third man loped back to them boggs hes in there by hisself ascipio laughed again randy boggs liked the library reading was one of those things you dont think anything of until you actually did it when he was outside there were some things hed do for the peace of it like sitting with a quart of beer for the evening listening to cicadas and owls and the surf of leaves and the click of branches that was something he could do practically forever which seemed like doing nothing but was actually one of the most important ways a man could spend time that was how he now looked at reading most of the books here were pretty bad somebody a school he guessed had donated a lot of textbooks sociology and psychology and statistics and economics boring as dry toast if that was what people learned in college no wonder nobody seemed to have any smarts and some of the novels were a bit much the older ones and the library here seemed to have mostly s and s books were pretty dense man he couldnt make heads or tails out of them he had to slug his way through just like the way hed clean a floor scrape then sweep then mop then rinse inch by inch then he found some newer ones catch which he thought was really okay he grinned for five minutes straight after finishing that one then somebody mentioned kurt vonnegut and although there were none of his books in the prison library a guard hed become friendly with gave him a copy ofcats cradle and a couple others as well whenever he saw the guard hed wink and say so it goes boggs loved paul therouxs travel writing he also tried john cheever he didnt like the short stories but the novel about prison really struck home sure it was about prison but it was about somethingmore than prison that seemed to be the sign of a good book to be about something but about something more too even if you didnt know exactly what the book that girl reporter had given him wasnt so good hed decided the writing was oldfashioned and he had to read some sentences three four times in order to figure out what was going on but he kept at it and would pull it out occasionally and read some more he wanted to finish it but the reason was so he could talk about it with rune that got him thinking about that girl again and he wondered why her program hadnt run on tuesday rune hadnt called to say anything about it but then he wasnt sure what day shed said maybe shed meant a week from tuesday shed probably said next tuesday instead of this tuesday boggs always got confused with next and this damn that girl was something else here hed spent months and months trying to figure out how to get out of prison thinking of escaping thinking of getting sick thinking of appealing and then here she comes and does it for him and it doesnt cost him anything in grief or money he and that was when he heard the noise and felt the first hum of fear the prison itself was old but the library was a newer addition away from the cell blocks it looked and smelled like a suburban school there was only one door in and out he looked around the library was completely deserted and he understood that the word had gone around no other prisoners no guards no clerk behind the desk hed been reading away and hadnt noticed everybody else leaving oh hell boggs heard the slow footsteps of several men coming up the corridor toward that one door he knew severn washington was outside and he knew too that the big black man was as loyal as a friend could be in prison but that was a big qualifier in prison inside anybody can be bought and when it comes right down to it anybody can be killed boggs still had no idea why ascipio wanted to move on him but it was clear he was marked no doubt in his mind and right now hearing footsteps come closer to the door he knew not a premonition or anything like heknew something was going down he stood up instinctively the possibilities for weapons were a book or a chair well now neither of thems much help at all oh he didnt want the knife again that terrible feeling of the glass blade terrible he looked at the chair he couldnt pull it apart and when he tried to lift it a searing pain from the first knifing swept through his back and side he tried again and managed to get the chair off the ground holding it in both hands then part of his mind said why bother theyd burst in theyd circle around him theyd take him hed die what could he do swing a chair at them knock one of them off balance while the others easily stepped behind him so randall boggs failed son of a failed father simply sat down in the chair in front of a fiberboard table in a shoddy prison library and began thinking for some reason suddenly and obsessively about atlanta and the sunday dinner menu of his childhood from his pocket he took out the book the reporter girl had given him and put his hands on it as if it were a bible then he thought that was funny because probably to the oldtime people the old greeks or romans or whatever this myth book probablywas a bible prometheus got freed but it didnt seem like this was going to be a replay of that story not here not now the footsteps stopped and he heard mumbled voices randy boggs swallowed and tried to remember a prayer he couldnt so he just swallowed again and tried not to think about the pain the door swung open hey boggs he blinked staring boggs come on haul ass he stood up and walked toward the guard he opened his mouth to say something but nothing came out which was just as well because he didnt know what to say anyway lets move it along boggs whats up the guard had drowsy eyes and a voice to match the warden wants to see you hustle it you got yourself a pretty little girl fred megler said to randy boggs the lawyer was trooping around the office he couldnt sit still and was on some kind of energy trip randy boggs was sitting forward in a chair in meglers office his hands pressed tightly together as if theyd been manacled he wore blue jeans and a blue denim work shirt clothing hed worn when hed entered the prison three years before rune sitting nearby smelled mothballs little girl yessir boggs was nodding a lot agreeing with what everybody said but at the little girl part he looked questioningly at rune who launched courtney toward him boggss hands reached out and she gave him a shy hug daddy she said and looked at rune to see if shed gotten the line right rune nodded at her smiling then said to boggs mr megler didnt know that you had a little girl that was one of the reasons he was so nice to help you even though the program hasnt run yet yeah boggs said squinting to see if that helped him understand things any better it didnt seem to sure appreciate it megler paced his polyester tie with the bic repair job flopped up and down on the baggy shirt where his belly would have been if he weighed forty pounds more his hair jutted out behind his thin skull as if he were facing into a gale he said so heres the deal the young lady here had some pretty good evidence that wouldve gotten you out but seems some asshole he looked at courtney but she was playing with daddys shoelaces and missed the word someperson got into the studio and stole it that was strike one then oh you shouldve seen it rune interrupted it was a really great story randy it wouldve gotten you out in a minute i did the fades just perfect the sound was mixed like a symphony and i had a really really super shot of your mother mom you did he grinned what kind of stuffd she say didnt make a lot of sense i have to tell you but she looked real motherish yeah thats one thing she does good megler said you guys mind courtney pointed her tiny index finger at him like a pistol and fired it was a game shed decided they should play he smiled grudgingly at her and shot back she clutched her chest and fell to the floor seemed to hope shed play dead for a long time rune preempted the lawyer you know who did it you know who the killer was uhm if i knew that boggs shrugged it was the guy who picked you up who did it jimmy boggs was shaking his head i dont know about that wait wait wait runes legs bounced in the chair ill tell you why i know in a minute but see everything got stolen by jimmy he somehow found out about the story i kind of told a reporter about it and there was this newspaper story so i think he read it and came to town to stop the program courtney revived and climbed up into her lap anyway i came here to tell fred that the evidence had been stolen we felt awful didnt we court awful yeah the little girl said megler said and i told this young lady that not having the tape or the second witness rune interrupted to explain about bennett frosts death boggs was frowning got himself killed medical examiner says it was an accident but who knows megler said wanting to take the stage again anyway with him dead it wasnt looking too good but what with you having a cute little girl you have to support megler missed the glance boggs shot rune and the sweep of her eyes across the grimed ceiling i thought we could make a good case in court i got a deposition from the first witness ms breckman who admitted that most of her id was based on seeing you on tvafter youd been arrested then he paused dramatically i got a special ex parte hearing and presented my new secret witness boggs cocked his head you found yourselfanother witness rune bowed me i put rune on the stand for frosts testimony frost told her what he saw about this other guy killing hopper normally thats hearsay and wouldnt be admissible but since frost is dead she can testify about what frost said she said oh i was great do you solemnly swear megler said i also let slip the fact that she was a reporter forcurrent events i mean justice is one thing but media forget about it the judge practically made sure she had the correct spelling of his name rune said and poof he released you from the bench megler said solemnly dont happen too often that way im free pending the prosecutors decision on a new trial theyll probably just let it drop but you have to stay in new york city until they decide you can travel if you tell the das office but you cant leave the state my dear lord boggs said i dont know what to say he leaned forward and shyly kissed runes cheek then he stood up and walked to the window megler said youve earned yourself the right to walk through the slime of new york just like anybody else now you got any money they give me some when i came out not a lot megler was opening up his wallet a wad of twenties appeared a couple hundred bucks worth he aimed it toward boggs who shook his head no sir thank you anyway its a loan is all it is come on pay me back when you can ha you dont ill sue your butt boggs was blushing as he took the money and he put it into his pocket as quickly as possible megler was giving him advice about getting jobs what sort of work to look for boggs looked solemn for a moment something id like to do a friend of mine got himself killed in prison id like to go see his family up in harlem you look like youre asking permission megler said you want to go just go yeah i could i guess sure i wasnt thinking then boggs was saying he had to look for a hotel room no first some food then a room no first he wanted to walk down what was that street there boggs pointed out the window over there broadway megler answered i want to walk down broadway rune corrected actually youd probably be walkingup broadway from here up broadway and i want to stop and go into some of those stores plenty to choose from the lawyer offered shitty merchandise overpriced shitty courtney echoed and check out some other streets too and nobodys going to tell me not to not a soul in the world boggs was grinning rune said ive got some tapes left but ill have to interview you again i want to start as soon as possible boggs laughed well you dont hardly have to even ask theres only one thing id ask first sure you think we might rustle up some beer its been a while and ive really got me a taste the plastic bag rang like sleigh bells it contained a heineken a moosehead a grolsch two budweisers not the best by a long shot but it was my first mind if i get a couple for you know sentimental reasons a tecate and a sixpack of corona rune had also bought some amstel but randy boggs had never drunk light beer in his life dont believe id like to celebrate my freedom with something like that they turned onto christopher street and aimed themselves at the hudson waiting for the stoplight to change when it did they crossed the wide west side highway courtney holding tight to runes hand and looking left and right the way shed taught the little girl boggs asked uh whered we be going he looked uncertainly toward the deserted waterfront rune felt southern when she was with boggs and she answered yonder he looked at where she was nodding and laughed there they walked up the yellow gangplank to the houseboat boggs grinning and looking around him you dont need me to say anything bout it i suppose you live on one of these you musta heard all kindsa comments by now inside boggs walked from room to room shyly inspecting hed carefully touch the stuffed animals the scraps of lace rune draped over lamps the rosy and blue magic crystals her books hed laugh occasionally as he tried to figure out something an eyelash curler or a broken antique apple parer that rune bought because she thought it was a medieval weapon in the kitchen she put the beers away and fixed the food theyd bought crispyfried cheetos and cans of refried bean dip and little shrimp cocktails in jars with pryoff lids i love these things and you can use the jars for juice glasses later juice said courtney rune poured ocean spray for the girl then filled a winniethepooh dish with bean dip and handed her a spoon this is ugly the girl said looking into it yes it is but she took the utensil and began to pick up bits of dip and wad it onto the spoon shes showing off for guests rune said to boggs court you know how she added sternly ugly food she scrunched her nose up but began to eat properly napkin rune reminded her and courtney picked a paper napkin out of a stack in the center of the table and placed it on her lap she resumed eating boggs watched them youre kinda young to be a mother whos the father he laughed other than me i mean long story she then said what kind of beer you like to start with believe ill start with a bud buy american when i went inside three years ago thats what everybody was saying buy american but nobody makes beer like mexicans ill save that corona for dessert come on over here rune led him out to the deck where they could have some privacy but she could still watch courtney i didnt want to say anything in there in front of her she told him how claire had abandoned the girl boggs shook his head i dont think i ever met anybody whod do something like that claires totally immature i never had me any kids he grinned not that i know of anyway not so there was a paternity suit rune said me with a kid she shook her head you dont know me that well but its definitely role reversal looks to me like you two get along pretty good though runes eyes were dancing oh shes the best i always thought kids were like completely obnoxious you know they go through this phase where they cant talk they have to screech and they dont eat they just barf but what it is ive figured this out theyre just like adults some days theyre in good moods some days theyre in bitchy moods and can we talk we walk all over the place and i tell her things she understands our minds kind of work alike rune glanced at courtney shes going to be just like me when she grows up i know naturalmothers who dont sound that happy with their kids boggs was tasting the bud like it was vintage wine rune offered him the bag of cheetos he shook his head he said must be nice having someone to live with i had me a couple girlfriends various times but i was never married i dont know itd be pretty strange for me i think living with somebody when you dont have to inside you dont have any choice of course inside in prison oh sure well i usually have roommates theyre sort of a necessary evil in new york with what rents go for but ive lived by myself a lot ive gotten used to it its like a skill you work on dont get lonely huh sure i remember some nights id be sitting there watchinggilligans island reruns on this blackandwhite tv you know the kind with a coat hanger for an antenna and id be watching this show and id hear a piece of paper slide under the door and id start to get up and see what it was but then i wouldnt because i knew it was only a menu from a chinese restaurant a delivery guy was slipping under all the doors in the building but if ididnt go see then maybe itd be a note from someone maybe it would say theres a party in threeg plenty of men come in costume or maybe it would be mysterious meet me on the corner of avenue a and ninth street at midnight on the night of the full moon boggs was looking at her trying to figure this all out but naw it was always just a menu and id go back to sitcoms and commercials but ups and downs thats what makes life what it is she thumped her chest im from ohio peasant stock boggs said theres one thing id like to say rune had been wondering if hed bring up the sleeping arrangements which is what this sounded like it was going to be about but just then courtney called i want juice say please i want please very funny rune called one minute honey to boggs she said im hungry for some real food ive got a couple leftover whoppers in the fridge you interested sure heat me one up too rune started into the houseboat suddenly boggs stopped he turned and twisted his head like a dog hearing an ultrasonic whistle he lifted his face to the sky his nostrils flared wide as he inhaled how bout that what the smells he said yeah we arent exactly talking perfume in new york no i dont mean that what i mean is therere a bunch of them a thousand smells she sniffed then shook her head i cant make out too many boggs inhaled again when youre inside there are only a couple smells you smell disinfectant onions or grease from the kitchen sweat spring air summer air its like you get used to them but here what do i smell rotten fish and dog doo and garbage and car exhaust nope what i smell is freedom one potato two potato three potato four jack nestor walking slowly along the old docks on the hudson river was thinking in florida peopleought to be on boats especially in south florida close to the glades you realize that even on land theres water everywhere and its a part of your life houses are raised up on stilts and everybodys got a boat of some kind in the yard but in new york it seemed pretty weird to live on a boat five potato six potato seven potato more nestor had parked on tenth street not far from the river hed rented the car which he didnt like doing because that left a record but he knew that after what was about to happen there was a pretty good chance his description would go out citywide including to the port authority police at the airports and bus and train stations but nobody could ever stop you fromdriving out of new york the sun was down by now and the sky was a shade of blue it never was in florida it was a grayblue metalblue junkyard blue nestor was thirsty but didnt want to look for a deli that many more people to see him so he sat on a bench facing the city and waited for more darkness to fall he stubbed out his cigarette after taking one long final drag deciding that the menthol made him less thirsty eight potato nine potato no cops anymore the blueandwhite that had been parked on the highway near the houseboat the cops eating sandwiches drinking coffee pulled away made a lazy uturn then headed north time to go to work he pulled out his gun and eased slowly toward the houseboat i learned a lot of law for one thing they had a mess of law books inside some of the fellows write their own appeals they do pretty good at it rune nodded boggs was working on his corona he still wasnt drunk or even tired it seemed and rune was sipping herbal tea and eating twinkies shed wanted to tape him and ask him more questions about what life was like in prison but hed begged off he was tired tomorrow he said shoot me all you want tomorrow courtney had gotten cranky it was a little early for bed but shed had a busy day helping get prisoners released from jail and playing the role of a convicts daughter so rune gave her a bath then put her to bed she fell asleep almost at once rune bounded back into the living room portion of the cabin and saw boggs sitting on the couch looking uneasy nervous he cleared his throat and looked at her for a long moment then away something was on his mind and she wondered if this was the moment when he was going to bring up sleeping arrangements again or even make a move as in a man and a woman alone together as in a man whos been behind bars for three years suddenly alone with a woman but no propositions were forthcoming boggs got another beer and kept up a nervous chatter they talked about life in the city for a few minutes about atlanta about politics and washington he seemed to know a surprising number of facts for someone who appeared so redneck rune expecting the line at any minute you know i was thinking i might have me some trouble getting a room but just as that was going through her head boggs yawned and looked at his watch he said i ought to be finding a room for the night and she surprised herself by saying you want you can sleep in the living room courtneys got the futon but we could fix up something but he was shaking his head no its funny i cant explain it but id really be inclined to spend the night by myself you know sure not understanding at all but feeling relieved that he wanted to do this let me pack up the rest of the beers and ill give you some pizza for breakfast uh no thanks im pretty partial to oatmeal i got some packets of instant she said you want a couple which was a question that never got answered with a huge crack the front door burst open hitting a table and knocking over a pile of runes books she looked at the fat man rushing into the houseboat saw the big gun in his hand and instinctively leapt in front of the storeroom where courtney was asleep rune pulled the door shut standing defiantly in front of it staring back at the man she knew without a bit of doubt had killed lance hopper and bennett frost this was jimmy boggs stood up fast knocking over the beer which chugged onto the floor the big man stopped then closed the front door slowly calmly as if hed been invited in he stood with his arms hanging awkwardly at his side cautious but confident squinting checking out the room and its inhabitants nothing he saw scared him randy boggs his eyes wide with shock faced the man the way boggs stood made him look like a soldier no more like a boxer one foot forward turned sideways which was crazy because even without the gun no way could he have taken this fat guy who outweighed him by a hundred pounds and looked like a ballkicker and eyegouger a dirty fighter what do you want rune whispered he ignored her and stepped right up to boggs five seconds of complete silence passed as the men seemed locked in a staring contest no one moved it was randy boggs who grinned first then said jack you son of a bitch wasnt expecting you for a couple of days or so the fat man laughed and let out a whoop he slipped the gun into his belt and the two men embraced like longlost cossack brothers suddenly reunited the one question on her mind could courtney swim rune could about as well as any midwest girl who never saw a body of water with waves until she was ten hell she could just hold on to courtney picturing her now screaming and waving her arms in panic and kick to the far pier how many yards was that maybe thirty or forty and god the hudson was gross and yucky but that didnt matter if they didnt get out now theyd be dead in three minutes she tore the door to the storeroom open and lunged vaguely aware of a sudden rush of activity behind her in the living room footsteps voices she slammed the door and turned the skeleton key lock court wake up the little girl didnt stir rune pressed her back against the thick wood and began to untie her boots which were laced up tight through dozens of eyelets she knew shed drown if she didnt get them off she shouted courtney juice a weak voice said wake up maybe some of the toys would float there was an anemic balloon tied onto the wall rune grabbed it and looped it around the girls wrist im sleepy courtney said rune had one boot off she started on the second with a huge snap of cracking wood the door crashed inward catching rune on the shoulder she flew into the far wall and lay still jack nestor stepped into the room narrowing his eyes against the darkness he looked around and walked toward rune when he got to her she sprung it wasnt much of an assault the only damage her shoulder caught him in the cheek and he jerked back blinking in surprise as a tooth cut into his tongue or the flesh of his mouth little shit he muttered she pounded him with her hands knotted into small fists but he was resilient as hard rubber and strong too he just picked her up stuffed her under his arm and carried her out into the living room she screamed and twisted and kicked nestor was laughing hard whoa this ones a hellcat he dropped her into a wroughtiron butterfly chair she kicked him in the thigh flinching he said angrily settle down you son of a bitch she leapt out of the chair making for boggs nestor roared settle down he grabbed her like a receiver snagging a sixtyyard bomb and tossed her into the chair again she bounced once the breath knocked out of her she wiped at her tears you bastard looking into randy boggss evasive eyes boggs said to nestor you got yourself wheels sure do some kind of hertz shit but itll do damn you look good for somebody who aint seen but prison sunlight for three years boggs said you look ugly as you ever did nestor laughed and the men did a little goodnatured sparring boggs landed a left hook on nestors chest and the fat man said you prick you always were fast you hit like a pussy but youre fast youll see a bruise the shape of my knuckles there come morning nestor looked around we gotta blow this joint ill vote for that rune said to boggs you did it you really did it nestor was speaking to boggs lets take care of business and get on our way he pulled the gun out of his waistband and glanced at rune the smile left boggss face whatcha aiming to do nestor shrugged pretty clear wouldnt you say dont see we have much choice boggs was looking down avoiding both their eyes well jack you know i wouldnt be too happy you did that rune stared at the gun afraid to look into nestors face he seemed to be the sort who would kill you sooner if you looked him in the eye randy we gotta she knows everything i know but hell i wouldnt want that to happen it just wouldnt be right you know right her hands were shaking sweat popped out on her forehead and she felt a trickle run from under her arms to her waist boggs said the thing is shes got a kid a little girl nestors face darkened a baby this little kid in there nestor looked at the storeroom i didnt see her you cant do the kid jack i wont let you do that meaning its okay if he shootsme rune began to cry more seriously nestor was saying i wouldnt do a kid anyway you know me better than that randy after all weve been through i hope you do and whats the kid going to do without a mother shed starve to death or something shes pretty young to be a mother from somewhere rune found the voice to say please dont hurt her if you do anything to me please call the police or somebody and tell them that shes here please nestor was debating boggs said i really gotta ask this one jack i really gotta ask you to let her be nestor sighed he nodded and put the gun into his belt shit thats the way it is thats the way it is okay ill do it for you randy i dont think its a good idea i just want to go on the record and say that but i owe you so ill do it but he walked to the chair and took runes face in his onionscented fingers you listen up good i know who you are and where you live if you say anything to anybody about us ill come back i get to new york all the time ill come back and ill kill you rune nodded she was crying in pure fear in pure relief and from the worst pain of all betrayal youbelieve him piper sutton had asked rune such a long time ago as if she was talking to a chid youbelieve him when he says hes innocent nestor said brutally you hear me she couldnt speak she nodded her head they used lamp cord and tied her into the chair and gagged her with an old wool scarf boggs knelt down and tested the wires he smiled shyly i suspect youre right upset and i dont blame you you helped me out and i repay you this way but sometimes in life youve gotta do things just for yourself you know for your own survival im sorry it worked out this way but you saved my life ill always be thankful for that she wanted to sayfuck you orgo to hell orjudas a thousand other things but the gag was tight and besides no words could convey the undiluted anger she was feeling for this man so she stared into his eyes not blinking not wavering a millimeter forcing him to see how much hate welled up and overflowed between them how she wished prometheus was still chained to rock being eaten by birds boggs squinted for an instant he swallowed and finally looked away lessgo boy nestor called we got a date with the road then they were gone man man man theres nothing like driving randy boggs was thinking theres not a goddamn thing in the world like it the way the tires make that hissing sound on asphalt the way the car dances over beatup pavement the way you know the road always be there and that you can drive forever and never once cover the same spot twice you dont want to the ford tempo jack nestor driving had left jersey and pennsylvania way behind and was cruising down the highway into maryland heading south motion is like smooth whisky motion like a drug randy boggs kept up his meditation and the best part of all when youre driving youre a moving target youre the safest you can ever be nothing can get you not bad love not a job not your kin not the devil himself crabs nestor said keep an eye out for a crab place they couldnt find any and instead got cheeseburgers at mcdonalds which boggs preferred to crabs anyway and nestor said was better for him because he was on a diet they drank beer out of tall doublearches waxed cups theyd emptied of soft drink they drove the speed limit but at boggss request had rolled down all the windows it seemed like they were racing at a hundred miles an hour randy boggs lowered the passenger seat and sat back sucking the beer through a straw and ate a double cheeseburger and thought again about freedom and moving and realized that was why prison had been so hard for him that there are people who have to stay put and people who have to move and he was a mover these were thoughts he had and that he believed were true in some universal way but they were thoughts that he didnt tell to jack nestor not that jack was a stupid man no hed probably understand but he was somebody boggs didnt want to share much with so jack nestor asked hows it feel feels good feels real good how bout that little girl back there shes a pistol you get any naw wasnt that way didnt seem to have any tits to speak of she was more like a friend you know wish i couldve leveled with her did what you had to though i understand that couldntve stayed inside for any longer jack i gave it my best but i had to get out somebody was moving on me spades nope was an asshole from i dont know colombia or someplace venezuela for some reason he didnt take to me got cut cut huh two weeks ago hardly hurts anymore yeah i was cut once i didnt like it better to get shot kind of more numb prefer to avoid either thats a good way to thinks nestor offered he was in a good mood he was talking about restaurants down in florida and fishing for tarpon and the quality of the pot they had down there and this cuban woman with big tits and a tattoo somebodyd given her with his teeth and a parker pen talking about the heat about a house he was buying and how he had to live in a fucking hotel until the place was ready how long to atlanta boggs asked tomorrow then im going on to florida you interested in coming with me youd be welcome you like spic women never had me one dont know what youre missing that a fact yessir one is telling you bout man she could probably do both of us at once boggs thought hed pass on that i dont know well just keep er in mind so you gonna pick up that money yessir you got the passbook with you got her good and safe nestor said funny about how that works you just let some money sit in the bank and there she be earning interest every day they just throw a few more dollars into the till and you dont do nothing yeah bet you made yourself another ten thousand dollars you think no foolin for sure i think that account earns maybe five six percent boggs felt a warm feeling he hadnt remembered about interest hed never had a savings account to speak of you know theres something you ought to think about you hear about all those bank failures whats that a lot of savings and loans went under people lost money hell you say happens a lot last couple of years didnt you watch the news inside usually was cartoons and the game we were watching boggs was tired he put the seat way back the last car hed owned was a big pontiac with a bench seat that didnt recline he liked this car he thought he was going to buy himself a car a new one he lay back closed his eyes and tried not to think about rune so nestor said you might want to think about investing that money ill do that you have any idea what nope not yet im going to keep my eyes peeled for the right thing you got money people listen to you money talks shit walks nestor said thats the truth randy boggs said three hours later courtney woke up and wanted some juice the little girl sat up slowly and unwound herself from the cocoon of a blanket that had twisted around her as she slept she eased forward and climbed over the edge of the rolledup futon like edmund hillary taking the last step down from everest and then sat on the floor to put her shoes on laces were too much of a challenge but the shoes didnt look right with the white dangling strings so after staring at them for five minutes she bent down and stuffed the plastic ends into her shoes she climbed carefully down the stairs sideways crablike then walked up to rune who was tied into the butterfly chair she looked at the cords at runes red face she heard hoarse wordless sounds coming from behind the scarf youre funny rune courtney said then went into the galley the refrigerator was pretty easy to open and she found a cardboard carton of apple juice on the second shelf the problem was that she couldnt figure out how to open it she looked at rune who was staring into the kitchen and still making those funny noises and held up the carton in both hands then she turned it upside down to look for the spout the carton which it turned out had been open after all emptied itself onto the floor in a sticky surf ohoh she looked at rune guiltily then set the empty container on top of the stove and went back to the refrigerator no more juice a lot of coldpizza which she was tired of but there were dozens of twinkies which she loved she started working on one and then wandered around the small kitchen to see what she could find to play with not a lot there was however a large filleting knife on the counter that intrigued her she picked it up and pretended it was a sword like in one of runes books stabbing the refrigerator a few times rune watching this was making more noise and started jiggling around rocking and swaying back and forth the girl then looked into drawers and opened up some prettymuchunused cookbooks looking for pictures of ducks dragons or princesses the books contained only photos of soups and casseroles and cakes and after five minutes she gave up on them and started playing with the knobs on the stove they were old and heavy glistening chrome and trimmed with red paint courtney reached up and turned one all the way to the right way above her head was apop she couldnt see the top of the stove and she didnt know what the sound came from but she liked it pop she turned the second knob pop runes voice was louder now though the little girl still couldnt understand a word of it with the thirdpop she got tired of the stove game that was because something else happened there was suddenly a red glare from above her head a hissing sputter then flames courtney stepped back and watched the juice carton burn the flaming wax shot off the side of the carton like miniature fireworks one piece of burning cardboard fell onto the table and set a weekoldnew york post on fire a cookbooka hundred glorious jello desserts went next courtney loved the flames and watched them creep slowly along the table they reminded her of something a movie about a baby animal a deer a big fire in a forest she squinted and tried to remember but soon lost the association and stood back to watch she thought it was great when the flames quickly peeled away the breedsofdog contact paper rune had painstakingly mounted on the walls with rubber cement then they spread up to the ceiling and the back wall of the houseboat when the fire became too hot courtney moved back a little farther but she was in no hurry to leave this was wonderful she remembered another movie she thought for a minute yeah it was like the scene where wizardoz was yelling at dorothy and her little dog all the smoke and flames everybody falling on the floor while the big face puffed and shouted but this was better than that this was better than peter rabbit it was even better than saturday morning tv the tourists coincidentally were from ohio runes home state they were a middleaged couple driving a winnebago from cleveland to maine because the wife had always wanted to see the maine coast and because they both loved lobster the itinerary would take them through new york up to newport then on to boston salem and finally into kennebunkport which had been featured inparade magazine a year before but theyd made an unplanned stop in manhattan and that was to report a serious fire on the hudson river cruising up from the holland tunnel they noticed a column of black smoke off to their left coming it seemed right out of the river they slowed like almost everybody else was doing and saw an old houseboat burning furiously traffic was at a crawl and they eased forward listening for the sirens the husband looked around to find a place to pull off to get out of the way of the fire trucks when they arrived but none did they waited four five minutes six she asked youd think somebodydve called by now wouldnt you dear youd think they were astonished because easily a hundred cars had gone by but it seemed that nobody had bothered to call maybe figuring somebody else had or not figuring anything at all just watching the houseboat burn the husband an exmarine and head of his local chamber of commerce a man with no aversion to getting involved drove the winnebago up over the curb onto the sidewalk he braked to a fast halt in front of the pier where the flames roared he took the big jc penney tripleclass fire extinguisher from the rack beside his seat and rushed outside the wife ran to a pay phone while he kicked in the front door of the houseboat the smoke wasnt too bad inside the hole in the rear ceiling of the houseboat acted like a chimney and was sucking most of it out he stopped cold in the doorway blinking in surprise at what he saw two girls one a young girl was laughing like nero as she watched the back half of the houseboat turn into charcoal the other a girl wearing a yellow miniskirt two sleeveless mens tshirts and low boots dotted with chrome studs was tied in a chair whod do such a thing hed read about greenwich village but this seemed too sick even for a sodom like that he pulled the pin of the fire extinguisher and emptied the contents at the advancing line of flames but it had no effect on the fire he carried the little girl outside to his wife and then returned to the inferno opening his case pocketknife as he ran he cut the wires holding the older girl he had to help her walk outside her legs had fallen asleep inside the couples winnebago the little girl saw the older ones tears and decided it was time to start crying herself three minutes later the fire department arrived they had the fire out in twenty the police and fire department investigators knocked on the door the girls stood up and went outside and the couple followed a huge black cloud hung over the pier the air smelled of sour wood and burnt rubber from the tires that had dangled off the side of the boat to cushion it against the pier the vessel hadnt sunk but much of the structure on the deck had been destroyed one of the detectives asked the older girl could you tell me what happened she paced in a tight circle that goddamn son of a bitch he tricked me he lied to me im going to find him and have his ass thrown back in jail so goddamn fast shit hell shit shit courtney said and the husband and wife looked at each other the police asked questions for almost a half hour the girl was telling a story about a man who was convicted wrongly of murder then got released only now it was clear hed done it after all and there was a big fat man named jack no last name and jack had a gun and wanted to kill them and he was involved in the first killing the couple lost a lot of the details just like the cops must have too but they didnt really need to hear any more they had enough of the facts for a good traveling story which theyd tell to friends and to themselves and to anybody they happened to meet on the way to maine and which unlike a lot of the stories theyd told didnt need much embellishment at all finally a tall balding man in a plaid shirt and blue jeans and with a badge on his belt arrived and the girl fell into his arms though she wasnt sobbing anymore or hysterical then she pushed him away and went into one of her tirades again goodness the wife said when the girl calmed down she told the cop the couple had saved her life and he introduced himself to them and said thank you they talked about ohio for a few minutes then the cop said that the girls could go to bomb squad and stay there until he was off duty and the little girl said can we get another hand grenade please and that was when the couple decided not to do what had crossed their midwestern minds ask the girls if they would like to stay with them in the camper that night and figured it would probably be best if they pressed on to the alternate destination of mystic connecticut which came highly recommended in their guidebook at eleven that night jack nestor said he needed a real drink and pulled off the highway at a motel somewhere in virginia i could use some realfood too randy boggs said he wanted a steak burnt on the outside and red inside hed spent a lot of time thinking about steaks when he first went inside then as with with most of the things he enjoyed he forgot about good meat or it was more that they became distant like facts in a history book he understood them he remembered them but they had no meaning for him now though he was out and he wanted a steak and the way nestor had saidreal drink boggs was now thinking that hed like his first shot of whisky in three years they parked the car and went into the motel office nestor gave a fake name and car license then asked for a room in the back explaining to the young night clerk that he didnt sleep well highway noise bothered him the young man nodded apathetically took the cash and gave him the key boggs was impressed at how smoothly nestor had handled things boggs himself would have been more careless leaving the car in front but nestor was right the girl had probably gotten free by now and turned them in or maybe someone in new york had seen the license plate he was glad he was with somebody like nestor somebody who could teach him to think outside again nestor lugged his duffel bag into the room and boggs followed with the paper bag that was his suitcase he was relieved to see there were two large beds he hadnt wanted to spend his first night of freedom in bed with another man without commenting on the room nestor dropped his luggage onto the bed nearest the door and said food boggs said hold up i want to wash he disappeared into the bathroom amused and feeling almost heartsick with joy at how clean it was at all the sweet smells at the soap and wrapped glasses and a john behind a door that closed and locked he ran the water cold then hot then cold again then hot and washed his face and hands as the steam rose up and filled the room im hungry nestor bellowed over the sound of the running water minute boggs shouted back and dried himself with luxurious towels that seemed thick as down comforters the barrestaurant near the hotel was a local hangout done up in prefab tudor dark beams plastic windows mimicking stained glass beige stucco walls the place was half filled mostly around the bar with contractors and plumbers and truck drivers and their girlfriends the men were in jeans and plaid shirts a lot of beards the women were in slacks high heels and simple blouses almost everyone smoked the honeymooners was showing on a cockeyed tv above one end of the bar nestor and boggs sat down at a rickety table boggs stared at his place mat which was printed with puzzles and word games he could figure out the visual ones whats wrong with this picture but he had trouble unscrambling letters to make words he turned the place mat over and looked at the women at the bar the waitress came by and told them the kitchen was closing in ten minutes they ordered four black jacks neat bud chasers and steaks and fries that girl nestor said too bad you didnt fuck her who the one sprung you naw i told you we was mostly friends nestor asked so well i only got out a few hours before you showed up it was me the first thing i woulda done was get me some poontang boggs felt he was on the spot he said well she had the baby there the drinks arrived and they poured the shots down without saying anything because neither of them could think of a toast boggs wheezed and nestor laughed the big guy did his second shot right after dont get any of that inside do you nestor asked him there was stuff you could get depending on what you were willing to do or how much money you had it was shit though me i didnt get any care packages so i had to settle sometimes id get me some watered vodka or a joint or two mostly i didnt get nothing when i was inside we had it easy fucking country club a lot of dealers from la there was so much shit boggs dizzy from the liquor asked you did time fuck yeah i was in did eighteen months in obispo was fanfuckingtastic you wanted blow you got blow you wanted sess you got sess you wanted fucking wine you could get a good bottle of wine boggs was feeling the liquor sting his lips they mustve gotten windburned from the drive when were you in obispo four five years ago about i didnt know youd done time nestor looked at him surprised hey theres probably a thing or two we dont know about each other like i dont know how long your dick is boggs said long enough to keep a grin onher face for an hour or two his eyes slipped to the bar where a roundfaced young woman with twotone hair blonde returning to black sat with her elbow on the bar and her hand up a cigarette aimed at the ceiling like a sixth finger in front of her was a nononsense martini the way she stared vacantly at the tv he figured the drink was the descendant of a long line of the same nestor said you can have her she dont have tits sure she does shes setting hunched over the food arrived and took both mens attention boggs was eating slowly cautiously but hed found his appetite was gone maybe the steak was too rich maybe the burgers had filled him up or the alcohol had burned out his taste buds he thought about rune about the little girl he ate mechanically he looked at the woman who caught his eye and held it for a minute before she looked back at the tv he thought a bit more then decided to finish eating maybe food would sober him up boggs finished while nestor was still halfway through man boggs said that was a meal nestor looked at boggss thin stomach you eat that way how come you aint fat dunno i just never gain any notmy doing boggss voice faded as he stared again at the girl at the bar this time she gave him a bit of a smile nestor caught it ohoh he smiled prisonboy gonna get laid boggs finished his beer you mind if i take the room for about an hour shit boy itll take you five minutes unless you jerked off every night inside the slammer well gimme an hour anyway maybe well wanta do it twice okeydokey nestor said but get her butt out by two im tired and i need some sleep boggs stood up and walked slowly toward the bar trying to remember how to be cool and slick trying to remember how to talk to women trying to remember a lot of things boggs and the girl had been gone a half hour when jack nestor finished the lousy apple pie and sucked the ice cream off his fork he took the last swallow of coffee and called for the check the bar was pretty empty now and aside from the waitress there was nobody who saw him stand and go out to the parking lot he looked up and saw the light on in his and boggss room he opened the trunk of the car and took out his pistol he hid the gun under his jacket and climbed the stairs to the second floor then moved slowly along the open walkway to the room hed thought about getting another key from the desk but that would have given the clerk another look at him hed decided to just knock on the door and when boggs opened it shoot him in the gut his idunnoijusteatanddontgetfat gut then do the girl if she was still there he paused what was the noise the tv they were fucking and the tv was on maybe she was a screamer and boggs kept the sound up so other guests wouldnt hear that was good maybe it was a cop show and thered be gunshots which would help cover up the sound of the steyr nestor walked closer to the door he pulled the slide back on the gun he saw something flashing that putz boggs was so horny hed left the key in the door which wasnt even fully closed all nestor had to do was push he made sure the safety was off slipped his finger into the trigger guard and swung into the room empty the bedclothes werent even turned down the bathroom was dark but he walked inside anyway thinking that maybe they were fucking in the tub but no that was empty too the only motion in the room was the flicker of the tv screen on which severalhill street blues cops were looking solemn nestor shut off the set then he noticed that boggss bag was gone shit he picked up the note which rested on the pillow shit jack lynda thats her name and me went back to her house seems she is going to atlanta tomorrow thats a coinsidence huh so were going to be driving together for a spell her and me i mean i will meet you at your place in florida in a couple days sorry but you dont have legs like her son of a bitch motherfucker nestor kicked the bed furiously the mattress bounced off the springs and came to rest at an angle he slammed the door shut violently which brought a sleepy protesting pounding from the next room over nestor hoped the guest would come over because he had an incredible desire to beat the living hell out of someone he sat down on the bed picturing boggs balling the scrawny bitch while the passbook sat in a crumpled paper bag probably five feet away from them the anger seeped away slowly as he decided what to do well it wasnt the end of the world it was a change of plans was all he had to kill the girl anyway the one on the houseboat he might as well do that now then get down to atlanta or florida and take care of boggs it didnt really matter who he did first six of one half a dozen of another the way piper sutton found out was thepost headline tv scoop becomes oops which she wouldnt have paid any attention to except that there was a picture of rune talking to a couple of men in suits they didnt look happy rune didnt either and now piper sutton joined the club standing on the street corner near her apartment she stared at the story shed bought thepost and then adaily news and atimes ripping open each furiously skirt and hair tousled by the wind as she stared at the smudged type thank god for a big assault in central america that buried thedaily news story inside thetimes had simply reported houseboat burns in hudson with a reference to a possible convicts escape but thetimes would be on the story today how the fittoprint paper loved to take potshots at the competition especially tv sutton flagged down a cab giving up her usual mile walk to the office and sat with the newspapers on her lap staring out the window at people on their way to work but not seeing a single one of them at her office sutton found her secretary juggling two calls oh ms sutton mr semple has called several times therere calls from all the local tv stations and somebody from thevillage voice the fuckingvoice and a mr weinstein with the attorney generals office then hold all the calls sutton hissed ask lee maisel to come over get me the legal department i want tim krueger here in fifteen minutes if any other reporters call tell them well have a statement by noon if any of them say they have an earlier deadline take his or her name and let me know immediately sutton pulled her coat off and i wanther now who miss sutton you know who sutton replied in a whisper now rune had been fired worse but the sad thing was that the other times she didnt care shed screwed up often in the past sure but theres a big difference between getting fired from a video store or restaurant and getting fired from a real job one you cared about usually shed say eh happens or thems the breaks this was different shed wanted to do this story badly shedlived for this story shed breathed it and tasted it and now not only was she getting axed but she was getting fired because the whole thing had been a complete lie the very core the most very basic fact was false the worst it was like reading a fairy tale and then the writer telling you oh yeah by the way i was just kidding theres no such thing as evil spirits although she had proof there was such a thing and his name was randy boggs rune now stood in front of piper suttons desk also in the room were a tall thin middleaged man in a gray suit and white shirt his name was krueger lee maisel leaned against the wall behind sutton reading thepost account jesus christ he muttered he looked at rune with dark impenetrable eyes and went back to the paper tell me exactly what happened sutton said dont embellish dont minimize dont edit rune explained about the fat man and boggs and what happened on the houseboat so boggs did it after all maisel said there was another killer but they were partners jesus sort of looks like it rune wasnt countinglikes sortofs andkindofs when i saw them there kind of hugging each other i totally freaked i mean her voice faded sutton closed her eyes and shook her head slowly then asked the graysuited man whats the legal assessment tim the lawyer said calmly i dont think we have any liability we didnt fabricate evidence and the court decision was legitimate i wish she not looking at rune hadnt gotten him released without telling anybody here that adds another dimension for the first time since shed known him maisel turned angry eyes on rune why didnt you tell me you were going to get boggs sprung i was worried about him i sutton couldnt keep cool any longer ive told you from the beginning that our job isnt to get people out of jail its to report the truth thats theonly job i just didnt think i didnt think it would matter didnt think sutton stretched the words out for a vast second im really sutton turned to maisel so whats the next step nighttime news the lawyer winced its a new york story cant we justify keeping it local maisel said no way time andnewsweekll cover it you know what the other nets are going to do and forget about thetimes theyll crucify us itll be understated but itll still be a crucifixion well have to preempt them sutton said put it on thenews at noon then do a piece at five and have eustice do it at seven we tell all we confess not a single word of excuse or backpedaling krueger said god thatll hurt maisel sighed the lawyer asked rune you have any idea where boggs went all i know is like he came from the south atlanta was where he was born and he lived in florida and north carolina but other than that she ended in a shrug the lawyer said im going over to our law firm and brief the litigators just in case with a fast curious glance at rune he left the office sutton stared at thedaily news lee maisel played with his pipe and sat in a slump he was uncomfortable rune looked into his eyes though his darted away quickly what she saw hurt her more than the hatred she felt gushing from sutton oh how could i do it he believed in me and i let him down sutton looked at rune dont talk to the press about what happened youve already blabbed your mouth off i see waving her arm at the newspaper rune said i didnt say anything the police mustve told the reporters well all ill say is the network is going to be in deep shit for this and heads are probably going to roll if you make things worse for everybody because you cant keep your mouth shut then youll be opening yourself up to a big fat fucking lawsuit you understand me rune nodded there was a long pause broken by suttons saying well i guess thats it youre out of here rune stared at her blinked just like that today sorry rune maisel said today yes now sutton added and dont take any files or cassettes with you thats our property do you mean i should go back to my job at the o ampo sutton looked at her with a disbelieving smile rune said you mean im like totally fired sutton said like totally sam healy woke up at eight the next morning when courtney emptied a box of raisin bran in their bed the noisy cascade didnt wake rune up jesus christ healy muttered and shook her arm he rolled over rune opened her eyes and said whats that noise that crunching courtney stood in front of the bed and looked down at it frowning rune swung her feet over the side of the bed her legs covered with cereal courtney what did you do im sorry the little girl said spilled healy whod gotten home two hours before from duty watch said im going into adams room he vanished rune scooped the cereal up and brushed it off her legs then put it back into the box you know better than that come on i know better dont look so damn cute when im yelling at you damn cute courtney said come on rune trudged into the kitchen she poured juice and bowls of cereal made coffee can we go to the zoo courtney asked tomorrow ive got some errands to do first you wanta come yeah i wanta come she held up her hand fivehigh rune sighed then held up her hand the little girl slapped it ahalf hour later rune and courtney got off the e train at west fourth and started walking up christopher street to the water rune paused at the west side highway took a deep breath for courage then plunged around the corner to survey the damage to her late home the houseboat still floated but it looked like a load of charred wood had been dumped onto the deck irregular glistening slabs of fluted charcoal rose above it a haze of smoke still hung around the pier and made everything the houseboat the debris the trash cans the chainlink appear out of focus the front of the pier was cordoned off with a yellow police tape fifty feet in front of where the boat bobbed like a manowar that had lost a sea battle rune remembered seeing the houseboat for the first time riding in the hudson fifty miles north of here and now a viking burial she sighed then waved to the patrolman in the front seat of a blueandwhite he was a friend of healys from the sixth precinct the station where the bomb squad was housed look at this she called sorry about it honey some of usll drive by once in a while check up on things just till you get your stuff moved out yeah if theres anything left there was but the stink and smoke damage were so bad she didnt have the heart to go through it anyway courtney was restless and kept climbing on the pilings rune took her by the hand and led her back up christopher street whats that courtney asked pointing at a storefront sign encouraging safe sex it showed a condom balloon said rune i want one when youre older rune answered the words came automatically and she decided she was really getting into this kid bit they continued down christopher then along the tail end of greenwich and finally onto eighth street it had become a lot shabbier in the past year more graffiti more garbage more obnoxious kids but god the shoe stores more places to buy cheap shoes than anywhere else in the world they walked down to university place past dozens of chic blackclad nyu students rune made a detour she stopped in front of an empty storefront above the door was a sign washington square video i used to work there she told courtney the little girl peered inside in the window was another sign on yellow cardboard for rent net lease just like my life she thought for rent net lease they walked to washington square park and bought hot dogs then kept walking south through soho and into chinatown hey rune said suddenly want to see something neat yeah neat lets go look at some octopuses yeah rune led her across the street to a huge outdoor fish market on canal street its like the zoo only the thing is the animals dont move so much courtney didnt buy it though pukey she said about the octopus then got yelled at by the owner of the stand when she poked a grouper rune looked around and said oh hey i know where we are come on ill show you something totally excellent ill teach you some history and when you start school you can blow everybody away with how much you already know yeah i like history they walked down centre street past the black family court building rune glancing across the square at the criminal courts building and thinking of randy boggs she felt the anger sear her and looked away quickly in a few minutes they were in front of the new york supreme court at centre this is it rune announced yeah courtney looked around this used to be called five points a hundred years ago it was the worst area in all of manhattan this is where the whyos hung out whats a whyo a gang the worst gang that ever was ill read you a bedtime story about them some night yeah rune remembered though that her present copy ofnew york gangs was now just a cinder and wondered where she could get a new one she said the whyos were really tough you couldnt join them unless you were a murderer they even printed up a price list you know like a menu for how much it cost to stab somebody or shoot him in the leg or kill him yuck said courtney you hear all about al capone and dutch schultz right courtney said agreeably uhhuh but they werent anything compared with the whyos danny driscoll was the leader theres this great story about him he was in love with a girl named beezy garrity isnt that a great name id like to be named beezy beezy and this rival gang dude johnny somebody or another fell in love with her too danny and him had this duel in a dance hall up the street they pulled out guns and blasted away rune fired a couple shots with her finger blam blam and guess who got shot beezy rune was impressed you got it then she frowned danny was pretty bummed by that id guess but it got worse because they hangedhim for killing his girlfriend right over there rune pointed thats where the tombs were the old criminal building hanged him right up well now shed have plenty of time to do her documentary about oldtime gangs she wished shed done that story in the first place they wouldnt have lied to her nope slops connolly would no way have betrayed her they were creeps and scum but she bet back then thugs were honorable come on honey rune said starting toward mulberry street ill show you where english charley started the last big fight the whyos were ever in you want to see oh yeah rune stopped suddenly and bent down and hugged the girl courtney hugged back squeezing with just the right amount of strength that rune needed just then the little girl broke away and ran to the corner a woman in a business suit maybe a lawyer on break from housing court crouched down and said to courtney arent you a cute one rune joined them and the woman looked up and said shes yours and as rune started to say she was just looking after her courtney said uhhuh this is my mommy randy boggs laughed out loud the man sitting in the seat next to him on the atlantabound greyhound bus glanced his way but must have been a seasoned traveler and didnt say anything he probably knew not to engage in conversation with people who laughed to themselves not on a bus not in north georgia what boggs was laughing at was the memory of lyndas astonished face as they walked out of the restaurant and he handed her fifty dollars telling her to get on home and not go back in that bar if tom cruise himself was in there offering to take her to bermuda uhhuh she said suspiciously why because boggs answered and kissed her forehead you mean you dont wannta nodding toward the room id love to specially with a pretty thing like you but theres someplace i gotta be he collected his bag and she gave him a drive to the charlottesville bus station which was a ways away but not so far that fifty dollars didnt buy the trip he thanked her and trotted off to wait at the terminal for the bus that would eventually get him to atlanta what had tipped him off had been the mens colony comment the california state mens colony at san luis obispo seemed pretty strange that jack nestor knowing that boggs was inside and knowing intimatelywhy boggs was inside hed never mentioned hed served time himself itd be natural for him to tell boggs what it was like maybe brag a little excons always did that but what was stranger still was that nestor had been in the same prison at the same time as juan ascipio okay it could have been a coincidence but if nestor wanted something to happen to boggs in harrison ascipio would have been a good choice to start that accident happening the accident that killed seven washington and came close to killing boggs a lot of strange things happening the obispo thing and the way the witness bennett frost had died and then the tape of runes story disappearing beneath his lazy smile and easy manner randy boggs was spitting mad here hed done right by nestor never said a goddamn word at trial or the entire time he was inside boggs was a standup guy and look what happened betrayed the bus rocked around a turn fast and he felt less angry boggs smiled it wasnt as good as a car but it was still movement movement taking him away from harrison and toward a pile of money he laughed again and said to the man beside him i love buses dont you be all right i guess bedamn all right boggs said whoa a fire jack nestor back on christopher street looked at the charred wreckage of the houseboat he leaned against a brick building next to the highway and wondered what this meant he thought about it some okay if shed been inside still tied up when it happened shed be dead and fuck it he could leave but it was also pretty likely that somebody wouldve seen the fire and come to help her before she got toasted or maybe shed moved and some asshole just torched the place a lot of questions no answers so boggs the prick was gone and now the girl was gone too damn jack nestor lit a cigarette and leaned up against the brick wondering what to do next the answer he decided was to wait he hadnt slept well the night before the pictures again always the pictures theyd wakened him and hed lain in bed thinking that now he was going to kill randy boggs he needed to find something to resent about him there wasnt much he wasnt a nigger a fag a spic he didnt insult you he didnt go after your woman nestors hand went to his stomach and he squeezed the glossy scar the imaginary itching crawled around in his belly somewhere then he decided that boggss sin was that he was a loser capital l nestor smiled that was plenty of reason to hunt the shit down and kill him good that was taken care of it was a mild april night and the sky was lit by this eerie glow you couldnt tell where it came from all the streetlights probably and headlights from cars and taxis and office buildings and stores this made him think about all the buildings in the city which of course included restaurants which reminded him that he was starving and then just as he was about to go get a burger there was the girl she was walking slowly up the dock to the houseboat looking at the smoldering mess she was dressed in those weird clothes of hers black miniskirt boots a couple of tshirts one bright red the other yellow over her shoulder was a large bag but she was nice enough to set that down and stand with her hands on her hips looking at the boat she walked forward to look at some of the burnt junk on the pier and kicked it absently she walked to the yellow policedo not cross tape and stood with her hands on it looking down as if she was praying nestor took the gun from his jacket pocket and looked around cars zipped past and there were people strolling along the riverfront but no one was near him the sun was going down fast a huge wad of orange fire sinking directly in front of him he could see it disappearing inch by inch into the palisades behind the charred skeleton of the houseboat nestor aimed he kept both eyes open he didnt squint it was a seventyfiveyard shot and he wished he had a stock and butt piece but he didnt so he leaned hard into the brick wall for support crooked his arm and set the pistol in the v between his biceps and forearm he aligned the sights and lifted it a millimeter to compensate for the distance there was no wind he held his breath complete stillness then the last streak of sun slipped under the horizon a car sped past and honked the girl turned jack nestor fired two fast shots whose sharp cracks spread across the water echoed briefly then faded hed aimed for her back first then her head both slugs hit her the first one struck her shoulder high the second caught her in motion as she spun around he saw a puff of blood like smoke on her cheek she dropped to the ground like a puppet with cut strings nestor walked quickly back to the car on the way he changed his mind a burger would no longer do the trick he decided to go looking for the biggest steak he could find in this goddamn town at first randy boggs thought hed been cheated by the bank hed never had a good relationship with financial institutions although hed never robbed any several georgia and florida savings and loans with the word trust in their names no less had foreclosed on his familys houses after his father had missed various numbers of mortgage payments he was therefore predisposed to be suspicious so now when the pretty girl behind the window handed him eleven tiny piles of cash so thin that they looked like a kids building blocks he thought in panic theyd kept most of the money for a fee or something she looked at his expression and asked is everything all right thats one hundred ten thousand yessir they just look small cause theyre new bills i counted em once and our machine there counted em twice you want me to do it again no maam looked right at ben franklin who stared back at him with that weird smile as if was as natural for him as for anyone else to be holding a fortune a hundred ten thousand and some change the extra being thanks to the interest jack nestor had mentioned kind of thought a hundred thousandd be a bigger pile you got it in nickels and dahms itd be pretty sizable then yes maam yall want an escort lahk a guahd or anything no maam boggs loaded the money in his paper bag and left then he wandered around downtown atlanta for an hour he was astonished at the changes it was clean and landscaped he laughed at the number of streets with peachtree in them laughed because he remembered his daddy saying most people thought that referred to peaches when in fact the name came from pitch tree like tar he passed the street named boulevard and laughed again this was a town where it seemed you could laugh at something like that and nobody would think you were crazy as long as you eventually stopped laughing and went about your business boggs went into a luggage store and bought an expensive blacknylon backpack because hed always wanted one something made for longdistance carrying he slipped the money and his change of shirt into the bag which put him in mind of clothes he passed a fancy mens store but felt intimidated by the weird headless mannequins he walked on until he found an oldtime store where the fabrics were mostly polyester and the colors mostly brown and beige he bought a tan offtherack suit and a yellow shirt two pairs of blackandred argyle socks and a striped tie he though this might be too formal for a lot of places so he also bought a pair of doubleknit brown slacks and two blue shortsleeve sport shirts he thought about wearing the new clothes and having the clerk bag his jeans and work shirt but theyd think that was odd and they might remember him which probably wouldnt matter at all sowhat if they remembered him he hadnt done anything illegal here and sowhat if they thought he was odd if hed been a rich buckhead businessman whod decided on a whim to buy some clothes and wear them home nobodyd think twice but he wasnt a businessman he was a former convict who wasnt supposed to leave new york and so he paid fast and left he walked into a hyatt and strolled past the fountains boggs had always loved hotels they were places of adventure where nothing was permanent where you could always leave and go elsewhere if you werent happy he liked the meeting rooms where every day there was a new group of people learning things for their jobs or maybe learning a new skill like real estate investing or how to become mary kay pinkbuick saleswomen every guest in a hotel stayed there because they were traveling and a traveling person randy boggs knew was a happy person he went into the washroom on one of the banquet room levels and in a spotless stall changed into his suit he realized then that he was still wearing his beatup loafers with the steel penny in the slit on the top that afternoon hed get some new shoes something fancy maybe alligator skin or snakeskin he looked at himself in the mirror and decided he needed more color he was pretty pale and he didnt like his hair very few men wore it slicked back the way he did nowadays they wore it bushier and drier so after lunch a haircut too he walked out of the john and into the coffee shop he was seated and the waitress brought him an iced tea without his saying a word hed forgotten about this southern custom he ordered his second steak since hed been outside a sandwich on garlic bread and this one along with the michelob that went with it was much better than the first boggs considered this his first real meal of freedom by three hed bought new shoes and a new hairstyle and was thinking of taking the marta train out to the airport but he liked the hotel so much he decided to stay the night he checked in and asked for a room close to the ground yessir not a problem sir he tried out the room and the bed and felt comforted by the closeness of the walls he realized only then that he was uncomfortable in the spaciousness of atlanta with their tall dark canyons of buildings the streets of new york had made him feel less vulnerable in atlanta he felt exposed he took a nap in the darkened room and then went out for dinner he saw an airline ticket office and went inside he walked up to the united counter he asked the pretty ticket agent what was nice nice a nice place to go uh outside of the country parisd be beautiful april in paris you know randy boggs shook his head dont speak the language might be a problem interested in a vacation we have a vacation service lots of good packages actually i was thinking bout moving he saw a poster silver sand exquisite blue water crashing onto it whats the caribbean like i love it i was to st martin last year me and my girlfriends had us a fine time man that sand looked nice he liked the idea but then he frowned you know my passport expired do you need a passport to go to any of those places some countries you do some all you need is a birth certificate how would i tell maybe what you could do is buy a guidebook theres a bookstore up the street you make a right at the corner and its right there now theres an idea you might want to think about hawaii they got beaches there thatve just as nice as the islands hawaii boggs nodded that was a good thought he could just buy a ticket and go and sit on the beach for as long as he wanted find out what those tickets cost wouldya as she typed information into her computer he hesitated for a moment then quickly asked you be interested in having dinner with me she blushed and consulted her computer terminal immediately he wanted to retract his words hed stepped over some line something that people on the outside people who stay in hyatt hotels and buy airline tickets instinctively knew not to do she looked up shyly the thing is i sort of have a boyfriend sure yeah he was as red as a schoolboys back in august im sorry she seemed started at his apology then she smiled hey nothings harmed nobody ever died from being asked out as she looked back to her terminal randy boggs thought this being out in the real world its going to take a little time to get used to sam healy sitting on his couch looked over his lawn as he hung up from the phone call that had delivered the terrible news and told himself to stand up but his legs didnt respond he stayed where he was and watched courtney playing with a set of plastic blocks he took a deep breath when healy was a kid blocks were made of varnished hardwood and they came in a heavy corrugated cardboard box the ones the little girl was making a castle out of were made of something like styrofoam they came in a big clear plastic jar castles what else would runes child build magic castles sam healy stared at the colored squares and circles and columns wondering not so much about the toys of his childhood as about the human capacity for violence peopled think a bomb squad detective would have a pretty tough skin when it came to things like shootings hell especially in the nypd the constabulary for a city with close to two thousand homicides a year but healyd be fast to tell them it wasnt so one thing about bombs you dealt with mechanics not with people mostly the work was rendersafe procedures or postblast investigations and by the time you got called in the victims were long gone and the next of kin notified by somebody else but he wasnt on the job now and he could no longer avoid what he had to do he stood up and heard a pop in his shoulder a familiar reminder of a blackpowder pipe bomb hed gotten a little intimate with a couple of years back he paused glancing at the little girl again and walked to the tv some old western was playing bad color bad acting he shut off the set hey that dude was about to draw on three bad guys sam youre a cop you should watch this stuff its like continuing education for you he sat down on the ratty green couch and took runes hand she said ohoh whats this thewifescomingbacktoroost speech i can deal with it sam he glanced into the living room to check on courtney after he saw she was contentedly playing he kept his eyes turned away as he said i got a call from the ops coordinator at the sixth precinct it seems there was a shooting on the pier where your boat was docked shooting a girl about your age shot twice her name was claire weisman claire came back rune asked in a whisper oh my god no is she dead runes eyes were on courtney critical condition st vincents oh god rune was crying softly then her voice fading she said somebody thought it was me didnt they there are no suspects she said you know who did it dont you boggs and the other guy the fat one jack it has to be them they came back to kill me her eyes were red and miserable i her hands closed on her mouth i never thought claired come back runes gaze settled on courtney healy held her then said ill call it in to the detectives about boggs and jack for a shooting theyll do a citywide search please she whispered please please claires mothers on her way shes flying down from boston ive got to go see her come on ill drive you there im so sorry rune said the woman mustve been in her early fifties she didnt know how to respond to the grief and did the only thing she could think of put her arm around runes shoulders and told her that they all had to be brave claires mother was heavy wearing a concealing long bluesatin dress her hair was a mix of pure black strands and pure white which made it look disorganized even though it was sprayed perfectly into place she held what rune thought was a crushed bouquet but what turned out to be a thin white handkerchief the kind runes grandmother called a hankie run looked at the bed it was hard to see claire the lights were very dim as if the doctors were afraid that too much brightness would give her life a chance to get away rune leaned forward claires left shoulder and arm were in a huge cast and the left side of her face was a mass of bandages there were tubes in her nose and several others led from a dressing on her neck into jars on the floor a monitor above her head gave its alarming messages about heartbeats or pulses or breaths or who knew what the lines were erratic rune wished the monitor faced the other way mrs weisman kept her eyes on her daughter and sad wheres courtney claire said she was staying with you i left her with the nurse outside i didnt think it was a good idea for her to see claire like this there was the dense silence of two people who have nothing in common except grief after a few minutes rune asked do you have a place to stay the woman wasnt listening she stared at claire then a moment later asked do you have any children other than courtney no mrs weisman turned her head toward rune at this answer did you tell her anything courtney i mean about what happened i said her mommy was sick and she was going to see her grandmother shes okay but she should get some sleep pretty soon mrs weisman said ill keep her with me rune hesitated sure does she have her things with her the clothesi bought shes got the toysi gave her rune said claire didnt leave her with much mrs weisman didnt answer rune said ive got some things to do could you call me if she wakes up she wrote sam healy s name address and phone number on the back of a restaurant receipt shed found in her purse im staying here for a while she nodded and rune wondered if she was hearing the words whod do such a thing mrs weisman asked vacantly a robber claire didnt look like the kind of girl whod have a lot of money do you think it was like what you hear about in california you know where they shoot people on the highway just for the fun of it she shook her head as if the answer didnt make any difference i dont know rune said her mother would find out soon enough what happened no sense in long explanations now but therewas something rune wanted to add she wanted so badly to turn to this poor woman and tell her exactly what she was thinking right now which was that she didnt give a shit about the news story anymore she didnt give a shit about the lance hopper murder she cared about one thing and that only finding the two of them randy boggs and his fat friend jack shed get into the network somehow bradford would help her and steal her tapes and notes get all the details on where randyd lived over the past ten years where he liked to go what he hoped to do in the future somewhere in that material would probably be a clue as to where he was running to right now shed find him and jack and make sure theyboth went to harrison prison but then when it occurred to her that claire might die and her mother would take courtney back to boston she thought she might not turn them over to the police at all shed kill them herself bradford simpson was uneasy the word is piper wants you drawn andeighthed quartered isnt good enough look i just need to get into the newsroom if i were you i wouldnt be in the samecity as piper sutton the young preppy said the samebuilding is a very very bad idea very bad they were at kellys a bar on the southern end of columbus avenue around the corner from the network the shabby place couldnt make up its mind whether it wanted to be the home base for yuppies who traded insider information or for ira sympathizers who argued politics rune ordered bradford another martini a reporters drink and one calculated to make him agreeable she asked him again to get her inside the network and appended a heartfelt please what for tell me what for i cant its just really really important give me a clue he speared the olive expertly connecticutians are good with martinis you know that might not be the best question to ask i dont think you really want to know now thats an honest response i dont like it but its an honest response whats the worst that could happen she asked i could get fired arrested and sent to jail on rikers island if anybody asks ill tell them i snuck in i promise i wouldnt jeopardize your career i know what it means to you please help me out just this once youre very persuasive he said i havent even started trying yet he looked at his watch what am i supposed to do nothing serious just distract the guard while you slip in no its a lot easier than that all youve got to do is deactivate the alarm on the fire door downstairs open it up and let me in piece of cake oh christ the young man looked heartsick at this assignment he poured down the last slug of martini and look at it this way rune said if you do get arrested and sent to rikers island youll be able to do a great expose on what lifes like in prison what an opportunity it didnt go quite the way shed planned it she got in okay thanks to bradford she even managed to get to her old desk unseen the problem was that someone had beat her there everything about boggs was gone rune went through every drawer every shelf of her credenza every waddedup lamstons and macys bag under the desk but there was zip about randy boggs all the files the background tapes the notes gone whod done it she wondered rune sat at the desk until sixpm when the first live network newscast began everyones attention was on the far side of the studio and not a soul noticed rune walk up to a gaffer a heavyset man in jeans and a white striped shirt he wore a mets cap he was sipping coffee from a cardboard cup watching the attractive asian anchorwoman deliver a story about the mayors press conference hey rune he said then looked back to the set welcome back danny i need some help she said help he asked youre on set here every day right yep working overtime to buy my boat somebody went through my desk recently you see who it was by any chance he sipped more coffee avoiding her eyes im off shift danny thought you were fired i am but i need your help please he stared at the newscaster whose shortcut hair shone under the lights like a blueblack jewel he sighed i saw who was it oh brother randy boggs hadnt been on an airplane in years but he was surprised to find that they hadnt changed much seemed there were more men flight attendants and it seemed the food was better though maybe that was just because of what hed been eating off metal trays for the past thirtythree months fifteen days he remembered what the united airlines clerk whod sold him this ticket had said about no one ever dying from getting asked out and he kept up that attitude on the plane practicing a bit of flirting with the flight attendants hed dozed and had had a dream that he couldnt remember now and then the weather got rough and the seat belt sign came on he didnt mind flying but he hated the insides of airplanes for one thing the dry close air bothered him but they also cheated you here you were moving at five hundred miles an hour but what did the airlines do but try their best to fool you into thinking you were in a restaurant and movie theater randy boggs wanted the planes to have picture windows man seeing the clouds go past like they were trees on the interstate thinking too about his hundred ten thousand dollars his nest egg what his father called a stake randy used to think the old man meant steak and now that he had one he was going to do something with it something real smart boggs wondered if he should invest the money in a clothing store in hawaii hed really enjoyed going into that place in atlanta he liked the smell he figured it was aftershave and he liked the even rows of clothes on the chrome racks he liked the way the men who worked there stood with their arms folded in front of the shiny counters if it was slow you could wander outside into the forever warm weather and have a cigarette while you paced the sidewalk under palm trees he wondered how much it would cost to open a clothing store in hawaii buying a store that would be the kind of investment hed be proud of not like those other dumbass ideas like lobster farming and selling amazing water filters and nomoneydown real estate and computerized sign painting all of which hed tried but then again maybe instead of a store he should invest the money in the stock market he felt exhilarated thinking of himself being driven to work wearing his tan suit and alligatorskin loafers riding in an elevator up to some penthouse office on wall street the pilot announced they were landing and he looked out the window again hearing his fathers words you listen to me young man you paying attention if youre not ill tan your hide come here son come here you remember this dont work for any other man dont lien the house get paid in cash not in promises though the real advice from his father could be summarized much more easily it was this dont be me just then the plane banked sharply and the engines slowed to a growl randy boggs shut out the overhead light and plastered his face against the window looking into the night in the distance he believed he saw a shoreline he believed he saw water he definitely saw the runway rising to meet him as if the land were rushing forward to greet him like a lover and welcome him to his new life the breakin took only five minutes the networks personnel department was empty rune used a letter opener and fire hose nozzle to break the locks off two file cabinets inside she found the bulky file shed been looking for examined it briefly then trotted out with it under her arm at an allnight coffee shop up the street she ordered takeout a greek salad extra anchovies and a large apple juice which reminded her of courtney and made her feel lonely she canceled the juice and got coffee the caffeine was a better idea anyway she decided she sat at the counter opened the stolen file and began reading her appetite faded by the time she was halfway through the salad but she drank all the coffee then she looked up squinting walked to the phone and got lee maisels number from directory assistance she punched the numbers in noticing only then that it was midnight wondering if she was going to wake him up she did the producers voice cracked yes hello lee its rune ive got to talk to you its an emergency emergency what dyou mean what time is it ive got to talk to you youre okay im all right i found out something about lance hoppers killing it wasnt an accident randy and jack were hired to kill him what are you talking about the voice was sharper now his mind was in gear he was a journalist probing for facts it was a professional hit but whod want lance dead it was now runes voice cracked too and the reason it did had nothing to do with being tired she repeated in a whisper it was piper that maisel cleared his throat rune heard the rustling of cloth she pictured the producer sitting up putting his feet on the floor feeling for slippers piper hired them to kill lance again a pause he was waiting she heard him clear his throat again then cough this isnt funny its true lee come on rune why would she want him dead somebody took all the randy boggs files and tapes out of my desk everything was gone who danny turner the head electrician on the set told me it was piper maisel didnt answer rune said and remember she didnt want to do the story in the first place she tried to get me to stop she was going to send me to london to get rid of me maisel snapped what i was asking waswhy shed want lance hopper dead because he was going to fire her i went through her personnel file you what how i just did anyway you know what i found that hopper tried to fire her a year before he died piper filed two eeoc complaints against him they were both dropped but theres lots of memos it was this huge war rune people dont kill people for jobs maybe not usually but you know piper and her temper you told me that her job was her whole life and how much does she make a million a year thats enough to kill somebody for but how is she going to find professional killers this is just too what were some of her assignments she continued in africa in nicaragua the middle east she couldve met some mercenaries the fat guy jack he looked just like a soldier and he probably hired randy to help him maisel considered this he was less skeptical than a moment ago he said keep going rune felt like a juggler it was tough to keep all the parts of the story in the air at once when mr frost the new witness died it wasnt an accident at all piper knew his name she saw it from my story she sent that fat guy to kill him and then what happens all the cassettes disappear and she knew where id put the duplicate cassette of frost and shed know how to get into the computer and steal the master she felt the silence from the other end of the line his concentration as he weighed her words the shock but maybe also the excitement reporters must feel when they first sniff a lead to a hot story when he spoke it was almost as if to himself and she was pretty smooth when she adlibbed the broadcast rune said like shed known all along she was going to have to do it a long pause this is a nuclear bomb were playing with rune youve got a lot of speculation theres no direct evidence linking her to the killing iknow she did it lee the way youknew boggs was innocent she said nothing to that the producer continued just let me ask you one thing youre bitter because piper fired you and ruined your story if that hadnt happened if you were an objective reporter would you still be coming down against piper yes i would maybe therere no eyewitnesses but theres plenty of circumstantial evidence maisel was silent for a moment ill have to call dan semple ill his voice was fading semple rune asked what are you thinking lee she remembered semples picking piper up in his limo after she and rune had dinner at that french restaurant oh no you think hes in on it too they had an affair you know piper and him around the time hopper was killed rune said after hopper was killed semple got his job what are we going to do lee maisel said okay stay on the line im going to make some calls she heard him use his cell phone to talk to jim eustice at home and tell him what rune suspected he then called timothy krueger the network lawyer whod presided over runes unemployment then she heard a conference call as maisel spoke to krueger and apparently the police she deduced that they were all going to rendezvous at the network in a half hour in studio e an old unused space in the basement of the building where they could meet in private maisel hung up his mobile phone and came back on the other line rune you there im here i talked to jim and our legal department i heard maisel confirmed that they were meeting two homicide detectives in studio e ill be there rune said lay low until the cops get there we dont want piper to see you sure man thiss bad he muttered but that was the only emotion he showed instantly he was edward r murrow again he said to her you did a good job rune whatever the fallout from this you did good see you in a half hour these were the longest minutes of her life the hour was late but television networks never sleep and she was afraid that if she got to studio e before maisel or krueger or the police a security guard might see her and word would get back to piper or dan semple so she sat in the booth at the greek diner bouncing her toes on the linoleum feeling the terrible sting of betrayal feeling fear too recalling all the time shed spent alone with sutton inches away from her a killer whose heart was as cold as her journalists eyes after fifteen minutes rune could stand it no longer and she left the deli and headed back to the network she slipped in through the door bradford had doctored to let her inside then started down the corridor through a slightly more populated part of the studio a noise nearby rune froze but it turned out to be only bradford whats up he asked noticing her troubled face she looked around just between us okay top secret he whispered piper sutton had lance hopper killed are you serious the young man said you bet i am she answered he was going to fire her she found out about it and hired boggs and his friend to kill him jesus im going to meet lee down in studio e then her face broke into a smile and after shes in jail im going to talk lee into letting me do the story for the network you sure why not bradford apparently couldnt think of any reason why not and simply nodded he said finally brother youve sure graduated from overturned ammonia trucks say after your meeting how bout that beer how bout somechampagne rune said itll be on me he said the network building was like a warren as complicated and big as a huge high school rune got lost several times on her way to studio e which was at the end of a dozen dim corridors at least she didnt have to worry about being seen now the studio was in a completely deserted part of the network building she pushed inside and waved to lee maisel who sat at a battered swivel chair engaged in a somber discussion with someone whose back was to rune this would be either jim eustice or the lawyer tim krueger the cops werent here yet rune come on in maisel said he nodded at her hand youve got the files you found in personnel right here she said good maisel stepped forward and took it from her rune sat down at the table and turned to the other man as she started to ask when the police would be here she froze the man was jack the killer he eyed her up and down and said there you go lee itold you them girls look alike no wonder i shot the wrong one it was like the time she had three frozen margaritas crazy drunk her mind giddy and spinning her body sick she tensed to leap up out of the chair but jack shook his head naw naw dont bother he showed her the butt of a pistol in his waistband she relaxed he was right there was no place to go even if shed had the strength to get past maisel which she didnt maisel closed the door and leaned against it her mind was racing trying to pin down the speculation it was you she whispered maisel sighed and nodded rune said when i called you at home you justpretended to call eustice and krueger and the cops right thats right rune there wont be any cops you did it just to get me here so you could kill me maisel didnt answer you bastard rune hissed at him jack wore a shortsleeved striped shirt over his huge belly and gray baggy pants and some kind of rounded scuffed brown work shoes he looked her over then picked up a cup of coffee noisily drunk from it sorry rune im so sorry maisel gave her a grim smile but the disappointment and disgust in his face overwhelmed it he blew air slowly out through his rounded cheeks rune could see he was suffering good she thought maisel poured his drink down in one swallow i dont know what to say to you i tried to stop it all without hurting you jack said yeah hes right we tried to kill boggs in prison that wouldve solved youtried to rune looked at maisel he wouldnt meet her eyes paid to have a buddy of mine in harrison kill boggs then when you got him out i tried to do it myself but that man just wouldnt die it wasnt piper but she did everything she could to stop the story well sure maisel said the story wouldve been bad for her image she didnt want the eeoc suits coming to light she hated having to run to the courts to fight her battles for her but just because she didntwant it to run didnt mean she was going to stop it youencouraged me to keep going with it thered been rumors that there was more to hoppers death than just randy boggs acting alone we needed you to find the evidence witnesses we knew we could control you rune said to maisel why did you do it what does it matter it fucking matters to me she snapped beirut jack said shut up nestor maisel snapped the story where those people got killed right she doesnt need to know maisel muttered why not jack said you fucked up lee you may as well admit it to rune he said you know lees big scoop a few years back his big fucking award she remembered his pulitzer she nodded well it was all fake he made up the interviews he made up the names of the locals who understands all those raghead names anyway he said they had machine guns and hand grenades and rockets he scooped everybody jack maisel said angrily but jack kept right on going only the problem was the us army believed the story and when they went into this village they were loaded for bear some arab kid shot a round at a dog or rabbit or whatever they got over there and jittery trigger ringers the whole platoon opened up when the smoke cleared there were a bunch of dead ragheads and a couple of our own boys all friendly fire all courtesy of mr newsman here you made up the whole story she asked it wasnt a big deal maisel said bitterly i mean itshouldntve been i didnt even think anybodyd pay attention to it you have to understand theres so much pressure to get stories theres so much time to fill and so little hard news and always the fucking competition breathing down your neck i started just adding a few quotes and the next thing i knew it got out of hand i never thought it would have any consequences but it did jack nestor said laughing cruelly and one of em was that lance hopper was going to investigate what happened so you hired him rune nodded toward jack the killer said mercenaries and journalists hang out a lot together in combat zones isnt much difference between them really you think about it lee and me spent some time together over there looking for the underground bars fucking ragheads cant even drink and hanging out i go off to sri lanka and come back to california where i do some funny stuff that lands me in obispo for a while doing easy time when i get out lee calls me and flies me into town to talk to him the rest is history maisel didnt look good he was pale and sweating beneath his saltandpepper beard you could see his lips pressed together she wondered what bothered him the most that hed nearly been caught violating journalistic ethics or that hed had several people killed to cover it up rune said what about randy boggs jack snorted that loser we set him up he didnt know anything about the hit he couldnt kill anybody if he was about to get whacked himself he lost his job in maine and called me looking for work on a fishing boat in florida i had him meet me in new york i made up some shit about a credit card deal lee and i were going to make it look like he hit hopper then id waste him and leave the gun there wouldve been a few loose ends but basically theres a perp and theres a vie so the copsd be happy but the son of a bitch ran right into a cop car well he doesnt know wed planned to kill hopper so he plays standup guy and doesnt turn me in jack continued everything was going along fine but then i read in the paper about you planning on getting him out so i come to town and talk it over with lee we try to make the story go away and in the meantime i have this spic buddy of mine happens to be in harrison try to move on boggs but that doesnt work then you get him out and things go to hell hes got his money and hes gone the wave passed over her like a fever so randy was innocent to the extent he could be innocent after having been mixed up with people like these she swallowed please let me go i wont say anything i dont care about hopper just let me go please ill be quiet about it maisel looked at jack who was shaking his head no in a humorous exasperated way cant lee you cant trust her maisel said rune rune her teeth were pressed together and she felt anger hot and searing oh what she wanted to say to him but the words were logjammed in her mind and even if she found the strength and the calm to sort them out she knew he wouldnt comprehend them jack stirred she understood this was his show now hed seen lee weakening and knew it was time for the pro to take over before more mistakes were made maisel said jack i dont think jack held up his hand a patient school teacher its okay lee ill take care of it rune said no please i promise i wont say a word her eyes were on maisels he opened his mouth to speak then looked away and sat down in his chair jacks stood up pulled a gun out of his pocket thesere soundproofed rooms right maisel looking away from rune nodded the killer looked around and saw a large roll of dusty seamless a ten foot wide paper used for backdrops he dragged rune toward it and shoved her down presumably to absorb the blood then he looked down at the gun and pulled the slide back aimed it at her head matteroffactly he hesitated do you ever see pictures he asked pictures in your head rune crying said what do you mean jack shook his head never mind he started to pull the trigger dont move a mans voice called bradford simpson walked into the room pointing a pistol at jack nestor drop it he screamed jack glanced over his shoulder in disgust and when he saw the hysteria in the young mans eyes tossed the gun on a nearby table who the fuckre you bradford rune said running toward him brads attention was wholly on maisel now he had no interest in jack who watched the young man with some amusement you son of a bitch the young man cried you killed him it was you maisel glanced at the pistol which was feet from his chest he said nothing whatre you doing here rune asked im going to kill him bradford said why because lance hopper was my father father maisel asked frowning my mother bradford said gazing at the reporter with angry eyes was one of the secretaries who worked at a station where my dad was a newsman twentytwo years ago i was one of lance hoppers illegitimate kids the tabloids were so happy to start rumors about only in my case it wasnt a rumor four years ago my mother told me who my real father was i came to see him at first he thought i wanted money or something but then he realized i just wanted to meet him get to know him we spent some time together i liked him he was a good man at heart he had his vices and weaknesses bradford laughed i guess i was the product of one of those vices but he was somebody i started to admire i decided to become a journalist and switched majors he was going to get me a job here at the network but i said no i wanted to do it on my own i applied for the internship and got accepted and that gave us an excuse to spend time together we had different last names so no one ever knew who i was but then he was killed it just about destroyed me i assumed the story about what happened was true and let it go at that but a few weeks ago i was doing mailroom duty going through all the unsolicited mail and i found boggs s letter i read it a dozen times i got to thinking that maybe there was more to my fathers death than what came out in court youre the one who put the letter on my desk rune said bradford smiled youre a crusader rune nobody else hered give a damn about finding the real killer but i had a feeling you would you were using me too lets just say i was looking over your shoulder the more you found the more i got to thinking that it mustve been piper or dan semple whod killed him lee you crossed my mind too that beirut situation always seemed fishy to me he nodded toward rune when she told me you were going to meet down here a deserted studio i figured you might be the one so i hid up there he glanced at the empty control booth look kid jack said impatiently why dont you just let us walk out of here and well forget everything you go your way and well go ours but bradford ignored him he nodded at the control booth and said to maisel i got everything you said on tape lee maisel closed his eyes he slumped in the chair jack sighed and shook his head think youre on your own here lee nice doing business with you the killer grabbed rune by the hair and pulled her to her feet no she cried bradford pointed his pistol toward jack but the fat man paid no attention he walked to the table where his own gun lay and picked it up dont bradford said yeah right jack muttered shoot him rune shouted to bradford now but the young man froze his eyes wide his mouth open in fear as jack lifted the gun and fired at him as casually as if he were tossing coins in a wishing well rune couldnt tell whether bradford was hit or not he fell or dove to the floor maisel slid from his chair and rolled to cover under the table tugging rune after him jack said lets go honey may need some insurance in case the kid called the police no goddammit she raged trying to pry his hand off her hair but he simply got a better grip and dragged her more quickly behind him shut up he whispered maybe bradfordhad called the police maybe sam healy and a hundred other cops were outside right now their guns pointed at the door jackd see that and give up he pulled her in front of him and kicked open the door that led to the parking lot please she thought let there be a thousand knights waiting here to slay the dragon they stepped outside nobody she scanned the alley and the parking lot empty oh no jack squinted orienting himself cars on the other side of the building that way he pointed let go of me he released her hair but took her firmly by the arm and led her forward she recalled what hed said about being amercenary soldier she said if you let me go ill give you eight thousand dollars no i can get it for you right now jack was walking more slowly now he seemed to be considering what she was saying finally he shook his head not enough maybe i can get a little more she thought desperately about where she might get some cash how about fifty jack said i dont have fifty fortyfive tears in her eyes i donthave that i can get maybe twenty i dont know from friends maybe fortythree thousand jack said i she shook her head tell you what jack said you give me thirtynine thousand five hundred and ill let you live ill let you walk away more tears but i cant get that much thirtyeight two when she glanced at his face a sick smile on it she knew that he was just being cruel he was playing with her reciting the odd numbers and whether she had fifty thousand or a hundred he wasnt going to let her go this was business and the bargain hed made was with lee maisel jacks job was to kill her they were on the sidewalk now deserted except for a homeless guy in the middle of the block the street was shimmering with a light rain that wasnt so much falling as hanging in the air jack said this way and tugged her forward ahead of them on broadway a few cabs and cars bounded up and downtown maybe she could tear away and sprint the half block to the corner shed just charge right into traffic and hope she didnt get hit maybe shed be lucky the same way randy boggs wasunlucky at lance hoppers apartment building and a cop car would be cruising past but jacks grip was fierce and besides he still had his gun in his other hand hidden inside his jacket jack stopped at a car he slipped his pistol in his pocket and reached into his other pocket to get the keys hey the drunk called staggering in their direction his head drooped forward in his stupor his clothes were drenched from rain and he looked like a straggly mutt change for something to eat you got some change shit fucking people in this town jack muttered pulling the keys out of his pocket he leaned down and said to rune i can feel you honey youre thinking the guy comes up and hes going to distract me and then youll run for it you think im stupid he shoved her in the car you think im not expecting that nearby now the homeless man called change please jack his eyes still on rune said to him fuck you mister the drunk suddenly stood up and became completely sober fuck you too jack randy boggs said and leapt forward slamming his fist into jacks face randy rune cried run boggs shouted as he grabbed jack around the waist and tried to pull him to the sidewalk rune scooted out of the car fast she hesitated watching them scuffle it wasnt a fight they were wrestling boggs was gripping jacks shoulders pinning his arms so he couldnt reach his gun jack blood streaming from his nose tried to knee boggs in the groin but couldnt get his leg up without falling over run damn it boggs shouted again she did to the nearest corner to a phone kiosk hitting as she watched the men on the ground now a dark squirming mass half in half out of the street she told the calm voice of the police dispatcher about the fight about the gun by the time shed hung up she heard sirens distant but moving in close she thought she should go back distract jack hit him with something but she didnt move for some reason an image of courtney came into her mind and she thought no even if claires back i can havesome role in the girls life and it wouldnt be fair to her to risk myself this was their battle now then rune saw jack break free and scramble away he had the gun in his hand randy leapt back into the street scrambling beneath a car for cover jack fired two fast shots at him then turned to run just as three blueandwhite police cars squealed around the corner the officers poured out shouting like madmen for jack to stop to drop the gun he fired at their cars twice and turned to run but he slipped and went down on one knee drop the weapon a metallic voice came over the loudspeaker jack leapt to the side and lifted the gun again the big sparking explosion of a shotgun was like a thunderclap jack tumbled backwards he tried to get up muttering some distorted words something about pictures rune thought the fatman lay back his body convulsed once then he was still ten squad cars with lights flashing were parked in front of the network building several ems ambulances were here too and for some reason so were two fire trucks already the crowd of spectators was large rune noted with a laugh to herself that the three news crews on hand to capture the story on tape were all from the competition no one at the network seemed to have heard about the incident rune was standing next to randy boggs who leaned against a squad car his hand and chin were bandaged jack had missed when hed fired those two shots at him but hed cut himself in several places during the fight he seemed most upset because the ugly tan suit he wore was torn and greasy bradford simpson however had been hit by jacks bullet but only in the leg hed be all right lee maisel was in custody how did you get here rune asked shaking her head in confusion i went to your houseboat saw whatd happened there im plenty sorry about that did jack do it indirectly she didnt mention the actual arsonist was three years old boggs continued i just came to the tv station here to see if maybe the guard or somebody could tell me where you were i saw you and jack coming out of the back door didnt know what was going on but i figured it wasnt good and that i better do something about it so i pretended to be a you know homeless man so i could get in close a detective came up to her and said could you give us a few more details miss rune answered can we be alone for a couple minutes just him and me then ill tell you everything the detective nodded he walked over to the medical attendants who were putting jacks body on a gurney i thought youd taken off rune told boggs angrily he stared at the ground not able to return her gaze i just went down to atlanta for a day or two to get my money and then i was coming back i was going to do that all along i have some business to take care of here business she asked skeptically im giving some of my money to the family of this friend of mine from harrison he got himself killed cause he was my friend anyway icouldnt leave remember mr megler said i had to stay in new york until the case was officially over when has obeying the law ever meant anything to you rune snapped why didnt you tell me about you and jack was a new suit he said studying at his torn sleeve then he looked up focused on the flipping lights atop a squad car was the deal i made with him him rune asked in disbelief that son of a bitch way i was brought up is you dont snitch he used you know that now didnt then didnt until just a few days ago didnt you think it was kind of funny that he took you along on this credit card thing then coincidentally somebody gets killed not at the time i didnt think so and then when maybe i started to think itwas a little off he give me all that money i needed a nest egg a hundred thousand dollars whered i ever get money like that otherwise nowhere i know of runes head swam with painful emotions wanted to slap him to scream to grab his thin collar and shake him randy boggs said im sorry she didnt answer i coulda just left im thinking of going to hawaii after everything gets settled in court you know i coulda just got my money and kept going there hawaii she asked as if hed said mars he nodded buy me a store of some kind on the weekends i could sit on the beach and drink those drinks that look like pineapples with umbrellas in them you could come visit you like them drinks she didnt answer i wanta give you some money rune said me why it was on account of me that your house got burned down hows ten thousand i dont want your money maybe fifteen no forget it maybe your little girl shesnot my little girl rune snapped neither of them spoke for a moment then boggs said im just trying to tell you im sorry rune said i wanted to help you that was why i did the story in the first place everybody told me not to everybody told me to forget about you that youd killed a man and that you deserved to be in jail boggs said id appreciate it if youd consider taking the money give it to courtneys mother claire she needs it more than me ill give her some sure but ill give you some too hows that rune slapped the top of the police car she shook her head then laughed boggs was looking around smiling too though he didnt know what was funny she said hell randy no wonder you never made any money you give it all away havent held on to it too good that much is true she turned to him and said i need to do my story again ill have to interview you will you talk to me and this time give me thewhole story if i do that will you forgive me she said i really dont know could we go drink beer some time i dont go out with felons ive done some things thatrecriminal i admit that but im not sure im a felon exactly the detective returned and said to rune need to get some statements from you both now he was in his politely firm civilservant mode sure she answered he took boggs aside first and for the moment rune was alone surrounded by a pool of dull colors on the wet street reflections from the streetlights from apartment windows from the emergency cars she felt a huge desire to get home to go back to her houseboat and to courtney but of course the boat was gone and the little girl was with her grandmother rune looked at the scene in front of her the news crews at last joined by one from the network were busy taping their threeminute segments on the shooting but they were virtually the only ones left on the street like the explosion of the shotgun that killed jack nestor the incident had erupted fast and then vanished immediately pulled into the huge gears of the city and ground up into nothing but for tv audiences throughout the metro area the events would live on in future newscasts until they were preempted by other stories which would in turn be replaced by still more after that rune sat down on a doorstep to wait for the detective and to watch the young reporters holding their microphones and gazing sincerely into the eyes of their loyal viewers as they tried once again to explain the inexplicable wrestle with it fight it standing in front of claires hospital bed rune wore a white sleeveless tshirt and black miniskirt beside her was courtney who was no longer new wave preschool no more black and dayglo and studs she was in her new laura ashley cornflowerblue dress and lopsided hair ribbon it had taken rune ten minutes to get the navyblue satin to impersonate a bow a sharp sweet smell was in the air rune didnt know whether it was disinfectant or medicine or the smell of illness and death she didnt like it she hated hospitals wheres your mom rune asked claire at her hotel the girl said she was with me all night thats something about mothers huh abuse em all you want and they keep coming back for more courtney clumsily set a paper bag on the bed i got this for you onehanded claire shook it open out fell a stuffed dinosaur courtney made it walk across the bed rune helped me buy it her daughter told her howd i guess claire examined the plush face with serious scrutiny hes like sensitive and ferocious at the same time you can really pick them rune nodded absently its a talent fight it fight it down claire didnt look good she could sit up okay with some help but otherwise she was pretty immobile her skin was paler than rune had ever seen it and claire was somebody who went as a vampire on halloween the year before and hadnt bothered with a costume i wont see in my left eye she announced matteroffactly ever again rune looked her straight in the good one and was about to offer something sympathetic when claire moved on to another subject i got this job at a department store its kinda bullshit i have a couple bosses and theyre like well well try you out and im like whats to try its not like the best thing in the world but its working out okay like listen to this ive got health insurance i got it just before i left to come down here man theyre going to get some friggin bill this room was better than the intensive care unit where shed been for a few days from here claire had a view of rolling jersey hills and the hudson and closer to home one of runes favorite hangouts the white horse tavern the poet dylan thomass hangout where rune had spent a number of afternoons and evenings with a literary and artistic crowd hospitals were pretty icky but here at least you got a view and sunlight and history claire was talking about her mothers house in boston and how weird it was that nobody in the neighborhood wore black leather or had shaved heads and how she hadnt met any musicians or shortstory writers but the one guy she met who she liked was a salesman wasnt that the craziest thing you ever heard crazy rune nodded and tried to listen the muscles in her abdomen clenched against the crawly feeling like she was possessed by a space creature that was getting ready to burst out of her fight it down fight it then claire was into a travelogue telling rune and courtney about boston faneuil hall and cambridge and chinatown and the lofts and antique stores around south street station theres this one really really neat place it sells old bathtubs that must be three feet deep rune nodded politely and a couple times said wow thats interesting in an uninterested way which claire seemed to take as encouragement to keep rambling rune found she was holding courtneys hand tightly the little girl squirmed fight it rune didnt say much about boggs or maisel or thecurrent events story just the bare bones claire must have known rune was the reason shed been shot and rune wanted to steer clear of that not that she was racked with guilt you could also say that claire got hurt because shed abandoned her daughter but that got into the way gods or fate or nature worked and if you started thinking too much about cause and effect rune knew itd drive you nuts there was silence for a minute then rune said i bought court a new dress nodding at the little girl look mommy claire twisted her body as far as she could so the unbandaged eye got a good look at the dress and the way the young womans damaged face blossomed with love as she looked at her little girl clearly answered the single scorching question that had been consuming rune since claire had returned when she considered it now of course she realized there really had never been any chance that courtney could stay with her and she was mad at herself for hoping things might turn out otherwise after all shed readthe snow princess she knew how it ended this business about fairy stories having happy endings that was bullshit sometimes people melt people go away people die and were left with the stories and the memories which if were lucky will be good stories and good memories and then we get on with our life claire was reaching forward awkwardly across the bed with her good arm saying did you miss me honey uhhuh courtney let go of runes hand and tried to climb onto the bed rune boosted her up rune said so youre going back to boston huh the two of you claire said yeah like well live at my moms until i can get some money saved up but apartments are cheap there it shouldnt take me much time fight it rune swallowed you want i can keep courtney with me until you get settled were pretty good buddies huh the little girl was playing with the dinosaur and didn t hear what rune said or didnt want to in any case she didnt answer claire shook her head i kind of want her with me you know how it is sure look rune i never said it but i like really really appreciate what you did it was a pretty bad thing just leaving like that a lot of people wouldnt have done what you did true they wouldnt rune said i owe you yeah you do you owe me the doctor says i can be transferred to boston in a couple of days and guess what runes face burned a couple of days im gonna take an ambulance like the whole way is that cool or what my moms paying for it and with that rune realized it was no good fighting it anymore shed lost she took a deep breath and said well ciao you guys aw come on claire said stay for a while check out the doctors theres this cute one curly hair you wont believe rune shook her head and started for the door rune courtney said suddenly can we go to the zoo pausing to hug the girl briefly she managed somehow to keep her voice steady and to hold back the tears for the time it took her to say before you leave honey well go to the zoo i promise rune remained steady and calm for the few seconds it took her to say this and walk out the door but not an instant longer and as rune walked down the corridor toward the exit the tears streamed fast and the quiet sobbing stole her breath as if she were being swept away drowning and numb in a torrent of melting snow look at this like a damn dragon burned me out piper sutton looked at her you and your dragons they stood on the pier where the glistening scorched hull of the houseboat floated hardly bobbing in the oily water of the hudson rune bent down and picked up a soggy dress she examined the cloth the collar was a little scorched but she might be able to cover it up with paint she thought about the lawyer fred megler an expert at repairing clothes with pens but she sniffed the dress shrugged and threw it into the discard pile which looked like a small volcano of trash both the fire and the water from the nyfd had taken their toll on the deck was a pile of books pots and pans some halfmelted running shoes drinking glasses nothing real valuable had survived only the motorola tv and the wroughtiron frames of the butterfly chairs the s were indestructible rune said nodding at the frames mustve been one hell of a decade it was a stunningly gorgeous sunday the sky was a cloudless dome of threedimensional blue and the sun felt as hot as a lightbulb piper sutton sat on a piling shed covered with a scrap of blue cloth one of runes work shirts before shed lowered her blacksuedeencased thighs onto the splintery wood you have insurance the anchorwoman asked kinda weird but yeah i do it was one of those adult things you know the sort that i dont usually get into but my boyfriend at the time made me get some she walked to the water and looked down at the charred wood the policys in there someplace do i have to have it to collect i dont think so im going to make some serious money there i lost some really hyper stuff dayglo posters crystals my entire elvis collection you listen to elvis presley thatd be costello rune explained then considered other losses my magic wand a ton of incense oh god my lava lamp you have a lava lamp hadrune corrected sadly wherere you staying with sam for a while then ill get a new place someplace different i was ready to move anyway i lived here for over a year thats too long to be in one place a tugboat went by a horn blared rune waved i know them she told sutton who twisted around to watch the lowriding boat muscle its way up the river you know rune said ive got to tell you i kind of thought you were the one behind the killings me sutton wasnt laughing thats the stupidest crap i ever heard i dont think its so stupid you tried to talk me out of doing the story then offered me that job in england which was real sutton snapped and got filled by somebody else rune continued unfazed and the day of the broadcast when you adlibbed the tapes were missing even the backup in my credenza you were the only one knew they were there sutton impatiently motioned with her hand as if she were buying candy by the pound and wanted rune to keep adding some to the scale come on think think think i told you i was on my way to see lee he asked me if youd made a dupe i told him that you had and youd put it in your credenza hes the one who stole it you also went through my desk after boggs escaped danny saw you the electrician i didnt want any of that material floating around you were really careless by the way you trust too many people you she realized she was lecturing and reined herself in they watched the tugboat for a few minutes until it disappeared then sutton said abruptly you want your job back you can have it i dont know rune said i dont think im a company person a brief laugh of course youre not youll probably get fired again but its a peach job until you do the local or the network current events i was thinking doing what like a script girl assistant producer rune paused then dropped a pair of scorched jeans into the trash pile id want to do the story the whole thing about the hopper killing and id have to include lee this time sutton turned back away from the water and stood up looking over the huge panorama of the city thats a problem what do you mean current eventswont be running any segments about the hopper killing or about boggs rune looked at her network news covered it the woman said rune said wryly oh thats right i saw that story it was about sixty seconds long wasnt it and it came after the story of the baby panda at the national zoo the powersthatbe at the parent decided the story should go away thats bullshit can you blame them yes rune said in her prototype piper sutton voice piper sutton snapped it wasnt my decision to make wasnt it sutton took a breath to speak then didnt she shook her head slowly avoiding runes eyes rune repeated wasnt it and surprised herself again by hearing how calm she sounded how unshaken she now was in the presence of this woman a woman who wore suede and silk and bright red suits a woman richer and smarter than shed ever be a famous commentator who now seemed abandoned by words rune said youd rather the competition did the story prime time tonight orpulse of the nation sutton stepped up on a creosoted railroad tie bolted into the pier as a car barrier she looked in the water her expression said she didnt like what she saw rune wondered if it was her reflection she said simply the story wont run oncurrent events what would happen if it did if you want to know i posed that exact question and the answer was if it does the parentll cancel the show then she added and ill be out of work you need a better reason than that i dont think i want my job back no rune said shed found some of her old comic books theyd miraculously survived both the fire and looters she looked at the cover of a classic sheena queen of the jungle who swung out of a tree toward a startled lion the cat stared at her spear and radiant blonde hair and leopardskinclad hourglass figure a physique that existed only in the luxurious imaginations of illustrators thats me rune held up the book queen of the jungle sutton glanced at the picture rune stacked the books in the small tobesaved pile and asked your conscience bothering you yet ive never had trouble sleeping at night not in fortythree years you want my opinion not really youre caving just to keep your paycheck rune expected a tirade but what she got was a surprise a small hurt voice saying i think you know its not that and after a moment rune nodded understanding that sutton was right sure shed bowed to the wishes of the executives but the reasons were complex shed caved partly because she was hooked on the prestige and excitement that went with being a primetime news anchor partly to keep a job that shed fought hard for and partly mostly because piper sutton felt the world of journalism and her ten million viewers needed her which of course they did they needed the news handed to them by people like this people they recognized trusted admired an old boyfriend had once quoted somebody a poet she thought who said that mankind cant bear too much reality well it was the piper suttons of the world who cut reality into manageable little bites and set them out pleasantly arranged in front of her viewers i put it in context sutton shrugged boggs was innocent and you got him out thats a good deed but its still a small story theres a lot of news out there a lot bigger news nobody says ive got to cover everything ill produce it independently rune sounded more threatening than she meant to sutton laughed bless you babes and more power to you all im telling you is the story wont run on the network not on my program rune turned to face sutton and if i do it im going to mention the part about how they wouldnt do the story oncurrent events sutton smiled ill send you the files and all backup the stuff i saved from your desk give us your best shot we can take it rune returned to her pile of salvage itll be a son of a bitch to do by myself sutton agreed sure will you know i could use a business partner somebody who was smart and knew the business and was like abrasive likeabrasive you wouldnt be interested would you wait you mean quit my job and go to work with you sutton laughed genuinely amused sure wed be a great team no way in hell the anchorwoman walked over to the messy pile and began to help rune pick through it shed hold up an object and rune would give her instructions save pitch pitch pitch identity unknown pile save save they worked for a half hour until sutton straightened up and looked at her smudged hands with a grimace she found a rag and started wiping them clean what time you have rune glanced at her working watch noon sutton asked you interested in getting some brunch i cant today im going to the zoo with somebody a date huh not hardly rune said hey you want to come sutton was shaking her head which rune figured was probably her reflex reaction to invitations of this sort i havent been to the zoo in years she said laughing its like riding a bike rune said itll come right back to you i dont know come on let me think about it sutton stopped shaking her head aw come on i said ill think about it sutton snapped you cant ask for more than that sure i can rune said adamantly the anchorwoman ignored her and together they crouched down in front of the pile of mystery artifacts and began picking through it looking for more of runes damaged treasures
