songs of love death for everyone weve loved and lost you know who you are starcrossed lovers the earliest reference we can find for the phrase starcrossed lovers traces it to attributing it to shakespeares romeo and juliet a tragedy about the doomed romance that blossoms between a young man and a young woman on the brawling streets of verona a romance that is destined to fail because the families they come from are locked in a deadly feud from forth the fatal loins of these two foes a pair of starcrossd lovers take their life its an astrological phrase of course stemming from the old belief still held today by millions of people as a look at any newspaper will tell you that the position of the stars at your birth casts a supernatural influence that determines your fate so to say that a romantic relationship is starcrossed is to say that the influence of the stars are working against it that its opposed by fate illfated thwarted by a malign star not meant to be that youre destined to be kept apart no matter how hard you struggle to be together in real life even without the influence of the stars or the dread hand of fate there are any number of things that can doom a relationshipdifferences in temperament race religion social status political affiliations being on different sides of a bitter war philosophical dogma degrees of affluence or lack of it even simple distance can work to keep people apart and over the centuries there must have been many lovers who stood on the dock and watched their loved ones sail off to destinations like australia or america thousands of miles away knowing that theyd never see them again since in the days before modern transportation they might as well have been sailing off to mars many many immigrants must have left someone behind them in the old country as they were forced into exile or set off to find their fortunes and most were never reunited this is a theme that has been eagerly embraced by fiction and

bodies and said love hurts i ducked under the crime scene tape and entered the wrigleyville apartment the smell of blood and death was thick it made gallows humor inevitable murphy stood there looking at me she wasnt offering explanations that meant she wanted an unbiased opinion from cpds special investigations consultantwho is me harry dresden as far as i know i am the only wizard on the planet earning a significant portion of his income working for a law enforcement agency i stopped and looked around taking inventory two bodies naked male and female still intertwined in the act one little pistol illegal in chicago lying upon the limp fingers of the woman two gunshot wounds to the temples one each there were two overlapping fanshaped splatters of blood and more had soaked into the carpet the bodies stank like hell some very unromantic things had happened to them after death i walked a little farther into the room and looked around somewhere in the apartment an old vinyl was playing queen freddie wondered who wanted to live forever as i listened the song ended and began again a few seconds later popping and scratching nostalgically the walls were covered in photographs i dont mean that there were a lot of pictures on the wall like at greatgrandmas house i mean covered in photographs entirely completely papered i glanced up so was the ceiling i took a moment to walk slowly around looking at pictures all of them every single one of them featured the two dead people together posed somewhere and looking deliriously happy i walked and peered plenty of the pictures were nearduplicates in most details except that the subjects wore different sets of clothinggenerally cutesy matching tshirts most of the sites were tourist spots within chicago it was as if the couple had gone on the same vacation tour every day over and over again collecting the same general batch of pictures each time matching tshirts i said creepy murphys smile was unpleasant she was a tiny compactly muscular woman with blond hair and a button nose id say that she was so cute i just wanted to put her in my pocket but if i tried to do it shed break my arm murph knows martial arts she waited and said nothing another suicide pact thats the third one this month i gestured at the pictures though the others werent quite so cuckoo for cocoa puffs or ah in medias res i shrugged and gestured at the obsessive photographs this is just crazy murphy lifted one pale eyebrow ever so slightly remind me how much do we pay you to give us advice sherlock i grimaced yeah yeah i know i was quiet for a while and then said what were their names greg and cindy bardalacki murphy said seemingly unconnected dead people but they share similar patterns of death now were upgrading to irrational and obsessive behavior as a precursor i frowned i checked several of the pictures and went over to eye the bodies oh i said oh hells bells murphy arched an eyebrow no wedding rings anywhere i said no wedding pictures and i finally found a framed family picture which looked to have been there for a while among all the snapshots greg and cindy were both in it along with an older couple and a younger man jesus murph i said they werent a married couple they were brother and sister murphy eyed the intertwined bodies there were no signs of struggle clothes champagne flutes and an empty bubbly bottle lay scattered married no she said couple yes she was unruffled shed already worked that out for herself ick i said but that explains it explains what these two they were togetherand they went insane doing it this has the earmarks of someone tampering with their minds murphy squinted at me why i spread my hands lets say greg and cindy bump into bad guy x bad guy x gets into their heads and makes them fall wildly in love and lust with each other theres nothing they can do about the feelingswhich seem perfectly naturalbut on some level theyre aware that what theyre doing is not what they want and dementedly wrong besides their compromised conscious minds clash with their subconscious and i gestured at pictures and it escalates until they cant handle it anymore and bang i shot murphy with my thumb and forefinger if youre right they arent the deceased murphy said theyre the victims big difference which is it wish i could say i told her but the only evidence that could prove it one way or another is leaking out onto the floor if we get a survivor maybe i could take a peek and see but barring that were stuck with legwork murphy sighed and looked down two suicide pacts couldtechnicallybe a coincidence three of them no way its natural this feels more like somethings mo could it be another one of those skavis vampires they gun for loners i said shaking my head these deaths dont fit their profile so youre telling me that we need to turn up a common denominator to link the victims gosh i wish i could have thought of that on my own i winced yeah i glanced over at a couple of other si detectives in the room taking pictures of the bodies and documenting the walls and so on forensics wasnt on site they dont like to waste their time on the suicides of the emotionally disturbed regardless of how bizarre they might be that was crap work and as such had been dutifully passed to si i lowered my voice if someone is playing mind games the council might know something ill try to pick up the trail on that end you start from here hopefully ill earn my pay and well meet in the middle right murph stared at the bodies and her eyes were haunted she knew what it was like to be the victim of mental manipulation i didnt reach out to support her she hated showing vulnerability and i didnt want to point out to her that id noticed freddie reached a crescendo which told us that love must die murphy sighed and called for the love of god someone turn off that damned record im sorry harry captain luccio said we dont exactly have orbital satellites for detecting black magic i waited a second to be sure that she was finished the presence of so much magical talent on the far end of the call meant that at times the lag could stretch out between chicago and edinburgh the headquarters of the white council of wizardry anastasia luccio captain of the wardens my exgirlfriend had been readily forthcoming with the information the council had on any shenanigans going on in chicagowhich was exactly nothing too bad we dont eh i asked unofficiallyis there anyone who might know anything the gatekeeper perhaps he has a gift for sensing problem areas but no one has seen him for weeks which is hardly unusual and frankly warden dresden youre supposed to be the one giving us this kind of information her voice was half teasing half deadly serious what do you think is happening three couples apparently loveydovey as hell have committed dual suicide in the past two weeks i told her the last two were brother and sister there were some seriously irrational components to their behavior you suspect mental tampering she said her voice was hard luccio had been a victim too i found myself smiling somewhat bitterly at no one she had been among other things mindboinked into going out with me which was apparently the only way anyone would date me lately it seems a reasonable suspicion ill let you know what i turn up use caution she said dont enter any suspect situation without backup on hand theres too much chance that you could be compromised compromised i asked of the two people having this conversation which one of them exposed the last guy rearranging peoples heads touché luccio said but he got away with it because we were overconfident so use caution anyway planning on it i said there was a moment of awkward silence and then anastasia said how have you been harry keeping busy i said she had already apologized to me sort of for abruptly walking out of my personal life shed never intended to be there in the first place there had been a real emotional tsunami around the events of last year and i wasnt the one who had gotten the most hurt by them you keeping busy she was quiet for a moment and then said i know its over but im glad for the time we had together it made me happy sometimes i miss feeling that i thought completing the sentence my throat felt tight nothing wrong with happy no there isnt when its real her voice softened be careful harry please i will i said i started combing the supernatural world for answers and got almost nothing the little folk who could usually be relied on to provide some kind of information had nothing for me their memory for detail is very short and the deaths had happened too long ago to get me anything but conflicting gibberish i made several mental nighttime sweeps through the city using the scale model of chicago in my basement and got nothing but a headache for my trouble i called around the paranet the organization of folk with only modest magical gifts the kind who often found themselves being preyed upon by more powerful supernatural beings they worked together now sharing information communicating successful techniques and generally overcoming their lack of raw magical muscle with mutually supportive teamwork they didnt have anything for me either i hit mcannallys a hub of the supernatural social scene and asked a lot of questions no one had any answers then i started contacting the people i knew in the scene starting with the ones i thought most likely to provide information i worked my way methodically down the list crossing out names until i got to ask random people on the street there are days when i dont feel like much of a wizard or an investigator or a wizard investigator ordinary pis have a lot of days like that where you look and look and look for information and find nothing i get fewer of those days than most on account of the whole wizard thing giving me a lot more optionsbut sometimes i come up goose eggs anyway i just hate doing it when lives may be in danger four days later all i knew was that nobody knew about any black magic happening in chicago and the only traces of it i did find were the miniscule amounts of residue left from black magic wrought by those without enough power to be a threat warden ramirez had coined the phrase dim magic to describe that kind of petty essentially harmless malice there were also the usual traces of dim magic performed subconsciously from a bed of dark emotions probably by someone who might not even know they had a gift in other words goose eggs fortunately murphy got the job done sometimes hard work is way better than magic murphys saturn had gotten a little blown up a couple of years back sort of my fault and what with her demotion and all it would be a while before shed be able to afford something besides her old harley for some reason she didnt want to take the motorcycle so that left my car the evertrusty almost always blue beetle its an oldschool vw bug which had seen me through one nasty scrape after another more than once it had been pounded badly but always it had risen to do battle once moreif by battle one means driving somewhere at a sedate speed without much acceleration and only middling gas mileage dont start its paid for i stopped outside murphys little white house with its little pink rose garden and rolled down the window on the passenger side make like the dukes of hazzard i said doors stuck murphy gave me a narrow look then she tried the door it opened easily she slid into the passenger seat with a smug smile closed the door and didnt say anything police work has made you cynical i said if you want to ogle my butt youll just have to work for it like everyone else harry i snorted and put the car in gear where we going nowhere until you buckle up she said putting her own seat belt on its my car i said its the law you want to get cited cause i can do that i debated whether or not it was worth it while she gave me her cop look and produced a ballpoint pen i buckled up murphy beamed at me springfield head for i i grunted kind of out of your jurisdiction if we were investigating something murphy said were not were going to the fair i eyed her sidelong on a date sure if someone asks she said offhand then she froze for a second and added its a reasonable cover story right i said her cheeks looked a little pink neither of us said anything for a little while i merged onto the highway always fun in a car originally designed to rocket down the autobahn at a blistering one hundred kilometers an hour and asked murphy springfield state fair she said that was the common denominator i frowned going over the dates in my head state fair only runs what ten days murphy nodded they shut down tonight but the first couple died twelve days ago they were both volunteer staff for the fair and they were down there on the grounds setting up murphy lifted a foot to rest her heel on the edge of the passenger seat frowning out the window i found skeeball tickets and one of those chintzy stuffed animals in the second couples apartment and the bardalackis got pulled over for speeding on i five minutes out of springfield and bound for chicago so maybe they went to the fair i said or maybe they were just taking a road trip or something murphy shrugged possibly but if i assume that its a coincidence it doesnt get me anywhereand weve got nothing if i assume that theres a connection weve got a possible answer i beamed at her i thought you didnt like reading parker she eyed me that doesnt mean his logic isnt sound oh right she exhaled heavily its the best ive got i just hope that if i get you into the general area you can pick up on whatever is going on yeah i said thinking of walls papered in photographs me too the thing i enjoy the most about places like the state fair is the smells you get combinations of smells at such events like none found anywhere else popcorn roast nuts and fast food predominate and you can get anything you want to clog your arteries or burn out your stomach lining there chili dogs funnel cakes fried bread majorly greasy pizza candy apples ye gods evil food smells amazingwhich is either proof that there is a satan or some equivalent out there or that the almighty doesnt actually want everyone to eat organic tofu all the time i cant decide other smells are a cross section depending on where youre standing disinfectant and filth walking by the porta potties exhaust and burnt oil and sunbaked asphalt and gravel in the parking lots sunlight on warm bodies suntan lotion cigarette smoke and beer near some of the attendees the pungent honest smell of livestock near the animal shows stock contests or pony ridesall of it charging right up your nose i like indulging my sense of smell smell is the hardest sense to lie to murphy and i got started midmorning walking around the fair in a methodical search pattern it took us all day the state fair is not a rinkydink event dammit she said weve been here for hours you sure you havent sniffed out anything nothing like what were looking for i said i was afraid of this of what a lot of times magic like thiscomplex longlasting subtle darkdoesnt thrive well in sunlight i glanced at the lengthening shadows give it another half an hour and well try again murphy frowned at me i thought you always said magic isnt about good and evil neither is sunshine murphy exhaled her displeasure plain you might have mentioned it to me before no way to know until we tried i said think of it this way maybe were just looking in the exact wrong place she sighed and squinted around at the nearby food trailers and concession stands ugh think theres anything here that wont make me split my jeans at the seams i beamed probably not how about dogs and a funnel cake bastard murphy growled then okay i realized we were being followed halfway through my second hot dog i kept myself from reacting took another bite and said maybe this is the place after all murphy had found a place selling turkey drumsticks she had cut the meat from the bone and onto a paper plate and was eating it with a plastic fork she didnt stop chewing or look up whatcha got guy in a maroon tee and tan bdu pants about twenty feet away off your right shoulder ive seen him at least two other times today doesnt necessarily mean hes following us hes been busy doing nothing in particular all three times murphy nodded fiveeight or so long hair little soul tuft under his mouth yeah he was sitting on a bench when i came out of the portapotty murphy said also doing nothing she shrugged and went back to eating how do you want to play it were here with a zillion people harry she deepened her voice and blocked out any hint of a nasal tone you want i should whack him until he talks i grunted and finished my hot dog doesnt necessarily mean anything maybe hes got a crush on you murphy snorted maybe hes got a crush on you i covered a respectable belch with my hand and reached for my funnel cake who could blame him i took a bite and nodded all right well see what happens then murphy nodded and sipped at her diet coke will says you and anastasia broke up a while back will talks too much i said darkly she glanced a little bit away hes your friend he worries about you i studied her averted face for a moment and then nodded well i said tell will he doesnt need to worry it sucked it sucks less now ill be fine fish in the sea never meant to be et cetera i paused over another bite of funnel cake and asked hows kincaid the way he always is murphy said you get to be a few centuries old you get a little set in your ways she shook her head its his type hed be that way if he was twenty he walks his own road and doesnt let anyone make him do differently like she stopped before she could say who kincaid was like she ate her turkey leg a shiver passed over the fair a tactile sensation to my wizards senses sundown twilight would go on for a while yet but the light left in the sky would no longer hold the creatures of the night at bay murphy glanced up at me sensing the change in my level of tension she finished off her drink while i stuffed the last of the funnel cake into my mouth and we stood up together the western sky was still a little bit orange when i finally sensed magic at work we were near the carnival a section of the fair full of garishly lit rides heavily slanted games of chance and chintzy attractions of every kind it was full of screaming excited little kids parents with frayed patience and fashionenslaved teenagers music tinkled and brayed tinny tunes lights flashed and danced barkers bleated out cajolement encouragement and condolences in almostequal measures we drifted through the merry chaos our maroonshirted tail following along ten to twenty yards behind i walked with my eyes half closed giving no more heed to my vision than a bloodhound on a trail murphy stayed beside me her expression calm her blue eyes alert for physical danger then i felt ita quiver in the air no more noticeable than the fading hum from a gently plucked guitar string i noted its direction and walked several more paces before checking again in an attempt to triangulate the source of the disturbance i got a rough fix on it in under a minute and realized that i had stopped and was staring harry murphy asked what is it something down there i said nodding to the midway its faint but its something murph inhaled sharply this must be the place there goes our tail we didnt have to communicate the decision to each other if the tail belonged to whoever was behind this we couldnt let him get away to give the culprit forewarningand odds were excellent that the man in maroons sudden rabbit impersonation would result in him leading us somewhere interesting we turned and gave pursuit a footrace on open ground is one thing running through a crowded carnival is something else entirely you cant sprint unless you want to wind up falling down a lot and attracting attention you have to hurry along hopping between clusters of people never really getting the chance to pour on the gas the danger in a chase like this isnt that the quarry will outrun you but that youll lose him in the crowd i had a huge advantage im freakishly tall i could see over everyone and spot mr maroon bobbing and weaving his way through the crowd i took the lead and murphy followed i got within a couple of long steps of maroon but was interdicted by a gaggle of seniors in shriners caps he caught a break at the same time a stretch of open ground beyond the shriners and by the time i got through i saw maroon handing tickets to a carnie he hopped up onto a platform got into a little rollercoaster style car and vanished into an attraction dammit murphy said panting what now behind the attraction advertised as the tunnel of terror there was an empty space the interior of a circle of several similar rides and games there wouldnt be anyone to hide behind in there you take the back ill watch the front whoever spots him gives a shout got it murphy hurried off around the tunnel of terror she frowned at a little plastic barrier with an authorized personnel only notice on it then calmly ignored it and went on over anarchist i muttered and settled down to wait for maroon to figure out hed been treed he didnt appear the dingy little roller coaster car came wheezing slowly out of the opposite side of the platform empty the carnie an old fellow with a scruffy white beard didnt noticehe was dozing in his chair murphy returned a few seconds later there are two doors on the back she reported both of them chained and locked from the outside he didnt come out that way i inhaled and nodded at the empty car not here either look we cant just stand around maybe hes running through a tunnel or something weve got to know if hes inside ill go flush him out she said you pick him up when he shows no way i said we stay with our wingi glanced at murphyperson the power i sensed came from somewhere nearby if we split up were about a million times more vulnerable to mental manipulation and if this guy is more than he appears neither of us wants to take him solo she grimaced nodded and we started toward the tunnel of terror together the old carnie woke up as we came up the ramp let out a wheezing cough and pointed to a sign that required us to give him three tickets each for the ride i hadnt bought any and the ticket counter was more than far enough away for maroon to scamper if we stopped to follow the rules sir murphy said a man were looking for just went into your attraction but he didnt come out again we need to go in and look for him he blinked gummy eyes at murphy and said three tickets you dont understand she said a fugitive may be hiding inside the tunnel of terror we need to check and see if hes there the carnie snorted three tickets missy though it aint the nicest room you two could rent murphys jaw muscles flexed i stepped forward hey man i said harry dresden pi if you wouldnt mind all we need to do is get inside for five minutes he eyed me pi huh i produced my license and showed it to him he eyed it and then me you dont look like no private investigator i ever saw wheres your hat in the shop i said transmission gave out i winked at him and held up a folded twenty between my first and second finger five minutes he yawned naw cant let nobody run around loose in there he reached out and took the twenty then again what you and your lady friend mutually consent to do once youre inside aint my affair he rose pulled a lever and gestured at the car mount up he leered and keep your ah extremities inside the car at all times we got in and i was nearly scalded by the steam coming out of murphys ears you just had to play along with that one we needed to get inside i said just doing my job sergeant she snorted hey murph look i said holding up a strap of old worn leather seat belts she gave me a look that could have scoured steel then with a stubborn set of her jaw secured the flimsy thing her expression dared me to object i grinned and relaxed it isnt easy to really get murphs goat and get away with it on the other side of the platform the carnie pulled another lever and a moment later the little cart started rolling forward at the blazing speed of one maybe even two miles an hour a dark curtain parted ahead of us and we rolled into the tunnel of terror murphy promptly drew her gunit was dark but i heard the scratch of its barrel on plastic as she drew it from its holster she snapped a small led flashlight into its holster beneath the gun barrel and flicked it on we were in a cramped little tunnel every surface painted black and there was absolutely nowhere for maroon to be hiding i shook out the charm bracelet on my left wrist preparing defensive energies in case they were needed murph and i had been working together long enough to know our roles if trouble came i would defend us murphy and her sig would reply a door opened at the end of the little hallway and we rolled forward into an open set dressed to look like a rustic farmhouse with a lot of subtle details meant to be scarysevered fingers at the base of the chickenchopping stump just below the bloody ax glowing eyes appearing in an upstairs window of the farmhouse that kind of thing there was no sign of maroon and precious little place for him to hide better get that seat belt off i told her we want to be able to move fast if it comes to that yeah she said and reached down just as something huge and terrifying dropped onto the car from the shadows above us screaming adrenaline hit my system like a runaway bus and i looked up to see a decidedly demonic scarecrow hanging a few feet above our heads bouncing on its wires and playing a recording of cackling mad laughter jesus christ murphy breathed lowering her gun she was a little white around the eyes we looked at each other and both burst into high nervous laughs tunnel of terror murphy said we are so cool total badasses i said grinning the car continued its slow grind forward and murphy unfastened the seat belt we moved into the next area meant to be a zombieinfested hospital it had a zombie mannequin which burst out of a closet near the track and plenty of gore we got out of the car and scouted a couple of spots where he might have been but wasnt then we hopped into the car again before it could leave the set so it went on through a ghoulish graveyard a troglodyteteaming cavern and a literal old west ghost town we came up with nothing but we moved well as a team better than i could remember doing with anyone before everything felt as smooth and natural as if wed been moving together our whole lives we did it in total silence too divining what each other would do through pure instinct even great teams lose a game here or there though we came up with diddly and emerged from the tunnel of terror with neither maroon nor any idea where hed gone hells bells i muttered this week has been an investigative suckfest for me murphy tittered again you said suck i grinned at her and looked around well i said we dont know where maroon went if they hadnt made us already they have now can you pick up on the signalwhatsit again energy signature i said maybe its pretty vague though im not sure how much more precise i can get lets find out she said i nodded right then we started around the suspect circle of attractions moving slowly and trying to blend into the crowds when a couple of rowdy kids went by one chasing the other i put an arm around her shoulders and drew her into the shelter of my body so that she wouldnt get bowled over she exhaled slowly and did not step away from me my heart started beating faster harry she said quietly yeah you and me why havent we ever she looked up at me why not the usual i guess i said quietly trouble duty other people involved she shook her head why not she repeated her eyes direct all these years have gone by and something could have happened but it never did why not i licked my lips just like that we just decide to be together her eyelids lowered why not my heart did the drum solo from wipe out why not i bent my head down to her mouth and kissed her very gently she turned into the kiss pressing her body against mine it was a little bit awkward i was most of two feet taller than she was we made up for grace with enthusiasm her arms twining around my neck as she kissed me hungry and deep whoa i said drawing back a moment later work right she looked at me for a moment her cheeks pink her lips a little swollen from the kiss and said right she closed her eyes and nodded right work first then dinner i asked dinner my place we can order in my belly trembled in sudden excitement at that proposition right i looked around so lets find this thing and get it over with we started moving again a circuit around the attractions got me no closer to the source of the energy id sensed earlier dammit i said when wed completed the pattern frustrated hey murphy said dont beat yourself up about it harry her hand slipped into mine our fingers intertwining ive been a cop a long time you dont always get the bad guy and if you go around blaming yourself for it you wind up crawling into a bottle or eating your own gun thank you i said quietly but heh murphy said you said but we both grinned like fools i looked down at our twined hands i like this so do i murphy said why didnt we do this a long time ago beats me are we just that stupid she asked i mean people in general are we really so blind that we miss whats right there in front of us as a species were essentially insane i said so yeah probably i lifted our hands and kissed her fingertips im not missing it now though her smile lit up several thousand square feet of the midway good the echo of a thought rattled around in my head insane oh i said oh hells bells she frowned at me what murph i think we got whammied she blinked at me what no we didnt i think we did i didnt see anything or feel anything i mean nothing harry ive felt magic like that before look at us i said waving our joined hands weve been friends a long time harry she said and weve had a couple of near misses before this time we just didnt screw it up thats all thats happening here what about kincaid i asked her she mulled over that one for a second then she said i doubt hell even notice im gone she frowned at me harry i havent been this happy in i never thought i could feel this way again about anyone my heart continued to go pitapat i know exactly what you mean i said i feel the same way her smile warmed even more then whats the problem isnt that what love is supposed to be like effortless i had to think about that one for a second and then i said carefully and slowly murph think about it what do you mean you know how good this is i asked yeah how right it feels she nodded yeah how easy it was she nodded energetically her eyes bright i leaned down toward her for emphasis it just isnt fucked up enough to really be you and me her smile faltered my god she said her eyes widening we got whammied we returned to the tunnel of terror i dont get it she said i dont i didnt feel anything happen i dont feel any different now i thought being aware of this kind of thing made it go away no i said but it helps sometimes do you still i squeezed her hand once more before letting go yeah i said i still feel it is it is it going to go away i didnt answer her i didnt know or maybe i didnt want to know the old carnie saw us coming and his face flickered with apprehension as soon as he looked at us he stood up and looked from the control board for the ride to the entranceway to the interior yeah i muttered sneaky bastard you just try it he flicked one of the switches and shambled toward the tunnels entrance i made a quick effort of will raised a hand and swept it in a horizontal arc snarling forzare unseen force knocked his legs out from beneath him and tossed him into an involuntary pratfall murphy and i hurried up onto the platform before he could get to his feet and run we neednt have bothered the carnie was apparently a genuine old guy not some supernatural being in disguise he lay on the platform moaning in pain i felt kind of bad for beating up a senior citizen but hey on the other hand he did swindle me out of twenty bucks murphy stood over him her blue eyes cold and said wheres the bolt hole the carnie blinked at her what the trap door she snapped the secret cabinet where is he i frowned and walked toward the entranceway please the carnie said i dont know what youre talking about the hell you dont murphy said she leaned down and grabbed the man by the shirt with both hands and leaned closer a snarl lifting her lip the carnie blanched murph could be pretty badass for such a tiny thing i loved that about her i cant the carnie said i cant i get paid not to see anything shell kill me shell kill me i parted the heavy curtain leading into the entry tunnel and spotted it at oncea circular hole in the floor about two feet across the top end of a ladder just visible a round lid lay rotated to one side painted as flat black as the rest of the hall here i said to murph thats why we didnt spot anything by the time you had your light on it was already behind us murphy scowled down at the carnie and said give me twenty bucks the man licked his lips then he fished my folded twenty out of his shirt pocket and passed it to murphy she nodded and flashed her badge get out of here before i realize i witnessed you taking a bribe and endangering lives by letting customers use the attraction in an unsafe manner the carnie bolted murphy handed me the twenty i pocketed it and we climbed down the ladder we reached the bottom and went silent again murphys body language isnt exactly subtleit cant be when youre her size and working law enforcement but she could move as quietly as smoke when she needed to im gangly it was more of an effort for me the ladder took us down to what looked like the interior of a buried railroad car there were electrical conduits running along the walls light came from a doorway at the far end of the car i moved forward first shield bracelet at the ready and murphy walked a pace behind me and to my right her sig in hand the doorway at the end of the railroad car led us into a large workroom teaming with computers file cabinets microscopes and at least one deluxe chemistry set maroon sat at one of the computers his profile in view dammit stu he snarled i told you that you cant keep coming down here to use the john youll just have to walk to one of the he glanced up at us and froze in midsentence his eyes wide and locked on murphys leveled gun stu took the rest of the night off i said amiably wheres your boss a door opened at the far end of the workroom and a young woman of medium height appeared she wore glasses and a lab coat and neither of them did anything to make her look less than gorgeous she looked at us and then at maroon and said in a precise british accent you idiot yeah i said good help is hard to find the woman in the lab coat looked at me with dark intense eyes and i sensed what felt like a phantom pressure against my temples as if wriggling tadpoles were slithering along the surface of my skin it was a straightforward attempt at mental invasion but id been practicing my defenses for a while now and i wasnt falling for something that obvious i pushed the invasive thoughts away with an effort of will and said dont meet her eyes murph shes a vampire red court got it she said her gun never moving from maroon the vampire looked at us both for a moment then she said you need no introduction mr dresden i am baroness leblanc and our nations are not at the moment in a state of war ive always been a little fuzzy on legal niceties i said i had several devices with me that i could use to defend myself i was ready to use any of them a vampire in close quarters is nothing to laugh at leblanc could tear three or four limbs off in the time it takes to draw and fire a gun i watched her closely ready to act at the slightest resemblance of an attack we both know that the war is going to start up again eventually you are out of anything reasonably like your territory she said and you are trespassing upon mine i would be well within my rights under the accords to kill you and bury your torso and limbs in individual graves thats the problem with this ride i complained to murphy theres nothing thats actually scary in the tunnel of terror you did get your money back she pointed out ah true i smiled faintly at leblanc look baroness you know who i am youre doing something to peoples minds and i want it stopped if you do not leave she said i will consider it an act of war hooray i said in a ben stein monotone spinning one forefinger in the air like a new years noisemaker ive already kicked off one war with the red court and i will cheerfully do it again if that is what is necessary to protect people from you thats irrational leblanc said completely irrational tell her murph hes completely irrational murphy said her tone wry leblanc regarded me impassively for a moment then she smiled faintly and said perhaps a physical confrontation is an inappropriate solution i frowned really she shrugged not all of the red court are battlehungry blood addicts dresden my work here has no malevolent designs quite the opposite in fact i tilted my head thats funny all the corpses piled up say differently the process does have its side effects she admitted but the lessons garnered from them serve only to improve my work and make it safer and more effective honestly you should be supporting me dresden not trying to shut me down supporting you i smiled a little just what is it you think youre doing thats so darned wonderful i am creating love i barked out a laugh leblancs face remained steady serious you think that this this warping people into feeling something they dont want to feel is love what is love leblanc said if not a series of electrochemical signals in the brain signals that can be duplicated like any other sensation love is more than that i said do you love this woman yeah i said but that isnt anything new leblanc showed her teeth but your current longing and desire is new is it not new and entirely indistinguishable from your genuine emotions wouldnt you say sergeant murphy murphy swallowed but didnt look at the vampire leblancs uncomplicated mental attack might be simple for a wizard to defeat but any normal human being would probably be gone before they realized their mind was under attack instead of answering she asked a question of her own why why what why do this why experiment on making people fall in love leblanc arched an eyebrow isnt it obvious i sucked in a short breath realizing what was happening the white court i said the whites were a different breed of vampire than the reds feeding on the life essence of their victims generally through seduction genuine love and genuine tokens of love were their kryptonite their holy water the love of another human being in an intimate relationship sort of rubbed off on you making the very touch of your skin anathema to the white court leblanc smiled at me granted there are some aberrant effects from time to time but so far thats been a very small percentage of the test pool and the survivors are as you yourself have experienced perfectly happy they have a love that most of your kind seldom find and even more infrequently keep there are no victims here wizard oh i said right except for the victims leblanc exhaled mortals are like mayflies wizard they live a brief time and then they are gone and those who have died because of my work at least died after days or weeks of perfect bliss there are many who ended a much longer life with less what im doing here has the potential to protect mortal kind from the white court forever it isnt genuine love if its forced upon someone murphy said her tone harsh no leblanc said but i believe that the real thing will very easily grow from such a foundation of companionship and happiness gosh youre noble i said leblancs eyes sparkled with something ugly youre doing this to get rid of the competition i said and hell maybe to try to increase the worlds population make more food the vampire regarded me levelly there are multiple motivations behind the work she said many of my court agreed to the logic you cite when they would never have supported the idea of strengthening and defending mortals ohhhhh i said drawing the word out youre the vampire with a heart of gold florence nightingale with fangs i guess that makes it okay then leblanc stared at me then her eyes flicked to murphy and back she smiled thinly there is a special cage reserved for you at the red court dresden its bars are lined with blades and spikes so that if you fall asleep they will cut and gouge you awake shut up murphy said leblanc continued in a calmly amused tone the bottom is a closed bowl nearly a foot deep so that you will stand in your own waste and there are three spears with needlesized tips waiting in a rack beneath the cage so that any who pass you can pause and take a few moments to participate in your punishment shut up murphy growled eventually leblanc purred your guts will be torn out and left in a pile at your feet and when you are dead your skin will be flayed from your body tanned and made into upholstery for one of the chairs in the red temple shut up snarled murphy and her voice was savage her gun whipped over to cover leblanc shut your mouth bitch i realized the danger an instant too late it was exactly the reaction that leblanc had intended to provoke murph no once murphys sig was pointing elsewhere maroon produced a gun from beneath his desk and raised it he was pulling the trigger even before he could level it for a shot blazing away as fast as he could move his finger he wasnt quite fifteen feet away from murphy but the first five shots missed her as i spun and brought the invisible power of my shield bracelet down between the two of them bullets hit the shield with flashes of light and sent little concentric blue rings rippling through the air from the point of impact murphy meanwhile had opened up on leblanc murph fired almost as quickly as maroon but she had the training and discipline necessary for combat her bullets smacked into the vampires torso tearing through pale flesh and drawing gouts of redblack blood leblanc staggered to one sideshe wouldnt be dead but the shots had probably rung her bell for a second or two i lowered the shield as maroons gun clicked on empty lifted my right fist and triggered the braided energy ring on my index finger with a short uplifting motion the ring saved back a little energy every time i moved my arm storing it so that i could unleash it at need unseen force flew out from the ring plucked maroon out of his chair and slammed him into the ceiling he dropped back down hit his back on the edge of the desk and fell into a senseless sprawl on the floor the gun flew from his fingers im out murphy screamed i whirled back to find leblanc pushing herself off the wall regaining her balance she gave murphy a look of flat hatred and her eyes flushed pure black iris and sclera alike she opened her mouth in an inhuman scream and then the vampire hiding beneath leblancs seemingly human form exploded outward like a racehorse emerging from its gate leaving shreds of pale bloodless skin in its wake it was a hideous thingblack and flabby and slimylooking with a flaccid belly a batlike face and long spindly limbs leblancs eyes bulged hideously as she flew toward me i brought my shield up in time to intercept her and she rebounded from it to fall back to the section of floor already stained with her blood down murphy shouted i dropped down onto my heels and lowered the shield leblanc rose again even as i heard murphy take a deep breath exhale halfway and hold it her gun barked once the vampire lost about a fifth of her head as the bullet tore into her skull she staggered back against the wall limbs thrashing but she still wasnt dead she began to claw her way to her feet again murphy squeezed off six more shots methodically none of them missed leblanc fell to the floor murphy took a step closer aimed and put another ten or twelve rounds into the fallen vampires head by the time she was done the vampires head looked like a smashed gourd a few seconds later leblanc stopped moving murphy reloaded again and kept the gun trained on the corpse nice shootin tex i said i checked out maroon he was still breathing so murphy said problem solved not really i said leblanc was no practitioner she cant be the one who was working the whammy murphy frowned and eyed maroon for a second i went over to the downed man and touched my fingers lightly to his brow there was no telltale energy signature of a practitioner nope who then i shook my head this is delicate difficult magic there might not be three people on the entire white council who could pull it off so its most likely a focus artifact of some kind a what an item that has a routine built into it i said you pour energy in one end and you get results on the other murphy scrunched up her nose like those wolf belts the fbi had yeah just like that i blinked and snapped my fingers just like that i hurried out of the little complex and up the ladder i went to the tunnel car and took the old leather seat belt out of it i turned it over and found the back inscribed with nearly invisible sigils and signs now that i was looking for it i could feel the tingle of energy moving within it ha i said got it murphy frowned back at the entry to the tunnel of terror what do we do about billy the kid not much we can do i said you want to try to explain what happened here to the springfield cops she shook her head me either i said the kid was leblancs thrall i doubt hes a danger to anyone without a vampire to push him into it besides the reds would probably kill him on general principle anyway once they found out about leblancs death we were silent for a moment then stepped in close to each other and hugged gently murphy shivered you okay i asked quietly she leaned her head against my chest how do we help all the people she screwed with burn the belt i said and stroked her hair with one hand that should purify everyone its linked to everyone she said slowly i blinked twice yeah so once you do it well see what a bad idea this is and remember that we both have very good reasons to not get together yeah and we wont be feeling this anymore this happy this complete no we wont her voice cracked dammit i hugged her tight yeah i want to tell you to wait a while she said i want us to be all noble and virtuous for keeping it intact i want to tell you that if we destroy the belt well be destroying the happiness of god knows how many people junkies are happy when theyre high i said quietly but they dont need to be happy they need to be free i put the belt back into the car turned my right hand palmup and murmured a word a sphere of whitehot fire gathered over my fingers i flicked a hand and the sphere arched gently down into the car and began charring the belt to ashes i felt sick i didnt watch i turned to murphy and kissed her again hot and urgent and she returned it frantically it was as though we thought that we might keep something escaping from our mouths if they were sealed together in a kiss i felt it when it went away we both stiffened slightly we both remembered that we had decided that the two of us couldnt work out we both remembered that murphy was already involved with someone else and that it wasnt in her nature to stray she stepped back from me her arms folded across her stomach ready i asked her quietly she nodded and we started walking neither of us said anything until we reached the blue beetle you know what harry she said quietly from the other side of the car i know i told her like you said love hurts we got into the beetle and headed back to chicago jo beverley new york times bestselling author jo

secret duke and the stolen bride she lives with her family in england here she tells the story of a man wooing a very reluctant maidwith his life and the lives of all his relatives in the balance all doomed to die if he cant overcome her resistance which is not going to be easy the marrying maid st jamess park london it was as if a new song entered his world or a new taste or a new senseand yet one instantly recognized rob loxsleigh turned to look around the park striving to make the movement casual to his chattering companions so noisy in their silks and lace but already fading under the power of his new awareness there he smiled with delight but with surprise the woman in gray the one strolling through the park at the side of another woman just as ordinary wearing a plain gown with little trimming and a flat straw hat she was his destined bride hed been told hed know and for years hed sought the unignorable sometimes with a particularly pretty girl or fascinating woman hed tried to believe his desire meant that his quest was over a kiss had quickly proved him wrong now however he knew she alone seemed real in an unreal world and his body hummed with a symphony of need not just desire but a hunger for everything she would bring now within weeks of disaster titania had sent his marrying maid a prickle on the neck when martha darby turned she saw a man looking at her a london beau in silk and lace with powdered hair and a sword at his side a peacock in company with other birds of fine plumage their bright laughter and extravagant gestures indicating that theyd escaped the gilded cage of court in the nearby palace of st james but why was one of them staring at her a very sparrow of a spinster he turned back to his companions shed imagined his interest but now she couldnt help staring at him he seemed somehow brighter than his glittering companions merely the effect of a suit of peacock blue silk she told herself but he did seem perfectly made and he moved with such grace even in ridiculous shoes with high red heels such extravagance in their clothing and a shower of rain would ruin all martha turned to her mother smiling at the practical comment im sure chairmen would rush to carry them to shelter let us admire nature instead trees welcome the rain they strolled on their way martha and her mother were enjoying the park but also it must be admitted some glimpses of the follies of the great martha had certainly seen nothing like those courtier peacocks in york but then in york shed lived quietly for so many years helping her mother nurse her father through a long distressing illness this visit to a relative in london was to help them regain their spirits and be ready to pick up life but martha wondered what form her life could take she was too accustomed to quiet and routine and too old for adventures unless she was looking at that man again she quickly turned away lets walk toward rosamunds pond mother away from temptation temptation ridiculous lord peacock was a wastrel courtier and she was the virtuous daughter of a canon of york minster and at twentyfour long past the age of folly yet she looked again just to be sure she was safe she told herself safe did she think he would pursue her laughable but then she realized that he was looking at her again he smiled she turned her back heart pounding lud had he caught one of her glances and taken it as admiration even as lewd encouragement heaven defend her the court was notoriously licentious she urged her mother to walk more quickly but plump anne darby was never energetic her strolling involved many pauses to admire a vista or yet another pelican for some reason this park was full of them pelicans and peacocks come mother we must hurry what why martha came up with the only possible excuse i need to piss oh dear oh dear yes very well her mother did walk faster and gradually marthas panic simmered down they were safe and she would not come here again ladies martha froze then would have walked on if her mother hadnt already turned incapable of being cold or discourteous thus she must turn too already knowing who had spoken by logic surely not by a frisson on the back of her neck and a strange tension deep inside he stood mere feet away his silk suit embroidered with silver thread as well as colors the lace at throat and wrist would have cost a fortune and his neckcloth was fixed by a gold pin that sparkled in the sun as did rings on his fingers and the jeweled hilt of his sword as did his eyes as green as a summer leaf his handsome lean face was painted to give him fashionable pallor and then to restore color with rouge on cheeks and lips he was ridiculous but martha was powerfully aware of being dressed in mourning gray with only a silver pin for ornamentation and of never having let paint touch her face she should have been disdainful but instead the peculiar sensation within could almost be awe he was smiling directly at her now and holding out a handkerchief i believe this is yours maam martha glared at the linen ferociously irritated that the handkerchief was indeed her own marked by the embroidered forgetmenots in one corner how had it come to fall out of her pocket before she could lie her mother said oh see it is martha how kind of you sir he bowed to them both in the most extravagant manner imaginable dancing the handkerchief in little curlicues i am in heaven to be of service to so enchanting a lady martha plucked the fluttering linen from his fingers my thanks to you sir he put hand to chest no no thank you maam for providing me the opportunity to do this small kindness providing was the wretch implying that shed dropped her handkerchief on purpose it was a wellknown device of foolish women but she would never stoop so low she sent him an icy look but hed already turned another bow on her mother robert loxsleigh maam at your service sensible anne darby curtsied blushing flustered and delighted so kind so kind mistress darby sir of york and this is my daughter miss darby more bowing and greeting and all of it mockery if only her mother hadnt been inveigled into exchanging names may i hope to encounter you again in london mistress darby martha quickly answered alas no sir we leave tomorrow her mother began to protest but martha shot her a ferocious glare thus town is left desolate but york will soon rejoice a charming city i know it well as my home is near doncaster martha could have groaned that he was also from yorkshire would make her mother regard him as a friend we really must go mother martha said with meaning reminding her of her spurious need oh yes sir im afraid we must i do hope we will meet again one day in york perhaps he bowed to both of them but was looking at martha when he said im sure of it maam oh my said her mother watching him walk back to his friends so lithe and elegant despite uneven ground and those shoes oh what idiocy martha said steering away at speed that was the end of thatexcept that she was holding her handkerchief as if it were precious she screwed it up and thrust it into her pocket why did you say we were leaving town martha we are to stay three more days because i thought him up to no good truly but her mother sighed we cant be liars can we so we must leave all for the best perhaps we can stay longer with your aunt clarissa in newark and thus i am punished martha thought aunt clarissa was a very silly chatterer it was all the peacocks fault mr robert loxsleigh had been playing a game for the amusement of his idle friends and fecklessly upset her life and yetand yetas she resisted an almost overpowering need to look back martha knew she would never entirely forget an encounter with a peacock in st jamess park rob returned to his companions protecting miss darby from their curiosity by letting them assume he intended a seduction it was no lie if miss martha darby seemed likely to succumb hed bed her tonight she was the one the one the one his marrying maid which meant that at first kiss his talent would awake and when they lay together it would roar into full power he would be at last a true trouvedor of five oaks and his family would be saved rapid seduction was unlikely but a kiss perhaps if he pursued her now not to do so was like refusing water when parched but she seemed to be prim to a fault perhaps even a puritan his very appearance would have counted against him and any boldness could ruin everything no he must resume simple dress and manners and then court her carefully there was so little time though just two weeks to his birthday to doomsday but hed found her at last and she would be willing to be wooed faery would make it so zounds they left town tomorrow he separated from his companions suppressing panic he needed to untangle himself from court say farewells settle bills the darby ladies would travel the york road however and surely on the public coach he could follow post chaise and catch them in days as he walked toward his rooms he wondered how oberon had hidden martha darby for so many years he visited york quite often that didnt matter titania had prevailed the heir to five oaks had found his marrying maid with time enough to woo and win her it was always so the dark lord of faery had never won this fight not in five hundred years martha slept badly and spent the first hours on the crowded york coach braced for pursuit whatdid she think mr peacock loxsleigh was racing after on horseback intent on dragging her from the coach for ravishment such scenes alas had featured in her dreams how could a ladys mind produce such things she had never even flirted for a canons daughter should not shed had a few suitors over the years all clergymen but her mother and sick father had needed her and truth to tell none had truly appealed now she was free and returning to york to live a full life she was emerging from a chrysalis but too old dull and dry to become the simplest sort of butterfly except that no she would not allow that man in her mind she did have a suitor a perfectly eligible suitor dean stallingford had been a good friend to her family in recent years and had expressed his interest just before this journey saying that he wished to make his intentions known before she was exposed to londons temptations martha knew she should have committed herself then but for some reason the words had stuck in her throat he was fifteen years her senior and a widower with three young children but that was not to his discredit very well she would accept him when they returned and become a married woman with house and family to manage and a place in york society but she was aware that he sparked no excitement within her robert loxsleigh had created sparkles in a moment such madness must be why women succumbed to seduction racing fecklessly to their ruin she was in no danger of that but she wished the coach had wings she wished they werent to stay for days at aunt clarissas once in york she would become mistress stallingford as quickly as was decent and be safe she repeated that like a litany over two long days of travel and as they climbed out of the coach in newark they were soon in aunt clarissas modern brick house awash with her chatter clarissa heygood was a childless widow having lost her soldier husband early to war and enjoyed visitors very much that evening they took a stroll around the town eventually taking a path by the river martha enjoyed the exercise after so much sitting but she dropped behind for relief from her aunts endless flow of gossip her own company however gave space for dismal thoughts marrying dean stallingford would mean remaining part of the chapter of york minster and that felt cloistered even york itself held no savor she had few friends there because her time had been so taken up with her fathers care she was frowning at some innocent ducks when a man said heaven is before me tis the lady of the forgetmenots martha turned heart pounding and indeed it was the peacock except now he was a much more ordinary birdif such a man could ever be ordinary he wore riding breeches and boots with a brown jacket and his hair was unpowdered hair of burnished gold stop that it was a russet shade catching the setting sun alas he said those green eyes laughing at her she has betrayed her handkerchief and forgotten me i certainly have not regretting that martha walked on to catch up with her mother and aunt alarmed by how far they were ahead he kept up without effort you remember my gallantry miss darby i remember your impudence heavens when had she ever been so rude cheeks burning she walked ever faster he stayed by her side for returning your handkerchief a harsh judgment maam good manners compelled she stopped and dipped a curtsy i apologize sir that was kind of you he smiled then may i call on you at your inn martha thanked heaven she could say we stay in a private home sir how pleasant for you the home of the lady ahead she could do nothing about it he outpaced her with ease and made his courtesies to her mother who of course introduced him to aunt clarissa who was in ecstasies to give him carte blanche to call at her house whenever he wished martha was in danger of grinding down her teeth and when he left with an invitation to sup at aunt clarissas within the hour she could have screamed but what protest could she make both the older ladies thought him charming and were not immune to his good looks either then as they hurried home to make preparations for a guest aunt clarissa stopped to exclaim from five oaks why he must be a son of viscount loxsleigh and by the stars i do believe he has only one lud we will have a future viscount to sup she almost raced on her way martha trailed after he was a lord a future one but it came to the same thing he was as far above her as the stars and for some strange reason that caused a deep pang of loss when martha entered the house her aunt was already calling frantic instructions to her cook marthas mother said the heir to a viscountcy and i believe i saw him look at you in a most particular way dear mother for heavens sake what interest could such a man have in a woman like me her mother sighed i suppose thats true but his company will make an agreeable evening martha considered claiming a headache as escape but for some reason she couldnt say the words she went to her room to tidy herself and slowly her good sense returned it was ridiculous to imagine mr loxsleigh was pursuing her but she would be chaperoned by her mother and aunt she would enjoy the novelty she decided tying a fresh cap beneath her chin shed met no man like him before and likely wouldnt in the future if he did attempt a seduction that would be the most novel experience of all she was not the tiniest bit vulnerable to his sort of tinsel charm but watching his attempt could be diverting loxsleigh did not attempt to seduce her and indeed how could he when both her mother and aunt fluttered around him like adoring moths to the flame he entertained them with the wonders and follies of the court he pretended interest in anne darbys impressions of london and even in aunt clarissas chatter about newark his sympathetic manner soon drew out the story of canon darbys long illness and of aunt clarissas old tragedy he mentioned his own mothers death three years ago with tender feeling where was the artificial peacock this might be a different man all the same beneath easy manners he was intense a strange word but the only one martha could find and his intensity was centered on her when their eyes met she felt its power that must be a skill of practiced seducers and on a weaker woman it might work for it created the illusion that she was special that she was important to him when he invited them all to dine at his inn the next afternoon martha agreed with as much pleasure as the rest it appeared he might plan an attempt on her virtue perhaps dry spinsters from the provinces were a new dish for such as he and she looked forward to seeing what other skills he would bring into play would he attempt to get her alone hed fail but it would be like watching a play and the performance of this leading actor should be a wonder to behold however the price for her amusement was more embarrassing dreams and others even odder where did the woodland scenes come from shed spent her life in a city but in the night she visited dense woodlands and glades woven through with a hauntingly beautiful song where strange creatures danced loved and quarreled quarreled over her an exquisite lady in iridescent draperies and a lord in dark velvet prowled and snarled over her when she awoke to her sunlit bedchamber martha felt as if the misty greenwood still surrounded her but by the time they left to walk to the crown inn she was sensible again she could wish aunt clarissa so that lady was in alt at loxsleighs high station and had spent the morning making inquiries of her friends which also allowed her to spread the word about her interesting new acquaintance he is the heir shed told martha and her mother and the family is famously rich as soon as they were seated at the inn she said i understand your home at five oaks is most unusual sir famous for its antiquity it is maam a part of it dates back to the thirteenth century a small part he said as soup was served only the old great hall and some rooms above it five hundred years old aunt clarissa declared is it not rather uncomfortable asked marthas practical mother he turned his smile on her which is why its hardly used maam are there five oaks martha challenged of course miss darby trees die even oaks there cannot always be five her sharpness did not cut him there can if one counts saplings but yes there have always been five mature oaks before she could debate that point he added or so legend says there are certainly five now perhaps you would care to visit and see for yourself he addressed it nicely to both martha and her mother but she knew it was intended for herself so that was it he wanted her in his home under his power before she could forestall it her mother had agreed and then she made it worse i hope well be able to return your hospitality soon sir and serve you a dinner when next you visit york perhaps we can show you some entertainments we will soon be out of mourning dear martha missed so much of her youth while helping me nurse mr darby that i look forward to her enjoying parties and assemblies im past the age for such frivolities mother why say that dear i declare i am not i intend to dance when asked and enjoy many entertainments and so you should maam loxsleigh said i will certainly ask you to dance he addressed her mother but martha felt the message was to her she found her hand tight on her knife and fork as if shed need to fight him off talk turned safely to musical evenings and assemblies but then both marthas mother and aunt shared stories from their youth that implied more liveliness than martha had imagined her mother had flirted with a number of suitors and even slipped aside from a dance for a kiss and not with the future canon darby either in their recollections the older ladies became more youthful brightereyed rosiercheeked while martha remained herself dull and lacking memories to share did everyone dance and flirt their way into their twenties except her she became aware of hunger and not for soup she hungered for touches and dances and teasing and flirtation all the things the older ladies remembered with such pleasure all the things shed missed and feared never to experience especially in dean stallingfords embraces good heavens shed never let her imagination go so far and now the idea revolted her she caught loxsleigh looking at her and immediately envisioned embraces that would not revolt her how was he doing this to her she seized her wineglass and drank he also raised his glass but sipped his eyes remaining on her bright as fire heat rose through her body she began to sweat this wasnt a play and it wasnt harmless she would not go to five oaks she would return directly to york and marry dean stallingford and be safe the meal seemed to take an age and when they rose to take their leave martha gave thanks that the torment was over however loxsleigh insisted on escorting them back home and walked beside her as they left the inn she could feel his presence perhaps even a vibration she welcomed fresh air and the hubbub of ordinary lifepeople in the street vendors calling their wares a line of chairmen offering transport i feel quite fatigued said aunt clarissa i do believe ill take a chair loxsleigh summoned a sedan and paid the men mistress darby would you too care to be carried home i confess the idea appeals sir dont feel obliged to join us in laziness dear she said to martha i know you enjoy a walk and mr loxsleigh will ensure your safety if marthas senses were any guide mr loxsleigh planned the exact opposite but she took a sudden resolve even if she refused to visit his home he could follow her to york the only way to put a stop to this was to directly dismiss him yes she said i should like to walk its a lovely afternoon as soon as the older ladies were carried away she turned to him and now mr loxsleigh we will talk plainly if you please he extended his arm i will be delighted miss darby martha didnt want to touch him but propriety compelled she curled her hand around his arm and they set off down the street even through gloves and sleeve she felt that vibration again and it rippled into her she twitched and glanced around had she heard that song again the one from her dream plain talk miss darby he prompted i wish to know plainly sir why you are pursuing my mother and myself we can hardly be amusing to you after court court is a constantly repeating play its charms soon wear thin she gave him a look so we are a new play a novelty as i am for you im sure im certainly not accustomed to such elevated company she was launched on an argument about their different stations but he said i assume you meet the archbishop now and then that is hardly the same but extremely elevated where does the archbishop of york come in the order of precedence closely after royalty i believe and far far above the heir to a viscountcy jaw tense martha said i have very little to do with the archbishop but would not reject his company as unsuitable come miss darby why are you so prickly what have i done to offend she glared at him do you pretend that you encountered us in newark by accident it is on the north road which we both must take but i confess that i wanted to meet you again why martha suddenly realized that theyd taken a shortcut through the churchyard it was the route her party had walked to the inn enjoying the tranquillity now the leafy quiet seemed dangerous she released his arm and stepped away why she demanded again what interest do you have in us in you your mother is delightful but you are the lodestone lodestone but that was best ignored i insist you leave us be sir there is no connection and can never be there was a handkerchief he said whimsically my dear miss darby my intentions are completely honorable honorable she was becoming an echo but hed opened the way to an attack that sounds as if you intend to propose marriage she waited with relish for him to show panic but instead he smiled i believe i do but first i must kiss you what you wretch to make fun of me and to suggest something so wicked a kiss is wicked then the whole world is destined for hell including you with such tempting lips you must have been kissed many times certainly not martha snapped but instantly regretted the admission my fathers illness mourning he sobered as your mother said you have missed much he captured her hands allow me to introduce you to the kiss he didnt wait for permission however but pulled her beneath a tree and kissed her a mere press of lips to lips yet sparkles started there and spread throughout her bodyinto her chest down her spine right to her fingers and toes she almost felt that her tightpinned hair crackled she tried to step back but that brought her hard against the trees trunk and he pressed over her his hot mouth claiming hers hungrily destroying both conscience and will she gripped his jacket lightningstruck and helpless until a deep urgent ache awoke her to peril she pushed him away with all her strength he crushed closer as if he might force her but then he put hands to the tree and thrust violently backward as if breaking bonds breathing hard eyes bright and wolfish in their hunger a hunger that pounded in herself he went to one knee miss darby will you marry me she stared then snapped of course not from an instinct as sharp as that which snatches the hand from a burning pot his eyes still shone you must you know martha backed away but the infernal tree blocked her must from a kiss a kiss forced upon me i fear youre mad sir and he looked it with those wide burning eyes and flushed cheeks i will be if you reject me why do you refuse why my father was a canon yours is a viscount you will be a viscount one day i have an extremely modest portion to bring to a marriage and no idea of how to behave at court i dont live at court he said rising to his feet and i dont need your portion but in fact you bring a dowry of immense value he stepped forward let me kiss you again martha pushed him away stop that i know what youre about youre trying to seduce me im trying to marry you i dont believe you he sighed and looked up i thought an oak would have some power what he took her handcomeand dragged her toward the church what are you doing stop this martha stumbled along unable bring herself to scream they turned a corner and there at last were peopletwo gravediggers chest deep in the ground sirs she cried i want to marry this lady loxsleigh interrupted will you stand witness the men grinned showing crooked teeth if you wish sir i do he tossed them both a coin come he dragged martha onward she grabbed a headstone youre drunk sir you must be it would serve you right if i took up your offer he stopped beaming do please my marrying maid your what you my dear my darling miss darby are my marrying maid i have sought you high and low long and far despairing of ever finding you in time but here you are and here i am and all is wondrous he grasped her waist and swung her around in the air nothing so alarming so wonderful had ever happened to martha darby before she swatted at his head beat at his shoulders and when her feet touched the ground again she exclaimed youre mad or drunk or both not a bit of it but then he swooped down to dig his fingers into the long grass by the edge of the path mad martha thought tears gathering in her eyes tragically the man was mad see he straightened showing her a small golden earring as if it were a wonder of the orient is it not wonderful you must return it to its owner martha said gently of course but its proof you see proof of what that youre my marrying maid how soon can we be wed mr loxsleigh i am not going to marry you he shook his head as if she were a moonling martha reached for the only weapon she had im promised to another that did cloud his sun do you love him martha couldnt quite lie we are very well suited she said and set off along the path toward the street toward people sane people he passed her and spoke walking backward you dont love him of course you dont a marrying maid wants no other i wonder why i didnt find you years ago perhaps she said tightly because we belong in different spheres and still do ah your father was a canon did you live close to the minster the safety of the street lay ahead but he blocked her way yes and in the long years of caring for your father did you mostly stay at home of course that explains it then faery powers cant work in powerful christian spaces fairies he was a worse case than shed feared he turned and opened the gate for her if i try to explain youll never believe me quite likely i wont she said safe at last on the street martha my dear just say yes she looked him in the eye no come to five oaks no what harm can it do said the spider to the fly she marched on aunt clarissas house was in view martha had never been so glad to see it come to five oaks he persisted it will change your mind but if it doesnt ill bother you no more and that is a painful promise for me to make martha was struck by his sincerity and slowed her steps why he didnt immediately answer and seemed to be calculating her reaction if you dont marry me he said at last i will die die of love we hardly know each other simply die and not just me many others mad mad but she was suddenly unable to abandon him if she went to his home she would be with her mother aunt clarissa would know where they went perhaps his father didnt realize how sad a case he was there might be some way to help him very well martha said at last i will visit five oaks he beamed all that bright light shining but the song came from elsewhere as did the burst of ethereal laughter martha looked around even as she knew neither was anything to do with the here and now was insanity infectious by morning martha had second third twentieth doubts about the wisdom of her decision especially in light of her dreams that one kiss had unleashed wickedness beyond comprehension and even more vivid images of impossible things mr loxsleigh arrived and though he was striving to appear normal his eyes revealed that madness still rode him not dangerous madness she assured herself what was more hed brought a luxurious traveling carriage drawn by six horses which meant three postilions who would hardly allow evil she guessed he intended rash speed however and said we will travel only as fast as is reasonable sir he handed her into the carriage we must reach five oaks today martha paused in the doorway why she caught him staring into nowhere but then he was with her again smiling my impatience to see you there miss darby but my word on it well travel no faster than is safe with yet more misgivings martha took her seat at her mothers side facing the horses it was difficult to be a wellbred lady who never behaved improperly and did not upset arrangements how lovely to travel post her mother said so kind of you mr loxsleigh he took the opposite seat it is you who are kind maam agreeing to come to five oaks as the carriage moved off martha gripped her hands together she forced them to relax she was safe any other impression was a lingering effect of her dream or proximity to a man the seating put her far too close to loxsleigh their knees almost touched unless she chose to look outside all the way she must look at him be aware of how he looked at her with eyes that now seemed to gleam emerald bright she turned away as if fascinated by the sight of the castle over nearby houses he said our road is good according to those coming south in other words he claimed speed was safe to prove it as soon as they left the town the horses picked up their pace it did not jolt over ruts however so martha couldnt reasonably complain extravagantly they halted for new horses in an hour and then again they would have continued that way till dark if martha hadnt prompted him to stop to dine at gone two oclock he agreed but though he smiled and conversed he hurried them through their meal and out again to the carriage even marthas mother commented on it is there urgency mr loxsleigh do you have bad news from home no maam im merely anxious that we arrive before dark if it becomes dark martha said we must stop he looked at her with something like rage and she shrank back wishing there was some way to escape with propriety he instantly smiled so that she might have believed shed imagined the reaction but she didnt he turned to her mother theres a family legend that might interest you maam as it concerns the oldest part of five oaks may i relate it to pass the time by all means mr loxsleigh long long ago he began an ancestor also called robert loxsleigh traveled the land seeking to do his knightly duty and defend the weak one night he became lost in dense woodland despite the fact that it was a full moon when he came into a clearing he saw a beautiful woman being assaulted by a man he leaped from his horse drew his sword and rushed between them the lady fell on his chest in gratitude but the man was furious he declared sir robert was his prisoner for entering a faery circle under the full moon you see the warring couple were titania and oberon queen and king of faery as in shakespeare anne darby exclaimed ill met by moonlight how interesting ill met indeed loxsleigh agreed but when he turned to martha that fire of intensity burned worse she felt it in herself now as if she had urgent need to race to his home but it fought with a desperate need to turn away from the course sir robert sought to escape but his horse had disappeared as had his squire and all the woodland except for the five gnarled oaks that circled him he knew of faery ways and knew that a mortal who invaded a faery circle at full moon was their prisoner he believed himself lost to our world but titania took him under her protection and declared that he should go free and would even receive a reward one wish what did he wish for anne darby asked remember maam he was a truly noble knight he asked for some talent that would enable him to help the poor and helpless even more than before ah the good man what talent martha asked hearing her tension make it harsh loxsleigh looked at her the ability to find lost gold lost coins salvers jewelry such as an earring their eyes were locked quite possibly but then he turned to her mother anything already mined and formed by man gold is a mystical metal valued everywhere some believe it also has mystic and healing powers it serves us well and shouldnt be lost according to this story faery has the task of ensuring that lost gold is found and returned to use have you ever heard the story of the gold at the end of a rainbow martha clung to silence unable to understand why she felt such threat her mother seemed unaffected and asked to know more that legend appears in many places it says that if a person can find the place where a rainbow touches the ground they will find gold thus it is a way for faery to put some of their trove back into human hands or sometimes buried gold is brought to the surface to be exposed by the plough or coins hidden in a wall are revealed when someone is inspired to break it down i have heard of such cases anne darby declared wideeyed its only a legend mother that caused loxsleigh to look at her again you doubt miss darby and therein lies the problem once the fey folk lived close to humans dwelling in the dense woodlands that surrounded every village and manor interacting with people according to their whim but much of that woodland has been cut down and the land put to agriculture and modern thought has made skeptics of us all nowadays faery lives among us only in their mystic havens to continue the work titania made sir robert her deputy enabling him to find lost gold and put it to use to benefit the poor then why martha asked are his descendants so rich martha her mother protested but loxsleigh smiled as if shed opened a door queen titania wished sir robert to found a line that would continue this work so she bound him with rules he must keep a seventh of the value of any trove and use it for his own health and prosperity he must marry and sire children so that an eldest son would carry on the work and so must his heirs for all time those with the talent must do the work if he or his descendants broke these rules there was a penaltythey would die within the year not just the trouvedor for thus the gold finders are called but all roberts descendants to that day over five hundred years anne darby exclaimed that could be a vast number faery is not benign maam we are as moths to them dead in a moment and that rang deadly true martha desperately tried to make sense of this but she remembered him saying that if she did not marry him he would die he could not be claiming that this story was true that he possessed a fairy gift those are easy enough conditions mr loxsleigh martha said with deliberate flippancy to live a comfortable life and marry martha her mother said again becoming distressed loxsleigh still smiled but martha was more and more aware of dark tension all around him as you say miss darby except that oberon does his best to thwart his queen the coach lurched into an inn then for a change of horses breaking the moment almost breaking a spell was that it was she under a spell was that why shed agreed to this mad journey but that would mean it was all true fairies gold finders he climbed down to inspect the new horses and pay the fees she watched him remembering the earring his bright burning exultation him sweeping her up in that mad whirl a predictor of this mad whirl but shed been alive then alive as never before no she would have none of this she was a rational christian woman the man was mad and she could only pray he wasnt dangerously so he climbed back in and the coach moved on marthas mother said you mentioned oberon sir do tell us more martha saw that he wanted to tell her intended to tell her and could do nothing to prevent it you will remember that oberon had reason to hate robert loxsleigh but by faery law he could not deny his ladys gifts titania had already imposed rules and a dreadful consequence however so he set out to make obedience difficult he decreed that robert loxsleigh and his heirs would not achieve their talent until they married and that they must marry a woman that he would choose and before their twentyfifth birthday titania insisted that the woman must be healthy and of a suitable age and station but she and her husband enjoy their battles so she made no more attempt than that thusif we are to believe my family lorethere will always be a destined bride for the loxsleigh heir but oberon will make her hard to find he turned to martha when found however there will be no doubt on either side we call the bride his marrying maid martha inhaled clenching her fists how old are you she would not ask she would not she turned away looking outside and noticed gathering clouds rain often turned the roads to mud and she prayed for it she didnt want to reach his house and with delay perhaps she could escape what a charming story anne darby said martha turned to her mother charming fairies noble knights and brides and threat of death for many if there was any truth in it but there isnt is there dear martha forced a smile no of course not i was swept away by it for a moment the weather looks ominous sir we should stop at the next stage we can reach five oaks today i promise loxsleigh said martha didnt argue if she was any judge the clouds would do her work for her her mother asked does the name five oaks come from that legend from the oak trees in the glade it does maam in fact the legend says that the old part of the house was built in that very glade as you will see for yourself within hours he looked out at the gathering clouds however and frowned do you have any other stories mr loxsleigh her mother asked martha closed her eyes briefly wondering what more there could be i do have one more maam which is very whimsical we left sir robert with his faery gift and once he married his marrying maid he used his talent but kept the seventh thus obeying the rules however he began to find it harder to distribute the gold to the poor his generous charities were beginning to cause comment he tried leaving gold for people to find as faery had done but it offended him when it was found by rascals or the rich he traveled farther to escape attention and when returning from a benevolent journey he was set upon by outlaws the leader took his purse and made a play of him having donated the purse to the poor that gave sir robert an idea he set up a trap and captured that leader and put a proposition to him if he would give up his thievery sir robert would protect him and his companions and provide money for them to live on in return robin ahood and his men would pass on the gold claiming that theyd stolen it from the rich to give to the poor robin hood martha exclaimed now i see you play with us i did say it was whimsical miss darby and many people think robin hood was real her mother said especially around yorkshire and nottinghamshire they think fairies real too martha scoffed or magic wells or that eleven days were stolen from them when the calendar changed oh i remember that said her mother such a furor even rioting there are some still convinced that their lives will be shorter she turned to loxsleigh one neighbor in york whose birthday was on the tenth of september that year insists to this day that shes a year younger than she truly is loxsleigh didnt respond in fact he looked dumbstruck he looked outside at the gathering gloom and then at martha eyes wide robin hood martha said sharply hoping to bring him back to reason that device could only have lasted a while men die he blinked as if her words made no sense but then said no of course i mean yes he shivered a legend can live forever the robin hood stories are spread over centuries you know and from nottinghamshire to yorkshire to barnsdale where five oaks lies one version links to the loxsleigh name though spelled differently it could be true it was a good attempt but close to babble how interesting said marthas mother but he continued to look at martha you disbelieve all robin hood might have existed she said but fairies certainly do not pray god youre right he said and turned again to study the weather as if willpower could change it rob didnt know how he was presenting a normal appearance if he was the change of calendar how could he have ignored it how could his father five years ago the calendar had been corrected by going from the second day of september to the fourteenth as mistress darby said many of the simple folk believed that eleven days had been stolen from them there had been riots demanding their return people with birthdays during the eleven days had fretted about how old they were hed regarded all this with amusement why hadnt he realized no one could tell how faery viewed such human matters as dates and calendars but if the rules applied to the old date it would explain the gathering stormand not the one visible in roiling clouds at first it had been a dark chanting in his head but that had turned into a cacophonous chorus that flogged him toward five oaks hurry hurry hurry over the past hours hed become aware of them around him gleeful oberon and furious titania no wonder if the rules kept to the old calendar his birthday wasnt the twentieth day of june eleven days away but the ninth tomorrow if he didnt bed martha darby before tomorrow perhaps before eleven in the morning his hour of birth oberon would be free to finally exact his revenge on the line of sir robert loxsleigh that left no time for niceties and wooing by kind means or cruel he must have her in the next twenty hours he tried to compel calm they would be at five oaks in hours even with the worsening weather oberons work he was sure once he took martha to the old hall where faery energy burned so fiercely she would have to believe have to agree to anticipate the wedding even she the prim daughter of a canon of york if not damnation oberon had chosen well and done his mightiest but he could not be allowed to succeed but then the rain swept toward them sheeting down pounding the rough ground of the road we must stop at the next inn mr loxsleigh martha said we risk becoming stuck in the mud the roads sound he said desperately and its not far now perhaps only an hour the coach had slowed however and he could feel the labor of the horses the postilions would be miserable but they must press on then the wheels sank and the coach stopped he opened the door to jump out we must lighten the load the coach lurched forward then the wheels finding new purchase he fell back into his seat this is folly his bride declared look i see lights ahead we must stop we cant climb out to lighten the load in this weather my mother could catch her death he wanted to rail at her but every word was true they could not go on very well he said desperately seeking solutions my apologies the lights turned out to be a small inn but called the maid marian was that a hopeful sign or a twisted joke it had two tiny bedchambers for them but they would have to take their supper in the common room that didnt matter he made his plans he ordered supper for them and hot punch making sure it had plenty of honey and spices when it arrived he strengthened it with the flask of brandy he had in his valise mistress darby declared it excellent and drank two glasses martha drank well of it too he topped up her glass when she wasnt looking and saw her drain it again mistress darby began to nod off she started oh my the long journey has tired me out im for bed she left the room somewhat unsteadily martha rose and he saw her steady herself on the back of her chair i too am tired you set too hasty a pace mr loxsleigh perhaps i did i am simply impatient to see you in my home he watched her struggle to focus i am not going to marry you you must you know the story now remember oberons revenge fablesh she frowned fables for the credulous he grabbed her and shook her why am i cursed with such an impossible woman she fought him off cursed cursed because i will not sin in your bed im a curse i want to marry you i dont want to marry you she yelled inhibitions shattered by drink she was magnificent but adamant youre mad mr loxsleigh she said with the careful precision of the drunk its sad but i will not bind myself to a madman a man laughed deep and dark martha looked around almost losing her balance again who was that oberon anticipating victory martha listen to me my birthday isnt twelve days away its tomorrow we need to go to bed together now she blinked at him that is a most improper statement sir i know very well we need to go on to five oaks now mad mad mad we could ride i cannot ride we could share a horse he desperately wanted her willing martha if we dont wed by tomorrow i will die my father will die all the descendants of sir robert loxsleigh wherever they may be will die within the year she swayed slightly it is impossible for us to marry by tomorrow sir banns and i do believe that you have made me drunk he approached again certainly you are affected by the punch miss darby permit me to escort you upstairs she swatted at him keep away from me you you horny goat that came so improbably from her lips that he laughed a mistake she backed away muttering mad mad mad keep away from me and i will not go to your home not tomorrow not ever he watched her steer carefully toward the door some were made docile by drink and some quarrelsome clearly martha darby was the latter some were made lusty but hed never trusted to that he followed at a distance ready to save her if she stumbled on the narrow stairs halfway up her legs betrayed her and she sat down leaning her head against the wall muttering drunk im drunk oh the shame then she slipped into a stupor rob went to where she slumped and touched her prim cap martha my love i wish it had been otherwise pray god you forgive me he gathered her into his arms aware of titanias exultance and oberons fury and hating both equally titanias lilting voice approved but then oberon changed his tone to coaxing will you rape her it murmured despoil her limp body what will be the result when she regains awareness and understands what you have done shell love you argued titania shes your marrying maid it is her destiny to love you just as it is your destiny to love her do it now my knight do it now so you and your line can live do it now and eat bitter bread forever perhaps it is not necessary perhaps i will allow your birthday to be as your worldly custom designates rob carried martha up to his bedchamber where he laid her on the bed he untied the stings of her cap and took it off then unpinned her hair he spread it astonished by its silky thickness aroused by it and hungry he leaned down and pressed his lips to hers which were slack and unresponsive he inhaled straightening i cannot he said titania screamed at him oberon laughed where was virtue and vileness here where was right and wrong there was one last hope martha was first aware of a throbbing head and then that she was cold and wet then that she was not in her bed but being carried was this another odd dream she struggled feebly and realized she was trapped in something in heavy cloth hush love were home ill soon have you warm home she forced her eyes open and saw a distant starry sky closer she saw loxsleighs shadowed face what have you done her mouth was almost too parched for speech brought you to five oaks it was the only way no he was going to rape her and here in his house there would be no noble sir robert to stand between she felt her own hot tears on her cold cheeks he kissed them dont be afraid love i wont harm you but i had to bring you here i had to try he put her down on the steps to open the door but only for a moment and still swaddled so her feeble struggles achieved nothing they entered total darkness but he must know it well of course he did then wild candlelight showed a high painted ceiling my boy my boy youre home and with your bride praise be to god martha turned her head and saw a tousledhaired man in a night robe candle in hand welcome my dear welcome oh happy day but why such a journey the poor girl must be chilled through bring her up bring her up she can lie in my bed for now no martha cried not the father too no rob loxsleigh said i must take her to the old hall the old hall shell catch a lung fever i hope shell catch credulity already striding across the entrance hall he called the calendar change it changed my birthday we have no time bring brandy and water rouse the servants to prepare her a bed please martha cried please dont but he rushed forward into darkness struggling to open doors leaving them wide behind him and all around her a cacophony of voices swelledhigh voices low voices merry and angry coaxing and threatening tangled up in a song in that song her nightmare song a man growled he plans to rape you fight mortal creature fight she tried but was helpless then loxsleigh stopped smallpaned windows let in a trace of light and marthas eyes were accustomed to the dark they were in the ancient part of five oaks and the nightmare song and creatures whirled around a dream this had to be a dream he put her on her feet supporting her still the lady was there the one in iridescent robes she smiled like a madonna but with blank eyes titania the man paced around them like the panther shed seen in the tower of london he cannot rape you hes too puny for that you have only to resist titania pressed close in a cloud of woodland perfume dear child you have only to surrender to rob to that which you most desire her hand brushed marthas forehead and the dull throb there faded the room seemed brighter by the moment and all her senses heightened the song turned sweet you love rob loxsleigh whispered the queen of faery he loves you you were destined from birth and the threat is real dear child refuse and my lord will have his way then stop him i have brought you together now it lies in your hands you demand that i sin titania laughed i demand nothing it will annoy me if my lord wins this little contest but there are many others faery rob loxsleigh had said are not benign martha realized that whether the light came from a magical glow or from the fey folk themselves she could see the room was long and low and paneled in dark oak but held no furniture rob stood nearby wild haired and grim watching her but prepared she understood to abide by her decision here now she could not deny the reality of the threat it showed in titanias heartless smile and in handsome oberons simmering anticipation he waited to exact revenge for an offence half a millennium old others flowed around the room and in and out of the dark walls watching and chattering they were enjoying the show as people watch animals fight to the death simply for amusement the unearthly song swelledsweet yes but chanting both love and death martha turned to rob they are vile we must deny them both he took her hands martha martha they are as wind wave and lightning deny them if you will but you will still die or rather i will and my father my uncle and aunt my cousins and my cousin cecilias newborn child who knows how many others carry sir robert loxsleighs blood trust me love there is only one way come to my bed and lie with me we will be married as soon as may be but oberon will be thwarted only if we love each other tonight it would be wrong the dark lord growled in her ear and you know it what good can come from that we can pledge ourselves now rob argued we can say our vows i will keep them as will you there can never be any other for you or me by your beliefs it must be in a church oberon argued think of the scandal your reputation it was as if all around held their breath as if the very room the old house the one built by robert loxsleigh in a faery glade guarded by five oaks held its breath even the song stopped but oberon had misplayed his hand marthas morals still quailed but to let innocents die for her reputation would be vile she looked into the mans eyes i will lie with you tonight rob loxsleigh my husband in all but the ceremony the chorus burst into song again a song of wild rejoicing that clashed with thunderous rage rob took her hand and raced her out of the ancient part of the house back to the entrance hall lit now by a branch of candles the noises faded and then stopped martha knew that the faery had gone gone on to other entertainments rob took her into his arms holding her tight and close burying his head in her hair her loose hair martha realized as it had never been except between brushing and pinning he separated and kissed her a gentle reverent kiss you will not regret this no i dont believe i will but she swallowed before saying do we do it now he smiled we have all night youre damp in places and wet in others come up to your room and be comfortable she went up with him hand in hand but still embarrassed she could hear servants around woken from sleep and talking softly about her they would all know but she would not sacrifice hundreds to her discomfort he led her to a room where three maidservants worked still in their nightwear with tied shawls atop they cast her looks but smiling ones did they know did everyone here know the room was lit with candles and warmed by the flickering flames of a newlaid fire two of the servants were running warming pans through the bed the other was spreading a nightgown over a rack before the fire ill leave you in their care rob said smiling down at her she could do nothing but smile back im all awhirl i know be comfortable ill return later the subject still embarrassed her too much for speech but she nodded he left and she surrendered to the maids care they gave her small beer to slake her thirst and stripped off her damp outer clothing martha wouldnt let them strip her naked she retired behind the screen to take off her shift and put on the nightgown the maids toweled dry her hair and then settled her into the warm bed with a cup of chocolate and a sweet cake there was a plate of fruit as well but martha could eat nothing the servants left she sipped the chocolate which was richer than any shed tasted and she waited all awareness of faery had gone making her realize how it had lived in her for days ever since that encounter in the park instead there was a growing peace a growing certainty that all was now right despite the lack of church and clergy she was drinking the last of the chocolate when rob came to her shining and handsome again in a rich blue robe my peacock i see at your command he said crossing the room to her always he extinguished the candles until only fire lit the room and came into the bed beside her im sorry it must be this way my love but it will be holy he was naked and she had to look away even though she said i know it wildly she thought it would never have been like this with dean stallingford he took her hand and she felt his warm lips on her knuckles look at me martha she turned her head shyly but hed pulled the covers up to his neck there was nothing to embarrass her except that he was here a man in her bed he took her hand her left hand and slid a ring onto her third finger my pledge to you dear heart martha raised her hand and saw a complex ring of gold set with small smooth stones ive carried that for years love as i sought my marrying maid come let me love you now he gathered her into his arms and kissed her and there was all the magic she remembered from that other kiss so long ago a day ago heat and sparkles danced through her and this time she felt no need to resist shyly she kissed him back her hands encountered his skin and she laid her hands on him uncertainly but with growing pleasure she moved against him her whole body twining with his so they seemed one especially when he raised her nightgown high then took it off she stared up at the bed canopy as he put hands to her naked breasts and then his mouth but then she was lost to anxiety and swept up into his passion her need building so that when he thrust inside her she cried out as much in satisfaction as in pain the pain was short and soon forgotten the pleasure built until she thought shed die of wanting more until it came and she didnt die but ended up hot and sticky in his arms laughing softly at the splendor of it so that she said is magic he chuckled into her hair if its magic its a magic available to everyone love he nuzzled and kissed her there thank you my dear my darling my marrying maid we will be gloriously happy but martha suddenly sat up mother laughing he pulled her back down someones already been dispatched to bring her here safely on the morrow the explanations may be delicate but i think shell be mollified by our wedding he cradled her face any regrets martha shook her head none this is right and true well follow faerys rules and all will be well and when our son is of marrying age well work with him to circumvent oberons wiles a distant look came into his eyes and martha said what more trickery from them he focused on her again no love but im aware of the gold now after the kiss it was a whisper and all ive found is nearby pieces now its a symphony on the air a choir in my mind from near and far tomorrow will you come with me to find lost gold she snuggled into his chest also hearing this new sweet song i will husband and right merrily carrie vaughn bestseller carrie vaughn is the author of a wildly popular series of novels

fence formed the backdrop supposedly suggesting the shadows of a forest a pile of stuffed black garbage bags made a castle shape a woman in a white bustier panties fishnets and a black garter with a cute little bow clinging to her thigh lay at the foot of the tower of trash as if she had just thrown herself off it to her death nearby another body lay a twisted man dressed in a threepiece suit with a tire iron sticking out of him suggesting a sword at the end of a duel the hero a handsome man with a cleanshaven face wearing an alluring amount of leather had been kneeling beside the woman

artist the truth was she looked good in the lingerie and knew it and was probably afraid that pretty meant putting her in a floorlength gown charlotte thought she had said something along the lines of wanting to recast classic gothic narratives as a vehicle for alienationthe terrors of postmodernity expressed as the sublime they had the terrors of postmodernity down pat but seemed to be missing the sublime the last dress rehearsal was a little late to be rethinking the project was it too late to cancel the whole thing it had all seemed so much more clever when she wrote it never mind she said its fine its all fine maybe the lighting otto said trying to be helpful more of a halo effect upstage he put on his headset bob is it too late to change that last lighting cue she sat in her squishy velvet seat in the middle of the house and pondered this was supposed to be her big break her jump from the bush leagues to the bigtime with a director like otto an awardwinning actress like marta starring in a theater that didnt seat its audience in folding chairs charlotte couldnt help but feel that her career was already over her phone rattled and she dug in the pocket of her jeans for it the screen showed dorians text wrk late wont make dinner sry make it up to you she quelled her disappointment and instead decided to admire dorians dedication an upandcoming assistant da like dorian merriman didnt win cases like the one against the midnight stalker by going on dinner dates with struggling playwrights otto and the three actors were all looking at her and she might have blushed everything okay otto said fine she said putting her phone away are we done otto harry said were done calls at five tomorrow otto and the actors disappeared backstage part of her wanted to curl up right here for the next twentyfour hours until it was all over maybe she could sleep through it instead she found her coat and bag and went to catch a bus home it was early summer still daylight still warm she could have walked the whole way scuffing toes on the sidewalk and thinking of everything that could go horribly wrong tomorrow night she didnt even have to go on stage and she was terrified as an alternative to going home and stewing she decided to take herself to dinner just because dorian couldnt go out didnt mean she had to stay home she had to celebrate either the beginning of her career or mourn its incipient demise she had a favorite place a hillside café with a rooftop patio perfect for watching the urban neon sunset and it arranged its wine list by price which she thought was postmodernly classy she didnt plan for the jewelry store next door to the café to get robbed while she was there she had just ordered a salad and a glass of zinfandel something to take the edge off while she stared at the hazy city sky and reminded herself that she was lucky and she had a great boyfriend when he was around and her dream was coming true and the play really was okay and no one was going to write wretched reviews calling her names everything was going to be just fine alarms started ringing clanging mechanically vibrating through the floor the police sirens joined a minute later a dozen customers and waitstaff crowded along the patio rail to see what was happening charlotte was already sitting there and had a pretty good view of the street but like many others she also looked up and around at the sky and rooftops wondering which hero would swoop in to save the day breezeway the bullet captain olympus himself the police sirens approached howling then a half dozen commerce city pd squad cars roared up the street and screeched to cinematic halts skidding to angles that blocked the intersections uniforms bounded out and pointed guns at the building out came the bullhorn and one of the officers called through it come out with your hands up shouting echoed up the stairwell that led to the roof six men wearing purple kevlar vests fatigues and ninjalike masks appeared two held heavy metallic briefcases no doubt filled with something nefarious and stolen four held what had to be ray gunsplastic streamlined with parabolic dishes where the barrels should be they made quite an impression they must have planned to jump to the next rooftop and keep running until they found a ladder to shimmy down while the police were still racing up the stairs after them the police were a little too fast and the thieves were a little too desperate because they went for hostages the two gunmen pointed their weapons and yelled freeze which nobody did instead people screamed and tumbled out of the way covering their heads falling to the floor scrambling on top of each other it was a pretty good strategy because if they stayed in a mob and the gunmen fired it would probably be somebody else who got shot astonished charlotte just kept sitting there back to the railing instead of fleeing with the others so one of the guys grabbed her arm around her throat and held her against the rail purple parabolic dish to her temple her captor shouted the obligatory nobody move she thought the other gunman was standing at the top of the stairs pointing his weapon at the oncoming cops preventing rescue so much for a nice evening out staring back at the gun which had become very large in her vision she wondered if the weapon would incinerate her or simply make her vanish in a stream of light she wondered which one would hurt more maybe she wouldnt have to go through opening night after all maybe dorian would avenge her after standing forlornly over her poor broken body would he feel guilty for missing dinner with her the tableau froze heroine and villain random crowd huddling like a greek chorus henchmen wreaking chaos time stopped her heartbeat stilled to a moment of perfect silence a universe holding its breath she didnt know where the newcomer entered from but the gun left her head and pointed at something else and there he was in the middle of the patio hands on his hips he was also wearing a mask and that may have been what set the gang of jewel thieves most on edge one more variable must have been too many to handle the thieves had an out and they took it her captor tipped her over the railing charlotte gasped a breath as the sky spun past her feet she was fallingthen she wasnt she jerked to a stop hanging two stories over the sidewalk she didnt even have time to scream she wasnt sure how it happened but she could see how it ended up the masked man the hero gripped her hand and held her dangling thirty feet up she swayed and came to rest against the concrete wall his other hand held the railing he must have dived over the edge as she fell faster than a heartbeat faster than a blink he must have grabbed her grabbed the railing and stopped her midplunge her shoulder throbbed with the pain of being wrenched his must have felt worse now they hung there looking at each other ill need you to climb up he said voice tight with strain what she squeaked im fast not all that strong he gasped he lifted her partway until she could grab hold of his jeans then his shirt then his shoulder panting and panicked too shocked to be scared unbelievably remembering not to look down she used him as a ladder until she put her arms around his shoulders he swung his leg up to hook it over the railing shrugged to hint that maybe she should make her way to the railing as well she meant to dig her fingers more tightly around his shirt but she got the muscle of his shoulder he only flinched a little she managed to slide over hook her elbow over then her leg and the two of them rolled onto the patio together the ray guntoting thieves had used the distraction to flee charlotte and her rescuer looked at each other he was nondescript but the mask made all the difference without it shed have glanced at him once maybe admired the muscled shoulders under the almosttootight tshirt no uniform just tshirt and jeans plain black boots well worn but he wore a mask a length of black cloth with eyeholes over his head and tied in back she stared at his eyes brown rich with the mask it was like looking at someone through a window she wasnt sure she could really see him he held her armsmaybe she looked like she was going to faint falling backward making him rescue her all over again imagine ither rescued at the last second by a reallife hero just like one of her plays unbelievable thrilling he was breathing hard the feat hadnt been easy for him sweat shone on his neck are you all right she asked i should be asking you that he said smiling he had a very nice smile no well yes but youthat was amazing she sounded a little breathy im fine are you just fine he said he never stopped smiling then just as a crowd of police trooped up the stairs he ranand yes he was fast he sped to the other side of the roof to the back of the building where a fence gave him a chance to jump off climb down flee and vanishall in seconds she couldnt see movement arms and legs pumping just this shape that flowed away then it was dusk and she couldnt see anything and you have no idea who he was the detective asked again no i have no idea when she arrived at the police station someone put a blanket over her shoulders and a cup of coffee in her hands then she started shivering she hadnt realized she was cold the detective stared at her annoyed because she was clearly making his job more difficult sighing he pulled over a threering binder opened it in front of her and started turning pages are any of these the guy who rescued you this looked almost like the binders the theater got from agentscatalogs of actors the first round of cattle calls instead of headshots the detectives pictures mostly showed blurry fullbody action shots of the masked vigilantes she recognized a lot of them from news clips and reputation the invincible dressed in red white and blue who as far as anyone could tell really was invincible and could fly to boot black belt who dressed like a ninja and could shoot laser beams from his hands quantum girl a woman in a silver leotard and spikeheeled boots who could teleport and more there were maybe two dozen of themmore than shed realized no one knew much about them where they lived or what they did when they werent out fighting crime maybe they had secret identities maybe they had secret hideouts like gothic castles maybe they were robots who only emerged when there was crime to be fought in her play she had assumed that her hero was a person with a heart to break like everyone else she flipped through the whole book and shook her head he wasnt anybody i recognized he didnt even have much of a costume just a mask shouldnt you be going after the thieves instead of him i need all the information i can get for the report the detective said flatly she finished making her statement which she couldnt see being very useful to any investigation all she had seen was a swarm of masked men running around performing some mystery play charlotte dorian merriman hotshot assistant da on the fast track after that midnight stalker trialfrontpage stuff she hadnt called him about what had happened he had just known probably through one of his connections in the police department he rushed to her side heroically even but she was a little too wrung out to be impressed by the feat are you all right what happened i came as soon as i heard are you hurt he turned to the detective is she hurt shell be fine the man said he straightened the pages on his desk signaling that they were done hi she said her smile weak he knelt by her side smoothed back her hair like she was a child and she beamed back at him now lets get you home he said dorian had brown eyes reporters had arrived at the police station snapping pictures and demanding answers word had gotten out about the masked man a new rooftop hero in the city and they kept asking what was his power his name had he talked to her what did he say they already knew who she was a witness at the restaurant had told them everything she wondered what the papers would make of it shed been right there and she didnt know what had happened the detective told her not to say anything so she didnt in dorians car on the way to her apartment she got a second wind you should have seen it it was amazing i dont know who this guy was and the way the cops were talking im not sure if they want to catch the thieves or him you know id have expected him to be wearing some suit or armor like the other ones do at least maybe spandex but no just jeans and you know how you joke around because you dont think those flimsy masks would really hide anyones identity but i cant for the life of me remember what he looked like i just saw the mask you werent scared he glanced at her well yeah sure but she let the thought fade she only wanted to remember amazing charlotte shared an apartment with several other starvingartist types in too small a space an arrangement that worked because most of them were gone most of the time at their theaters or band rehearsals or projects or day jobs the place was in a part of town that in another ten years would be hip and gentrified and they were all hoping theyd have made their fortunes by then so they could afford to stay he guided her inside made her put on pajamas tucked a cup of tea in her hands and apologized i have to get back to work i want to tell the da about this well get those guys we wont let anything like this happen again well that wasnt nearly as romantic as him rushing to the police station to tend to her emotional wounds but dorian was a very dedicated assistant da she didnt feel quite right complaining but but im not sure i want to be alone right now he gave her a quick kiss on the forehead im sorry i wouldnt leave if it wasnt an emergency call me if you need anything anything at all and there he went saving the city again she sighed she couldnt sleep so she made another cup of tea and sat in a chair by the bedroom window she half expected to see a shadowed figure running across the rooftops pausing to strike a heroic pose against a backdrop of city lights she fell asleep wrapped in a blanket and leaning against the window dreaming strange dreams until one of her roommates came home nudged her awake and put her to bed her phone rang early she had to scramble for it it was still in the pocket of her jeans on the floor somewhere hello have you seen the news was that really you are you okay otto charlotte are you all right muzzyheaded she rubbed her face hadnt it all been a dream wait a minute what how did youi mean yeah im okay how did you hear about what happened it was the only conceivable reason otto would be calling this early in the morning its all over the news hon he said theyve been calling the theater youre a genius charlotte what are you talking about as publicity stunts go this is over the top i love it but it wasnt i know im teasing youre really all right ii think so i know its opening night but if youre not up to coming out dont sweat it opening night almost as terrifying as dangling off a roof ill be there i think i gotta go she clicked him off and went to the computer to find two roommates already there ogling over her and otto was right the story was everywhere someone had gotten a cell phone picture of the guy in the maskand charlotte looking flustered and windblown it was all fairly dramatic the more sedate web sites had facts and figures what had been stolena shipment of loose diamondsand what the police knew sparsely delivered news including charlottes name her association with the theater and her professionplaywright there it was in the news it had to be true right her phone rang three times in five minutes friends wanting to know if she was okay really okay she put them off as quickly as she could which probably convinced them that she really wasnt all right theyd call again in an hour then dorian called honey are you okay i think so hey do you have time for breakfast or lunch or something anything well not really im afraid i talked the da into giving me the case at least when there is a case ill get it isnt that great i have to get to the precinct and find out what theyre doing theyd better not screw this up this could make my career i almost died she wanted to mew her phone beeped to tell her of another incoming call she checkedit was her mother this time she canceled the call but youll be there tonight wont you she said to dorian tonight the play opening night it must have seemed like such a small thing to him oh right of course ill be there ill meet you at the theater and dont forget about the party afterward otto rented out napolis of course ill be there after dorian hung up the phone rang again a reporter this time she told the woman to call the police then the police called telling her to tell reporters to call the police which was a relief mostly though she read everything she could find about what had happened the most helpful source was a web site called rooftop watch it tracked superhumans and masked vigilantes and villains recorded sightings and gleefully spread all manner of gossip her masked man had been seen two previous times in both cases hed foiled residential robberies by racing in shining a highpowered flashlight at the wouldbe burglars as they were breaking into the back doors of houses then racing out before the thieves could react their cover blown the burglars ran and so did the masked man but by then the owners were awake and on the phone with the police they were calling him blue collar which seemed rude it was a commentary on his wardrobe rather than his powers or personality nothing like speed or blaze or comet there was a lot of speculation about who he was what he was doing most commentators in the know figured he was new and starting small foiling robberies and breakins hed work up to bigger featslike snatching young playwrights from certain death maybe hed even get a real uniform someday the cell phone picture of him standing with charlotte was too good not to post all over the internet a billion times she hoped someone was getting rich off it the possibility of prosecuting the case was certainly making dorian happy she arrived at the theater two hours early and crept backstage unsure if she should gather everyone together for a manic pep talk or hide in a closet unable to decide she paced along an outoftheway section of wall backstage while stagehands and tech crew bustled shed gotten her dress at a fancy consignment shop which meant she looked much richer than she actually was red sleek slinky strapless shed even found the heels to go with it in the right size shed been in one of her good moods thinking of the glamorous life and her possible place in it now she felt a bit like a dyed poodle unnatural vaguely humiliated shed been in a good mood when she met dorian at a fundraising party for an artsintheschools organization she was there helping run the party and he was there to rub elbows see and be seen and all that she liked to think that they swept each other off their feet with their mutual romantic notions the actors swooped in marta last of all carrying on and backstage got loud after that marta even rushed over to stagehug her charlotte i cant believe youre even here after what happened my godwhat happened are you all right if it were me my nerves would be shot id be traumatized id be in bed for a week how are you even here oh whered you get that dress nice oh my god what time is it and she rushed off again charlotte wonderedshould she be more traumatized by what had happened it really did seem like a dream otto had slipped in earlier unseen phantomlike working his director magic backstage when he found charlotte he asked are you all right are you really all right she glared you look great by the way she still glared a half an hour before curtain she didnt dare peek into the house to see if anyone was actually there if anyone had actually deigned to come and dorian was going to be late she had his ticket they were supposed to sit in the back cuddled together watching her big debut shed had it all planned out but she couldnt honestly be surprised when her phone buzzed showing dorians number im really sorry im going to be stuck at work for at least another hour ill come see the show another night ill make it up to you can you at least come to the party it probably wont start till eleven or so sure im sure i can make the party ill meet you there napolis right right and he hung up ten minutes before curtain otto ran from the wings beaming she nearly stumbled away the sight was so shocking its all right he said coming up and taking her hand its going to be all right what what is weve sold out the house is full its your adventure last night youre famous theyre here because of you that didnt make her feel any better otto continued backstage to the dressing rooms to tell the cast and jolt them into more spirited performances or greater heights of anxiety she couldnt stand it anymore so she crept to the edge of the curtain and peeked out and it was true the house was full only a handful of empty seats left scattered as the last people filtered in and those two empty seats in back meant for her and dorian the murmurs of the crowd hushed over her the theater was full but what if no one liked it because she couldnt bear to watch she waited backstage pacing everything went well she supposed but all she heard from the faint voices reciting her lines on stage were the mistakes awkward phrasing she should have fixed a long time ago bad delivery that she couldnt do anything about from backstage applause sounded muted and lackluster then it was all over at last otto came at her grinning and nearly shouting there you are come on get out front what for the curtain call he took her hand and dragged her opening night of course the director and playwright would come out on stage as well smile he hissed she scrounged together what poise she could then they were under the stage lights the cast around them applauding otto gestured offering charlotte to the audience or the audience to her they were on their feet the whole audience on its feet clapping and cheering someone pressed longstemmed roses into her arms she cradled the bundle like it was an infant they must have liked it she was still dazed as the curtain closed at last and the cast fell to laughing and embracing champagne appeared and marta herself popped the corkafter shaking the bottleletting the contents spray everywhere the stage manager wouldnt be happy about that people came to hug charlotte and she held them off with the shield of roses and tried to be gracious she was suddenly exhausted all that pacing backstage but everyone else was buzzed and manic as squirrels and the night was just starting she realized that she hadnt thought this far ahead it was enough to have her play finished and actually staged and she hadnt dared think any further than that except to assume that it would all be a dismal failure but by all appearances the play was a success shouldnt she be happy if the play had been a failure the invitationonly openingnight party would have been a wake and they could have mourned in peace without having to talk to anyone but themselves since the play had been successful it would be the most sensational and soughtafter party of the month tonight would be a celebration charlotte tried to ignore a growing sense of foreboding otto had reserved the restaurant but marta had rented the limo for them all to arrive in them being marta the actors charlotte otto and ottos young actress wife helen part of why otto was a good director was because he didnt automatically cast helen in everything he did wheres your handsome lawyer i didnt see him at the theater helen asked and charlotte blushed working late helen acknowledged this happily enough but otto gave her a sympathetic almost pitying smile otto had helen on one arm and marta on the other as he swept them up the sidewalk to the door of napolis harry and fred tried to sweep charlotte the same way but she resisted extricating herself from their grips in the restaurants lobby dorians meeting me here she said faking confidence wait for him inside harry said pouting just another minute more and more people arrived passing through the restaurants lobby checking their coats hugging and kissing cheeks many were already drunk all of them cheerful there were reporters here and photographers otto would get all the publicity he could hope for it was fabulous charlotte paced her steps dragged and the maître d kept asking if he could get her anything she almost gave up she almost lost faith then there he was in his sweeping overcoat and intense face a man with purpose he held a bundle of roses you came she said maybe a little too brightly of course i did you look wonderful he pressed the roses into her arms and leaned in for a quick kiss on her cheek hed rushed she could tell he was still catching his breath and a faint sheen of sweat lay on his neck im sorry i missed the play ill make it up to you how did it go she took a deep breath the thrill was finally starting to build it was amazing it was brilliant it was she sighed come inside help us celebrate she took his hand and tried to urge him in honey thats wonderful but im not sure im up for a late night with all your theater friends wouldnt you rather have a quiet evening we could celebrate in private just the two of us her heart melted at that a little but she might only ever have one big successful openingnight party she couldnt be expected to pick between her dashing boyfriend and her openingnight party could she just for a little while please he finally slipped off his coat and gave it to the check clerk charlotte held the roses with one arm and him with the other as they entered the main dining room the room was full she hadnt realized so many people were herethe cast and crew and all their significant others didnt account for everyone how many invitations had otto given out he probably hadnt expected everyone to come but the show was a success they were hip and cool who knew she recognized a handful of celebrities the deputy mayor a popular news anchor and was that the masked hero breezeway in uniform posing with some of the cast maybe her own rescuer would be here but she looked and couldnt see him she could smell champagne as if it flowed from fountains the place was in chaos people sitting on tables shouting across the room accosting waitstaff bearing platters of finger food no one should have noticed charlotte and dorian slipping in late but they did charlotte otto called from across the room where he held court at a round table covered with a red satin cloth and a dozen champagne bottles he was loud enough to draw the attention of the others who turned to look to our playwright to the genius otto raised a glass marta at her own table with a dozen fawning admirers took up her own glass to the genius and everyone raised glasses and cheered and applauded all over again this was more than charlotte had expected more than she had imagined she could only bask silent the playwright wordless beside her dorian looked at her and smiled he put his arm around her shoulders and pulled her close congratulations he whispered posing for pictures with her making sure the reporter spelled his name right the party went until dawn but they left early he brought her home to his place this time and made love to her more attentively than he had since their first weeks together by morning ten different people had emailed charlotte a photo going around the news web sites of the masked hero on surveillance footage thwarting a convenience store robbery yesterday evening the same time shed been pacing backstage the photo was blackandwhite grainy and showed him standing with one foot on a guy who sprawled in front of the checkout counter a gun could be seen nearby as if it had fallen and skittered away from the wouldbe robbers gloved hand is this the same guy everyone wanted to know and how would she know because all she saw was the mask but she thought it was the same guy he kept himself busy she tried to put him out of her mind but she recognized the convenience store on a corner a few blocks away from the theater hed been right there almost the reviews of the play were all right which was more than shed hoped for and while they didnt sell out again after the opening the house was mostly full every night maybe that first night had sold out because of the novelty of her instant fame if people were just coming to see the play written by that woman who was rescued by that blue collar vigilante but if that was all the play offered ticket sales would have bombed soon after which meant that maybe she knew what she was doing and maybe everything was going to be all right weeks passed and the play continued its respectable run then people starting asking how is the next play coming along and it wasnt she stared at her laptop for hours took her notepad to the park the coffee shop the library she thought she had charactersanother woman another hero another subversion of traditional gothic narratives etcetera but every line she wrote sounded just like what shed already done and the words didnt fit anymore shed sit in her chair by the window all nighteven the nights she spent at doriansmake notes in her notebook and watch the sky grow light if she was at dorians hed wake up see her sitting wrapped in a blanket staring instead of writing and try to be helpful youll get there he said you did it before you can do it again like it was just a matter of arguing a case one morning at dorians shed made it to bed and was still there when he was nearly ready for his day the da wants to come see your show i told him i could get him tickets looking in the mirror he straightened his tie you can get tickets right sure she said emerging from blankets for when for tonight that might be kind of tough come on honey surely you have some pull you guys always hold a few tickets back right maybe but she didnt run the box office she still had some of her comp tickets left for the run but there might not be anything for tonight ill see what i can do but im not a superhero great text me when you get them all right dont forget to lock up on your way out have a good day dorian he gave her the appropriate kiss on her forehead and then was gone the box office did have a pair of tickets for that evening they were even decent seats charlotte was very apologetic promising shed have more notice next time and that this was an emergency and she was very grateful on the other hand the box office manager outdid herself apologizing in return making sure the tickets were the best ones possible and thanking her for the opportunity to be of service dorian would have known what to do in this situation the problem wasnt that charlotte didnt have pull the problem was she didnt know what to do with it the manager filed the tickets with will call she texted dorian and went to her favorite coffee shop to write then she saw him she was at a sidewalk table chin resting on her hand staring at the traffic moving along the treelined street because staring somewhere else wasnt any less productive than staring at a blank page she caught movement it might have been the flickering of a set of leaves at the top of one of the trees but it wasnt it was a person on the roof across the way jeans dark tshirt and a mask he seemed to realize that she saw him he stood and ran disappearing to the back of the roof she stood jostling the table and tipping over her coffee which streamed to the edge and dripped to the sidewalk grabbing her notebook and satchel she ran across the street dodging cars like a creature in a video game at the first alley she came to she ran to the back of the building to look but of course he wasnt there just trash that hadnt made it into the dumpsters and puddles from the last rain filling cracks in the asphalt the back doors of various businesses shut and blank maybe if she waited here until after dark shed get caught by muggers and the masked man would come to rescue her she didnt want to leave she didnt want to pretend that he was a ghost that it hadnt happened that she could move on hello she called her voice rattled in the empty space and no one answered dorian was working late again and asked her to bring dinnerthai takeoutto his office hes a crazy superhuman vigilante you know what theyre like he said when she told him the story she felt the need to defend the superhero while not offending dorian youre both working so hard to catch these guys maybe you should work together pool your resources collaborate that was a theater word she should have used another he gave her a look appalled and amused at once a yeah right and dont be ridiculous that night back at her own apartment she tried to sleep couldnt she collected her notebook and sat by the window still didnt write a word but sitting with a pen in hand at least made her feel productive the moon was full she could see every detail of the street the apartment blocks the row of shops and laundromats with steel grates pulled over the doors at night all the colors washed out to various degrees of halftone shading on the roof of a row of shops a figure moved monochrome like the rest of the scene black tshirt charlotte couldnt see his face he was watching her he was and her heart fluttered at the thought she had seen him at all hours mostly on rooftops she couldnt predict where hed be unless maybe she staged a convenience store robbery but the odds of that ending badly were very very high so she didnt instead she went to the top of a parking garage on the fringes of downtown with a set of binoculars and scanned the surrounding rooftops she might have become a vigilante herself searching for crime because if she found crime shed find him she didnt see anything for another night she sat at her bedroom window wrapped in a blanket waiting for a shadow to race across rooftops and strike a dramatic pose and she started writing just a few lines in her notebook dorian took her to a charity banquet and introduced her to the mayor she wore the red dress shed worn on opening night met the mayor accepted compliments from the da and dorian beamed the evening was a strange echo of the first night theyd met but different she was different an accessory instead of a novelty she should have been thrilledthis was part of her dreams of a glamorous life wasnt it but she was distracted it all seemed shallow for real drama some disaster would strike the banquet some villain or group of thievesmaybe the same gang that had robbed the jewelry storewould storm the hall divest the women of their jeweled necklaces and the men of their gold cufflinks along with wallets and platinum cards and stock portfolios they would take charlotte hostage the red dress made her stand out then he would arrive an epic battle would ensue thered be flames and bullets shed be trapped behind a burning door and he would what are you looking for dorian asked her oh what nothing nothing shed been craning her neck looking at the doors and windows for impending drama you writers dorian said squeezing her hand some nights she went to the theater to take in the atmosphere but avoided otto because he always asked about the next play she watched the old play from the house once but otherwise sat backstage well out of the way and made notes she was like an observer on a rooftop the text messages from dorian continued sry work ran late will make it up to you xoxo so again she took herself to dinner to the same favorite café with the rooftop patio it was raining but she asked to sit on the patio anyway but its raining the host said i have an umbrella she said she dried off a chair with a napkin and sat in a sheltered spot near the wall that housed the main part of the café under her umbrella drinking coffee the petunias and daisies in the large planters at each corner drooped and the sky grew grayer and there he was he didnt seem to mind the rain the tshirt molded to him a little more and water dripped off his arms and the edges of his mask quickly she stood then thought maybe she shouldntshe didnt want to scare him off but when he didnt run she didnt sit down hi she said a moment passed hi he seemed nervous he kept looking away so he was shy that made sense he had secrets to hide no one could know who he wasit was all very romantic she was sure beautiful even right down to his jeans to his ungraceful boots then he said i have to go wait but for what for her how did she talk a masked avenger into waiting for her who are you she winced so obvious he gave her a lopsided smile i cant say but and what excuse would she give about why she was different why was she any different except that hed once plucked her out of the air why are you following me she said surprised to say anything even the first thing she thought of shed expected to let him flee to make sure youre safe that gangthey could come after you again really he averted his eyes so the answer was no she hadnt thought so if youre looking for them trying to catch them you should talk to dorian hes my she didnt want to say the word she didnt want to shut the door my friend hes an assistant da hes got the robbery case if it ever goes to trial hes working with the police he may have information you can use maybe you could work together it seemed reasonable i dont think so is it just because of the mask because youd have to tell them who you are i mean do you really have to hide who you are its traditional he said and now he sounded apologetic the only expression she could see under the mask was a flatlipped frown a gaze somewhere between determined and resigned im sorry i shouldnt pry but its justim sorry its just that he was strange and she wanted to help him i saw your play he said then she wondered how was he in the audience in the rafters how had she missed him but what she asked was what did you think i liked it what a sweet smile he turned bashful again id never seen a play before really really oh my god mine shouldnt have been your first play ever how could you have never seen a play i guess i dont get out much he said which seemed ironic they just kept standing there in the rain she lifted the umbrella and stepped closer to bring him under the shelterhe stepped back as if afraid she tried not to be hurt tried not to take it personally she swallowed her pride i dont know anything about you a statement containing all her questions i mean where do you live what do you do do you have a day job a a girlfriend whats your name he might as well have been an alien a character a face on a billboard he seemed uncertain pain in his eyesbiting his lips he seemed to consider when he returned taking back the step hed moved away closing the distance between them she thought hed tell her everything he moved quickly with the reflexes that had saved her from crashing to the pavement touched her chin with gentle calloused fingers she closed her eyes waiting for that kiss and so didnt see him run away only felt a draft on her face where there should have been warmth wait she saw a shadow fleeing through the mist then he was gone and she was alone the only one stupid enough to stay on the rooftop in the rain the next evening dorians text message about working late came later than she expected but it came it rained again and charlotte imagined the masked man out there in it she watched the news for an hour looking for signs of him but he didnt seem to be busy tonight or if he was the network wasnt showing it they were more interested in the flashier heroes the invincibles and red meteors who had a sense of style and public relations and she thought of dorian in his courtroom attire which was just as alluring as a vigilante costume in its own way then she wondered dorian had been so busy lately the masked man had brown eyes dorian had brown eyes they were about the same height and their chinschagrined she realized she couldnt say that she had ever noticed dorians chin before it was a nice chin average she noticed the heros chin because the mask drew attention to it the masks were deceptive they seemed like they shouldnt be able to disguise anything but it was more than a mask it was a distraction she had never ever seen dorian in jeans and a tshirt his version of casual involved dockers polo shirts and loafers boating or golf attire he always had a bit of polish because as he said it he never knew when he might run into someone who needed impressing she could never imagine him standing out in the rain wearing a tshirt and a goofy smile maybe that was the point she had seen marta in half a dozen shows playing ingenues and dutiful daughters unrecognizable from one role to the next later that week they didnt meet for dinner but she came over to dorians place anyway late to spend the night dorian was in the kitchen pouring himself a tumbler of scotch youve been working late a lot she said watching for his reaction yeah he said in a mock longsuffering tone what exactly do you do she winced because it sounded accusing paperwork mostly believe it or not i meet with people all day so the paperwork gets put off and the police work late i like to keep track of them ah i guess ive never had a sense of what goes on in a real job she quirked a smile trying to make it a joke thats why you have writers block you need to get out in the real world and then youd have something to write about she tried to remember how the masked man had smelled shed been close enough to smell his skin his sweat maybe she could tell if he and dorian smelled the same but all she remembered from him was the smell of rain on fabric and the sensation of warmth when he touched her get out in the world so shed have something to write about yeah while dorian slept charlotte was about to go sit by the window when dorians phone rang he seemed to be ready for it hello yeah he rolled out of bed and took his phone into the next room sitting very still she could hear you got them theyre cornered and not surrendering of course i want to be there give me fifteen minutes he came back into the bedroom and dressed quicklyhe didnt even bother with a tie what she said never mind go back to sleep its all right but he was out the door hed never even turned on the lights something was happening or was about to happen charlotte got up and went to the next room to turn on the tv but whatever was going on the news hadnt picked up on it yet dorians laptop sat on the desk and she went there next fired it up and checked rooftop watch a dozen updates had been posted just in the last ten minutes its those jewel thieves the cops are there any supers on the lookout for supers the police seemed to be centered on st and pine she was turning into one of those superhero stalkers who haunted web sites like this and posted conspiracy theories she didnt care then she read the latest post blue collars been sighted just for a second charlotte found her phone and called dorian waited and waited but got no answer and maybe that was her answer she called a cab while getting dressed reached the curb just as it pulled up trundled into the backseat and told the sleepylooking driver the address and hurry she said like this was some spy movie he sighed they didnt get there the police cordoned off the area a block away a dozen squad cars parked flashing lights reflecting off the concrete walls of body shops and warehouses red white and blue fireworks and christmas at once the driver glared at her like it was her fault she paid him and left she ran just to see how far shed get until someone stopped her which turned out to be pretty far because no one was looking out to the streets for crazy women they were all looking inward to the unfolding drama she joined the inner circle the edge of the stage and watched six masked jewel thieves sprawled in a heap on the ground their purple outfits streaked with dirt their ray guns in a neat pile a few feet away as though someone with superspeed had snatched them away and placed them there and there he was her rescuer standing over them and looking worn out rather than particularly heroic his arms hung at his sides and he seemed to be trying to catch his breath a couple of suited men who might have been detectives stood across from the thieves who seemed like prey that hed caught and delivered to them also with the detectives was dorian dorian and the masked man were looking at each other then the masked man saw charlotte when he turned to look so did everyone else the jig was up dorian called charlotte what are you doing here the uniformed cops on either side of her looked her over and glared she didnt say anything hardly noticed that the tableau had unfrozen and police were now collecting the thieves putting handcuffs on them and shoving them into cars that left dorian the vigilante and charlotte i told you you guys should work together she said lamely charlotte dorian exclaimed again a word that was a question demanding explanation are you having an affair she asked him because it was the only other thing she could think of what no for gods sake what gave you that idea he was indignant enough that she believed him but she also wasnt sure shed be able to tell if he was lying she watched actors on stage all day and actors on stage did nothing but lie while convincing her they were telling the truth it was all those late nights she said and tried to explain all at once to both of them all those broken dates and the evasions and i thought i thought something must be going on then i met himand she still didnt know his nameand i thought i dont know what i thought you both have brown eyes he looked at the masked man looked at charlotte and sounded a little forlorn when he said i told you i was working late and how many men have said that to how many women its like something out of a bad play she stopped here they were three on the stage at the close of the curtain a gothic postmodern shambles the police lights flashed and didnt seem real she knew exactly what gels would make those colors on stage she walked away upset at how disappointed she was and how foolish she felt this all seemed so plain so messy couldnt we make it prettier she had said to otto she got to the end of the block when the masked man appeared in front of her that was what it looked like he just appeared after a blur of motion the thing is he said i cant take you out to dinner i cant be there for the openings of your plays i cant answer the phone every time you call i cant do any of that but i can still i can still try she could have a hero or have someone who was always there to take her to dinner but not both he took off his mask and she didnt know him he seemed young but the faint stubble and even fainter crowsfeetlaugh linesgave him rough edges he was handsome he was sad she knew nothing about him one thing he could do though was stand over her broken body striking a pose and looking tragically bereft before he flew off into the night and it would be pretty dramatically speaking she leaned in hand on his chest he stood still body tense she felt his heart racingmuch faster than a normal persons faster than dorians he still smelled like rain she brushed her lips against his which trembled in response barely a kiss more like an apology then she walked home and nobody tried to mug her she was almost disappointed charlotte and dorian split up dorian prosecuted the jewel thieves and talked to the press about putting in for da in a couple of years he started dating a painter whose gallery shows were making news charlotte finished the next play otto liked it marta liked it it needed some work she would have been worried if it hadnt this one was straight realism which was a departure for her and which meant not stringing the wires with lights when they flew the heroes in and out she still had to have heroes but this time she imagined what they said to each other when they sat on rooftops looking for jewel thieves she imagined they talked about the weather and the girls they liked and how to avoid getting idd by the cops the only nonsuperhero character in the play was the cop who was trying to figure out who they were she never did a week into rehearsals she sat on a chair at the edge of the stage watching otto block actors listening to lines following along in her copy of the script making notes when she thought something else would sound better shed think something else would sound better long after the play had had its run and closed otto had been on the same page for half an hour and was on his fourth try arranging actors repeating lines in a minute hed do something off the wall and unexpected and that would be the version that worked all she had to do was wait and wonder how it would all turn out leaning back in her chair she looked up into the rails ropes chains and lights of the fly system distant ladders and rafters lost in shadow and saw a masked face looking back at her smiling m l n hanover new writer m l n hanover is the author of unclean spirits and darker angels the first and second in the black suns daughter sequence an international horror guild award winner hanover lives in the american southwest in the hardedged story that follows hanover shows us that not only can obsession persist through a lifetime but can perhaps sometimes last a little longer than that hurt me there werent many threebedroom houses that a single woman could afford lachmont drive was an exception built in the s from masonry block it sat in the middle of a line of houses that had once been very similar to it decades of use and modification had added character basement added in the s called finished only because the floor was concrete rather than dirt garage tacked on to the north side that pressed its outer wall almost to the property line artificial pond in the backyard that had held nothing but silt since the s the air smelled close and musty the kitchen vent cover banged in the wind and the air force base three miles to the north meant occasional jet noise loud enough to shake the earth but the floors were hardwood the windows recently replaced and the interiors a uniform white that made the most of the hazy autumn light the realtor watched the womancorrie morales was her namenervously he didnt like the way she homed in on the houses subtle defects yes there had been some water damage in the bathroom once yes the plaster in the master bedroom was cracking just a little the washerdryer in the basement seemed to please her though and the bathtub was an old iron clawfooted number the enamel barely chipped and she smiled as soon as she saw it she wasnt the sort of client he usually aimed for he was better with new families either justmarrieds or firstkid types with them he could talk about building a life and how the house had room to grow in a sewing room for the woman an office for the man though god knew these days it seemed to go the other direction as often as not new families would come in live for a few years and trade up or traffic from the basemilitary people with enough money to build up equity and flip the house when they got reassigned rather than lose money by paying rent he had a different set of patter for those but he could work with them new families and military folks let the other realtors sell the big mansions in the foothills maybe he didnt make as much on each sale but there were places in his territory hed sold three or four times in the last ten years this woman though was hard to read in her late thirties and seeing the place by herself no wedding ring her face had been pretty once not too long ago might still be if she wore her hair a little longer or pulled it back in a ponytail maybe she was a lesbian not that it mattered to him as long as her money spent its a good solid house he said nodding as a trick to make her nod along with him it is she said the price seems low motivated seller he said with a wink by what she opened and closed the kitchen cabinets excuse me motivated by what she said well you know how it is he said grinning kids grow up move on families change a place maybe fits in one part of your life and then you move on she smiled as if hed said something funny i dont know how it is actually she said the seller moved out because she got tired of the place the realtor shrugged expansively his mental gears whirring the question felt like a trap he wondered how much the woman had heard about the house he couldnt afford to get caught in an outright lie well they were young he said just got hitched and they had all these ideas and plans i dont like selling to newlyweds especially young ones too young to know what theyre getting into better to go rent a few places move around find out what you like what you dont like bought it and didnt like it didnt know quite what they were getting into he said the sudden weariness around the womans eyes was like a tell at a poker table the realtor felt himself relax divorced this one maybe more than once alone now and getting older maybe she was looking for someplace cheap or maybe it was just the allure of new beginnings that he was wrong in almost every detail didnt keep him from playing that hand my wife was just the same god rest her he said when we were kids shed hop into any old project like she was killing snakes got in over her head hell she probably wouldnt have said yes to me if shed thought it through you get older you know better dont get in so many messes they were good kids just no judgment she walked across the living room it looked big empty like this add a couch a couple chairs a coffee table and it would get cramped fast but right now the woman walked across it like it was a field like she was that twentyyearold girl with her new husband outside getting the baggage or off to work on the base like the world hadnt cut her down a couple times he could smell the sale he could taste it lot of rentals in the neighborhood she said looking out the front window he knew from her voice that her heart wasnt in the dickering hard to build up much of a community when youre getting new neighbors all the time you see that with anything near the base he said like they were talking about the weather people dont have the money for a down payment or some just prefer renting i cant rent anymore no i smoke she said thats a problem these days unless youve got your own house of course she took a deep breath and let it out slowly the realtor had to fight himself not to grin here we go wrap it up she said ill take it mr and mrs kleinfeld had lived at lachmont drive for eight years making them the longeststanding residents of the block to them the uhaul that pulled up on sunday morning was almost unremarkable they ate their toast and jam listened to the preacher on the radio and watched the new neighbor start unloading boxes she wore a pair of old blue jeans a dark tshirt with the logo of a longcanceled television show across the front and a pale green bandana when the breakfast was over mrs kleinfeld turned off the radio and cleaned the plates while mr kleinfeld ambled out to the front yard morning he said as the new woman stepped down from the back of the truck a box of underpacked drinking glasses jingling in her hand hi she said with a grin moving day mr kleinfeld said it is she said you need a hand with any of that i think im good thanks though if it turns out i do me and the missus are here all day he said come over anytime and welcome to the neighborhood thanks he nodded amiably and went back inside mrs kleinfeld was sitting at the computer entering the weeks expenses a trapped housefly was beating itself to death against the window angry buzzing interrupted by hard taps its happening again mrs kleinfeld said it is it took her the better part of the day to put together the basics just assembling the new bed had taken over an hour and left her wrist sore the refrigerator wouldnt be delivered until the next day the back bedroom now a staging area was thighdeep in packed onethingandanother there was no phone service except her cell the electricity wasnt in her name yet but by nightfall there were clothes in the closet towels in the bathroom and her old leather couch in the living room by the television she needed to take the uhaul back but it could wait for morning she walked briskly through the househer houseand closed all the blinds the slick white plastic was thick enough to kill all the light from the street the new doubleglazed windows cut out the sounds of traffic it was like the walls had been suddenly silently transported someplace else like it was a space capsule a million miles from anything human cut off from the world she turned on the water in the tub it ran red for a moment rust in the pipes and then clear and then scalding hot she stripped as the steam rose naked in front of the fulllength mirror she watched the scars on her legs and elbowsthe tiny circles no bigger than the tip of a lit cigarette the longer thinner ones where a blade had marred the skinblur and fade and vanish her reflected body softened and the glass began to weep she turned off the water and eased herself into the bath slowly the heat of it brought the blood to her skin like a slap she laid her head against the iron tubs sloping back fidgeting to find the perfect angle she had soap a washcloth shampoo the almondscented conditioner that her boyfriend david liked she didnt use any of them after about ten minutes she turned leaning over the edge to reach for the puddle of blue cloth that was her jeans a pack of cigarettes a zippo lighter with its worn pink martini logo the click and hiss of the flame the first long drag of smoke curling through the back of her throat she tossed cigarette pack and lighter onto the floor and lay back again the tension in her back and legs and belly started to lose its grip around her the house made small sounds the ticking of the walls as they cooled the hum of her computers cooling fan the soft clinking of the water that lapped her knees and breasts smoke rose from her cigarette lost almost instantly in the steam the first stirrings of hunger had just touched her belly when the screaming started jet engines ramping up from nothing to an inhuman shriek between one breath and the next something fluttered in her peripheral vision and she scrambled around dropping her cigarette in the tub and soaking the floor with water something moved in the mirror something that wasnt her the condensation made it impossible to see him clearly he might have had pale hair or he might have been bald he might have jeans or dark slacks the shirt was white where it wasnt red the movement of balled fists was clearer than the hands themselves and somewhere deep in the airplanes roar there were words angry ones corrie yelped her feet slipping under her as she tried to jump clear the noise began to fade as suddenly as it had come the rumbling echoes batting at the walls more and more weakly the mirror was empty again except for her she took a towel wrapping herself quickly her blood felt bright and quick her heart fluttering like a bird her breath fast and panicshallow her mouth tasted like metal hello she said is someone in here the floor creaked under her weight she stood still waiting for an answering footstep the water pooled around her feet and she began to shiver the house had grown viciously cold is anyone here she said again her voice small and shaking nothing answered her but the smell of her spent cigarette all right then she said hugging her arms tight around herself okay mom listen to me everythings fine were not breaking up she said willing her voice to be more certain than she was well you move out like this her mother said voice pressed small and tinny by the cell connection and that house i think its perfectly reasonable of me to be concerned corrie lay back on the couch pressing the tips of her fingers to her eyes sleeplessness left her skin waxy and pale her movements slow she had taken the day off work thinking she would finish unpacking but the boxes were still where they had been the day before afternoon sun spilled in through the windows making the small living room glow the refrigerator had arrived an hour before and hummed to itself from the kitchen still empty its just something i need to do corrie said is he beating you who david my david people have habits her mother said she raised her voice when she lectured they imprint i did the same thing when i was young all my husbands were alcoholics just like my father was i like david very much hes always been very pleasant but you have a type i havent dated anyone seriously since nash i dont have a type what about that hebrew boy nathaniel i saw him a total of eight times he got drunk broke a window and i never talked to him again dont turn into a lawyer with me you know exactly what i mean theres a kind of man that excites you and so of course you might find yourself involved with that kind of man if davids another one like nash i think i have a right to corrie sat up pressing her hand at the empty air as if her mother could see the gesture for stop the distant music of an icecream truck came from a different world the jaunty electronic tune insincere and ominous mother i dont feel comfortable talking about the kind of man that does or doesnt excite me all right david is absolutely unlike nash in every possible way he wouldnt hurt me if i asked him to did you her mother snapped did i what did you ask him to hurt you the pause hung in the air equal parts storm and silence okay were finished corrie said i love you mom and i really appreciate that youre concerned but i am not talking about you are her mother shouted you are talking about everything with me i have spent too much time and money making sure that you are all right to pretend that there are boundaries maybe for other people but not for us mija never for us corrie groaned the quiet on the end of her cell phone managed to be hurt and accusing im sorry she said i understand that youre scared about this and really i understand why youre scared but you have to trust that i know what im doing im not twenty anymore did you or did you not ask david to hurt you my sex life with david has been very respectful and loving corrie said through gritted teeth he is always a perfect gentleman the few times that weve talkedjust talkedabout anything even a little kinky hes been very uncomfortable with including even simulated violence in our relationship okay now can we please drop is that why you left him were not breaking up because thats the other side isnt it her mother said talking fast you find someone who isnt your type and you put yourself with him because hes good and clean and healthy and then there you are being good and clean and healthy like eating wheat germ every meal when you really want a steak all right im lost now she said her voice taking on a dangerous buzz are you saying that davids an abusive shit or that hes too good for me whats your argument she could hear her mother crying now not sobs nothing more than the little waver in tone that meant tears were in her eyes i dont know why youre doing this her mother said why you moved out of davids apartment why youre in that house im afraid youve gone to a very dark place the last words were so thin and airless corrie had to take a deep breath maybe i have she said drawing the words out but its all right im not scared anymore shouldnt you be is there nothing to be frightened of corrie stood it was only four steps to the bathroom door with the lights off the fulllength mirror showed her in silhouette the brightness of day behind her and her features lost in shadow there was no other shape no man with balled fists or knives no promises that the damage was a sign of love no cigarette burns or dislocated fingers or weekends of sex she was afraid to refuse it was just a mirror she was the only thing in it is there nothing to be frightened of dont know corrie said im finding out oh mr kleinfeld said suddenly off his stride so you knew it was haunted the new neighborcorrie her name wassaid sure i mean just in general terms mr kleinfeld smiled but his eyebrows were crawling up his forehead across the table his wife poured out cups of tea for the three of them her smile might have meant anything is that how you heard about it mrs kleinfeld asked youre one of those ghost hunters sunlight pressed through the still air along with the distant chop of a helicopter formation the new neighbor took the proffered cup and sipped at it his wife put two small silver spoonfuls of sugar into his stirred it twice neatly and handed him his cup not really the new neighbor said it was just one of those things you hear about you know in the air i dont even know where i stumbled onto it the first time but the realtor was pretty upfront was he mr kleinfeld said that had never happened before either sure i mean there werent a lot of gory details i asked about why the price was low and he said something about ghost stories and the old tenants getting freaked out and leaving the women mrs kleinfeld said it doesnt seem to care about men but it hates women it the new neighbor said and mr kleinfeld watched his wife settle back into her chair the first part of the meeting might not have gone along its usual path but they were back in familiar territory now there is a restless spirit in that house mrs kleinfeld said has been since before we came it never bothers the men they never see it the girls though mr kleinfeld said shaking his head the way he always did i could make a list of the young women weve had banging on our door in the middle of the night scared out of their wits its not a fit house for a girl to live in especially alone he sipped his tea but it was still scalding he blew across its surface weird the new neighbor said any particular reason anyone knows about ancient indian burial ground his wife nodded slowly the steam rising from her teacup swirling around her face the chop of the helicopters grew gradually louder mr kleinfeld shifted back a degree in his chair his part was done for now and just as well the missus was better at getting through to people than he was she always had been theres a story she said i dont know how much of its true and how much of its fancied up but ive never heard or seen anything to contradict it twenty years ago there was a couple of young people moved into that house youre in today young man and his wife well it wasnt long before the wife started showing up at the grocery store in big sunglasses wearing long sleeves in the middle of the summer that sort of thing lots of domestic abuse in the world the new neighbor said doesnt make for a million haunted houses her tone was light but mr kleinfeld heard something strong under it maybe skepticism maybe something else he was an evil man mrs kleinfeld said people used to hear them fighting they say he used to try to hide the worst of the screaming under the jet noise but the whole neighborhood knew one fellow who lived on the other side where that nice asian family is now tried to make an issue of it and the man threatened to cut his nose off and then one night they were gone man and wife both vanished from the face of the earth like theyd never been a few months later her people came and packed up all the furniture and put the place up for sale rumor was that the wife was in some sort of asylum out west with her mind all gone to putty talking about demons and satan she never did get out of that place the new neighbor was caught now her expression sharp as a pencil point mrs kleinfeld had to stop for a moment while the helicopters passed overhead the blades cutting through the high air with enough violence to drown out their words or their screams for that matter next people who moved in were an older couple with a girl just in high school she said her voice loud enough to carry over the falling racket as the copters flew on six months they were there not more the mother said shed have tried to stand it but the spirit started coming after the daughter too and that was that sold the place at a loss and moved across to the other side of the base only time the place has had the same owner for more than a year since then was five years back when there were four young men sharing the place and even then i saw their girlfriends leaving in the middle of the night crying too hard to stop what does it do to them the new neighbor asked the hardness was still there but it wasnt skepticism something more immediate more demanding something like hunger it comes for them mrs kleinfeld said and thank god they can feel it no ones ever stayed long enough to know what it would do if it caught them but there are nights i can feel it hating all the way over here im in my bed at night saying my prayers and its like someone put ice against the wall you couldnt pay me to stay a night in that place not for a million dollars something lives in that house and it hates women the new neighbor nodded more mr kleinfeld thought to herself than to him or his wife there was a brightness in her eyes not fear maybe even pleasure the new neighbors smile disturbed him more than his wifes story ever did he cleared his throat and she seemed to wake up a little her smile widened and became less authentic have you seen anything yet he asked anything out of the ordinary me no she said not a thing the cold front came on friday almost a week later vicious winds blasting down from a cloudless sky gritty air ripped at the trees stripping off leaves that were still turning from green to yellow and red and gold the glories of autumn cut short and shredded the low western sun turned bloody as it fell and corrie wheeled her car into the undersized garage like a child pulling up a blanket the thin walls were less protection than the idea of them every new gust battering against the house made the garage creak dust settled from the frame roof she scurried from car to kitchen hunched against the sound of the wind once she got into the house itself she unfurled the wind still threw handfuls of dirt against the windows the thick plastic blinds shuffled and clicked in the drafts but the masonry walls seemed beyond any violence nature could contrive solid and sober as a prison corrie turned on every light as she walked through the house she examined each room in turn the brokendown boxes in the spare bedroom the legal pads and laptop docking station in her makeshift office the sheets and blankets in the linen closet in the kitchen she counted the knives on the magnetic rack and checked the oven in her bedroom she squatted her eye on a level with the unmarked bedspread she took her shotgun from its place under the bed counting out the shells under her breath as she unloaded it and loaded it again in the bathroom she lingered in front of the mirror for over a minute her fingertips on the glass eyes unfocused and attention turned inward nothing had moved nothing was missing even the raging wind hadnt so much as rolled a pencil she microwaved a plate of lasagna poured herself a glass of wine and sat down on the couch a few bites and she was up again pacing restless frustrated outside the sun slipped lower i know youre here she said to the empty air i know you can hear me the wind shrieked and murmured the window blinds shuddered the air smelled of tomato sauce a little but burned at the edgesacid with a touch of smoke she stood in the middle of the room jaw clenched silent the moment lasted years before the hint of a smile touched her mouth and a mad reckless light came into her eyes she walked back to the couch picked up her plate and took it to the kitchen she ate two more bites standing at the sink and then dropped the plate onto the brushed steel with a clatter the faucet swung easily cold water drowning the food reddened bits of meat and pale sheets of pasta swum in a cold ugly soup and then settled clogging the drain she looked at the mess and deliberately stepped back leaving it there her chin rose daring the emptiness around her something within the house shifted walls that had been only block and plaster and paint turned their attention to her the windows hid behind their blinds like closed eyes she kicked off her shoes chuckling to herself the floor felt colder than it should have the glass of wine still rested on the coffee table she scooped it up taking her purse in the other hand the furnace kicked on blowers roaring a thousand miles away in the kitchen she leaned against the counter beside the sink goose bumps covered her arms and thighs her breath was coming fast and shallow and shaking a little she lit a cigarette and then sipped the cool astringent wine rolling it in her mouth feeling the alcohol pressing through the soft permeable membranes of her flesh when she swallowed her throat went a degree warmer she set the cigarette between her lips and stretched out a hand lifting the halffull glass red trembled for a moment as she slowly deliberately poured it out the wine spilling over the floor and staining the tiles she dropped the glass into the sink with her ruined dinner and stepped forward grinding the soles of her feet into the puddle the storm outside sounded like a warning she shifted her hips twisted at the waist dancing in the mess she rolled her weight back and forth humming to herself and raised her arms over her head her joints loosened her belly grew warm and heavy her nipples hardened and her breath became visible and featherwhite in the sudden arctic chill voices came from somewhere nearby raised in anger but distant still dancing she pressed one hand to her belly took the cigarette between her fingers and drew the smoke back into her the taste of it was like drinking fire she flicked the ash watching the soft gray fall down down down into the wide red puddle at her feet not wine blood he stood framed by the basement door a young man and ageless his shoulders were broad as a bull his pale hair cut close to the skull the dark slacks shed seen in the mirror were tight and strained across the hip as if designed to point out the things barely restrained erection with every deep heaving breath blood sheeted down his body from the hole where his heart should have been she had the impression of corrupted meat beneath that pale skin his lips curled back in wordless rage baring teeth too sharp to be human the warmth within her was gone her face was pale and the electric shock of fear turned her dance to stillness the man shook his head at her once slowly back and forth when he opened his mouth and howled she retreated two quick involuntary steps the countertop digging at the small of her back hatred radiated from him hatred and malice and the promise of violence the tiles between them were the slick red of fresh slaughter when she spoke her voice trembled it sounded very small even to her dont like it huh the ghost shifted his head side to side neither nod nor shake but stretching like an athlete preparing for some terrible effort a clearer threat than balled fists wwhat she tried to say then crossed her arms and took a fast nervous drag on the cigarette she lifted her chin in defiance whatre you gonna do about it his eyes moved across her body like she was something he owned the hissing sound of his breath came from everywhere so what you want to hurt me come on then she said her voice taking on a little strength if youre gonna do it do it he stepped into the room filling the doorway the deathblood slick on his belly glittered he bared his teeth growling like a dog you want to hurt me then hurt me she yelled hurt me the ghost screamed and rushed across the room toward her she felt its rage and hatred surrounding her swallowing her she saw its hand rising to slap her down and she flinched back her eyes closed and braced for the blow every scar on her skin tingled like someone had touched them with ice filthy water poured into her mouth her nose corrupted and sour with decay she felt the spirit pressing against her pushing into her skin its rage lifted her like a wave and then it was gone she stood in the kitchen her body shaking and her ragged breath coming in sobs she was terribly cold the wine on her toesonly winewas halfdried and sticky storm wind battered at the windows the walls the furnace rumbled fighting against the frigid air she sank slowly her back against the cabinet and hugged her knees a stray tear fell down her cheek and she shuddered uncontrollably twice then between one breath and the next her mouth relaxed her body released the breaking tension was more than sexual she started laughing a deep satisfied sound like the aftermath of orgasm sunday morning brought the first snow of the season the thick wet flakes appeared just before dawn dark against the bright city backsplash of the clouds and transformed to a perfect white once they had fallen after the mornings toast and tea and sermon mr kleinfeld wrapped in his good wool overcoat lumbered out after breakfast snow shovel over his shoulder he cleared his walkway and his drive then the stretch of sidewalk in front of his house the trees all around were blackbarked and frosted with snow and very few cars passed the tracks of their tires leaving white furrows and never digging so deep as the asphalt finished with his own house he made his way through the anklehigh snow to his neighbors no lights glowed in the house no tracks marked her walk her driveway hadnt been used he hesitated not wanting to wake her but it was almost midday he rang the bell and when no answer came mittened manfully on the door no one came he shook his head and put himself to work the clouds above were bright as the snow when he finished the air not yet above the freezing point but warmer all the same his wife met him at the door with a cup of hot cocoa just as hed known she would he leaned the snow shovel by the door took the warm mug and kissed his wifes dry cheek i dont think our new neighbor made it home last night he said he sat in his chair i figure shes seen it wont be long now before she moves on it was a conversation theyd had before and he waited now for his wifes agreement her prediction two more months another month a week the missus was better at judging these things than he was so he was surprised when she stood silent for a long moment shaking her head i dont know she said i just do not know davids apartment still showed the gaps where she had been his clothes still hung in only half of the bedroom closet the hangers moving into the emptiness she had left only slowly as if hoping that her blouses and slacks and dresses might come back the corner where her desk had once been was still vacant the four hard circles that the legs had pressed into the carpet relaxed out a little but not gone the kid upstairs was practicing his guitar again working on power chords that had driven her halfcrazy when shed lived there they seemed sort of cute now hes getting better david said she rolled over stuffing the pillow under her head and neck as she did a thin line of snow ran along the windowsillthe first of the season david beside her nodded toward the ceiling he made it all the way through jesus of suburbia last week he said all five parts yep kids going places she said please god that its places out of earshot she brushed her fingertips across his chest his skin was several tones darker than hers and the contrast made her hand seem paler than she was and her scars as white as the snow he had his first gray hair in among the black just over his ear his dark eyes shifted over to her his smile riding the line between postcoital exhaustion and melancholy quick as the impulse she rolled the few more inches toward him and kissed his shoulder he raised his eyebrows the way he always did when he knew that she was nervous whats your plan for the day he asked housework she said you get up early and hit the laundromat he said she nodded and since that didnt work do an emergency load in the sink to get through work tomorrow he said ive got to meet up with gemma at three to get back my scanner youll need to get hopping its past noon now another few minutes wont make a difference he said putting his hand over hers he wasnt prettyhis face too wide his nose bent where it had broken as a child and never been put right his jaw touched by the presentiment of jowls handsome maybe in an offputting way is there something to talk about is she said he took a long slow breath and let it out slowly not a sigh so much as the preparatory breath of a high diver or a man steeling himself for bad news i think you should come over tonight she said take a look at the place bring your laundry too he sat up the blankets dropped to his lap she looked at him unable to read his expression youre changing the rules he said each word was as gentle as picking up eggs no im not i always said that the not coming over part was temporary its just time thats all so you really arent breaking up with me jesus she said she took the pillow from under her head and hit him with it lightly then she did it again it is traditional he said girl gets a house without consulting her boyfriend moves all her stuff out tells him he cant come over says shes working through something but wont say what exactly it is its hard not to connect those dots and the part where i tell you in simple declarative sentences that im not breaking up with you goes under mixed signals he said she took a deep breath on the street a siren rose and fell sorry she said she got up from the bed pulling one of the sheets with her and wrapping it around her hips look i understand that this has been hard ive asked for a lot of faith you really have and given that i dont have an entirely uncheckered past and all she said i see why you would freak you and my mother both your mother shes been reading me the riot act ever since she heard about it she really likes you he leaned back surprise and pleasure in his expression your mother likes me focus sweetheart im apologizing here and i dont mean to interrupt he said relief had left him giddy between his brave face and her attention being elsewhere shed managed to ignore the sadness and dread that had been seeping into him now that it was lifting a little she saw how deep it had gone she found her pants in a heap on the floor sat down at the dressing table and lit a cigarette the taste of the smoke helped her to think when she spoke her voice was lower ive had a rough ride this life you know i used to be ashamed of that i used to think that after nash i was broken damaged goods like that and feeling like that has she stopped shook herself laughed at something and took another drag feeling like that has haunted me she said with an odd smile and this house is part of not feeling that way it is then i already like it he said sight unseen if it helps you see yourself the way i see you then its on my side corrie chuckled and shook her head that might be going a little far she said but anyway i want you to come over i want you to see it you should bring a sweater it gets kind of cold sometimes im there and i want you to think about whether youd like to move in corrie theres enough room the neighborhoods a little sketchy and the jet noise sucks but not worse than the jukebox hero practicing all the time corrie are you saying you still want to live with me her smile was tight and nervous not asking for a decision she said but im opening negotiations he slipped to the side of the bed slid to the floor at her feet and laid his head in her lap for a long moment neither of them moved or spoke then corrie wiped her eyes with the back of her hand come on silly she said youve got to get ready for gemma go get that scanner back i do he said with a sigh come shower with me not today she said and when he raised his eyebrows i want to smell like you when i get home lachmont drive seethed around her every noisethe hum of the refrigerator the distant roar of the furnace the ticking of the wooden floors as the pushpull of heat and cold adjusted the boardshad voices behind them screaming the faintest smell of hair and skin burning touched the air she knew they were meant to be hers corrie hung her coat in the closet a shape flickered in the basement doorway dark eyes and inhuman teeth she set a kettle on the stovetop and smoked a cigarette while it heated when the clouds outside broke the doubled light of sky and snow pressed in at the blinds the kettle whistled she took a mug out of the cupboard put in a bag of chamomile tea and poured the steaming water in when she sat down there was blood on the floor a bright puddle almost too red to be real and then a trail as wide as a mans hips where the stillliving man had been dragged across to the basement door when she looked up the air had a layer of smoke haze a foot below the ceiling it might have been her cigarette it might have been gun smoke she sipped her tea savoring the heat and the faint sweetness fine she said she stood up slowly stretching the stairs down to the basement were planks of wood painted a dark chipping green the years had softened the edges the basement had none of the brightness of the day above it even with the single bare bulb glowing the shadows were thick the furnace roar was louder here and the voice behind it spat rage and hatred she followed the trail of blood to the corner of the basement where washer and dryer sat sullen in the gloom she leaned down put her shoulder to the corner of the dryer and shifted it the metal feet shrieked against the concrete the scar under it was almost three feet wide a lighter place where the floor had been broken taken up and then filled in with a patch of almostmatching cement she sat down on the dusty floor there was blood on her hands now black and sticky and coppersmelling a spot of white appeared on the odd concrete and began to spread frost she put her hand on it like she was caressing a pet we should probably talk she said and when i say that i mean that i should talk and you for once should listen something growled from the corner by the furnace a shadow detached from the gloom and began pacing like a tiger in its cage she sipped her tea and looked around the darkness her gaze calm and proprietary its funny the things they get wrong you know they remember that you threatened joe arrison but instead of his cock you were going to cut off his nose they know i went to the laughing academy but they dont remember that i got out apparently i was going on about satan or something mind gone to putty she stroked the concrete the frost was spreading a dot of red smeared it at the center blood welling up from the artificial stone and you really screwed me up you know she said shooting you really was worse than i thought it would be i was so scared that someone would find you i had nightmares all the time id see someone who looked a little like you or id smell that cheapass cologne you liked and id start panicking i even tried to kill myself once didnt do a very good job of it i was one messed up chica every couple weeks id do a search online i just knew that there was going to be something bones found at lachmont drive so what do i find instead ghost stories there was one that even had a drawing of you and so i knew right the shadow shrieked at her its mouth glowing like there was something burning inside it the blood at the center of the frost became a trickle corrie let the icy flow stain her fingers i was so freaked out she said laughing i spent years putting myself back together and here you still were i dont think i slept right for a month and then one day something just clicked you know ive got a job i can buy a house if i want she sipped at her tea but it had gone cold she was sitting in a spreading pool of gore now the blood spilling out to the corners of the room more blood than a real body could contain it soaked her pants and wicked up her shirt chilling her but not badly the shadow hunched forward ready to leap davids coming over tonight she said i wasnt going to let him until i was sure it was safe but tonight im going to make him dinner and were probably going to get a little high watch a dvd something like that and then im going to fuck him in your bedroom and you youre going to watch the blood rushed up it was almost ankledeep now tiny waves of red rising up through the basement corrie smiled youll really hate him she said he is everything you could never be and he really really loves me and you know what i love him too and were going to be here maybe for years maybe forever and were going to do everything you couldnt and were going to do it right so seriously hows that for revenge the shadow screamed rising up above her blotting out the light she could almost feel its teeth at her neck she scratched youre dead fucker she whispered to the darkness you cant hurt me bloodsoaked she picked up her teacup and walked to the stairs the ghost whipped at her with cold insubstantial fingers it screamed in her ears battering her with anger and hatred corrie grinned a sense of peace and calm radiating from her the voice grew thinner more distant richer with despair with each step she took the visions of blood faded a little more and by the time she stepped into the winter light she was clean cecelia holland theres a cost for everything but here we learn

and in the dark it came on her heavy and sweaty its weight all along her body its mouth quested greedily after hers and she rolled her head away sick she felt its nakedness prodding and poking against her thighs her body roused even as she fought it a gritty shameful lust to submit coursed through her blood deep inside some ancient itch woke longing for penetration her hips rolled arching upward her knees parting and she heard its horrible triumphant laugh she jolted awake drenched with sweat in the dark room around her the other girls were still sleeping none of them made outcries none of them moaned in her dream fioretta slid quietly up off the pallet her nightdress sticking to her her long hair dripping down her shoulders one tress had wrapped itself around her neck she fumbled her way to the water basin and washed her face she felt dirty all over the day was coming light began to filter into the room behind her now the others were waking she kept her back to them she did not want to see them to know their faces they bustled around her whispering and yawning without asking they peeled off the damp nightdress they brought her a clean shift a fresh gown they murmured around her like a crowd of bees she did not look at them afraid they would see the dream in her eyes afraid of what she would see in their eyes they hated her she had felt that at once behind their cooing their simpering words my lady this my lady that and their rigid smiles they pulled and slapped at her dressing her yanking on the brush as they did her hair tugged the necklace into her skin when they clasped it one pinched her so hard she jumped they slid golden slippers on her feet and in their midst she went down to court they left the room on a cold stone stair but as they went down the step smoothed under her feet the space widened the swelling light struck on burnished walls the girls around her began to laugh and giggle ahead of them were tall white doors figured with gold and as they approached the doors burst open and on a rising excitement they swept through into the brilliant merry bustle of the court the room was full of young and beautiful people in satin and lace their faces smooth as silk as she came in they swooped toward her and bowed their eyes glittered eageror desperate she went through them toward the throne at the far end lifting her skirts in her hands and the wizardking stood up his hand out tall and lean he was dressed head to foot in a straight plain white gown his hair hidden under a cap his beard was a narrow dark fringe his face with its long eyes and straight narrow nose chiseled as if from walnut he said ah my beauty my darling one today i shall call you marguerite for you are a pearl she could not speak her breath choked in her throat her skin creeping he looked so well but she knew now her eyes downcast she went up the steps to the chair beside his he laughed as he had in the dream triumphant from the beginning she had known there would be a cost she had been born in the village at the foot of the mountain her mother died when she was only a child and her father was a drunkard so they were very poor but fioretta was pretty and clever and worked hard and as she grew into a handsome girl many young men thought well of her she was getting ready to choose one to marry when her father blind with drink set the house on fire she dragged him out of it but the fire scorched her face and burned her leg so badly she needed a crutch to walk the wound on her face faded but the scar caught one corner of her eye so she seemed to squint a little after that the young men thought less well of her all but the bailiffs younger son palo who was crossgrained anyway his familys black sheep he was round and plain a daydreamer a stutterer while her father went around drinking up everybodys sympathy palo came to fioretta and demanded that he marry her fioretta stopped short he had been waiting for her by the riverbank down from the bridge where she often went searching for herbs she propped herself on her crutch hostile quick to sense pity what did you say he stood there squat and round his hands on his hips his blue eyes intense and said again yyou ought to mmmarry me this is a great fffavor to you you know at that she went hot with temper she burst out what makes you so wonderful youre a fat pompous oaf he sneered at her youre a cccripple and youre poor your fathers the village dddrunk she flounced off tossing her head youre a fool then to want me youre a shshshrew then to turn down what you should gratefully accept he said in pursuit she wheeled to confront him youre pockyfaced youre shorter than i am and you smell youve got a tongue like a vvvv he put his hands on his hips again you squinty gimp you dont even have the wits to knnnow what im offering you at least i have the wit to know to reject it he flung his hands up his face bright red and stormed off at that she was suddenly very lonely she sat down on the riverbank exhausted she had nowhere to goshe was sleeping in the church and she would only eat if she found herbs and mushrooms and housewives in the village to buy them the next day would be the same she thought regretfully of palo even fighting with him was better than being alone there was a convent in the village on the other side of the mountain she could go there her gaze rose to the river rushing by or she could just throw herself in bitterly she wished the world were different good morning said a strange voice beside her she looked up startled at the old man standing there he wore a long gray hooded cloak which shadowed his face but his eyes shone bright and clear his hands were tucked away in his sleeves what are you doing here she blurted what do you want with me i have been watching you he said for a while me a shiver went through her she struggled up onto her feet and braced the crutch under her armpit why would you wait for me who are you he shrugged the gray cloak obscured him as if he went wrapped in a faint mist half turning away he mumbled into his hand call me goodman greenm thats near enough dont remember then he turned back toward her what is your name child fioretta she said ah he said such a lovely name and so harsh a fate as i have seen for such a lovely girl his bright eyes glimmered inside the shadow of his face fate is too cruel isnt it but what if i told you there is a place nearby where you could be made whole and beautiful again more beautiful than ever a ripple of yearning went through her almost overwhelming resisting that she gave a snort of disbelief she said i would think you were a great fool well he said he began to drift off like a mist moving along the riverbank but the castle is just up the mountain only a mile or so on youre going that way anyway his eyes gleamed at her from the darkness of the hood come he said take the right path and went off she stared after him her mouth open she watched him until he disappeared in the busy crowd by the bridge she rubbed her eyes with her hand thinking people shouldnt say such things thats cruel she saw ahead of her only the world cruel and cold there was the convent if they would not let her take the veil since she had no dowry they would give her work and keep her that was all she could hope for now in fact if she got less she would not be hoping too much longer for anything she started off toward the bridge the crutch dug under her armpit her leg ached but she had hours before sundown one of a dozen people she clumped across the bridge and turned onto the path up the mountain the other travelers soon turned off and she was alone as she climbed the path wound steadily upward rockier and narrow between tall pines the crutch slipped on the stones and she almost fell she should try to walk without it her leg seemed to get stronger when she used it but it hurt more too to walk without the crutch far behind her someone called out she shivered the voice was too far away to tell who it was but in her heart she knew it was palo she could stop go back take whatever he deigned to give her he wasnt so bad quicktongued and sometimes funny she imagined the drudge work of keeping house while he lay around as her father had then the drudge work in bed at night she hobbled along he was far behind he would give up soon the path narrowed still more and turned a sharp bend around a boulder and she stopped startled ahead of her the path divided in two the lefthand way wound on up the mountain paved with jagged rocks and overhung with scrawny trees the righthand side led off through what seemed a glade where the sun streamed in through tall fair oaks and lit the flowerdappled grass between them and the path led easily downward smooth and wide she gulped she had been up this road before not often but enough to know this righthand path had never been here before the old mans words came back to her a place where you could be made whole and beautiful and happy again behind her closer palo called uncertainly she took a step forward into the righthand path the air was warmer here the sunlight touched her face she walked on hitching along on her crutch the ground deep with leaves soft underfoot the trees seemed to spread their arms over her like a ceiling overhead so she walked down into a dark tunnel the wind blew through their leaves and they whispered like voices too soft to hear the words a wave of uncertainty broke over her she should go back she turned and saw far up at beginning of the path where the sunlight shone palos dark shape against the afternoon sky then coming up the other way she heard the bustle and laughter of a crowd of people she turned toward them wondering where they had come from they gamboled toward her bright and pretty as a flock of butterflies girls and men in beautiful clothes gathering up armfuls of wildflowers as they passed through the grassy glade at the far end of the tunnel of oaks fioretta drew aside to let them go by but they did not they gathered around her mirthful and brighteyed and took the gathered flowers and wreathed her in them she stood too amazed to move drenched in buttercups and violets and sprays of yarrow and the crowd around her parted through the gap came the old man he had shed the gray cloak he looked much younger his beard darker he wore white head to foot a gown a peaked cap he said welcome home fioretta and took her by the hands smiling she could not speak glad and grateful she let herself be drawn forward into the midst of these fair and merry people they hurried her down the road the trees ahead parted and across a flowery meadow a castle tower streamed a red pennant against the violet sky that was where they were going that white spire above the forest she thought suddenly of palo and turned and looked back but he was gone good she thought relieved and turned forward toward the wonders that awaited her she had known even then that there would be a cost but then she had not cared from that moment on she had been beautiful her legs were quick and her feet sure her hands graceful with delicate fingers her hair was like spun silk braided with ribbons and jewels she wore a satin gown that glistened with embroidered figures and on her feet were soft leather shoes that first day she sat on a raised dais beside the wizardking looking out over his great pillared gilded hall and watched his glittering exuberant court flirt and laugh dance and declaim before them the hall was wide and yet full of light from lamps standing everywhere round golden pillars held the roof up high above them the crowd whirled and dipped across the floor in a constant gaiety and she was their queen one by one they all came and bowed down before her servants brought trays of bread and fruit and cheese and she ate until she was stuffed she put her hand to her face the scar was gone her cheek as soft as a rose petal her leg was straight again she was whole again before her passed a constant stream of amusements there were jugglers and tumblers which made her laugh and singers who played so tunefully she held her breath to hear them she turned to the man on the throne beside her and he smiled and patted her arm she wondered what to say to him how to thank him but he only nodded and gestured toward some new fancy she wondered how long this would last a clown in red pants brought out a bear which turned in circles smirking girls wearing almost nothing commanded monkeys in little red hats to ride dogs and the dogs to run in circles and then stand on their hind legs and yap the monkeys clinging tight three men rushed out bearing on their arms a host of brilliant birds that shrieked and flapped their wings deafening she put her hands over her ears at their screams and beside her the wizardking gave her a sharp look and waved his hand and said something and abruptly they were ponies a little group of musicmen sat down below the dais tuned their lutes and patted their drums and the court began to dance the wizard turned to her dance my dear one he said to her let me see you merry with you she asked shy he seemed so solemn too majestic to dance and in spite of her gratitude she did not really want to touch him no no he said with a smile i will watch he gestured her toward the round dance forming on the floor show me your grace and beauty my queen she stood delighting in her nimble legs she ran out neatfooted as a goat to the spreading circle of girls in the center of the hall without thinking she knew every step perfectly and she whirled and dipped so elegantly everybody else stopped and gathered to see it the music was beautiful the dance was a song her newly perfect body sang but when out of breath she went back to the edge of the floor to let someone else have a place she heard the wall behind her murmur she turned her head looking out of the side of her eye the wall was of pale stone the surface carved intricately into vines and leaves at first she saw nothing but then in the spaces between the leaves eyes appeared desperate gleaming with tears they turned on her and through a crevice between the stone vines a hand reached out she jerked herself forward again her heart pounding and stepped out a little into the middle of the floor out of reach she would not see this misery she was too happy she could dance and she had never eaten so well and she was beautiful that was what mattered she made her way back to her place by the wizardking but now she saw bits of people everywhere eyes in the columns too hands and feet and the tables she saw had human legs and the braziers were the bottom halves of people with their open bellies full of fire the lamps were long thin girls all gilded their hair aflame when she looked down she thought she saw the floor was made of twisted bodies jammed together yet it was smooth and hard as stone she lifted her gaze to the happy whirling courtiers around her and her heart froze she stood beside him and said too loudly i loved the dancing the wizard said you were the most beautiful dancer there my queen maeve then from the crowd suddenly a woman strode forward who was not joyous and not laughing her eyes flashed with anger she cried no i wont have thisi was there yesterday fioretta stiffened her mouth falling open she turned toward the wizard and he gripped her arm leaning toward her his gaze turned on the angry woman be warned he said in a deep harsh voice remember what you were before the woman flung her arms out to him she was beautiful tall and shapely with long black hair and red lips her clothes were magnificent sheets of silk and silver cascading from the glowing purple calyx of her bodice her hands reached toward him pleading please my lordi did everything you wanted i rosa the wizard said and made a gesture fioretta gasped before them the woman writhed a moment shrinking her clothes shed from her like the petals of a blown flower to leave behind a withered crone her hair stringy and white her arms with the skin hanging like bags off the bones from the court looking on there went up a cry of disgust and contempt fiorettas arm was still tight in the wizards grasp the hag in the middle of the floor sank to her knees sobbing and then from all sides the others pelted her with food and hats and shoes fioretta spun toward him no she said dont punish her so i beg of you the wizard smiled at her his hand on her arm did not ease its grip he said sit down my fairy queen my gloriana remember i am master here his voice turned smooth are you not happy here what else can i bestow upon you only let me make you happy that is all i wish fioretta stood rigid under his eyes she tore her gaze from his down there they were dragging off the beaten woman rosa another flower his hand on her arm tugged commandingly then where all the others were moving her gaze caught on one who did not go with the others who stood where he was staring at her he wore a red tabard and spurred boots a goldhilted sword at his side and a hat with a plume she swallowed he was tall with brawny arms and legs and a proud tilt to his head but she knew those blue eyes palo had not escaped after all another tug and this time weakkneed she sat down beneath her the chair shifted and sighed and she sat as lightly as she could now in the night the horrible thing groaned over her it slobbered over her lips and poked at her body and she wanted she wanted to receive it she wanted even its loathsomeness she thought of the walls and what rosa had said but she thought most of palo what a fool to follow her yet it was her fault he was trapped here she clenched her body against the dream and forced herself to waken in the dark the incubus was gone when the dream was gone she pried herself up from the bed six other girls slept around her all deep in their slumber she threw a cloak around her and went quietly among them to the door and out she would find palo and she would help him escape she went down the great main stair in the dark to the hall there was only this one tower and the hall palo had to be here somewhere the wizard was here somewhere also and she dreaded meeting him but she had to find palo even before she reached the hall she heard the sounds of voices the two tall doors were wide open but no light shone beyond only a faint blue glow like moonlight when she came to the last step the broad dim room before her was empty yet it was noisy with calling sighing weeping cries and curses she stood on the step and saw from every wall from the columns the hands reaching out the fingers stretching out into the air struggling toward the open the tables trudged back and forth groaning and mewling and the braziers and lamps sat slumped on the floor she could not bear this and she could not find palo anywhere there was no sign either of the wizard who was perhaps out prowling as he had been when he caught her she ran back up the stair to the next landing below the tower room where she was supposed to be sleeping on the far side of the landing was the narrow arched opening to another stairway and she followed it this one spiraled around and down darker with every step soon pitch dark the steps grew rough under her feet then ahead below the darkness yielded to a faint red light shining on the rock she went around a bend into the full brightness and stood on the edge of a kitchen made all of fitted stone where a fire burned in a great hearth huge pots lined the walls and spoons and forks hung in hooks from the ceiling at a table in the middle sat a woman her wispy gray hair only halfcovered by a scorched linen cap who was kneading a mass of brown floury dough fioretta stopped the woman lifted her head and gave her a gappy grin well its been long since anyone came to see me who are you what are you doing here the woman wiped her wrist across her forehead why im the cook of course without me you wouldnt eat fioretta went farther into the kitchen into the warmth and the good smells she felt suddenly much better the cooks arms went back to her work the dough constantly swelling and her hands constantly kneading it down again fioretta said you arenthis you mean the one upstairs the womans arms thrust and beat on the dough we have an agreement i dont poison him and he doesnt turn me into a toad who is he how can i get out of here the cooks eyes twinkled at her his name is written down around here somewhere can you read no the cook shrugged neither can i she turned to the hearth with her burly arms poking and turning the fire and the flames shot up the light and the heat flooded the room behind her on the table the dough seized the chance to grow into a wild floury puff as tall as a man the cook came quickly back and punched it flat again fioretta came to the edge of the table is there any way outback to the real world i dont know this is a haunted place and since he came nothing is what it seems how did you get here fioretta asked the cook looked startled i her eyes widened and she peered around as if she had just noticed where she was ive always been here havent i thats why its her gaze returned to fioretta maybe the question is who are you i fioretta stopped not sure what to say the cook smiled at her and then on the stair the young man in the red tabard came down around the corner hes come for you the cook said fioretta got up the young man stood there on the last step his blue eyes on her and without a word she went past him up the stair around the curve he followed her and when they were out of sight of the kitchen she faced him with the light behind him she could not see his face he was taller with brawny arms and chest he said well here we are and it was palos voice it is you she said he said yes not so changed as you are i would not know you had i not seen it happen his voice quivered you are so beautiful and so graceful he put out his hand to her and she knocked it aside why did you come she cried you must get away somehow you must see what becomes of people here i knew youd need help he said his voice twinged with sudden anger and he put his hands on his hips as he was used to do youve really gotten yourself into something this time i do not need help but she was glad he was here familiar even with his new good looks his tall and broadshouldered body there has to be some way out of this place ive looked he said i cant find any doors that open out of the castle at night everything falls asleep i almost did too and in a few more days i probably will he yawned veiled in the halfdark the light brimming him like a nimbus what are you doing out of bed anyway she blurted out without thinking looking for you well he said here i am he reached for her hand no she said dont touch me hell know he gave a sharp twitch as if she had struck him he backed away and slid his hands behind him oh he said in a different voice thats how it is i guess you have what you want already youd better get back where you belong then hadnt you she grew hot with shame he thought she had yielded to the wizard in a way she thought she had coming here his voice changed almost wistful now softer you are so beautiful you were pretty before and clever and brave and after the fire i thought id have a chance with you but now you are so much beyond mego on brisker i cant bear to think what could happen to you if the worst would be that he would see me again as i really am she thought gimp squintyeyed the idea drove a sort of panic through her and then a rising resolve she would be happy as long as she could as long as this lasted but she would try to get palo out of it she turned and went quickly up the stair in the morning she came down to the hall and the whole court bowed down before her and the wizard stood to greet her you are as glorious as the sunrise he said wherefore today i call you io my darling he led her to the chair beside him and as he sat beside her he said under his breath i have done my part his eyes drilled into her dont you think you owe me something she lowered her gaze she began to feel guilty ungrateful a quiver went along her nerves she felt herself weakening dissolving into the illusion he said or perhaps you need some additional persuasion what do you think of my new knight herethe one who came in with you she licked her lips i was alone there was someone else what was his namebuffo salo he was playing with her his eyes glittering she looked away then a brassy blast of horns made her start down the center of the hall walked a tall man dressed in black two trumpeters preceded him blasting shrill challenges on their horns after him came two more men carrying a sword and a shield he stopped before the wizard i am here to claim your place king of the wood send out your champion and we will decide the issue now the flock of courtiers had divided to let him through now in one breath they cried out in scorn and pressed closer fioretta sat up her hands in her lap and her heart in her throat she glanced at the wizard wondering what this meant he did not look troubled his mouth curved in a smile and he never looked at the black knight his gaze steady on her she realized this was a trap name your champion cried the black knight he turned to his squires and drew a long goldfitted sword from the scabbard from the crowd one man after another leaped forward my lord name me no me me my lord the wizards look heavy with meaning never left fioretta he stood lifted his hand and pointed toward the mass of the court you my newest knight you shall prove yourself today she looked where he was pointing and saw palo her breath stopped in her throat if anything happened to him it would be her fault the red knight came forward uncertainly into the middle of the hall took hold of his own sword and drew it out of the scabbard so awkward he almost dropped it fioretta clenched her teeth she knew he was no fighter the wizard watched her and she forced herself to look away the wizard said you dont care for combat my lovely one she gave a cracked laugh i prefer the music and the dancing ah he said but this is more amusing watch the two men faced each other and began to trade blows the wizard paid no heed to them his gaze steady on fioretta she glanced at the two men stalking around each other slashing with their swords palo slipped and missed and almost dropped his inside the handsome body he was still the chubby boy who stuttered her hands fisted in her lap suddenly she longed for him to be that chubby boy again back in the village safe not much of a swordsman this one the wizard said he laughed with a glance at her perhaps i should let him lose she said nothing her heart was hammering if she said the wrong thing she was destroyed palo was destroyed out there the red knight staggered backward away from the black knight inches ahead of the slashing blade well the wizard said does he die or will you save him she said do as you will my lord and stared off at the wall palo dodged behind one of the pillars the watching court laughed and the black knight with a roar pursued him palo darted around the pillar came up behind the black knight swung the sword flat and swept the other mans legs out from under him the knight sprawled on the floor his sword clattering away palo stood back letting him up the wizard said under his breath what a galahad his voice had a rough edge as if the red knights gallantry annoyed him fiorettas heart leaped he was brave after all palo and good and in the wizards annoyance she sensed some weakness she pretended an interest in one of her hands admiring the perfect fingernails and watched from the corner of her eye the black knight rolled to his feet and snatched up his sword again he rushed at palo flailing his blade from side to side palo backed up stumbled and went to one knee and the knight raised his sword for the final blow the wizard said shall he die my io he was watching fioretta not the fight fioretta bit her lip but the knight perhaps waiting for the wizards command had paused and now palo rolled away across the floor and leaped up out of reach of his enemy the black knight yelled and chased him but palo held his ground and as the other man plunged recklessly toward him brought his own sword up with both hands and struck the other mans weapon sending it flying the black knight staggered back his arms up mercy he cried he went down on one knee the wizard stood enough of this kill him as you are my knight i command it palo came forward toward the throne my lord grant him mercy his handsome new face was solemn he never looked at fioretta let him have time to regret his inadequacy the wizard gave a harsh laugh he shot a quick glance at fioretta beside him i give no mercy here my lord palo said for your greater glory and the glory of your queen the wizards teeth showed when he spoke it was clearly against his will you shall have his life then go the black knight knelt on the floor his hands raised imploring my lord the wizard jerked his hand up in command and the black knights men hauled him off palo bowed and backed away into the crowd the courtiers in their satins and gilt and jewels flooded back onto the floor dancing and laughing again as if nothing had happened she thought nothing did happen really he made it all up to catch me but somehow palo had escaped had won against the wizards will he had found the edge of the wizards power she dared not look at him lost now anyway in the mass of merry dancing people she thought he has found a place here like me she looked down at her beautiful clothes a servant was offering her a fine flaky pie and a cup of wine the hall filled with laughter and chatter maybe this is good enough she thought but something in her had divided and the pieces didnt quite match anymore except for the wizard there was no one to talk to the other people were only shells without conversation they laughed and said how happy they were and whirled away from her into the general dance it all looked the same as yesterday maybe it was all the same day then at sundown when they were all going off to bed she saw rosa again the fallen favorite had become the lamp beside the door her body was thin as a pole glistening gold her arms clasped across her middle her white hair stood straight up glowing only her eyes moved sleek and hopeless watching fioretta wanting to be there again to be what fioretta was fioretta went swiftly up to the bedchamber and let them undress her and put her to bed but she lay stiff on the pallet biting her lips and pinching herself to stay awake until the others were all asleep then she rose threw a cloak around her and went out she went straight down into the kitchen where she found the cook stirring a great cauldron and the red knight sitting on the steps he gave her a glancing look his face stern she sat beside him you did very well she said i didnt know you could fight when its your life he said not looking at her his voice cold you learn fast you should go back hell catch you she said hes already caught me she looked at the cook again beseeching tell us how we can escape the cook was slicing onions the knife so fast it was a blur you came here of your own will you must stay until the castle falls she groaned palo was watching her curiously you dont want to staywhere you are so beautiful and so cherished she put her hand on his arm you were so brave and you were good when he wanted you to be wicked you defied him when you did not kill the black knight and he had to accept it you gave me some reason to hope i can keep on resisting him he had turned toward her at her touch and she looked into his eyes that was wonderful she said and she kissed him he flung his arms around her and kissed her back she shut her eyes reveling in the strength of his arms the sweetness of the kiss if the wizard destroyed her tomorrow she would have this one real true moment this one real true knight palos hand stroked her hair and she laid her head on his shoulder i love you he said i will always love you you have saved me so farwithout you i think i would already have given in to him you havent thank god you havent i dont know how long i can fight him off im afraid sssh he said ill think of somethinghush my darling one he kissed her again the cook was watching them smiling fioretta made herself draw back the memory of rosa flooded her mind thats not good enough i dont know if we have much time he said nostay and grabbed for her hand she held herself away from him at any moment he can ruin us i saw himyou saw what he did to that other woman if he finds out she faced him her heart pounding she had found a wonderful man to love but she could never have him she turned and ran up the stair a sinking feeling in her heart that in fact the wizard already knew she had to sleep and when she slept the demon came on her whispering kiss him will you want him and not me will you after all ive done for you you heartless whore it ground itself on her pinching and tugging at her breasts poking her between the legs stirring her to a thick greedy lust she struggled against her own body which longed so for the consummation palo she thought palo she knew that to give in would doom her and palo both but her lecherous body yearned for the coupling for the demons thrust she could not hold out too much longer between her legs was damp and thick with heat and an evil voice inside whispered let him hell keep me i will be queen forever hell love me and ill be different from the others she thought palo palo she made herself see him in her mindas he had been before the round untested boy with a wrench she woke up and lay there struggling to stay awake until the dawn came in the morning the other women dressed her and they hurried down to the court to the senseless merry laughter and the endless wild dancing when she came in the wizard rose as he had before but this time he was scowling at her behold the adulterous one i name you helen queen of treacherous women she stopped before his throne and the court fell silent the wizard sneered at her i ask one act of gratitude and instead i am traduced you shall not sit by my side today slut then palo stepped up out of the crowd wizard he walked between her and the throne and his voice rang out loud and brave i challenge you for this woman ho ho the wizard said you do do you he came down from the throne and paced around palo the hem of his white gown sweeping on the floor you think you can fight me you fool hah he flung one hand up go back as you were palo fioretta cried out palo seemed to buckle his red tabard flew off and he shrank and grew wider his handsome face bloated into the plain round pockmarked face of the bailiffs black sheep son he gave a yell and drew his sword and the blade melted away to nothing the court let out a lustful howl all at once they rushed forward snatching off their hats and shoes to throw fioretta leaped forward toward the wizard her hands pressed together no let him livei will do what you wishonly let him go the wizard seemed to grow taller and his eyes blazed his voice hissed out too late for that hussy too late fioretta she staggered she felt her beautiful clothes fall away and she stumbled on her bad leg she put her hands to her face and felt the slick ugly scar a shoe hit her shoulder the crowd of the court pressed closer their eyes glowing their faces ugly with hate palo wheeled his arms out trying to shield her fioretta her name she understood suddenly in a gust of memory how the wizard had only spoken her name twice and each time changed her something else hit her on the cheek palo jerked his arms up to fend off a hail of missiles she had heard the wizards name oncewhat was it he stood there laughing palo clutched her as hard things rained down on both of them and she flung her arms around him to stay on her feet she shouted goodman greenough greengood greenman greenham godham the wizard laughed disdainful she sagged under the weight of the attack greenam goodman goodgreen the wizard laughed again but he was slowly turning spinning around in place his white robes flew off what they had covered was not as tall was lumpy green damp covered with leaves or feathers or scales it spun faster and faster and the court besetting palo and fioretta let out a screech their target had changed the walls and columns erupted hands legs bodies the great throne behind the wizard reared up into a scrawny old man and two brawny boys who hurled themselves on the whirling green demon the floor burst up into waves of bodies wild hair like spume and the arch of shoulders rising in pieces and as one the prisoners of the castle flung themselves past fioretta and palo and onto their tormentor fioretta cried out something struck her from above and she looked up the roof was sagging down as legs and hands and heads rained down from it the floor was rising around her breaking into a tumble of arms and legs buttocks elbows she clutched palos hand in the door through the thickening downpour of the collapsing roof she saw the cook laughing run palo shouted in her ear run she turned and hobbled after him he caught her hand and held her up they struggled against the tide of bodies rushing at the wizard the air was thick with some kind of damp hot green mist and she could see nothing but she followed blindly where he drew her her leg hurt palos hand in hers dragged her on through the confusion she could not breathe the ground under her was falling away then under her feet was the rocky forest floor suddenly she could see again she limped along gasping for breath her hand in palos along the mountain path turning she looked back back there the last of the castle was vanishing into a clump of trees clinging to the mountainside the screaming and howling faded she slowed panting her bad leg caving in and he slid his arm around her waist he said gggood enough she turned to him to his plain pocky face smiling at her her one true brave knight he had always been there but neither of them had known a gust of love swept over her warm and sweet she still held his hand and she squeezed it tight good enough she said

very large array she lives in new mexico the wayfarers advice we came out of fold only twentythree thousand kilometers from kusatsushirane good job i started to say but was interrupted by blaring impact alarms shit shit shit melin at navigation chattered and her fingers swept back and forth across the touch screen like a child finger painting our ship the selkie obedient to melins sweeping commands fired its ram jet my stomach was left resting against the ceiling and my balls seemed to leap into my throat as we dropped relative to our previous position a massive piece of steel and composite resin edges jagged and blackened by an explosion tumbled slowly past our front viewport it had been four years since id been cashiered from the imperial navy of the solar league but the knowledge gained during the preceding twenty years was still with me that was an imperial ship i said my eye caught writing on the hull i had an impression of a name and my gut closed down into an aching ball it couldnt be but if it was i had to know i added an order match trajectory and imagecapture jax the tiponi flute piped through the breathing holes lining his sides not good news for kusatsushirane if the league has found them the alien had several of its leafy tendrils wrapped around handholds welded to the walls and his elongated body swayed with the swoops and dives of the ship id call that the understatement of the year baca grunted from his position at communication three hundred years ago humans had developed a fasterthanlight drive and gone charging out into our arm of the milky way galaxy there we had met up with a variety of alien races kicked their butts and subjugated them under human rule but two hundred years before the human blitzkrieg began there had been other ships that had headed to the stars longview ships with humans in suspended animation searching for new worlds most of these pioneers were cranks and loons determined to set up their various ideas of utopia best guess was that probably eighty percent of them died either during the journey or shortly after locating on a planet but some survived to create reicharts world and nirvana and kusatsushirane and numerous others the league called them hidden worlds and took a very dim view of humansettled planets that werent part of the league in fact the league rectified that situation whenever they ran across one of these worlds the technique was simple and brutal the league arrived used their superior firepower to force a surrender then took away all the children under the age of sixteen and fostered them with families on league planets they then brought in league settlers to swamp the colonists who remained behind but it hadnt worked this time because there were pieces of imperial ships orbiting kusatsushirane something had killed a whole battle group whatever it was i didnt want it destroying my little trade vessel contact orbital control and tell them were friendlies i ordered baca ive been trying tracy but nobodys answering worse the whole planets gone silent nobodys talking to nobody some new imperial weapon to knock out communications melin asked are you picking up anything i asked music baca replied we all exchanged glances then i said lets hear it baca switched from headphone to speaker and flipped through the communication channels from the planet slow mournful music filled the bridge it wasnt all the same melody but they all had one thing in common each melody was desperately sad something terrible had happened on kusatsushirane and judging by the debris something equally terrible had happened in orbit periodically melin fired small maneuvering jets as she dodged through the ruins but despite her best efforts the bridge echoed with pings and scrapes as debris impacted against the hull not the safest of neighborhoods captain came my executive officers voice in my left ear and i jumped damn the creature could move quietly i gave a quick glance over my shoulder and found myself looking directly into the isanjos sherrycolored eyes jahan had settled onto the back of my chair like alices cheshire cat well grab an identification and get out i said jahan wrapped her tail around my throat i couldnt tell if the gesture was meant to convey comfort or a threat an isanjos tail was powerful enough to snap a twobyfour my neck would offer little challenge as if in answer to my statement the screen on the arm of my jacket flared adjusted contrast and the name of the ship came into focus nuestra señora de la concepción my impression had been correct it had been her ship i gave the bridge of my nose a hard squeeze fighting to hold back tears holy crap thats a flagship baca yelped as he accessed the computer files under the command of mercedes de arango the infanta who would have held the lives of countless millions of humans and aliens in her hands once her father died jax recited in his piping tones his encyclopedic memory baffled me i had no idea how that much brain power could reside in something that looked like an oversized stalk of bamboo instead she precedes him into oblivion jahan said the attention of my crew was like a pinprick the unspoken question hung between us yes i was at the academy with her i said so did you know her baca asked im a tailors son what do you think baca reacted to my tone just asking he said sulkily a furcovered hand swept lightly beneath my eyes you weep jahan said and i was glad she had used her knuckle an isanjos fourfingered hand is tipped with ferocious claws capable of disemboweling another isanjo or even a man she leaned in closer and whispered and i note you did not actually answer the question twelve ships were destroyed here six thousand starmen died if things had fallen out differently i might have been among them i said loudly of course im upset they came here to do violence to the people of kusatsushirane jax tweeted it wasnt a duty they would have relished but they would have done it jahan said the infanta would have ordered it done i shrugged orders are orders i cleared a hidden world once when i was a newly minted lieutenant and now you trade with them and keep them secret jahan said making me a traitor as well as a cashiered thief i changed the subject we need to find out what happened down the gravity well it will take a damn lot of fuel to set the ship down jax tweeted flutes were famous for their mathematical ability and jax was no exception he was our purchasing agent and i was pretty damn sure he was the reason the selkie ran at a profit he counted every reales and squeezed it twice ill take the wasp i said referring to the small league fighter craft wed picked up at a salvage auction the cannons had been removed but it was still screamingly fast and relatively cheap to fly melin had given us enough gravity that i could grip the sides of the access ladder and slide down to the level that held the docking bay even so jahan using her four hands and prehensile tail reached the lower deck before me i take it that youre coming along i said as i hauled a spacesuit out of a locker i will need to report to the council chalking up another human atrocity i said with black humor its what we do the creature said shortly and she removed her suit from its locker isanjo suits always looked strange they were equipped with a tail because the aliens used their tails for their highsteel construction work and what happens when the ledger gets filled i asked as i stepped into the lower half of my suit we will act she said and i knew that she was speaking of all the alien races there are a lot more of us than there are of you yeah but none of you are as mean as us i shrugged to settle the heavy oxygen pack onto my shoulders but were more patient youve got me there i reflected that isanjos now built our skyscrapers and our spaceships under human supervision of course but my god there was so much opportunity for mischief if the aliens decided that it was time for them to act i had a vision of skyscrapers collapsing and ships exploding i thought about the hajin who worked as servants in our households how easy it would be to poison a human family and the tiponi flutes did our accounting they could crash the economy humans were fucked good thing i worked on a ship crewed mostly by aliens maybe they liked me enough to keep me around we secured each others helmets and headed for the wasp which sat in the middle of the bay even sitting still it looked like it was moving a million miles an hour the needle nose and vertical tail screamed predator i took the front seat and jahan settled into the gunners chair the canopy dropped i flipped on the engines instruments and radio and called to the bridge were ready for a few seconds we could hear the air being sucked out of the bay and back into the rest of the ship no sense wasting atmosphere it cost money to make as jax frequently pointed out once the wind sounds died the great outer doors swung slowly and ponderously open our view was dominated by the curving rim of the planet green seas and a small continent rolled past us beyond the bulk of the world the stars glittered icebright i sent us out into space and immediately dodged a piece of broken ship do mind the trash jahan said something was niggling at me something missing in the orbital mixbut i was too busy negotiating the floating debris to figure it out instead of heading directly to the planet i took the time to explore the expanding circle of debris that had been the nuestra señora de la concepción we soon saw bits of floating detritus that had once been people i studied each frozen face haloed with crystals of frozen blood shes dead jahan said i know i said but i couldnt accept it she was the heir to the league there may have been added protection for mercedes there had to have been she could not be gone twenty minutes later i admitted defeat took us out of the debris field and headed toward the planet we were passing relatively close to a small moonkusatsushirane had five but the others werent presently in viewwhen i heard it a distress beacon sending its cry into the void we locked on and followed it the life capsule had clamped itself limpetlike to the stony surface of the moon the tiny computer brain that controlled the capsule had rightly figured that it was safer for the occupant not to be floating in a battle zone and found refuge i landed the wasp popped the canopy and pushed out with such force that i almost hit escape velocity from the tiny planetoid jahans tail caught my ankle and pulled me back moving with a bit more caution i approached the bodyshaped container resting in a small crater the black surface was etched with messages in every known league language urging the finder to contact the navy headquarters on hissilek there was also a dire warning to any that might stumble upon the body that the dna of the human inside was not to be harvested or touched in any way i brushed away the layer of fine dust and ice that covered the faceplate of the life capsule it was mercedes placed into a deep coma by drugs injected by the capsule her long dark brown hair streaked now with silver at her temples had been braided and the braid lay across one shoulder a few strands of hair had come loose and caught in her lips at the moment that the capsule had slammed shut around her i wanted to reach out and brush them away i studied the long patrician nose the espressoandcreamcolored skin she was so beautifuland she was alive hmm i thought a princess would be prettier jahan said shes beautiful i flared ah i see now youre in love with her we returned to the selkie there was no way to fit the capsule inside the wasp i reprogrammed the clamps and secured mercedes to the hull it made me uncomfortable treating her in such a disrespectful way but i couldnt open the capsule in vacuum and i had no suit for her that was a quick trip bacas voice filled my helmet we found a survivor i radioed back as i brought us in through the bay doors and dropped the wasp onto the deck it was the work of minutes to unclamp the capsule from the side of the wasp and blow the seals i eyed the tangle of iv tubes and the pinpricks of blood that stained her arms and legs where the needles had driven through her clothes and into her veins while i was trying to figure out how to remove them without causing her pain the capsule sensed warmth and atmosphere and withdrew the needles that kept her in a deathlike coma i slid my arms beneath her and picked her up id like to say that i swept her into my arms but at five feet eight inches tall she was not much shorter than me and i had to work to carry her you could have waited for a stretcher jahan said as she listened to my panting breaths and noticed the way i braced myself against the wall of the lift i shook my head not wanting to waste the air and have you considered that you have put us all at grave risk by bringing her aboard we were smuggling to a hidden world the league will not only imprison us for that they will assume we know the location of other such worlds and they wont be gentle in trying to elicit that information i couldnt just leave her there because youre in love with her i summoned up a glare i didnt have the breath for a response we reached the fourth deck level and i carried mercedes into our small but wellequipped sick bay dalea was waiting for us i wasnt sure if dalea had a medical license but whatever her training was she was very good there had to be a story about why shed signed aboard a ship because she was hajin and the herbivores werent common in space but i hadnt managed to worm it out of her yet her coat was white with streaks of redbrown and a thick shock of chestnut hair curled across her skull and ran down her long neck and even longer spine to disappear beneath the waistband of her slacks somewhere along the evolutionary chain a creature like a cross between a zebra and a giraffe had stood upright the front legs had shortened to become arms and the split hoof that passed for feet developed a third digit that served as a thumb i laid mercedes on the bed and dalea began her examination i was jiggling shifting my weight from foot to foot waiting finally i couldnt contain my anxiety any longer is she hurt bumps bruises dalea filled a hypodermic she took a pretty good dose of radiation probably when the flagship blew this will help she gave mercedes the injection a few moments later there was a reaction mercedes stirred and moaned i laid a hand on her forehead shes in pain what was in that shot i asked suddenly suspicious of my alien shipmate nanobots that will repair her damaged dna thats not why shes moaning shes coming out of a rapidly induced coma and shes got that feeling of pinsandneedles in her extremities dalea exchanged a glance with jahan who shrugged and said hes in love with her what else can you expect would you stop saying that i said exasperated so stay with her said dalea im assuming that if you love her you must know her and she should wake up to a familiar face the two alien females left the sick bay i broke the magnetic seal on a chair pulled it over to the bedside and sat down i took mercedess limp hand where it hung over the side of the bed and softly stroked it it was her left hand and the elaborate wedding set seemed to cut at my fingers she should wake up to a familiar face what would that have been like to sleep next to this woman to have her scent in my nostrils to have her long hair catch in my lips once twentytwo years ago i had experienced only the last of those fantasies we had violated lights out at the academy and met on the star deck we had kissed and her hair floating in free fall had caressed my face i was lost in a daydream tending toward an actual dream when mercedes sighed and her fingers tightened on mine my eyes jerked open and i shot up out of the chair she looked up at me smiled and murmured tracy i dreamed i heard your voice but you cant actually be here but i am your highness she frowned and reached up i leaned forward so she could touch my face she looked around the tiny space and she accepted the truth once more you rescue me she murmured walking onto the bridge i was met with three conversations all taking place simultaneously why are we still here no trade no money from jax are you going down from baca i think i know what killed the imperials from melin i answered them in order of complexity because i say so yes what melin picked the question out of my surly and laconic reply kusatsushirane only has three moons now i sat down at my post they blew up two of their moons yep apparently the imperials closed with the planet in their normal arrowhead formation given the regularity of the moons orbits the folks on kusatsushirane picked the two moons closest to the ships to destroy the resulting debris went through the ships like shotgun pellets through cheese boom melin accompanied the word with an expressive gesture that would imply that the other three are booby trapped too most likely madre de dios i landed us on one of the remaining moons i wiped away the sweat that had suddenly bloomed on my upper lip i think it took a person with a finger on the trigger to set off the explosions melin offered it was comfort but not much new plan lets stay away from the remaining moons i said to our navigator good plan she said and turned back to her console baca spoke up then why the dirge from the planet they won a mighty victory but short term jahan said i jumped damn it shed done it again her fur tickled my left ear i nodded what jahan said the battle groups course was filed with central command on hissilek when they neither call home nor come home the league will come looking for them kusatsushirane is going to be discovered tracys right mercedess voice had always had this little catch in it very endearing and very sexy i stood and turned around she was on the platform lift and she looked shaky i hurried to her side and assisted her into the chair baca hastily vacated he was staring like a poleaxed bull i couldnt blame him how often did an ordinary space tramp meet the heir to an empire uh hello maam luis baca communications ill get a message off to hissilek where are you bound for next she asked me cuandru a message wont reach league space faster than this ship there will be military ships at cuandru she was right about that cuandru was the largest shipyard in the league mercedes smiled at me but i noticed that the expression never reached her eyes they were dark and haunted youre the captain i am i said congratulations you finally made it on a trading vessel i hoped that the resentment didnt show too badly believe me its better than being an admiral mercedes said softly ill have to take your word for it so why are you still in orbit she asked we have no communication from the planet jax trilled we are uncertain if there is anyone to trade with tracy was on his way to the planet when he picked up your distress signal melin said did they evacuate mercedes asked its possible but not likely there were close to a million people on kusatsushirane i said mercedes stood then let us go and find out what has become of them im not sure thats a good idea im not asking youre still my subject the final words came floating back over her shoulder i followed her onto the lift the wind whispered down the deserted streets of edogowa there were no vehicles parked on the streets it was all very tidy and orderly it was near sunset and to the west magnificent thunderheads formed a vibrant palette of blues grays reds and golds two long but very narrow bands of rain extended from the clouds to the chaparral below the bands looked like sweeping tendrils of gray hair and where the rain hit the ground the dust on this high desert plateau boiled into the air like milk froth where is everybody baca asked his eyes darted nervously from side to side jahan came scrambling down the wall of a fourstory office building nobodys there lights are off computers shut down its like everybodys taken a holiday mercedes shivered i started to put my arm around her shoulders but thought better of it and drew back lets go to a house she said why jahan asked when you think something terrible is about to happen you want to be with your loved ones mercedes answered we had ended up landing the selkie at the small spaceport the wasp could only comfortably carry two and the melancholy music and the lack of human voices had me jumpy i wanted backup jahan radioed our plan back to melin jax and dalea our footfalls echoed on the sidewalk and bounced off the sides of the buildings i realized that something else was missing besides the people the smell of cooking food there were hundreds of restaurants in edogowa most business was conducted over a meal and deals were sealed with alcohol food was a ritual on kusatsushirane but now all i smelled was that pungent mix of dust and rain and ozone as the storm approached the business district gave way to small wood houses with shoji screens on the windows and graceful upturned edges on the roofs now we found vehicles carefully parked at the houses the clouds rolled in dulling the color of the flowers in perfectly groomed beds overhead thunder grumbled like a giant shifting in his sleep we picked a house at random and walked up to the front door i knocked silence i knocked again mercedes reached past me grasped the knob and opened the door trusting kind of place baca muttered they want us to come in to see mercedes said in a hollow tone no one asked the obvious see what question it had taken me longer but i had finally come to the same point as mercedes in my analysis japaneseinfluenced culture imminent loss of their children and their way of lifefor the people of kusatsushirane there was only one possible solution the family was in the bedroom the children lay in their mothers arms her lax hands were still over their eyes she had a neat hole in her forehead the children had been shot in the back of the head the father slumped in a chair chin resting on his chest blood formed a bib on the front of his shirt the pistol had fallen from his hand mercedes remained stonefaced as we toured more houses it was the seventh house before she finally broke a sob burst out she turned toward me my arms opened and she buried her face against my chest she was crying so hard that in a matter of moments the front of my shirt was wet it made me think of the father in the first house his shirt wet with blood i closed my arms tight around mercedes trying to hold back the horror why they would have had a good life especially the children why would they do this theyre insane because the life we offered wasnt the life they wanted i said softly this was the last choice they could make for themselves and they made it im not saying its a good choice but i can understand it they killed their children mercedes whispered thousands of children she broke out of my embrace dragged frantic fingers through her hair why to keep them from us were not monsters that depends on where youre sitting in the pecking order jahan said in her dry way there was a silence for several long moments mercedes stood in the living room surrounded by the dead she looked lost and terribly frail i stepped to her side and put my arm around her lets go i said softly theres nothing here ghosts she whispered theyll be here melin plotted our course for cuandru the isanjo home world we boosted out of orbit heading for open vacuum between the planets before we entered the fold i left the bridge and went to visit jax in his officecabin he was standing in a wading pool of water rehydrating his leaves and holding a computer while he ran figures nervous whistling emerged from the sound valves that lined his sides each valve emitted a different discordant tone it was like a dentist drilling how bad i asked bad we didnt sell the lowtech farm equipment on kusatsushirane which meant we didnt pick up loads of lacquer knickknacks to sell to your jaded ruling class on league worlds we must hope for a big reward for rescuing the infanta jax concluded thats it thats your only reaction to the death of a million people we couldnt make the sale the seven ocular organs around the aliens head swiveled to regard me what was it one of your ancient dictators said one death is a tragedy a million is a statistic and bluntly they were not my kind nor is it a choice i can condone and thats why they call them alien i thought as i left i decided not to ask the other alien members of the crew how they felt the bizarre philosophical discussion had meant that i hadnt voiced my real concern that the league would decide we were somehow behind the destruction of the fleet and slap us in prison it would be a black eye for the navy and the infanta if the government had to admit that the citizens of a hidden world had destroyed a battle group better to blame a slightly shady trading vessel commanded by a disgraced imperial officer i decided that it couldnt hurt to clear things up with mercedes i had given her my cabin it was slightly larger than the crew cabins and the bed could actually hold two assuming they were friendly privacy on ships is the opposite of what one might expect youd think that people living in close confines inside a tin can would want the closed door and a private place instead i found that crews tended to live in a constant state of togetherness like a group hug we walked in and out of each others cabins when we werent on duty we played games that involved lots of people i think its because space is so vast so empty and so cold that you want the comfort of contact with other living things which is why i just walked in on mercedes she was kneeling in front of the small shrine i maintained to the virgin and she was saying the rosary the click of the beads set a counterpoint to the bass throb of the engines and i was startled when i realized she was using my rosary but of course she would have to hers had been reduced to dust and atoms along with everything else aboard the nuestra she gave me a brief nod her lips continuing to move and the familiar prayer just the barest of sound in the room i sat down on the bed and waited she wasnt that far from the end i closed my eyes and took the opportunity to offer up a prayer for my father still laboring away in the tailor shop on hissilek a strokebrought on i was convinced by my courtmartial and subsequent convictionhad left him with a crippled right leg but he still worked making uniforms for the very men who had ruined me sometimes it felt like the most personal of betrayals and i hated him for it but in more rational moments i realized that he had to eat and that he had spent a lifetime outfitting the officers of the imperial navy it wasnt like he could become a designer of ladies fashion at age sixtyeight i jumped and my eyes flew open when i felt cool fingers touch my cheek mercedes was standing directly in front of me and so close she jerked back her hand at my startled reaction i didnt want her to take my response as a rejection so i reached out and grabbed her hand its all right you just startled me i said while at the same moment she was saying im sorry you just had such a hurt and angry look on your face memories i shrugged theyre never a good thing really i have some nice ones of you dont i stood up and brushed past her all this proves is that the universe is a bitch and she has a nasty sense of humor we were very good friends once yes but that was years ago and a marriage ago i couldnt help it i looked back hoping id hurt her and was embarrassed when i realized i had but it was hard so hard she had married my greatest enemy from the academy honorius sinclair cullen knight of the arches and shells duke de argento known to his friends and enemies as boho he was an admiral now too i touched the scar at my left temple a gift from boho and his mocking tones seemed to whisper in the throb of the engines lowborn scum mercedes sank down on the bed we all do what we must that must be what the people on kusatsushirane thought there was an ocean of grief in her dark brown eyes i walked back and sat down next to her sitting this close i could see the web of crowsfeet around her eyes and the two small frown lines between her brows we were fortyfour years old and i wondered if either of us had ever known a day of unadulterated happiness has it been so bad she looked down at her hand twisted the wedding set and finally pulled it off it left a red indentation like a brand on her finger the palace makes sure his affairs are conducted discreetly and they vet the women to make sure they arent reporters or working for political opponents and thank god there have been no bastards she paused and gave me a rueful smile unfortunately no legitimate children either if i dont whelp soon my father may remove me from the succession there was a flare of heat in my chest if she wasnt the infanta wasnt the heir she could live as she pleased maybe even with a tailors son there was also a bitter pleasure in learning that boho was sterile but look at you captain belmanor how did you come by this ship i won a share of it in a card game it seemed great at first then i discovered how much was still owed on the damn thing sometimes i think tregillis lost deliberately mercedes laughed she knew me too well admit it you love it youre a captain you go where you please no orders from highborn twits with more braid than brains yes but i wanted to stay in the navy to prove that one of my kind could be an effective officer there was a silence then she asked were you guilty no i thought not but the evidence against you was overwhelming yes that should always be a clue that someones being framed i sat frowning shifting through all the old hurts and injustices she hesitantly touched my shoulder im sorry i thought about doing something so why didnt you and i realized that i was less angry than honestly curious i was afraid of she held up her hand cutting off the rest of my question there would have been whispers we sat silent for a few minutes the memory of the star deck returned have you married she suddenly asked pulling me back to the present no i never met anyone i wanted to marry liar her look challenged me i realized that our thighs were touching shoulders brushing her hair was tickling my ear and cheek she smelled of sweat and faded perfume and woman mercedes im um you saved my life she said softly and she took my hand and laid it on her breast i jumped up and looked down at her no not because youre grateful that would be worse than never having you you loved me once i still do she had tricked me and i had said it i fell back on the only defense and the source of my greatest pain and youre another mans wife she stood damn your middleclass morality my life has been bound by expectations rules and protocol i married a man i do not love i became a military leader because of my fathers frustration over his lack of a son and now ive led my fleet to destruction and the very thought of me and what i represent has driven the population of an entire planet to commit suicide but im forced to live on with all the loss and regret cant i have one moment of happiness the agony in her voice nearly broke my resolve she turned away hiding her tears i gently took hold of her shoulders see if you still feel this way after a nights sleep i dont want to add to those regrets i left before temptation overcame scruples we took the selkie out to an area of open space well away from any planetary bodies in the solar system and folded the ports now showed the strange gray filaments like spiderweb or gray cotton candy which was the hallmark of traveling past lightspeed i checked the watch implanted in the weave of my shirt midafternoon i decided to check on mercedes there was no response to my gentle knock concerned i slipped into the cabin and found her asleep but there were traces of tears on her cheeks she murmured disconsolately and her fingers plucked at the sheets feeling like a voyeur i quietly left and was caught by baca who with unaccustomed seriousness said i was thinking about saying a kaddish for the people but i realized it was more masada than holocaust and then i had to wonder if it was a righteous choice to die rather than submit is that noble or is it more noble to survive and persevere what do you think i looked at this stranger in bacas body and tried to compose an answer we had stood at the edge of a massive graveyard and i couldnt grasp it all i knew was that this burden of guilt rested on the shoulders of the woman i loved i couldnt do anything for the battle group or for kusatsushirane but maybe i could do something for mercedes she joined us that evening for supper with mercedes it was a tight fit around the small table in the mess but we all squeezed in jahan had prepared a slowsimmered stew of rehydrated vegetables and lamb for the omnivores and there was a vegetarian dish for dalea and jax like all isanjo food it was highly spiced so i drank more beer than normal perhaps it was due more to sitting so close to mercedes once the plates were cleared melin brought me a reader i was embarrassed to display this silly ship custom in front of mercedes i hedged i dont remember where we were the chapter entitled wayfarers all page second paragraph jax offered helpfully i mentally cursed the creature for its perfect recall what is this mercedes asked we read aloud after the final meal of the day jahan said each one of us picks a book from our species you never really know a culture until youve heard their poetry and read their great literature an interesting way to spread understanding mercedes said thoughtfully yes you dont allow it in your human schools and universities dalea said mercedes blushed and i glared at the hajin and what human book did you select mercedes hurriedly asked me to cover the awkward moment the wind in the willows mercedes shifted her chair so she could better see me please do read i was embarrassed and cleared my throat several times before starting but after a few sentences the soft magic of the story and the music of the words made me forget my special listener she will clothe herself with canvas and then once outside the sounding slap of great green seas as she heels to the wind pointing south and you you will come too young brother for the days pass and never return and the south still waits for you take the adventure heed the call now ere the irrevocable moment passes my voice cracked on the final words i coughed and reached for my beer and finished off the last sip thats all the voice i have tonight i said there were a few groans of disappointment but the party broke up some of the crew to return to the bridge others to their cabins to sleep i escorted mercedes back to the cabin we stopped at the door and an awkward silence fell over us both ive slept a night she finally said quietly my collar suddenly grabbed my throat i ran a finger around it ah yes you have i believe ill take the wayfarers advice she murmured and she kissed me i had enough wit barely to lock the door behind us later we lay in the narrow bed i liked that it was narrow it meant that she had to stay close her head was on my shoulder and i twined a strand of her hair through my fingers i was very aware of the scent of mercedesthe deep musk of our sex mingling the spice and pine smell of her hairher breath which seemed to hold a hint of vanilla i kissed her long and deep then pulled back and smacked my lips what you taste like vanilla too i answered she blushed it was adorable she ran a hand through my dishwater blond hair i know im shaggy ill get a haircut on cuandru i like it it makes you look rakish you were always so spit and polish i had to be everyone was waiting for the lowborn scum to disgrace the service she laid a hand across my mouth dont forget about them forget the slights hard to do dont be a grievance collector mercedes said she changed the subject lot of silver in there i stroked the gray streaks at her temples neither of us is as young as we used to be really i would never have known that if you hadnt told me she pulled my hair and we laughed together i was on the verge of dozing off when she suddenly rested a hand on my chest and pushed herself up her hair hung around her like a mahoganycolored veil my good mood gave way to alarm because she looked so serious tracy do something for me of course dont report that youve found me not just yet i want a little more time i did too so i agreed late in the sleep cycle i was awakened by her cries tears slid from beneath her lashes and wet her cheeks though she was still asleep she thrashed fighting the covers i caught her in my arms and held her close mercedes mi amor wake up youre safe her eyes opened and she blinked up at me in confusion theyre dead she gave a violent shiver and covered her face with her hands then looked in surprise at the tears clinging to her fingers i see those houses the children i killed them i rocked her shhh hush you didnt but it was only a halftruth and she knew it and she was only mentioning half the dead there was no word of the battle group the men shed commanded and who had died no less surely than the people of kusatsushirane eventually she fell back to sleep i lay awake holding her close and wondering when the full trauma would hit since there was an imperial shipyard at cuandru i came out of fold at the edge of the solar system i didnt want the big pointtopoint guns deciding that we were some kind of threat i ordered baca to tight beam our informationship registry previous ports of call excluding the hidden worlds of course and cargoto the planetary control my radio man gave me a look were not mentioning the infanta not yet her orders i answered striving to sound casual melin and baca exchanged glances and melin rolled her eyes i felt the flush rising up my neck into my face until it culminated at the top of my ears not for the first time i cursed my fair complexion then she better be a crew member jahan said otherwise theyll think were white slavers and we kidnapped her shes not young enough i said oh boy baca muttered better not let her hear you say that jahan said what i demanded melin said captain somebodys got to take you in hand and teach you how to be a boyfriend im not her boyfriend shes married were friends okay then you got a lot to learn about being a lover melin said at that moment i hated my crew i made an inarticulate sound and clutched at my hair get her on the crew list i stomped off the bridge i decided to take us in to dock at the station i shooed melin out of her post and she proceeded to hover behind me like an overanxious mother through the horseshoeshaped port we could see the big cruisers under construction spacesuited figures most of them isanjos clambered and darted around the massive skeletal forms against the black of space the sparks off their welders were like newly born stars there was a light touch on my shoulder i glanced up briefly it was mercedes and sometime in the past few hours she had cut her hair dyed it red and darkened her skin dalea loomed behind her whats this i asked hating the loss of that glorious mane we had to do something to keep her from being recognized dalea said im sure the port authorities will be expecting to find the infanta aboard a tramp cargo ship i said sarcastically as i tweaked the maneuvering jets jahan seated at my command station said tracy her face is on the money and so it was she graced the twenty reales note the picture was taken from an official portrait that had her wearing a tiara long hair elaborately styled and a diamond necklace at her throat now she wore a pair of my stained cargo pants and one of melins shirts jax came rustling onto the bridge now the entire crew and mercedes were watching but i wasnt nervous i knew i was good with brief bursts of fire from alternating jets i took us through the maze of trading ships station scooters racing yachts and military vessels with a final burst of power from the starboard engines i spun the ship ninety degrees and brought us to rest like a butterfly landing on a flower against a docking gantry at the main space station there was a brief outburst of applause mercedes leaned down and whispered you were the best pilot of our class the touch of her lips and the puff of her breath against my ear sent a shiver through me she straightened and addressed the crew so what now we try to find someone to buy the farm equipment and we pick up another cargo jax fluted melin stretched her arms over her head i want a martini and a massage and maybe not in that order or maybe both at the same time jahan uncoiled from the back of the captains chair im going home to see my mates and kids if the captain will give me money ill replenish our medical supplies dalea said mercedes smiled at baca and what about you he blushed im gonna find a concert maybe go to the opera depending on whats playing mercedes tugged my hair and you need a haircut i take it were going planetside i asked oh yes mercedes assured me daleas makeover worked the guards glanced briefly at my ship papers and waved us through and onto a shuttle to the planet it was foolish crazy even i planned to check us into an exclusive hotel a place frequented by aristocrats and famous actors it was going to take most of my savings but i wanted i wasnt sure exactly what i wanted to make sure she was comfortable to show her that i could be her equal fortunately mercedes was wiser than me when i outlined my plan she took my face between her hands and gently shook my head back and forth no first you dont have to prove anything to me and second im likely to be recognized red hair or no and third ive spent my life with these people let me have another life a short time where i dont have to remember but she didnt finish the thought jahan advised us and we ended up in an isanjo tree house hotel that sprawled through an oldgrowth forest on the outskirts of the capital city to accommodate the occasional human visitor there were swaying bridges between the trees which mercedes and i used with whiteknuckled effort as we crept across the swaying bridges the isanjo traveled branch to branch and crossed the intervening spaces with great soaring leaps the isanjo were good enough to deliver meals to our aerie so we spent our first day planetside in bed wind whispered and then roared through the leaves as it brought down a storm from the mountains it set our room to swaying lightning flashed through the wooden shutters and thunder growled with a sound like a giant chewing on boulders we clung to each other torn between terror and delight the rain came hammering on the wooden roof forcing its way through the shutters to spray lightly across our bodies it broke the heat and we shivered and snuggled close it would have been perfect except for her nightmares the next day mercedes took command we went to explore the city and to find a barber mercedes and the hajin hairdresser discussed every cowlick natural part and the consistency of my hair before she would allow the alien to cut between them they decided i should wear bangs it felt strange and i kept pushing them off my forehead only to have my lady reach out and muss my hair each time i did we strolled through the old quarter and i bought mercedes a string of beads that shed admired we moved on strolling along the river walk everyone seemed to be taking advantage of the good weather families spread blankets on the grass children tussled like happy kittens babies cried mercedes and i sat on a bench at the waters edge listening to the water gurgle and chuckle while we shared an ice cream cone we ate dinner at an outdoor café the isanjo being almost complete carnivores know how to cook meat our steaks arrived running blood tender and subtly flavored by having been stuffed with cheese we polished off a bottle of deep red wine between us and talked about books and music and the wonderful things wed seen during the day she scrupulously avoided all talk of the empire the navy or kusatsushirane we shared a dessert a lighterthanair concoction of mangos some local fruit cream and pistachio nuts i drained my coffee and steeled myself for a conversation that had to happen mercedes yes you need to talk to someone about what happened i will this policy cant stand not if its going to lead to mass suicide she said i shook my head stop deflecting you need to face whats happened and figure out why youre identifying more with the people on kusatsushirane than you are with your own battle group thats not fair tell me im wrong she stayed silent i left it there so shall we go yes i left money on the table and we walked out onto the street the air was soft after the tumultuous storms of the night before the restaurants were still busy and the many voices and many languages wove into something that was almost music then we heard real music dance music mercedes turned to me do you like to dance no i said she grabbed my hand i love to dance and i came along like the tail on her kite there was a small band playing on a pier that thrust out into the river multicolored lanterns hung overhead the isanjo danced on the narrow wires that supported the lanterns the humans earthbound and awkward danced on the wooden pier i felt graceless and stupid there had been no deportment and dance lessons in my youth but mercedes was gifted with grace and rhythm she made me look good the dance ended and we went off to the small bar to buy drinks she took a long sip and then kissed me i tasted rum and basil so im forgiven for poking at you at least you notice when im crazy she said youre not crazy the people on kusatsushirane were crazy were they no one got to force them into a life but she didnt get to finish the thought because there were murmurs from the crowd everyone was looking up we followed suit and watched pinpricks of light appear and flash like brilliant diamonds in the night sky thats a fleet coming in i said mercedes gripped me tightly take me home it was a misnomer we had no home but i understood what she wanted the comfort of bed bodies pressed close a roof to shut out the image of duty and responsibility now orbiting overhead we returned to the hotel and our lovemaking had a desperate quality she clung to me clawed at me as if she wanted to crawl inside my skin finally i had nothing more to give i lay gasping body sweatbathed blood pounding in my ears mercedes was curled up in a ball i put an arm around her waist and spooned her tracy it was barely audible hmmm let me stay really be a member of your crew tension and desperate longing etched every word and her fingers clung like claws to my wrist she turned over suddenly her face inches from mine they think im dead we can go away be together for an instant i was giddy at the prospect i thought of the worlds wed visit together nights in my cabin listening to her read to the crew but reality returned no love they know you survived your capsule was beaming out continuous messages when those signals stopped they know you were found and the capsule opened they would search for us and they could never admit that you joined us voluntarily and they would kill you she said her voice flat and dull and beyond personal concerns what happens if you dont take the throne you know boho will try to rule in your place she shuddered at the prospect weve had this moment we couldnt expect it to last it will last at least until morning we didnt sleep it would have wasted the time we still had together she wanted to say goodbye to everyone i called them and the crew assembled at a popular if lowrent diner i ordered huevos rancheros because i could stir it together and no one would notice that i hadnt eaten there was a brittle quality to our laughter and only at the end did we discuss what lay between us mercedes encompassed them all with a look thank you all for your kindness ill never forget you and what you did for me i also wanted you to know that there are going to be changes when i take the throne there wont be another kusatsushirane and ill see that theres a review of the alien laws the parting took a while because dalea wanted to make sure her patient was fit mercedes and the hajin retreated to the bathroom jahan joined me and stretched out her claws will you survive ill have to i said with forced lightness mercedes and dalea returned mercedes had an indescribable expression on her face i briefly took her hand all good i asked yes oh yes she said in a faraway voice our next stop was the hair salon my hairdresser from the day before stripped the red from mercedes hair and restored it to its lustrous dark brown once he was finished the hajin studied her closely mercedes went imperious on him all youve seen is a remarkable resemblance he stepped back extended a front leg and gave her a dignified bow quite maam we took a cab to the league embassy barricades and guards surrounded the building the driver cranked around to look at us they wont let me any closer than this he said thats fine i said mercedes and i looked at each other mercedess eyes were awash with tears i swallowed hard trying to force down the painful lump that had settled in my throat goodbye she said she started to reach out a hand then threw herself into my arms and pressed her lips to mine she pulled away opened the door and got out i got out too and watched as she walked quickly toward the elaborate gates of the embassy she didnt look back there was a flurry of reaction from the guards the door of the embassy opened and a flying wedge of men led by boho rushed out medals and ribbons glittered on the midnight blue of his uniform jacket and the sunlight glinted off his jetblack hair he was still handsome though middle age had softened the lines of his jaw he went to kiss her and mercedes turned her face away my three alien crew members found me in a bar late that night go away jax shuffled closer the ships notes been paid off so we own her free and clear and we got a reward a most generous reward the infanta meets her obligations and ive procured a new cargo were ready to leave whenever you are jahan curled up on the bar stool next to me the fleet has withdrawn theyre rushing back to hissilek apparently the emperors had a stroke that pulled me out of my rapt contemplation of my scotch i met those alien eyes and i had that cold sensation of being surrounded by hidden forces that were plotting against humans how convenient i managed i think shell be a good ruler jahan said now the final bit of news she gestured to dalea the infanta is pregnant i gaped at the hajin congratulations dalea added im going to be a father my child will be the heir to the solar league i will never know him or her and i realized that maybe none of us ever gets to choose our lives our only choice is to live the life that comes to us or go down into darkness i drained my scotch and pushed back from the bar lets go see what tomorrow holds

story that follows she shows us that although love can build bridges across the widest of chasms those bridges can be swept away by a flood of troublesbut that sometimes with luck and persistence they can be built again blue boots she was sitting on the splintery landing of the rickety wooden steps that led up to the kitchen servants quarters the sun had warmed the steps and it was her free day timbal had an apple crisp from the tree and she was swinging her boots and watching the swooping swallows as she ate it summer was winding to a close and soon the birds would be gone idly she wished she were going with them then just as quickly changed her mind life at timberrock keep was good to her she should be thanking the goddess eda for such a pleasant day not wishing for more azen the minstrel came out of the kitchen door as he passed her he casually reached up and knocked on the bottom of her boots morning blue boots he said and walked on she sat apple in hand staring after him as he made his longlegged way down the winding gravel path his trousers were blue his jacket a deep gold his head was a tangle of loose black curls that jogged as he strode along in that moment timbal fell in love with him it does not take that much to fall in love when you are seventeen and alone in the world and timbal was both her fathers death had cut her adrift she knew shed been lucky to find a post as a kitchen girl at one of the lesser keeps in buck duchy it was much better than the inn where shed first found employment here she had daily work hot food and her own room and bed there was a future for her here most likely was that shed keep working year after year and that eventually shed become a cook less likely was the prospect of getting married and becoming a wife to one of the other timberrock servants a handsome minstrel had no place in either future traditionally minstrels never wed or settled down they were the wandering record keepers of the six duchies the men and women who knew not just the larger history of the world but the details of inheritances the bloodlines of the noble families and many particulars of agreements among the small holders and even the business of the many towns and cities they wandered where they would supported by the largesse of titled families and innkeepers and patrons slept where and with whom they pleased and then wandered on there were minstrels guilds in the larger cities and informal associations in the lesser towns where orphans and the bastards of minstrels might be raised to follow in their trade it was a high and artistic calling that was not at all respectable or secure in short handsome melodic azen was the worst possible sort of fellow for a girl like timbal to fall in love with and so of course she had she had seen him before the morning he knocked on the soles of her boots and she opened her heart to him in the evenings when the days work was mostly done all the folk of timberrock keep were welcome to gather in the lords hall to listen to music and tales while they finished whatever chores could be done inside of an evening stable boys mended harness housemaids stitched torn sheets or darned socks and kitchen maids such as timbal could bring a big basket of apples to core and slice for the next days pies and so she had seen azen standing in the lateevening light from the open doors and windows singing for lady lucent and her husband lord just for lord just long crippled from a fall during a hunt azen chanted tales of ancient battles or songs about deeds of daring lord just had been a muscular fellow before his fall she had heard confined to a chair his body had dwindled and his black curls were starting to turn gray when he thudded his fist on the table and sang the refrains to some of the old songs he reminded timbal more of a small child banging with a spoon than a man enjoying a drinking song the strength of his lungs and depth of his voice had diminished along with his body yet when he sang along often as not lady lucent would set her hand on his bony shoulder and smile at him as if remembering the man he had once been to her for lady lucent azen sang romantic ballads or recited in dramatic tones the tales of love prevailing against all odds or failing in heartrending circumstances when azen performed for her lady lucents eyes never left the minstrels face often she kept her kerchief to hand for more than once his songs wrung tears from her eyes she was not alone in that on her very first evening in the hall timbal had been surprised to find her own eyes overflowing with tears at azens tale of a wandering warrior who finally returned home to discover he was too late his lady love was in her early grave timbal had been a bit embarrassed to weep at such a sad and sentimental song it was evidently a familiar favorite to many at the keep for they hummed along and kept at their tasks some whispering to one another untouched by his words she had no kerchief and was reduced to wiping her cuff across her streaming eyes and when she lowered her wrist from her face she realized that azen was staring straight at her as their eyes met perhaps a small smile quirked at the corner of his mouth not a mockery but his pleasure at her response to his song his eyes had said the same and she had dropped her gaze back onto the potatoes she was slicing confused and embarrassed to be noticed by him long minutes later she lifted her eyes again and was relieved to find the minstrel singing directly to lady lucent as if she were the only listener in his world timbal managed to sit through the rest of his performance without letting her emotional responses to his songs be too obvious surely it wasnt appropriate for her to weep like a child at a simple song a tenderhearted lady might break down at such a thing but not a kitchen maid when evening was deep and the minstrel announced with regret that he must give his voice a rest lady lucent spoke softly to lord just and the man beckoned the minstrel forward a little purse of red fabric tied with a gold cord appeared on the table at the lords elbow his lady might have readied it and passed it to him timbal hadnt seen the minstrel thanked them both profusely sweeping a low bow to the lord and going down on one knee to kiss the ladys hand timbal relatively new to such goingson watched curiously so this was how things were done in a keep she wondered if she had blundered into a special performance on her first evening here or if this was a nightly occurrence the minstrel rose gracefully from his obeisance and made his way out of the room she looked up at him from her seat on the floor as he passed close by her he looked down at her and winked or blinked perhaps he was gone and she was left wondering what if anything she had seen the conclusion of the minstrels performance had signaled the end of socializing in the hall all around her people were packing up their work on the dais the queen was bidding good evening to the aristocratic couple who were currently visiting at the keep while the four stout men who carried the kings pole chair were standing by to await his orders to move him timbal gathered up her empty bucket her knife and her basin of cut potatoes and carried them back to the kitchen her bundle was still in the corner where she had left it she gathered it up and waited until the cook had a free moment and then asked him please sir where may i sleep tonight he scowled briefly and for one terrifying moment she wondered if he remembered that earlier that day hed offered her room and board in return for her labor in the kitchen then he said out that door to the left up the wooden stairs two flights i think theres a room or two empty up there whatevers left in the room you can use if its empty well manage as well as you can tonight and tomorrow ill see who can spare what good night girl shed found an empty room as he suggested and was fortunate that it had a mattress stuffed with rather musty straw and a simple but wellmade table and even a basin and ewer that night shed taken the time to draw wash water for herself but had slept on the mattress as it was in the days since then cook had learned her name and shed freshened the mattress with clean straw and been given a rag rug and some empty sacking that had become curtains for the small window in the room most of the other kitchen help kept their shutters closed winter and summer but timbal judged the fresh air worth the nuisance of flies in the day and mosquitoes at night her extra apron and servants robe hung on a hook at night her shoes beneath them her personal clothing hung on a separate hook with the blue boots her father had bought for her arranged neatly beneath them she knew they would not last forever and so she wore them only on her days off and when she wasnt working in the kitchen there was little enough left of her former life shed make the boots and the memory of her father presenting them to her last as long as they could theyd been tinkers while he was alive and fairly good at that her mother had left them years ago but she and her father had managed well enough moving from town to town to find enough trade to keep them busy some months had been fat ones with meat in the cook pot or a meal at an inn and some months had been hard with little more than mushrooms roadside greens and the occasional trout from a stream but they had been happy and more rare still known they were happy with their simple life each night when they made their beds her father reminded her to thank gentle eda goddess of the fields and farms for her kindness to them in one town theyd done exceptionally well mending all the pots at a rich mans manor at the next town her father had bought her a soft shawl of gray wool and the pair of blue boots the boots were well made cut trimly to her foot and came almost to her knee they were an indulgence and she knew it especially the rich blue dye that the cobbler had applied to the leather just for her shed hugged her father tight when hed given them to her and hed told her they were no less than she deserved for being the best daughter a man could ask a month later she was an orphan even now when she thought about it the events jumbled in her mind the robbers had come to their campfire one night brandishing clubs and an ugly knife coward that she was when her father shouted at her to run run shed obeyed him she fled and climbed a tree in the darkness and clung there shaking and weeping silently until dawn grayed the sky then shed crept back to their campsite or tried to it was noon before she found her way back to the road and thence to where they had camped the wagon and team the tools of her fathers trade their clothes and supplies all were gone her father lay as they had left him his face battered and his arm broken with the bone jutting out it had made her feel queasy even to look at it but she had sternly mastered her horror and fear her fathers life had depended on her and she knew it shed given him water and tried to ease his pain and then flagged down a passing teamster hastily shed gathered the few scattered belongings left to them and bundled them into her blanket the teamster had given them a ride back to the town theyd just left an innkeeper had given them a room and called the town guard who had decided that it was a matter for the kings patrol the patrol arrived two days after her father had died theyd given her sympathy and money for a gravedigger promised to keep an eye out for her team and wagon noted her name and then left her to her own devices the innkeeper had let her work off her debt and offered to keep her on as a tavern girl his daughter gissel had shown her great kindness and likewise begged her to stay on but timbal could not bear to stay in the tiny room where she had watched her father die the same day that her debt was settled shed bundled her few possessions into her blanket and set off following the river road upstream shed regretted that decision more than once before she found the kindly cook at timberrock keep the hardships of the road and the dangers of being female and traveling alone had convinced her that any job that offered her shelter was better than venturing out again so shed become a kitchen girl shed never imagined that one day she would live in a keep lord just was well thought of and a good steward of his lands and people lady lucent was lovely and gracious as a lady should be minstrels played for them every night and lady lucent loved to entertain visiting nobility she was a decade younger than her lord and as able as he was crippled despite his misfortune her lord was a kindly man who seemed pleased to see her dancing with other partners and eating heartily while he himself picked at his food all the servants spoke well of lord just and mourned the fall that had crippled him they said less of lady lucent but none of it was ill timbal decided it was probably because lord just had been their lord and master since he was a young man and so their fondness for him was deeper than what they felt for the woman he had married as days turned to weeks she found she shared the local sentiment the lord was a kindly man and even if he never noticed her personally his easygoing and generous nature meant that his servants lived better than most servants did as witness her two days off every month and her being welcome to come into the hall every evening and listen to the minstrels perform it was a good life for a girl who had been homeless and alone but a few weeks before and she did not forget to thank the goddess for providing it she lacked for nothing usually on her days off she chose to walk into the nearby town sometimes to treat herself to a meal not of her own cooking at the tavern but on the day that azen knocked not just on her soles but her soul she decided that she would perhaps return early to the keep for his evening performance azen was not the only minstrel at timberrock but he was obviously the ladys favorite timbal had heard the tale of his life for gretcha one of the housemaids was fond of bragging of all she knew of the great folk and their affairs she did not deign to speak to lowly kitchen help such as timbal but if timbal were near gretcha seemed to take every opportunity to air loudly her special knowledge gretcha had come with lady lucent from her family home and had served as a maid in the ladys household since she was a child and thus timbal knew that azen had grown up near lady lucents family home and had been her playmate in her childhood he was himself the third son of a minor noble there had been no inheritance share for him but he had not minded instead he had taken up the minstrel way and spent most of his winters at timberrock keep playing for his old friend and her husband the other two minstrels were less impressive to timbal the apprentice saria did little more than tune instruments sing choruses and flirt wildly chrissock lord justs resident minstrel was an older man with a deep bass voice he performed with a variety of drums and specialized in the oldest tales recited exactly as they had been handed down through the years some evenings timbal could barely stay awake through his long recitals of ancient battles and who had died and how he twisted his pronunciation and used words that she didnt understand and sometimes she wondered why any of it mattered anymore but sometimes he told tales of brave warriors that were as stirring as any romance that azen had ever sung and for those she sat as close to his dais as she could get hugging her knees and watching him perform with awe it was while she was enraptured one evening that she chanced to glance over at azen the minstrel was behind chrissock and to one side he had been supplementing chrissocks percussion with his harp but had broken a string and stepped away from the music to make his repair he was finished now and was waiting easily to take his own turn performing and while he was waiting he was watching timbal at first she thought it was only chance that their eyes had met she put her gaze back on chrissock the toes of her blue boots tapped in time with his telling a sideways glance at azen found him still watching her a half smile on his face her toes lost the time and she glanced down at her feet confused half a chorus later she dared to look up at azen again this time he nodded to her and smiled a blush flamed her face she could not say why he had done no more than smile at her she put her eyes back on chrissock and kept them there desperately willing her heart to stop pounding and hoping her scarlet cheeks would cool when the song finally ended and she dared to glance in his direction he was gone she plummeted abruptly into disappointment though she could not have said what she had anticipated when she looked over her shoulder she found him he was standing before lady lucents chair his head inclined to hear her whispered request an instant later she dismissed him with a conspiratorial smile and he returned to his place on the minstrels dais chrissock played another song this one obviously for the children of the keep it was the tale of an old man who lived up a steep flight of stairs and had a succession of latenight visitors it required the children to stamp and clap the rhythm back to him and chrissock gradually increased the tempo of the old man running up and hopping down the steps until it all dissolved into an impossible cacophony of stamping and shouting children he bowed off the stage surrendering it to azen timbal lowered her eyes and watched her boots as he sang his first song was a melancholy tale of love gone awry with the maiden choosing wealth over fondness and regretting it evermore his second song was the old one about the millers daughter floating notes down the river to her true love his third song was one he had sung before the refrain mentioned his true loves raven hair tiny hands and deep blue eyes she closed her eyes to listen to it but was jolted out of her reverie for in the last stanza he sang not of her blue eyes but of her blue boots she lifted her gaze shocked but his face was calm his eyes on his patron as he sang if anyone else had noticed the change in lyrics they did not react she wondered if she had imagined it azen sang two more songs before a signal from lady lucent declared the evenings entertainment over the minstrel rose from his seat and stepped away from his harp lightly leaping down to advance on his patron and bid her good night timbal rose with the other maids and servants of the keep and followed them out of the hall into the warm evening light still lingered though it was fading fast tomorrows work meant another early morning for her she went up to her room to get her ewer and then strolled down to the well to fill it she hummed as she went the refrain of azens last song still ringing in her head gretcha was at the well before her filling her own ewer timbal waited while she scooped handfuls of water to splash her face and finally to drink before eventually handing the bucket over to timbal the housemaid silently watched her lowering the bucket into the well timbal did not know her well and was shocked by the note of resentment in her voice when the older girl spoke to her dont let him make a fool of you missy im sorry what did you say the bucket plashed into the water you heard me gretcha was already turning away from her dont pretend to be stupid the minstrel azen yesterday he asked me if i knew your name i told him yes that you were named trouble and his name is the same for you hes toying with you dont take him seriously surely your mother taught you that minstrels are never to be trusted hell flirt with anyone of course and sleep with any girl who opens her legs to him after a few sweet words from that golden tongue enjoy it if thats the sort of girl you are but dont expect it to come to more than that hes lady lucents minstrel and everyone whos worked here more than a season knows that but youre new so i thought id warn you just to be kind thank you timbal faltered though the girls tone had been anything but kind gretcha made no response but turned and sauntered away her filled ewer in hand as timbal hauled the bucket up to drink and wash her face and then fill her own ewer she wondered did gretcha think that what she had said was a kind warning timbal doubted it there had been jealousy in her voice or something like it something nasty and vengeful she wondered if somehow shed made an enemy at timberrock but could think of nothing shed done to gretcha nothing save draw azens attention hed asked gretcha what her name was that meant hed noticed her as more than a face in the crowd she smiled to herself he might be trouble but she doubted he was trouble she couldnt handle she wondered if hed been trouble to other serving girls and then nodded to herself was that it had the minstrel once been attentive to the housemaid or was he truly as gretcha had accused him a pastime for lady lucent lord justs legs were withered timbal wondered if that meant his other lower parts were useless she had heard of highborn ladies and lords that did not keep their marriage vows but dabbled where they would she thought again of how the lady summoned and then dismissed the minstrel and wondered if she summoned and dismissed him for other duties as well were they secretly lovers joined at the heart she imagined the minstrel clasping the lady to his breast and kissing her a strange thrill shot through her one tinged with envy oh she was being stupid to have thought for one instant that she could have caught the eye let alone the heart of a handsome young minstrel like azen of course he would be at his patrons beck and call performing whatever services she wished of him everyone knew that minstrels never truly gave their hearts what had she been thinking she filled her ewer and carried it back to her room yet that night despite her best efforts to clear her thoughts of him she fell asleep still humming the refrain with blue boots where blue eyes should have been and the dream she had of him awoke her long before dawn and did not allow her to easily fall asleep again her love for him was like poison ivy she thought she rose early and went to her work resolved not to allow her thoughts to touch on him but they did and with every touch of her mind her infatuation spread and enflamed her infatuation she told herself sternly a silly little girls wild dream of a handsome and popular older man what was wrong with her he was the least eligible of the men in the keep all he could do for her was break her heart or get her pregnant if she were foolish enough to dally with him set him out of your thoughts and get about your work girl so she told herself sternly and to absolutely no avail useless to recall that she knew next to nothing about him and that what she did know indicated than any sensible girl would avoid him he was a minstrel and possibly the lady lucents lover he had no fixed home no income other than the largesse of his listeners and probably few possessions other than the clothes on his back and his harp the only thing she could share with him was trouble she was scrubbing the big iron stew pot when he came into the kitchen yard it was the biggest pot the keep owned and it was seldom empty once she was finished with it it would be filled with water onions turnips carrots and a tough haunch from an old milk cow it would cook for a day and for the next week or so more vegetables and pieces of meat would be tossed in to replace most of what was ladled out to the serving folk sometimes the soup kettle would go a month without a scrubbing out and when it was finally time for a cleaning it had to be rolled out of the kitchen onto the flagged court where the lucky cleaner of the pot might spend half the morning scraping and scouring to get all the scorched scraps out of it timbal had tied back her hair and covered her head with a rag shed turned the pot on its side and was on her hands and knees with her head and shoulders inside the kettle scraping away two small dogs had appeared from somewhere tails wagging they awaited every handful of scrapedoff debris cheerfully snapping and snarling at each other to see who would claim it in the midst of one of their yap fests she heard her name in a questioning tone yes she replied as she backed hastily out of the pot excellent azen replied merrily ill see you then the minstrel swept her a theatrical bow that fluttered his blue summer cloak and turned away from her i dont know what you asked me she called after him he turned around walking backward away from her he was smiling and yet you agreed i call that a good sign for me agreed to what she could not keep the smile from her face even as she touched the greasy cloth that covered her hair and wondered suddenly how foolish she had appeared to him with her rear end sticking out of a soup pot you agreed to walk out with me this evening after your chores are done ill meet you at the bottom of your stair he had not paused in moving away from her now he turned and walked rapidly away dont you have to sing tonight she called after him he spun around once laughing only if you want me to he replied its my night to do as i please he added and then he turned a corner and disappeared behind the milk shed she stared after him her heart was hammering the kettle scraper in her hand forgotten what did it mean for a time she remained crouched on her haunches staring after him her task forgotten should she go she had said she would but she had said yes before she knew what he was asking or even who was speaking to her she hadnt really said yes at all would she have if she had emerged from the pot and heard what he was asking her of course not she had decided he was not for her an instant later she admitted the truth to herself yes she would have and she had it seemed cook gave her every dirty and disgusting task the kitchen offered for the rest of that day when finally the days work was done she was greasy and sooty and bone weary from scrubbing any other night she would probably have gone straight to her bed instead she hurried down to the womens bathhouse she scrubbed herself there and washed tangles and grease from her hair she wrung out her hair and knotted it up on the back on her head and hurried back to her room unfortunately azen was already waiting at the foot of the stairs he arched his brows in surprise at her dripping hair just a moment she assured him flustered beyond words and fled up the rickety steps she changed hastily out of her servants dress and into the only good clothes she owned her skirt was green with white trim and her blouse was pale yellow as she fastened the simple silver hoop earrings that her father had given her on her sixteenth birthday he was very much on her mind what would he have thought of what she was doing now would he have approved of her walking out with a minstrel for an instant sadness washed over her that she could not ask his permission or opinion she wondered what had become of their old cart and team and if the men who had killed her father had profited from his death then she shook her head clear of such thoughts they had never helped her not in the days right after his death and certainly not now she would have to make her own way in the world and live with her own decisions she tore a comb through her dark hair braided it and pinned it up hoping the wet would not be so noticeable she pulled on her blue boots took a breath and left her small room to descend the stairs thoughts of her father had driven some of the giddiness from her if she made any mistake with this man she reminded herself shed have no one to rely on except herself she cautioned herself to wariness but as she came down the steps azen was looking up and smiling at her his dark eyes seemed suddenly a pool that she might drown in there you are he exclaimed as if completely surprised by her presence he lifted a small covered basket from the ground and hung it on one arm while offering her his free one it seemed only natural to take it and once she had she could think of no polite way to let go of it i know a place where the night birds sing he told her and off they went she did not have to talk much at first for which she was grateful he entertained her with an accounting of his day turning his simple tasks to a tale full of humor and mischief she could not help but laugh and for a time he seemed to expect no more from her save that she listen and smile at his nonsense the place where the night birds sang proved to be a sandy river beach backed by trees downstream from the footbridge to town where the forest met the shore he found a bleachedout log for them to sit on the sun was making its lazy journey toward the horizon sending the forest shadows reaching toward them his little basket held a large honey cake for them to share and a bottle of wine he used his sheath knife to pull the cork doing it badly it will never go back in he told her gravely well have to drink it all here or waste it no more than a glass for me she demurred only to discover that he had forgotten to bring any sort of cups for them he offered her first drink from the bottle which she shyly accepted and then made her blush when he smiled slyly before he drank saying it would be his first taste of her lips she knew he was altogether too glib and that she should take warning from his clever way with words rather than be charmed by it but she was seventeen when the bottle of wine was halfgone in shared sips he began to draw her out with questions and though she tried valiantly to tell the tale of how she had come to be alone in the world in a calm manner her throat closed and her eyes filled with tears when she spoke of her father she looked down at her blue boots and then reached down to touch them as if by doing so she could remember the touch of his hands when hed given them to her that was when azen put his arm around her he said nothing but simply held her for a moment and when her tears broke forth he gathered her into his arms and let her cry she could not have said how or when she ended up in his lap leaning her head on his shoulder nor did she really know when drying her tears changed to kissing her mouth his lips held her as firmly as his arms perhaps she was not as alone in the world as she had thought evening and the forest shadow cloaked them from all eyes she let him kiss her and listened only to his sweet murmurs and the language of his knowing hands he never asked her if she would and so she never told him no or yes she did not tell him it was her first time but he knew for he spun her a golden string of words and glistening kisses telling her that opening a woman for the first time was like opening a wonderful bottle of wine and that the first sip was to be savored slowly his words formalized his touches banishing any thoughts of resistance or reluctance he promised her delight and he delivered it she did not wonder then if his words were too practiced and his touches too deft she did not wonder then how many other women he had opened in the depths of the night they walked slowly back to the keep there was enough moon to silver the road before their feet he hooked her hand through the crook of his arm and she trusted him to guide her home they were more than halfway there when she began to wonder what the morrow would bring she tried to frame a question around her sudden uncertainty what does it mean to you she asked him what does what mean tonight and what we did she wished she had his gift for words she spoke so bluntly she felt as if she threw rocks of question at him he was silent for a time something like that means more than can be put into words he said at last she tried to take comfort in that answer but suddenly she wished he would try to put it into words what do i mean to you i mean what do we mean to each other i think that as time goes by that is something we will discover he said easily i do not think we should worry about it on a night like this this is a time to savor the moment blue boots not map out all of our lives spoken like someone who cannot get pregnant she said and then wished with all her heart that she could call those words back like a hammer they broke the fragile bubble that had contained the moment he was quiet for a time and then said stiffly i have heard that women seldom conceive on their first time except when they do she replied morosely she had shattered whatever magic they had made now she was suddenly aware that she ached in new places and that until she bled again she must fret and fear the possible consequences that might befall her from this one night loomed large as did all the consequences of what might not befall her what had she ever imagined it might mean that the minstrel loved her that he would marry her and share his life with her take care of her if she were ill help to raise their children lets not worry about that right now he suggested and she wondered what worry he referred to she did not let go of his arm it suddenly seemed to her that it might be as much of him as she would ever hold the road was uneven and she tried not to lurch against him as they walked the inference that gretcha had made days ago came back to haunt her suddenly was he the ladys plaything she suddenly longed to ask him if he loved another if he was bound in some way to the lady she bit back that question and instead asked him if i asked you something important would you feel bound to speak the truth to me he laughed and she was shocked why do you laugh she tried to keep the hurt from her voice because without intending you have nearly spoken the words of the old curse that used to be hurled by one minstrel at another may your tongue be tied to the truth they used to curse and a fearsome curse it was and why was that because while we are the keepers of record and must be meticulously honest and correct about what land was ceded or sold or the year a couple was wed or what agreement was made between two nobles we are also the keepers of dreams there are times when we must flatter and lie in order to earn our bread heroes become stronger queens more beautiful and quests more dangerous when we sing them so to curse a fellow minstrel to have his tongue tied to the truth was to condemn him to live a life of frugality depending only on what he could earn as a record keeper rather than what he might spin for himself by singing dreams to others perhaps she heard in his words more than he meant to tell her for it seemed to timbal that he had spun a dream for her that night a tale that perhaps she was not so alone and in return she had paid him with the coin that a woman can only spend once her virginity was gone and she knew that to some men that would matter a great deal when it came time to broker a marriage she suddenly saw that of the small store of things she possessed first knowledge of her body had been a good she hadnt counted now she had given it to him and though they had both enjoyed the experience he was not bound to her by it she would never be able to look her husband in the face and say never have i known any man but you that was gone carried off by the golden tongue of a minstrel it seemed useless to rebuke him with that doubtless he thought it no more than she owed him for a honey cake some wine and some sympathy he would not understand what he had taken from her she sighed and he told her cheer up we are not so far from the keep and your bed at the foot of the stair he paused holding on to her hand the few torches that still burned outside the keep were but nubs in their sconces she could scarcely see his face you know blue boots i dont know your proper name even shame rose in her shed given him her maidenhead and he hadnt even known her name timbal she said quietly i am timbal ah a little drum and one that sets a lively beat it suits you and yet i prefer blue boots those were his last words as he left her at the foot of the servants stair although he drew her close and kissed her a gentle good night it did not thrill her as his first kiss had she stepped back from him groped for the railing in the dark and began to climb the stair treading close to the edge to keep the risers from creaking she was halfway up when she halted hearing angry whispers from below there you are i was sent to find you two hours ago where have you been did not you give your word you would be standing by ever ready to serve the need of the lady lucent a fine friend you are to her even hissing there was no mistaking gretchas voice cold washed through timbal what was this about a tryst he had failed to meet she crouched low pressing her body against the wall hoping the darkness shielded her from view azens voice was low both apologetic and indignant well how was i to know it was to be tonight i was told i could have the evening to myself for once i cannot recall the last time i was given that freedom and i can guess how you used it minstrel hurry dont waste your time in trying to justify it you may have put all the plans awry go to her now quickly and as quietly as you can all else has been made ready you are the only fault in this scheme how much do you know housemaid azens voice had dropped it was bitter with resentment enough to know that without you no heir can be made and that i think is something you must have known as well and yet your precious night of freedom was worth more to you than that all her girlhood she loved you and counted on you she would have married you if only youd asked her but no and now that she needs you see how well you repay lady lucent for her years of favor gretcha had pushed azen too far go yap elsewhere bitch you know nothing she heard his boots as he strode away across the cobbled yard in the darkness had gretcha followed him her lighter slippers would make no sound timbal was frozen her heart thumping so loud that her ears rang what did it mean and what would become of her if gretcha came up the steps now and discovered her she would know she had overheard was the secret worth her life she lost track of how long she crouched there her left foot began to buzz with numbness before she dared rise and continue her climb up the stair she groped her way to her room letting her garments fall as they would and crawled into her bed and there she lay sleepless and wondering exactly how azen served lady lucent she could think of only one way to interpret gretchas words azen would get the lady with child that the lord might claim an heir and if that were so if that were his duty that kept him at the ladys beck and call what then could a kitchen maid possibly mean to him nothing a pastime a way to spend his freedom shed been a fool when morning came she rose and went sandyeyed to face yet another day of toil she felt both changed and unchanged by the events of the night before and could not say which was more terrible she went about her work that day as if nothing had happened her premonition that she had been a fool only deepened as the day went on she tried to find satisfaction in the simple tasks that had occupied her hours and could not her mind wandered she felt impatient with chopping the onions annoyed with searching the kitchen gardens for turnips that had not gone wormy she did not as a rule see the minstrel during her workday so she told herself she should not wonder at his absence she tried to ignore the hardeyed look that gretcha gave her each time they passed but could not i wish i could just die she said to herself and then was shocked at her own whisper she saw gretcha muttering to two of the upstairs maids at lunch and then all three of them turned to stare at her gretchas plump little lips writhed back at her in a snide smile timbal looked away pretending she had not seen her smirk how had she known had azen gossiped of his conquest was she a joke among all the house servants now her heart sank and her spirits grayed what a silly strumpet she had been so easily seduced by the first man who ever kissed her or offered her a bit of sympathy she spoke to no one that afternoon but chopped the vegetables with a vengeance and scrubbed the big griddle as if she could scour azen from her memory by evening she was resigned to knowing shed been used neither lady lucent nor azen appeared for the evenings pastimes timbal sat a little apart from the other servants picking over gooseberries for pies and listened to chrissock without watching him the night seemed overly long and her task with the berries endless she stole glances at lord just but without lifting her head she was not surprised that he looked lonely and preoccupied he had to know what was going on chrissock sang sonorously of battles and warriors long dead but they were sorrowful songs of old defeats and heroes dying in vain lord just stared through him his face still and his eyes distant the evening ended early lord just summoned chrissock to come forward for a purse and then apologized for ending his performance early i have no heart for music with my lady gone from the keep when she returns then we will rejoice eda willing she will bear back to us that which we all most devoutly desire chrissock bowed deeply i am sure the goddess will be willing lord you have done all possible to smooth the way for her to favor us timbal glanced around at the other servants only to find them exchanging equally puzzled looks it was seldom that any event in the keep was not presaged with days of gossip and she had heard no rumor of lady lucent going on a journey as the workers of the timberrock keep rose to leave the hall the buzz of gossip increased in volume but for the most part all timbal heard were questions until gretcha and her two cronies happened to pass near her oh yes they had me packing all yesterday for the trip gretcha was assuring her friends its not officially said yet but the mistress has me doing more and more tasks for her soon enough ill be sleeping upstairs near her room i expect lady lucent likes to keep all her personal maids close you know and she has come to trust me so much i cant help but think that shell soon make me her personal maid ive known about the plans for this journey for days but of course intimate servants cannot gossip about the keep like ordinary housemaids gretchas friends looked both impressed and annoyed to be dismissed as ordinary housemaids timbal desperately wanted to be disinterested she kept her face impassive as she drifted closer the basin of pickedover gooseberries on her hip gretcha shot a glance back at her were her next words intended for timbals ears and of course azen the minstrel must go with our mistress or what would be the point of the journey what you havent heard gretcha leaned closer to her friends but her voice carried as clearly as ever well i suppose i should say nothing but it does no harm to remind you what you already know lord just has no heir and of course his health grows no better and with his er difficulties he is unlikely to get his wife with child but a baby there must be if he does not want timberrock keep to fall into his cousins hands when he dies youve heard of lord spindrift even his own servants call him lord spendthrift hes gone through all of his inheritance already and rumor is that hes been able to borrow more funds only because he can assure the lenders that when lord just dies timberrock keep will be his and all have heard that he is a cruel man to dogs and horses as well as to women and servants lord just has not allowed him to even visit here since that horrible incident with the hound puppy six years ago so theres no chance at all that he will let the lack of an heir make timberrock keep fall into his hands so there i will leave you all to think what you will lady lucent goes off on a visit to her sister and her husband she takes with her a very handsome minstrel to keep her company my guess is that when she returns the imminent birth of lord justs heir will be announced no no i wont tell you a word more than that not a word a ladys maid is supposed to be the soul of discretion she tittered as she said this fluttering her hands before her face as if to forbid her friends to ask her any more questions they looked suitably scandalized by what she had implied but neither ventured a query timbal put her eyes on her gooseberries and increased her pace to pass the threesome she resisted the impulse to give a bit more swing to her hip as she passed gretcha she knew she had the muscle to send the housemaid flying but then people would wonder why and the truth was too painful to admit she hated gretcha because the housemaid knew that timbal had made a fool of herself over the minstrel hated her even more because gretcha had warned her and shed ignored the warning the woman must think her an idiotic slut her cheeks burned as she hurried into the clamor and crowding of the kitchen everyone was rushing to put their chores to bed as timbal covered the basin of berries and disposed of the stems and rotten ones she forced herself to consider the obvious gretcha had known of the journey that meant that azen must also have known yet he hadnt admitted it last night or even hinted at it no hed simply taken advantage of her knowing well that hed soon be on his way and gone for months why would he be so heartless the reason for that dropped on her like a gush of cold water if she turned up pregnant no one would believe the minstrel had lain with her hed had her virginity perhaps the novelty of that was all that had drawn him to her as she tottered up the stairs to her room a new fear battered her he was gone and if she found herself expecting a child she couldnt even plead with him to help her sweet eda let that not be she prayed to the goddess id rather be dead than a mother with no husbandman she spent another nearsleepless night she berated herself for being a fool to have given in to him and for being a bigger fool for longing to feel his touch again she finally fell asleep clutching the dream that he swiftly returned to the keep with some reason for his cruelty it did not help that she herself could imagine no explanation for how he had treated her instead she dreamed that she disgraced herself by running out to him as soon as he returned in her dream she was heavily pregnant and he denied and mocked her and gretcha led all the servants in first laughing at her and then driving her away from the keep for her terrible lies about the minstrel in the dream she had to flee barefoot wearing only her servant clothes and she wept because she had lost her blue boots the last vestige of her fathers love for her she awoke late her tears still wet on her cheeks she had to rush to dress and when she hurried down the stairs she heard cook calling her name in frustration she rushed into the kitchen was scolded harshly for being late and put to washing up all the dishes by herself that night lord just seemed pensive and weary chrissock chanted long historical lays about ancient battles they were boring and depressing lord just drank too much and was carried off to his bed early everyone in the keep seemed out of sorts as they drifted away early from their masters hall and off to their own rooms gretcha was wearing a new cap and apron so perhaps she had been elevated to a ladys maid she stood gossiping with her cronies in the kitchen yard as timbal passed them one whispered something to gretcha and then they all burst out laughing she could not keep herself from glancing toward them and found them flatly staring at her she was the object of their mirth and they didnt care if she knew it she forced herself not to hurry but knew all the same that she fled as she retreated up the stairs to her room there she let her foolish hopes shatter hed had all he wanted of her and now azen was gone was his mission truly to get lady lucent with child so that the baby could be passed off as lord justs and the line would have an heir it seemed wildly unlikely and yet there were songs about such things happening both lord just and the minstrel had the same dark eyes and curly black hair but that was true of threefourths of buck and if azen had been chosen as a stud why send them off for the deed to be accomplished surely it would be more believable if the lady never left her home but perhaps the process was too humiliating for lord just to tolerate under his roof orand like a cold finger down her back she recognized the truthwas it a womans decision one that lady lucent had made out of her husbands need for an heir and her need for a bed partner livelier than a crippled old man but how could she hope to deceive her husband if he were unable to impregnate her unless he believed her already pregnant from some effort of his own timbal felt suddenly shamed to be dwelling on the intimate affairs of the nobility did not the folk who had taken her in and given her work and a place to live deserve a bit of respect from her she thought of azen and resolved to harden her heart whatever had happened between her and the minstrel had been her doing as much as his shed gone with him she hadnt resisted him and if he had no more interest in her than what hed had well she had only herself to blame put it aside and go on with her life and so she did for a week or so gretcha continued to laugh mockingly whenever she saw her but timbal ignored her and hoped that her shame did not show the keep was a quieter drabber place without its mistress the rains began and did not let up the kitchen yard became a sodden mucky wreck and timbal walked barefoot across it rather than ruin the leather of her blue boots she did her work by day and went to bed at night it was her life it had not seemed intolerable before azen had stepped into it and logic told her that it was not intolerable now she tried to remember how pleased she had been with it when her tasks were new how happy she had been to settle in at timberrock keep now it seemed tedious and pointless she would spend the rest of her life preparing food for other people that was all it was life it was what one did one worked and ate and slept with time shed remember how to do that without it feeling like each breath did no more than carry her one step closer to death on her next day off timbal resisted the urge to visit the river beach and moon over what had befallen her there instead under lowering clouds she walked into the village and treated herself to a mug of cider at the tavern and listened to a whitehaired old minstrel who specialized in silly drinking songs and humorous tales she even managed to smile a time or two at the end of his performance he announced that he would soon move on to the next town and asked if there were news he could share with friends and relatives there half a dozen people sent greetings to extended family one man announced the birth of a son and another issued a warning about an upriver bridge that he proclaimed was so dangerous that carts should avoid it the minstrel nodded to each message repeating it back word for word it was a common way for messages to be sent especially those intended for the public or for folk who could not read and write next with a salacious grin he asked for rumors and gossip worthy of being spread a minstrel he told them could make more from a rumor than most men could from a pot of gold so he begged them for whatever they had heard no matter how unfounded much of what was offered had to do with the best whores in town men bragging of their endowments a warning to whoever had stolen six sheep from a high pasture and a great deal of bawdy innuendo the minstrel took note of it all with great good cheer repeating the missives back so dramatically that even timbal laughed until her belly hurt then a field hand from timberrock keep somewhat the worse for drink stood up to announce that soon enough there will be an heir at timberrock keep and lord just will be just as delighted as if the babe were his edas tits lowl you loudmouthed drunk someone else at the table rebuked him and gave him a friendly punch in the arm that sent him sprawling to the floor another man at the same table shouted out hes drunk pay him no mind even the minstrel seemed to sense that the man had crossed a boundary for he parroted back the field hands from timberrock keep are loudmouthed drunks pay them no mind and received a roar of approval for his amendment but timbal sat suddenly silent the grin faded from her face and the laughter dried up in her mouth she put down her coppers for her cider and left to walk back to the keep alone it was pouring rain when she left the tavern timbal had not even worn a cloak there was nothing to do except get soaked by the chilling downpour for the first half of her walk she allowed herself to think about azen as she had known him she thought of the songs hed sung and how it had always seemed he was singing for her even when his eyes sought out lady lucents she thought of his softly curling black hair and how it had smelled when it had danced across her face as they made love she let herself think of his lips not just his kisses but his kind words and how gently he had held her and let her weep out her sorrow for her father she had one night of him could she truly say she knew him let alone loved him love wasnt based on knowing someone love it seemed to her simply was it shamed her that he had treated her so badly and still she was mooning after him recalling every whispered word and every touch it was bad enough to be stupid once did she have to recall her stupidity with such longing for the first time she let herself think the thought timbal wished she had the courage to kill herself wished she were dead and no longer feeling this pain for which she had no remedy but i dont have the courage el should kill me for a coward for lacking the spine to do the job myself she came to the footbridge she had crossed earlier that evening the river was up all the debris that had littered its banks all summer had been lifted and floated down to catch against the footbridge the water pressed it against the bridges wooden supports flowing through the debris and in several places across the top of the bridge she hesitated and set a foot out onto the wooden planks they trembled with the push of the waters but the bridge seemed sound enough she glanced back toward the village to see if anyone was coming wishing she could ask someones opinion on the safety but the falling rain obscured her vision and she doubted the others from the keep would start for home before nightfall it would be fine she decided in the pouring rain she stooped down and pulled her boots off her bare feet would give her a better grip and she had no desire for the water to pour inside her boots and ruin them she clutched them to her chest and walked out onto the bridge the wooden planks muttered and shuddered under her step the water was cold as it rushed past her bare feet then suddenly it skipped up over the top of her foot and on her next step she found herself ankle deep the water tugged at her and with one hand she snatched her skirts up out of its reach she glanced back but she was already in the middle of the bridge as well go on as back timbal took two more steps before the world bucked and lurched for a moment nothing made any sense then she realized that she was clinging to the bridge railing with one hand while clutching her precious boots to her chest with the other the bridge was still there under her bare feet but she had lost her grip on her skirts they tugged at her wetly as the water that was now kneedeep rushed past her her mind made sense of the tangle of lumber that loomed over her pressed hard against the footbridge the cart bridge upstream had given way just as the fellow in the tavern had predicted it had washed downstream slammed into this bridge and now other debris and the press of the flood waters was threatening to rip her bridge free of its supports and send it hurtling downstream with her on it or most likely not on it she realized as timbers groaned and the bridge gave a lurch under her she could not separate the thundering of her heart from the vibration of the bridge nor the ringing in her ears from the roar of the water i cannot be this afraid she told herself sternly not if i want to live and in that instant she realized that she very much did want to live azen or none the realization that she had asked dark el for death and the god had abruptly granted it to her shook her to her core no she shouted above the harsh roar of the furious water i dont want to die i wont die here she flung her precious boots as hard as she could the pouring rain obscured her vision but she thought they landed on the bank then with both hands free to grip the shuddering railing she began to lurch and sidle across the bridge toward the shore she was a bodys length from the jutting stone support for the bridge when the wooden part tore free she knew three seconds of a wild ride on a lurching raft of wood before it became merely a jumble of timber it parted beneath her and she fell through it into water thickened with forest debris and the broken jumble of planks and timbers the river had made of two bridges she caught wildly at chunks of wood that turned under her dousing her yet again her skirts caught on a tumbling snag the roots bore her under then up then under as she frantically tried to breathe scream and tear her skirts from her body before timbal could get her skirts free the snag suddenly discarded her as abruptly as it had snatched at her a floating plank slapped her then spun away before she could catch at it flotsam that was close enough to bruise her floated tauntingly out of reach when she tried to cling to it the choking clog of debris that had smashed the bridge slowly dispersed in the torrential downpour she finally caught hold of a splintered section of bridge planks when she tried to climb up on them they shifted dunking her again she found a new grip and held on her head barely above the water her existence narrowed to a single task when there was air on her face she took a breath when there was not she held it when her chilled hands wearied she clamped them more tightly willing the pain to keep them awake enough to grip darkness soon cloaked the river but the rain and the push of the water did not ease she shifted her grip was dunked nearly lost her plank and then found a new hold with her elbow wedged between two of the boards she had no breath to weep or cry for help all she could do was cling and pray to eda mother eda that she would be carried to shore out of cruel els reach in the dark of night her raft fetched up against something and stopped she held to it in the darkness glad to be still even as she dreaded that some larger snag might come with the current to slam into her once she tried to drag herself up out of the water but when she did so the wood she clung to came loose and turned for a moment before once more halting the rush of water against it now sheared up in a spray timbal averted her face from it and stayed as she was she would wait for morning and light before she tried to move to a safer place she pressed her elbow down into the crack between the planks and tried to stay conscious she did not think she slept but there came a moment when she suddenly knew that dawn had come and passed before she was aware of it the rain had lessened but not stopped and the river still raged past her but by the gray light of the overcast day she could see that she and a great amount of branches planks and one dead sheep were all tangled into one large mass braced against a fallen tree that jutted out into the river she did not shout for help there was nothing but forested riverbank as far as she could see the arm timbal had used as a brace was numb and her other hand so cold it scarcely worked her legs dangled and tugged in the water that swirled past her it took half a lifetime for her to work her numbed arm free slowly she dragged her body up onto the tangle of timbers and wreckage she lay there for a time trying to decide if she was colder now that she was out of the water she worked her ankles trying to feel her feet and moved her arm when finally it tingled she shrieked breathlessly at how much it hurt until she remembered to give thanks to eda for being able to free it at all perhaps her prayer to the more kindly goddess of the fields angered sour el she had lifted her head to try to decide her best path back to the riverbank over the packed debris when she saw what she had feared a large chunk of the cart bridge had decided to join the rest of itself it was moving down the river in a majestic chaos rolling in slow splashing turns that sent gushes of white water shooting up it was coming straight at her it was unavoidable she scrambled up on the debris raft slipped fell between pieces of wreckage and for one nightmare instant was trapped beneath it then she saw a slice of daylight and frantically clawed her way up into it she got her head above water hooked an arm over a tree trunk and then just had time to see the bridge bearing down on her damn you el she shrieked to the merciless sky hed taken everything from her fatherlover even her precious blue boots taking her life would probably be the only act of mercy he ever committed much later she would wonder if she said those words aloud or if a god did not need the words spoken to respond to them the last thing el would do was to give mercy to anyone by a superhuman effort she pulled herself up on the floating junk just as the bridge hit it timbal saw it turn as it came saw it crashing toward her and then saw a blast of white light a drenched woman awoke on the bank of a river her wet hair was strewn across her face her clothes were waterlogged her skirts tattered she was barefoot blood was thick on her hands it took her a little while to understand that a cut on her head was still seeping blood and she could not recall who she was or how she had come to be there the sun had come out and a thin light warmed the air she managed to stand and then to limp she followed the river downstream until she saw a bridge then climbed up the bank through a shallow edging of forest and found a road she followed it staggering gamely along until a woman driving a donkey cart came by and gave her a ride she awoke later in a room at an inn she gazed around her groggily then lifted her hands to look at the heavy bandaging that wrapped one of her forearms her head was bound also her hair cut away from one side of her skull she could not remember who she was or how she had come to the inn a girl came to her room bringing her a simple meal on a tray youre timbal the girl told her you used to work here but you left here months ago looks like you fell in the river or maybe got beat up and left to die in the storm but dont you worry youre safe here and with friends the kings patrol has been looking for you for quite a while they found your fathers wagon and team and the men who killed him they had to sell off the team and wagon when they couldnt find you but the money they got for them has been waiting for you for a while now so dont you worry well take good care of you it was all too much to take in it took several long days for her to accept the past the innkeeper and his employees assigned to her it took longer than that before she could cross the room without staggering sideways gissel the pleasant girl who had been tending her assured her that she had plenty of money to pay for her care but timbal soon insisted on coming down and resuming her tasks at the inn the work seemed familiar and pleasant enough bits of her old life came back to her and she fit them together as best she could no one could tell her where she had gone after she left the inns employ or how she had come back and eventually she let that year of her life go the money from her fathers team and wagon gave her a nice little nest egg and she was able to add to it with her wages from the inn she cut the long hair on one side of her head to match the short curly crop that was rapidly covering the scar where the healer had stitched her scalp closed soon she could serve in the tavern again as well as cook in the kitchen she made friends easily with the regulars and was a favorite with the kings patrol when they were in town her life she decided was good the only time she became melancholy was when minstrels came to the inn to entertain and even then it was only certain old songs that brought tears to her eyes three months after her accident she was waiting tables on the evening that the good news arrived from upriver at timberrock keep lord just has an heir a young teamster announced loudly as he entered timbal was shocked at the roar of approval that went up that night it seemed that everyone in the little town and surrounding farmsteads flocked into the inn to raise a mug to the wonderful tidings timbal was kept busy trotting back and forth from the kitchen to the hearth tables and only learned in snatches of gossip from gissel why the rejoicing was so raucous it was no newborn child they celebrated the people of lord justs holdings had reluctantly given up the hope that their beloved but crippled lord could sire a child instead they had lived in fear that his lands and holdings must be inherited by his cousin lord spindrift all knew how he had already plunged his own inheritance into ruin and taken all his folk with it enacting taxes no one could possibly pay and running up debts that would never be settled the prospect of the reckless young noble becoming their lord was now at an end lady lucent had traveled to her home taking with her a minstrel loyal to her and her husband so that her adoption of her sisters son might be witnessed and made legal before lord spindrift could mount an objection to hear the teamster tell the tale it had been a plot long in the making with the minstrel sworn to secrecy and the lady herself begging on her knees that her sister would give up her youngest son to them by all accounts he was a good and likely lad openfaced friendly and an excellent horseman all the folk at timberrock keep were rejoicing and all who lived in lord justs holdings could now know and share the good tidings timbal rejoiced in the lively trade and good spirits that provoked such excellent tips that night the names rang familiar in her ears but of course they would had not she worked at this very inn since before her accident she was accustomed to names and bits of old news that jangled oddly in her mind and almost stirred a memory to the top so there was no reason for her melancholy to deepen over the days that followed yet it did she awoke weeping in the dark of the night felt a weariness that had no reason and could not find a smile for anyones jest she knew her life was good and nightly thanked eda for blessing her but as she explained it to gissel i cannot find my heart i feel i have lost something that i am missing something very important and can know no peace until i find it you lost your father not that long ago gissel ventured but timbal shook her head i grieve him i recall him in flashes his face seen by firelight and how his hands clasped my shoulders and even that he taught me to thank the goddess for every good fortune no gissel i recall enough of him to miss and mourn him but there is something else something i had and i lost tomorrow gissel announced firmly we will tell my father we need a day off and we will walk up to smithfield its the next village on the river well visit my cousins for i want you to meet seck i believe youll like each other and he may be exactly the cure for whatever youve lost timbal was reluctant but gissel pestered her until she agreed her father agreed to give them both the day off for trade was slower in winter but he frowned at gissels plan to visit her cousins reminding her seck has been seeing the farriers daughter i heard he was quite taken with her gissel shrugged that off perhaps he is but i am not and once he meets timbal he will likely forget all about scrawny missa and her shrews tongue they set out the next morning catching a ride with a carter that gissel knew he was taking a load of late cabbages to smithfield and would be happy to give them a ride back as well timbal sat on the tail of the cart while gissel shared the seat with the carter and soon divined that this was a ride that had been arranged well in advance of any favor that gissel hoped to do for timbal he even kissed her before he set them down at her cousins house her fathers gossip was correct seck was not even home that day having gone to his sweethearts house to help her father repair a fence timbal found she didnt care the cousins house was a noisy place with several small children and an adorable new baby the women there were as friendly as gissel and seck or no seck the visit lifted timbals spirits she was reluctant to bid them farewell and lingered as long as she could it was evening when they set out for the smithfield inn where gissels carter was going to pick them up for the ride home oh and if id known id have sent you on your way sooner so you could have had a bit of music there too gissels cousin told her ive heard rumors of the minstrel playing at the inn tall and dark he is and setting all the girls to swooning over his voice but not a one of them will he look at they say he mourns a lost lover and always plays his last song to her memory that was enough to pique the curiosity of both girls and they hurried shawls up against the light rain until they came to the inn gissels carter was late but they found a table near the back gissels cousin had been right the inn was crowded with a mostly female population the minstrel was repairing a harp string when they came in his head bent over his work ill get us some cider while we wait for your carter timbal offered and gissel declared hes not my carter not quite yet oh but he will be timbal called over her shoulder and made her way through the throng to reach the tavern keeper the minstrel struck up while she was trying to get the mans attention the chords rang strangely familiar to her ears she did not recall learning the song but she knew it it was about a warrior come home from his wandering too late his love was lost to him carried off by death a strange prickling ran over her skin lifting the hair on her scalp slowly she turned as he sang of his lost love and her raven hair and her tiny hands then he sang of her blue boots cider forgotten she pushed her way slowly through the crowd ignoring the unkind comments of those she jostled she found him by the hearth seated on a low stool his harp leaned against his shoulder as he played his fingers knew his strings and as he played his eyes rested only on the chair before him enthroned on the chair were a pair of blue boots they were clean but water stained she knew them then suddenly she knew herself she looked at the minstrel her eyes devoured him and at the sight of him a flood of memories thundered through her blood azen did not see her not until she reached the chair and took the blue boots from the seat wordless and pale he said nothing as she sat down and pulled them onto her feet but when she stood he was waiting for her he was shaking as he embraced her i thought i had lost you he managed to say through the uproar of the crowds delighted response gretcha told me you were dead that theyd found your boots on the riverbank that youd thrown yourself in gretcha lies about many things yes she does blue boots you must never go away from me again he folded her close and held her tight eda willing i

and me wearing starskyandhutch wigs complete with sideburns at five oclock in the morning by the side of a canal in amsterdam there had been ten of us that night including rob the groom last seen handcuffed to a bed in the red light district with shaving foam covering his nether regions and his brotherinlaw giggling and patting the hooker holding the straight razor on the arse which was the point i looked at scallie and he looked at me and he said maximum deniability and i nodded because there are some questions you dont want to be able to answer when a bride starts asking pointed questions about the stag weekend so we slipped off for a drink leaving eight men in starskyandhutch wigs one of whom was mostly naked attached to a bed by fluffy pink handcuffs and seemed to be starting to think that this adventure wasnt such a good idea after all behind us in a room that smelled of disinfectant and cheap incense and we went and sat by a canal and drank cans of danish lager and talked about the old days scalliewhose real name is jeremy porter and these days people call him jeremy but he had been scallie when we were elevenand the groom to be rob cunningham had been at school with me we had drifted out of touch more or less had found each other the lazy way you do these days through friends reunited and facebook and such and now scallie and i were together for the first time since we were nineteen the starskyandhutch wigs which had been scallies idea made us look like we were playing brothers in some madefortv moviescallie the short stocky brother with the thick moustache me the tall one given that ive made a significant part of my income since leaving school modeling id add the tall goodlooking one but nobody looks good in a starskyandhutch wig complete with sideburns also the wig itched we sat by the canal and when the lager had all gone we kept talking and we watched the sun come up last time i saw scallie he was nineteen and filled with big plans he had just joined the raf as a cadet he was going to fly planes and do double duty using the flights to smuggle drugs and so get incredibly rich while helping his country it was the kind of mad idea he used to have all the way through school usually the whole thing would fall apart sometimes hed get the rest of us into trouble on the way now twelve years later his six months in the raf ended early because of an unspecified problem with his right knee he was a senior executive in a firm that manufactured doubleglazed windows he told me with since the divorce a smaller house than he felt that he deserved and only a golden retriever for company he was sleeping with a woman in the doubleglazing firm but had no expectations of her leaving her boyfriend for him seemed to find it easier that way of course i wake up crying sometimes since the divorce well you do he said at one point i could not imagine him crying and anyway he said it with a huge scallie grin i told him about me still modelling helping out in a friends antique shop to keep busy more and more painting i was lucky people bought my paintings every year i would have a small gallery show at the little gallery in chelsea and while initially the only people to buy anything had been people i knewphotographers old girlfriends and the likethese days i have actual collectors we talked about the days that only scallie seemed to remember when he and rob and i had been a team of three inviolable unbreakable we talked about teenage heartbreak about caroline minton who was now caroline keen and married to a vicar about the first time we brazened our way into an film although neither of us could remember what the film actually was then scallie said i heard from cassandra the other day cassandra your old girlfriend cassandra remember no the one from reigate you had her name written on all your books i must have looked particularly dense or drunk or sleepy because he said you met her on a skiing holiday oh for heavens sake your first shag cassandra oh i said remembering remembering everything cassandra and i did remember yeah said scallie she dropped me a line on facebook shes running a community theatre in east london you should talk to her really i think well i mean reading between the lines of her message she may still have a thing for you she asked after you i wondered how drunk he was how drunk i was staring at the canal in the early light i said something i forget what then i asked whether scallie remembered where our hotel was because i had forgotten and he said he had forgotten too and that rob had all the hotel details and really we should go and find him and rescue him from the clutches of the nice hooker with the handcuffs and the shaving kit which we realised would be easier if we knew how to get back to where wed left him and looking for some clue to where we had left rob i found a card with the hotels address on it in my back pocket so we headed back there and the last thing i did before we walked away from the canal and that whole strange evening was to pull the itchy starskyandhutch wig off my head and throw it into the canal it floated scallie said there was a deposit on that you know if you didnt want to wear it idve carried it then he said you should drop cassandra a line i shook my head i wondered who he had been talking to online who he had confused for her knowing it definitely wasnt cassandra the thing about cassandra is this id made her up i was fifteen almost sixteen i was awkward i had just experienced my teenage growth spurt and was suddenly taller than most of my friends selfconscious about my height my mother owned and ran a small riding stables and i helped out there but the girlscompetent horsey sensible typesintimidated me at home i wrote bad poetry and painted water colours mostly of ponies in fields at schoolthere were only boys at my schooli played cricket competently acted a little hung around with my friends playing records the cd was around but they were expensive and rare and we had all inherited record players and hifis from parents or older siblings when we didnt talk about music or sports we talked about girls scallie was older than me so was rob they liked having me as part of their gang but they liked teasing me too they acted like i was a kid and i wasnt they had both done it with girls actually thats not entirely true they had both done it with the same girl caroline minton famously free with her favours and always up for it once as long as the person she was with had a moped i did not have a moped i was not old enough to get one my mother could not afford one my father had died when i was small of an accidental overdose of anaesthetic when he was in hospital to have a minor operation on an infected toe to this day i avoid hospitals i had seen caroline minton at parties but she terrified me and even had i owned a moped i would not have wanted my first sexual experience to be with her scallie and rob also had girlfriends scallies girlfriend was taller than he was had huge breasts and was interested in football which meant that scallie had to feign an interest in football crystal palace while robs girlfriend thought that rob and she should have things in common which meant that rob stopped listening to the mids electropop the rest of us liked and started listening to hippy bands from before we were born which was bad and that rob got to raid her dads amazing collection of old tv series on video which was good i had no girlfriend even my mother began to comment on it there must have been a place where it came from the name the idea i dont remember though i just remember writing cassandra on my exercise books then carefully not saying anything whos cassandra asked scallie nobody i said she must be somebody you wrote her name on your maths exercise book shes just a girl i met on the skiing holiday my mother and i had gone skiing with my aunt and cousins the month before in austria are we going to meet her shes from reigate i expect so eventually well i hope so and you like her i paused for what i hoped was the right amount of time and said shes a really good kisser then scallie laughed and rob wanted to know if this was french kissing with tongues and everything and i said what do you think and by the end of the day they both believed in her my mum was pleased to hear id met someone her questionswhat cassandras parents did for examplei simply shrugged away i went on three dates with cassandra on each of our dates i took the train up to london and took myself to the cinema it was exciting in its own way i returned from the first trip with more stories of kissing and of breastfeeling our second date in reality spent watching weird science on my own in leicester square was as told to my mum holding hands together at what she still called the pictures but as told to rob and scallie and over that week to several other school friends who had heard rumours from sworntosecrecy rob and scallie and now needed to find out if it was true the day i lost my virginity in cassandras aunts flat in london the aunt was away cassandra had a key i had for proof a packet of three condoms missing the one i had thrown away and a strip of four blackandwhite photographs i had found on my first trip to london abandoned in the basket of a photo booth on victoria station the photo strip showed a girl about my age with long straight hair i could not be certain of the colour dark blond red light brown and a friendly freckly not unpretty face i pocketed it in art class i did a pencil sketch of the third of the pictures the one i liked the best her head halfturned as if calling out to an unseen friend beyond the tiny curtain she looked sweet and charming i put the drawing up on my bedroom wall where i could see it from my bed after our third date it was who framed roger rabbit i came back to school with bad news cassandras family was going to canada a place that sounded more convincing to my ears than america something to do with her fathers job and i would not see her for a long time we hadnt really broken up but we were being practical those were the days when transatlantic phone calls were too expensive for teenagers it was over i was sad everyone noticed how sad i was they said they would have loved to have met her and maybe when she comes back at christmas i was confident that by christmas she would be forgotten she was by christmas i was going out with nikki blevins and the only evidence that cassandra had ever been a part of my life was her name written on a couple of my exercise books and the pencil drawing of her on my bedroom wall with cassandra february written underneath it when my mother sold the riding stables in the drawing was lost in the move i was at art college at the time considered my old pencildrawings as embarrassing as the fact that i had once invented a girlfriend and did not care i do not believe i had thought of cassandra for twenty years my mother sold the riding stables the attached house and the meadows to a property developer who built a housing estate where it had once been and as part of the deal gave her a small detached house at the end of seton close i visit her at least once a fortnight arriving on friday night leaving sunday morning a routine as regular as the grandmother clock in the hall mother is concerned that i am happy in life she has started to mention that various of her friends have eligible daughters this trip we had an extremely embarrassing conversation that began with her asking if i would like to meet the church organist a very nice young man of about my age mother im not gay theres nothing wrong with it dear all sorts of people do it they even get married well not proper marriage but its the same thing im still not gay i just thought still not married and the painting and the modelling ive had girlfriends mummy youve even met some of them nothing that ever stuck dear i just thought there might be something you wanted to tell me im not gay mother i would tell you if i was and then i said i snogged tim carter at a party when i was at art college but we were drunk and it never went beyond that she pursed her lips thats quite enough of that young man and then changing the subject as if to get rid of an unpleasant taste in her mouth she said youll never guess who i bumped into in tescos last week no i wont who your old girlfriend your first girlfriend i should say nikki blevins hang on shes married isnt she nikki woodbridge the one before her dear cassandra i was behind her in the line i would have been ahead of her but i forgot that i needed cream for the berries today so i went back to get it and she was in front of me and i knew her face was familiar at first i thought she was joanie simmonds youngest the one with the speech disorderwhat we used to call a stammer but apparently you cant say that anymorebut then i thought i know where i know that face it was over your bed for five years of course i said its not cassandra is it and she said it is and i said youll laugh when i say this but im stuart inness mum she says stuart innes and her face lit up well she hung around while i was putting my groceries in my shopping bag and she said shed already been in touch with your friend jeremy porter on bookface and theyd been talking about you you mean facebook she was talking to scallie on facebook yes dear i drank my tea and wondered who my mother had actually been talking to i said youre quite sure this was the cassandra from over my bed oh yes dear she told me about how you took her to leicester square and how sad she was when they had to move to canada they went to vancouver i asked her if she ever met my cousin lesliehe went to vancouver after the warbut she said she didnt believe so and it turns out its actually a big sort of place i told her about the pencil drawing you did and she seemed very uptodate on your activities she was thrilled when i told her that you were having a gallery opening this week you told her that yes dear i thought shed like to know then my mother said almost wistfully shes very pretty dear i think shes doing something in community theatre then the conversation went over to the retirement of dr dunnings who had been our gp since before i was born and how he was the only nonindian doctor left in his practice and how my mother felt about this i lay in bed that night in my small bedroom at my mothers house and turned over the conversation in my head i am no longer on facebook and thought about rejoining to see who scullies friends were and if this pseudocassandra was one of them but there were too many people i was happy not to see again and i let it be certain that when there was an explanation it would prove to be a simple one and i slept i have been showing in the little gallery in chelsea for over a decade now in the old days i had a quarter of a wall and nothing priced at more than three hundred pounds now i get my own show every october for a month and it would be fair to say that i have to sell only a dozen paintings to know that my needs rent and life are covered for another year the unsold paintings remain on the gallery walls until they are gone and they are always gone by christmas the couple who own the gallery paul and barry still call me the beautiful boy as they did twelve years ago when i first exhibited with them when it might actually have been true back then they wore flowery opennecked shirts and gold chains now in middle age they wear expensive suits and talk too much for my liking about the stock exchange still i enjoy their company i see them three times a year in september when they come to my studio to see what ive been working on and select the paintings for the show at the gallery hanging and opening in october and in february when we settle up barry runs the gallery paul coowns it comes out for the parties but also works in the wardrobe department of the royal opera house the preview party for this years show was on a friday night i had spent a nervous couple of days hanging the paintings now my part was done and there was nothing to do but wait and hope people liked my art and not to make a fool of myself i did as i had done for the previous twelve years on barrys instructions nurse the champagne fill up on water theres nothing worse for the collector than encountering a drunk artist unless hes a famous drunk and you are not dear be amiable but enigmatic and when people ask for the story behind the painting say my lips are sealed but for gods sake imply there is one its the story theyre buying i rarely invite people to the preview any longer some artists do regarding it as a social event i do not while i take my art seriously as art and am proud of my work the latest exhibition was called people in landscapes which pretty much says it all about my work anyway i understand that the party exists solely as a commercial event a comeon for eventual buyers and those who might say the right thing to other eventual buyers i tell you all this so that you will not be surprised that barry and paul manage the guest list to the preview not i the preview begins at pm i had spent the afternoon hanging paintings making sure everything looked as good as it could the only thing that was different about this particular event was how excited paul looked like a small boy struggling with the urge to tell you what he had bought you for a birthday present that and barry who said while we were hanging i think tonights show will put you on the map i said i think theres a typo on the lake district one an oversized painting of windemere at sunset with two children staring lostly at the viewer from the banks it should say three thousand pounds it says three hundred thousand does it said barry blandly my my it was perplexing but the first guests had arrived a little early and the mystery could wait a young man invited me to eat a mushroom puff from a silver tray then i took my glass of nursethisslowly champagne and i prepared to mingle all the prices were high and i doubted that the little gallery would be able to sell them at those prices and i worried about the year ahead barry and paul took responsibility for moving me around the room saying this is the artist the beautiful boy who makes all these beautiful things stuart innes and i would shake hands and smile by the end of the evening i will have met everyone and paul and barry are very good about saying stuart you remember david he writes about art for the telegraph and i for my part am good about saying of course how are you so glad you could come the room was at its most crowded when a striking redhaired woman to whom i had not yet been introduced began shouting representational bullshit i was in conversation with the daily telegraph art critic and we turned he said friend of yours i said i dont think so she was still shouting although the sounds of the party had now quieted she shouted nobodys interested in this shit nobody then she reached her hand into her coat pocket and pulled out a bottle of ink shouted try selling this now and threw ink at windemere sunset it was blueblack ink paul was by her side then pulling the ink bottle away from her saying that was a threehundredthousandpound painting young lady barry took her arm said i think the police will want a word with you and walked her back into his office she shouted at us as she went im not afraid im proud artists like him just feeding off you gullible art buyers youre all sheep representation crap and then she was gone and the party people were buzzing and inspecting the inkfouled painting and looking at me and the telegraph man was asking if i would like to comment and how i felt about seeing a threehundredthousandpound painting destroyed and i mumbled about how i was proud to be a painter and said something about the transient nature of art and he said that he supposed that tonights event was an artistic happening in its own right and we agreed that artistic happening or not the woman was not quite right in the head barry reappeared moving from group to group explaining that paul was dealing with the young lady and that her eventual disposition would be up to me the guests were still buzzing excitedly as he was ushering people out of the door apologising as he did so agreeing that we lived in exciting times explaining that he would be open at the regular time tomorrow that went well he said when we were alone in the gallery well that was a disaster mm stuart innes the one who had the threehundredthousandpound painting destroyed i think you need to be forgiving dont you she was a fellow artist even one with different goals sometimes you need a little something to kick you up to the next level we went into the back room i said whose idea was this ours said paul he was drinking white wine in the back room with the redhaired woman well barrys mostly but it needed a good little actress to pull it off and i found her she grinned modestly managed to look both abashed and pleased with herself if this doesnt get you the attention you deserve beautiful boy said barry smiling at me nothing will now youre important enough to be attacked the windemere paintings ruined i pointed out barry glanced at paul and they giggled its already sold ink splatters and all for seventyfive thousand pounds he said its like i always say people think they are buying the art but really theyre buying the story paul filled our glasses and we owe it all to you he said to the woman stuart barry id like to propose a toast to cassandra cassandra we repeated and we drank this time i did not nurse my drink i needed it then as the name was still sinking in paul said cassandra this ridiculously attractive and talented young man is as i am sure you know stuart innes i know she said actually were very old friends do tell said barry well said cassandra twenty years ago stuart wrote my name on his maths exercise notebook she looked like the girl in my drawing yes or like the girl in the photographs all grown up sharpfaced intelligent assured i had never seen her before in my life hello cassandra i said i couldnt think of anything else to say we were in the wine bar beneath my flat they serve food there too its more than just a wine bar i found myself talking to her as if she was someone i had known since childhood and i reminded myself she wasnt i had only met her that evening she still had ink stains on her hands we had glanced at the menu ordered the same thingthe vegetarian mezeand when it had arrived both started with the dolmades then moved on to the hummus i made you up i told her it was not the first thing i had said first we had talked about her community theatre how she had become friends with paul his offer to hera thousand pounds for this evenings showand how she had needed the money but mostly said yes because it sounded like a fun adventure anyway she said she couldnt say no when she heard my name mentioned she thought it was fate that was when i said it i was scared she would think i was mad but i said it i made you up no she said you didnt i mean obviously you didnt im really here then she said would you like to touch me i looked at her at her face and her posture at her eyes she was everything i had ever dreamed of in a woman everything i had been missing in other women yes i said very much lets eat our dinner first she said then she said how long has it been since you were with a woman im not gay i protested i have girlfriends i know she said when was the last one i tried to remember was it brigitte or the stylist the ad agency had sent me to iceland with i was not certain two years i said perhaps three i just havent met the right person yet you did once she said she opened her handbag then a big floppy purple thing pulled out a cardboard folder opened it removed a piece of paper tape browned at the corners see i remembered it how could i not it had hung above my bed for years she was looking around as if talking to someone beyond the curtain cassandra it said february and it was signed stuart innes there is something at the same time both embarrassing and heartwarming about seeing your handwriting from when you were fifteen i came back from canada in eightynine she said my parents marriage fell apart and mum wanted to come home i wondered about you what you were doing so i went to your old address the house was empty windows were broken it was obvious nobody lived there anymore theyd knocked down the riding stables alreadythat made me so sad id loved horses as a girl obviously but i walked through the house until i found your bedroom it was obviously your bedroom although all the furniture was gone it still smelled like you and this was still pinned to the wall i didnt think anyone would miss it she smiled who are you cassandra carlisle aged thirtyfour former actress failed playwright now running a community theatre in norwood drama therapy hall for rent four plays a year plus workshops and a local panto who are you stuart you know who i am then you know ive never met you before dont you she nodded she said poor stuart you live just above here dont you yes its a bit loud sometimes but its handy for the tube and the rent isnt painful lets pay and go upstairs i reached out to touch the back of her hand not yet she said moving her hand away before i could touch her we should talk first so we went upstairs i like your flat she said it looks exactly like the kind of place i imagine you being its probably time to start thinking about getting something a bit bigger i told her but it does me fine theres good light out the back for my studioyou cant get the effect now at night but its great for painting its strange bringing someone home it makes you see the place you live as if youve not been there before there are two oil paintings of me in the lounge from my shortlived career as an artists model i did not have the patience to stand and wait blownup advertising photos of me in the little kitchen and the loo book covers with me onromance covers mostly over the stairs i showed her the studio and then the bedroom she examined the edwardian barbers chair i had rescued from an ancient barbers that closed down in shoreditch she sat down on the chair pulled off her shoes who was the first grownup you liked she asked odd question my mother i suspect dont know why i was three perhaps four he was a postman called mr postie hed come in his little post van and bring me lovely things not every day just sometimes brown paper packages with my name on and inside would be toys or sweets or something he had a funny friendly face with a knobby nose and he was real he sounds like somebody a kid would make up he drove a post van inside the house it wasnt very big she began to unbutton her blouse it was creamcoloured still flecked with splatters of ink whats the first thing you actually remember not something you were told you did that you really remember going to the seaside when i was three with my mum and my dad do you remember it or do you remember being told about it i dont see what the point of this is she stood up wiggled stepped out of her skirt she wore a white bra dark green panties frayed very human not something you would wear to impress a new lover i wondered what her breasts would look like when the bra came off i wanted to stroke them to touch them to my lips she walked from the chair to the bed where i was sitting lie down now on that side of the bed ill be next to you dont touch me i lay down my hands at my sides she said youre so beautiful im not honestly sure whether youre my type you would have been when i was fifteen though nice and sweet and unthreatening artistic ponies a riding stable and i bet you never make a move on a girl unless youre sure shes ready do you no i said i dont suppose that i do she lay down beside me you can touch me now said cassandra i had started thinking about stuart again late last year stress i think work was going well up to a point but id broken up with pavel who may or may not have been an actual bad hat although he certainly had his finger in many dodgy east european pies and i was thinking about internet dating i had spent a stupid week joining the kind of web sites that link you to old friends and from there it was no distance to jeremy scallie porter and to stuart innes i dont think i could do it anymore i lack the singlemindedness the attention to detail something else you lose when you get older mr postie used to come in his van when my parents had no time for me he would smile his big gnomey smile wink an eye at me hand me a brownpaper parcel with cassandra written on in big block letters and inside would be a chocolate or a doll or a book his final present was a pink plastic microphone and i would walk around the house singing or pretending to be on tv it was the best present i had ever been given my parents did not ask about the gifts i did not wonder who was actually sending them they came with mr postie who drove his little van down the hall and up to my bedroom door and who always knocked three times i was a demonstrative girl and the next time i saw him after the plastic microphone i ran to him and threw my arms around his legs its hard to describe what happened then he fell like snow or like ash for a moment i had been holding someone then there was just powdery white stuff and nothing i used to wish that mr postie would come back after that but he never did he was over after a while he became embarrassing to remember i had fallen for that so strange this room i wonder why i could ever have thought that somebody who made me happy when i was fifteen would make me happy now but stuart was perfect the riding stables with ponies and the painting which showed me he was sensitive and the inexperience with girls so i could be his first and how very very tall dark and handsome he would be i liked the name too it was vaguely scottish and to my mind like the hero of a novel i wrote stuarts name on my exercise books i did not tell my friends the most important thing about stuart that i had made him up and now im getting up off the bed and looking down at the outline of a man a silhouette in flour or ash or dust on the black satin bedspread and i am getting into my clothes the photographs on the wall are fading too i didnt expect that i wonder what will be left of his world in a few hours wonder if i should have left well enough alone a masturbatory fantasy something reassuring and comforting he would have gone through his life without ever really touching anyone just a picture and a painting and a half memory for a handful of people who barely ever thought of him anymore i leave the flat there are still people at the wine bar downstairs they are sitting at the table in the corner where stuart and i had been sitting the candle has burned way down but i imagine that it could almost be us a man and a woman in conversation and soon enough they will get up from their table and walk away and the candle will be snuffed and the lights turned off and that will be that for another night i hail a taxi climb in for a momentfor i hope the last timei find myself missing stuart innes then i sit back in the seat of the taxi and i let him go i hope i can afford the taxi fare and find myself wondering whether there will be a cheque in my bag in the morning or just another blank sheet of paper then more satisfied than not i close my eyes and i wait

lurk in the darkness kept at bay only by the strangest of alliancesand by the power of the blood after the blood lost in the forest i broke off a dark twig and lifted its whisper to my thirsty lips pablo neruda i didnt have time to grab my coat only shoes and the shotgun i had gone to sleep with the fanny pack belted to my waist so the shells were on hand and jangled as i ran i had forgotten they would make noise not that it mattered no moon slick gravel and cold rain on my face neighbors dogs were barking and i wished they would shut up but they didnt and i kept expecting one of them to make that strangled yip sound like petepete had out in the woods where i couldnt ever find his body i missed him bad nights like these so did the cats the cowbell was still ringing when i reached the gate and i heard a loud thud a hoof striking wood chains rattled i raised the shotgun ready theyre coming whispered a strained voice murmuring something else in german that i couldnt understand amanda here i muttered hurry hinges creaked followed by the soft tread of hooves and wheels rolling over gravel slow too slow i dug in my heels hearing something else in the darkness a hacking cough wet and raw steven i warned were through he said i pulled the trigger gritting my teeth against the recoil the muzzle flash generated a brief lightenough to glimpse a hateful set of eyes and then almost in the same instant i heard a muffled scream i fired again just for good measure steven slammed into the gate i ran to help him set the lockonehanded shotgun braced against my hip i heard more coughsdeeper masculineand got bathed in the scent of rotten meat and shit all those unclean mouths breathing on me from the other side of the fence a rock whistled past my ear i threw one back with all my strength steven dragged me away son of a bitch i muttered breathlessand gave the boy a hard look his body faintly visible even in the darkness what the hell are you doing here steven let go i couldnt see his face but i heard him stumble back to the horses i almost stopped him needing an answer almost as much as i feared onebut i smelled something else in that moment charred meat i stood on my toes and reached inside the wagon felt a blanket and beneath a leg when i wanted to ask but my voice wouldnt work i clung to the edge of the wagon needing something to lean on but that lasted only until steven began leading the horses up the driveway i followed uneasytrying to ignore the sounds of rocks hitting the fence and those raw hacking coughs that quieted into whines sounded like dogs crawling on their stomachs begging not to be beaten made me think of petepete again my palms were sweaty around the shotgun steven remained silent until we reached the house lamplight flickered through the windows which were crowded with feline faces pressed against the glass it felt good to see again steven dropped the reins and walked to the back of the wagon he was a couple inches taller than me and slender in the shoulders just a teen cleanshaven wearing a dark widebrimmed hat his suspenders were loose and his pants ended well above his ankles a pair of old tennis shoes clung precariously to his feet they hurt him bad said the boy unlatching the backboard even though he saved their lives he didnt fight back i asked though i knew the answer steven gave me a bitter look they called him a devil called him other things too i guessed but that couldnt be helped we had all expected this one way or another only so long a man could keep secrets while living under his familys roof i tried to hand my gun to the boy he stared at the weapon as though it were a live snake and put his hands behind his back steven i said sharply but he ducked his head and edged around me toward the back of the wagon no words no argument he did the job i was going to do taking hold of those blanketed ankles and pulling hard the body slid out slowly but the cooked smell of human flesh curdled through my nostrils and i had to turn away with my hand over my mouth i went into the house cats scattered under the sagging couch and quilt while kittens mewed from the box placed in front of the ironbellied stove i left the shotgun on the kitchen table beside the covered bucket of clean water i had pulled from the hand pump earlier that evening and grabbed a sheet from the line strung across the living room i started pulling down panties too and anything else embarrassing just in time steven trudged inside breathing harddragging that blanketwrapped body across my floor he didnt stop for directions just moved toward the couch one slow inch at a time a cat peered from beneath the quilt and hissed i helped sling the body on the couch a foot slipped free of the blanket still wearing a shoe the leather had melted into the blackened skin steven and i stared at that foot i wanted to cryit was the proper thing to dobut except for a hard sick lump in my throat my eyes burned dry what about you i asked steven quietly they know you brought him here i put the fire out he replied and pulled off his hat with a shaking hand dont know if i can go home after that i rubbed his shoulder put the horses in the barn then take my bed thisll be awhile our dad he began and stopped swallowing hard crumpling the hat in his hands he could not look at me just that blackened foot i stepped between him and the couch but he did not move until i placed my palm on his chest pushing him away he gave me a wild look haunted i noticed for the first time that he smelled like smoke but i didnt have to say a word he turned and walked out the front door head down shoulders pinched and hunched some of the cats followed him i stayed with the body sat down at the bottom of the couch beside that exposed foot it took me a long time to peel off the shoe longer than it had to i wanted to vomit every time i touched that warm burned skin i peeled and pulled and finally just cut everything away with a pair of old scissors steven passed through only once from the front door to my bedroom if he looked i didnt know i ignored him i unrolled the body from the blanket worked on all those clothesand the other shoe stripped off what had been handsewn pants made of coarse denim and a shirt of a softer weave the beard i knew so well was gone so was that face except for blackened skin and exposed bone his mouth was open twisted into a scream so visceral his lower jaw had unhinged stupid i whispered to him rubbing my eyes and running nose you had nothing to prove same as me nothing to prove nothing at all i had brought in a knife with the scissorssterilized in boiling water and wrapped in a clean rag covered in some faded drawing of a black mouse in red pants i did not want to touch the blade but i did i did not want to hold my arm over that open mouth but i did that too sucked down a deep breath steeled myself cut open my wrist nothing big i wasnt crazy but the blood welled up faster than i expected my vision seemed to fade behind a white cloud and i almost lay down on that burned body but i took a couple quick breaths grit my teeth and stopped looking at the blood just that mouth just that mouth i held my wrist over swallowing all those little drops of my life it took a while i didnt want to make a mistake this was the worst i had ever seen so bad i began to wonder if this was the end the last and final straw got harder to breathe after that my throat burned cats pawed my legs and took turns in my lap butting my chin and kneading my thighs with their prickly little claws one of them licked a charred finger but didnt try to chew so i let that go my wrist throbbed so did my head after a time i kept at it until finally i noticed a little color around his lips a hint of pink beneath the blackened skin i closed my eyes counting to one hundred when i looked again it wasnt my imagination pink skin signs of life i pressed my wrist against his burned mouth and felt his lips tighten just a hairsbreadth good enough for me i was exhausted i didnt move my wrist but stretched out on the couch beside him ignoring the smell and crunch of cooked skin a cat walked up the length of my hip while another perched on the cushion above me licking my hair purrs thundered everywhere and that mouth closed tighter i closed my eyes and went to sleep i woke choking water trickling down my throat but there was also a hand behind my head and something hard on my lips and both flashed me back to the bad days i sat up fighting heart all thunder my fist slammed into a hard chest a naked man squatted in front of me gripping a cup of water in his hand scared me for a moment terrified me part of me still asleepbut then i took a breath and my vision cleared and i saw the man i saw him he was bald scorched raw not much better than a halfcooked chicken and certainly uglier but his eyes were blue and glittering as ice and i smiled crooked for that cold gaze henry i wiped water from my mouth trying not to tremble arent you a sight amanda he replied but that was it only my name that other hand of his still held the back of my head i looked down my wrist had been bandaged i saw other things too and dragged the quilt from the couch to toss over his hips his mouth twitchedfrom bitterness or humor i couldnt tellbut he leaned in to kiss me just my cheek slow and deliberate lingering with our faces pressed close i slid my arms around his neck and held tight dont make me cry again i whispered henry dragged in a deep breath how did i get here steven he leaned harder against me did anyone see him we havent talked about what happened but id say yes i pulled away speaking into his shoulder a patchwork of pink and blackened flesh he said you saved lives i gave in henrys fingers tightened in my hair i killed monsters i killed he said again shivering i violated gods rule you did what you had to i wanted to tell him but those were cheap words compared to what he needed and that was more than i could give him bedsprings creaked from the other room i glanced toward the window still dark out but it had to be close to dawn i heard birds and the goats and farther away that dog barking i tried to stand henry grabbed my wrist you need to rest what you did last night im fine i lied blinking heavily to keep my vision straight stay here but he didnt he wrapped the quilt around his hips and limped outside with me followed by several cats bounding twining pouncing in the grass little guards cool air felt good on my face and though henry did not take my hand our arms brushed as we walked i had built the rabbit hutch inside the barn horses stirred restlessly when we entered and so did the goats in their dark pen but the chickens were quiet i felt all the animals watching as i undid the latch and reached inside for a sleek brown body the rabbit trembled so did henry when i handed it to him i wish you wouldnt watch he murmured but almost in the same breath he bit the rabbits throat it screamed so did he but it was a muffled relieved sound i looked away all the other rabbits were huddled together shaking i could hear henry feeding and it was a wet sucking sound that made my skin crawl and my wrist throb i counted seconds counted until they added up to minutes then i took another rabbit from the hutch and held it out head turned henry took it from me and walked away no longer limping i heard the rabbit scream before he reached the door i did chores freshened the water for the goats brushed the horses down with handfuls of hay and the palms of my hands thought again about building a pen for some pigs and how much id have to trade upriver for several in an upcoming litter id heard about in town i wanted to get set before winter trees needed cutting too for firewood i had been putting that off when i left the barn i found henry near the garden digging a hole just large enough for two dead rabbits soil was wet and smelled good like the tomatoes ripening on the vines i saw light on the horizon ill finish that i said you need to get inside i need a walk he mumbled i realized he had been weeping i dont want to see steven too bad i crouched taking his hand his skin appeared healthier burn marks fading you may be all he has now besides its too close to dawn for a walk dont be stupid stupid he echoed and pulled his hand away you should have seen how my dadhow theylooked at me how theyll look at steven now my fault amanda i was too weak to leave the rabbits were still warm but hollow flattened drops of blood coated their throats i dropped them into the hole henry had dug and pushed dirt over their bodies staying was harder than leaving i said but that was all the house door creaked open somewhere out of sight then banged shut henry tensed i backed away i doubt he noticed too busy watching his brother who strode down the path toward usjust a shadow in the predawn light shoulders hunched hands shoved deep in his pockets hat tilted low over his eyes i left them alone went back to the house for my shotgun and a coat and then headed down to the fence looking for monsters cats followed me the land had been in the family a long time long enough for stories to be passed down stories that never changed except for the weather or the animal or the person stories involving my kin who were neighbors and friends to the plain people or the amish as my mother had called them respectfully she was dead now gone a couple years she and my father had both survived the big death though cancer and infection finally killed them mundane compared to what had destroyed most everyone else a plague that struck cities a virus that killed in hours or days my brother was lost that waygone to college in chicago which didnt exist anymore it was for him that i didnt like hearing stories about the big death though some refugee survivors seemed to get kicks from the attention they received when telling the tale blood in the streets and riots and the government quarantining the cities and suburbs with tanks and barricades and guns no burials for the millions dead no burials for the cities just the forests that had grown up around them an unnatural growth some said cities of the dead swallowed by trees and in the intervening years other strange things unnatural visitations but folks didnt like to tell those stories plague was easier to swallow than magic the fence around my land was made of wood planks instead of strung barbed wire maybe my greatgrandfather had built the thing or his fatheri didnt know for surejust that it was older than living memory and had been tended and mended over the last hundred years by people who knew what they were doing so many times over there probably wasnt much original wood left in the damn thing it was a good fence and id made my own additions still dark out skies clearing revealing stars i checked the gate at the end of the driveway couldnt see much on the other side except for a splash of something dark on the gravel blood maybe no body dragged away into the woods with petepetes bones i undid the lock crossed over shotgun held carefully cats walked with me but didnt hiss or flatten their ears just watched the shadows beyond the road in the trees i didnt hear anything except for birds hiding from the light said a quiet voice behind me i didnt flinch one of the cats had glanced over its shoulder which was warning enough henry stepped close still naked except for the quilt i said you should be in the house i have time not safe here all by yourself got an army i held up my gun and glanced at the cats steven he said nothing just took a few jolting steps toward the woods i grabbed him afraid of what he would do he didnt fight me but the tension was thick in his arm i pretended not to see the sharp tips of his teeth as he pulled back his lips to scent the air theyre in there he said his voice husky i tasted their blood last night i tightened my grip both on his arm and the shotgun cats twined around our legs did you like it henry looked at me yes its not a sin i said to be yourself you told me that before i was turned into this he touched his mouth pressing his thumb against a sharp tooth i was called a demon last night dad put the torch to me himself and i didnt stop him i kept hoping he would stop first i squeezed his arm come on before the sun rises i have time he said again but gently holding my gaze please lets walk so we did on the dangerous side of the fence outside the border of the land my cornfields and the potatoes and the long rows of spinach green beans tomatoes and cucumbers i didnt have a rabbit problem cats strolled along the rails and through the tall grass which soaked the bottoms of my jeans henry did not notice the wet or chill he watched the forest and the sky and my face stop i said and knelt to examine a weatherbeaten post it was hard to see i had no batteries for the flashlights stored in the cellar but i had traded for some butane lighters some years back and those still worked i slipped one from my pocket flipped the switch a little flame appeared i needed it for only a moment it looks fine henry murmured you always say that i replied and held out my finger to him he hesitatedand then nipped it ever so carefully on the sharp point of his tooth i felt nothing except a nick of pain and maybe sadness or comfort or affectionlovebut nothing as storybooks said i should feel no shiver no lust no mindmeld i had done my research in the library which still stood in town governed by three crones who lived there and guarded the books i had read fiction and myths and looked at pictures on the backs of movies that couldnt be played anymore but in the end none of it meant much problems just had to be lived through i smeared a spot of my blood on the fencepost and said a prayer nothing big it was the feeling behind the words that mattered and i prayed for safety and light and protection i prayed to keep the monsters out we moved on a hundred feet later stopped again i repeated the ritual weak spots no way to tell just from looking but i knew in my blood in my heart they got through last night henry said watching me carefully past the fence to the front door thats what started it i was in the barn cleaning the stalls i heard mom scream im sorry i glanced at the skylighter now dawn chasing stars sun would soon be rising ill swing around the farm today and see if i cant shore up the line without your folks seeing me take steven with you i shook my head patting the tabby rubbing against my shins wont do that if they try and hurt him then well know its important amanda i started walking have him talk to me about it his choice no pressure from you henry stayed where he was clutching the quilt in one hand his broad shoulders were almost free of burned skin and so were his arms thick with muscle he had been teethed on hard labor and it showed but henry was a goodlooking man when he wasnt burned alive and it hurt to feel him staring at me staring at me like i wanted to be stared atwith hunger and trust and that old sadness that sometimes i couldnt bear i looked away just for a moment one of the cats meowed when i turned back he was gone no one knew of course about the blood on the fence prior to last night no one had known about henrys affliction either just steven and me small town caught on the border of a governmentregistered enclave one of hundreds scattered across the former united states not many official types ever came around except a couple times a year with fresh medicines and other odds and endsmilitary caravans powered by gas no one else had fuel might be some in the quarantined cities but i couldnt think of anyone who would go there the virus might still be active waiting in the bones twenty years waiting little or no manufacturing in all that time no currency no airplanes no television or postal service or ice cream from the freezer or all the little things i had taken for granted as a kid and could hardly remember just stories now lives that were and would never be again the past gone unmissed maybe it was for the best survivors of the big death had to make do with leftovers farming experience was more valuable than guns so was living without electricity and plumbing which meantto the dismay of somethat amish and folks like them now held the real power government was encouraging them to spread out establish new agricultural communitiesfrom atlantic to pacific nothing asked for in return though it had created an odd dynamic id heard accusations of favoritism in business dealings complaints about cold shoulders and standoffishness other things toobitter and sour but not all communities were the same and if you were a good neighbor the plain people were good to you even if when you knew them too well they had their own problems religion was no cure for dysfunction i rode in the wagon beside steven brought my shotgununloaded in case anyone checked shells were in my pockets knives hidden inside my boots we werent the only ones on the road which had been one of those twolane highways back in the old days still a highway just not for carswhich rusted at the side of the road relics of another age none had been dumped in the fields plenty of land maybe but it all needed to be used to grow food vast vegetable gardens and grazing cattle surrounded several battered trailer homes little kids playing outside waved to us and went back to chasing the dog steven and i didnt talk much until we reached the border of his familys farm i made him stop twice and pricked my finger for blood blessed the fence god has a plan steven murmured watching me i glanced at him i hate it when you and henry say that better god than the alternative he leaned forward studying his handshis trembling hands i want god to be responsible for what changed us i want god to have a reason for us being different were not demons amanda i agree i replied sharply now let me concentrate you dont even know how you do it he murmured still not looking at me or why your blood works against them because i will it to whispered a small voice inside my mind but that was nonsenseand even if it wasnt years of considering the matter had given me nothing worth discussing the same instincts that had led me to dot fenceposts with my blood seemed just as powerful as the driving urge of birds to fly south for winter or cats to huntor henry to drink blood i worked quickly and climbed back into the wagon steven clucked at the horses i kept my gaze on the fence watching for weak spotslistening for them inside my head but it was near the gate where i saw the breaking point those boards are new i said jumping down and crouching or were before last night dad replaced them no one told henry or me stevens voice was hoarse his face so pale he looked ready to vomit found out too late you dont have to do this we can go back he closed his eyes and shook his head i need them to understand none of us could stop what happened not before i imagined him adding but we could stop it this time i stared past steven at the woods its been hard for you these past few years helping your brother pretend hes human keeping up the illusion every day in your own home a strained smile touched the corner of his mouth lying all the time praying for forgiveness wears on the soul cry me a river i said you know youre a good person by your standards maybe ah my weak morals my violent temper the jeans i wear i gave him a sidelong glance i thought pride was a sin he never replied i finished blessing the fence and pulled myself back into the wagon less than a minute later we turned up the drive almost a quartermile long from the fence to the house it was a sunny day so bright the white clapboard house near glowed with light purple petunias grew in tangled masses near the clothesline chickens scattered beneath billowing sheets pecking feed thrown down by a little girl dressed in a simple blue dress a black cap had been tied over her head and her curly brown hair hung in braids she looked up staring at the wagon steven waved anna is getting big i said just as the little girl dropped the bowl of chicken feed and ran toward the housescreaming i flinched so did steven he stopped the horses before we were halfway up the drive i slid out of the wagon watching as a man strode from the barn he held an ax my unloaded shotgun was on the bench i touched the stock and said samuel if youre not planning on using that cutter maybe you should put it down samuel bontrager did not put down the ax he was a stocky bowlegged man broad shoulders sinewy forearms lean legs and a gut that hung precariously over the waist of his pants he had a long beard more silver than blond henry might look like him one day if he aged last time id seen the man he had been admiring a new horse a delicate highstepping creature traded as a gift for his eldest daughter smiles then but now he was pale tense staring at me with a gaze so hollow he hardly seemed alive go he whispered as the house door banged open and his wife rachel emerged go on get out dad steven choked out but samuel let out a despairing cry and staggered forward with that ax shaking in his hands he did not swing the weapon but brandished it like a shield might as well have been a cross i took my hand from the shotgun we need to talk rachel walked down the porch stairs each step stiff sharp her gaze never left stevens face but her husband was shaking his head shaking like that was all he knew how to do his eyes downcast when open at all out he said hoarsely i saw a crime committed last night that was against god and i will not tolerate any who condone it you saw a young man save his parents from death i stepped toward him hands outstretched you saw both your sons take that burden on their souls to keep you safe i didnt add making amends for what they couldnt do years ago i might as well have spoken out loud rachel made a muffled gasping sound a sob touching her mouth with her scarred tanned hands i saw those memories in her eyes samuel finally looked at his son his gaze blazing with sorrow you held them down he whispered you held those men down for him i gave steven a sharp look but he was staring at his father pale shaking with some strange light in his toobright eyes they were going to kill you he breathed i did nothing wrong neither did henry we did not forsake the lord you held them down samuel hissed again trembling and he ripped out their throats he used nothing but his mouth to do this we all saw it he was not human in that moment he was not a child of god he was something else and i will not have such a monstrosity in my home nor will i bear the sight of any who would take that monsters side samuel i said looking past him as his weeping wife who swayed closer clutched her hands over her mouth those were not human men he killed then what was my son if those were not men samuel tossed his ax in the dirt and rubbed a hand over his ashen face i would rather have died than see my own child murder he was telling the truth i expected nothing less from a man of his faith nor could i condemn it he believed what he believed and it was the reason so many towns and enclaves had become safe places to live it was also why so many local men of the amish were gone now in the grave and why anna bontrager did not look like either of her fairhaired parents steven i said quietly get out of the wagon were going no he whispered flashing me a desperate look tell them amanda tell them what happened years ago in the woods but i looked at steven and then his parents and could not bring myself to say the words not yet maybe not ever steven and henrys belongings i said instead well take them gone said rachel so softly i could barely hear her she drew close to her husbands side and her bloodshot gaze never left stevens face burned steven sank down on the wagon bench breaking breakingi could hear his heart breaking i suddenly hated henry for not being here for asking me to do this i grabbed my shotgun off the wagon and touched stevens leg come on lets go he gave me a dazed look samuel behind me cleared his throat and whispered take the wagon and horses i dont want anything he touched i ignored him still holding stevens gaze i extended my hand after a long moment he took it and i pulled him off the wagon he kept his head down and did not look back at his parents i pushed him ahead of me very gently and we walked down the long driveway toward the road samuel called out amanda i stopped steven did not i glanced over my shoulder samuel and his wife were leaning on each other i wanted to pick up handfuls of gravel and throw it at their faces i wanted to ask them to remember the bad days and that violent afternoon maybe the choice not to act had always been clear to them but not to henry not to his brother if you keep the boy with you samuel began but i held up my hand stopping him dont i said dont threaten me no threats rachel replied pulling away from her husband pushing him even we care about you our families have always been close more close than she realized close enough that she would not want me here should the truth be known all those little truths wrapped up in lies all i could do was stare helpless then dont do this to steven no matter what happened last night you have to forgive him its your way rachels face crumpled samuel clamped his hand down hard on her shoulder forgiveness isnt the same as acceptance steven will be held accountable he said with ominous finality rachel shuddered for a moment i thought she would defy her husband but she visibly steeled herself and gave me an impossibly sad look that reminded me of my mother when she would dig out old pictures of my brother i know about the violence that was committed against you she whispered so softly i could barely hear her voice but dont let that be an excuse to harbor violence in your heart or my home i gave her a bitter smile there are just as many kinds of violence as there are forgiveness i looked at samuel you set henry on fire you killed your own son no ones free of sin in this place i turned and walked away steven waited for me at the end of the driveway i grabbed his arm and marched up the road holding him close even when the bontrager farm was out of sight i didnt let go i said you told them what happened to me she just knew steven whispered it was the same men and she knew i didnt want to think about that but i did i had time it took us more than an hour to walk home longer because i detoured to check other parts of his familys fence and then mine no need to bless any other borders in these parts folks had their own problems but not like oursthough this road between his place and mine had a reputation amongst locals few traveled it at night years ago men and women had gone missing parts of them found at the side of the road chewed up we walked slowly met only two other people the robersons a silverhaired woman on a battered bicycle transporting green onions inside the basket bolted to the handlebars and her husband ten years younger riding another bike and hauling a homemade cart full of caged chicks on their way to town central mr roberson wore a gun but his was just for show i was the only person in fifty miles who still had bullets but no one knew that either except henry and steven steven kept his head down i forced myself to wave mrs roberson still a short distance away smiled and raised her hand and then glanced left to the young man at my side her front tire swerved she touched her feet to the road to stay upright but it was rough and she almost spilled her onions her husband caught up deliberately inserting himself between his wife and us he touched his gun and then they were gone passing pedaling down the road i stopped turning around to stare mr roberson looked back i felt a chill when i met his gaze amanda steven said what i replied distracted thinking about the farm and the land and those crops i would need help harvesting i thought about the pigs i wanted to buy and all the little things i needed that only town businessesbusinesses run by the amishcould provide im sorry he said and then even more quietly everyone is going to know my parents will have already told the church about henry and me we wont be able to stay here they think henry is dead doesnt matter you wont have it easy either i dont care i lied we got home a small part of me was glad to see it still standing cats waited at the gate several perched on the posts watching the woods and one of thema scarred bullnecked tomlay a dead mouse on my boot when i stopped to undo the lock and chain i thanked him with a scratch behind the ears and then nudged the small corpse into the grass steven did not talk to me he headed for the barn i didnt ask why i went into the house trying not to trip on cats and set my shotgun down on the kitchen table blinds had been pulled henry sat on the couch in the dark room he still wore the quilt kittens squirmed in his lap chewing the fingers of his right hand in his left he held a small heart carved from wood i wondered all these years where this had gone he said softly you could have asked maybe i was afraid of the answer he tore his gaze from the heart and looked at me you had it hidden under your mattress i tilted my head been going through my things it was an accident he said unconvincingly why was it there so i could touch it at night without having to see it i almost told him so i could remember watching your hands as you made it instead i said today went badly but we both knew it would henry stared down at the kittens i hoped otherwise i hesitated watching him wondering how so much had changed seemed too far in the pasttoo painfulbut i remembered in clear moments fishing on lost river eating corn fresh from the stalk under the blazing sun holding hands in secret while hiding under the branches of an oak during some spring storm we had loved being caught in storms i walked to the cellar door grabbed a candle off the shelf and lit the wick with the butane lighter down the stairs into the cold dark air shadows flickered some catshaped fleeting agile skipping across the cellar floor in and out of the light as they twined around my legs i passed crates of cabbage and potatoes and dried beef walked to a massive chest set against the wall and knelt in front of the combination lock a new shiny lock straight from the plastic part of a good trade from an elderly junk woman named trace who rode through a couple times a year cats butted their heads against my hips rubbing hard surrounding me with tails and purrs i opened the chest held up the candle so that i could see the boxes of bullets and guns wrapped in cloth two pistols one rifle one hundred boxes of ammunition twenty alone were for the shotgun making a total of two hundred shells my fathers stash he had been a careful man even before the big death and now i was a rich woman but not in any way i wanted to make public going to battle henry asked behind me make love not war i quoted my father and shut the chest nudging aside paws that got in the way i locked it onehanded and turned to face henry he still wore nothing but the quilt candlelight shimmered across his smooth chest and face his gaze was cold had been for years since the change been a while since i saw you without a beard i said i never could bring myself to shave it he replied softly i didnt want to look unmarried i tried to smile too bad ive heard youre a catch aside from an aversion to the sun and all the blood aside from that henrys own faint smile faded about today whatever happened im sorry talk to steven i walked to another metal chest this one unlocked inside clothes i set down the candle and pulled out my fathers jeans and a red flannel shirt musty old but no mice had been in them i fought back a sneeze and held out the clothing to henry he did not take them just stared youre a dead man i said bluntly to them youre dead wouldve been that way even if your father hadnt set you on fire you couldnt pretend forever his gaze was so cold that doesnt change who i am i tossed the clothing at his feet you changed years ago even before what happened in the woods youve just been slow to admit it i picked up the candle stoodand his fingers slid around my arm warm strong grip i closed my eyes wife he whispered i flinched dont call me that henry tried to pull me closer i wrenched my arm free spilling hot wax on the stone floor and myself cats scattered upstairs a door banged footsteps passed overhead i stopped moving so did henry my eyes burned with tears amanda steven called out from the cellar door henry coming i croaked stumbling toward the stairs henry grabbed my arm again and pressed his lips against my ear he whispered something but i couldnt hear him over the roar in my ears and my thudding heart not again i finally heard clearly what i mumbled but henry did not answer he let go and passed me i heard him say something to steven but that was nothing but a buzz and i pushed him aside running up the stairs from the darkness from him steven stood in the kitchen he had been crying his eyes were red same as his nose and cheeks he glanced from my face to henrywho appeared behind me at the top of the stairsand his expression twisted with grief or anger i could not tell i made a bed in the barn he said ill cook something i replied because it was the right thing to say and i couldnt think then well talk about where to put you the attic will be too cold in winter but so will the barn wont be here that long steven said not me not any of us i stared at him henry said steven but the young man gave us a look so hollow it chilled my bones he backed away across the living room to the front door whipping off his hat and crushing it in his hands i see what i see he said and then turned stumbling from the house henry started after him i grabbed his arm yanking hard sun i said i dont care henry replied harshly but stayed where he was staring at the door i did not let go my hand slid down his arm until our fingers entwined he squeezed hard what happened he whispered out there what changed us we were human amanda and then we werent were human i said just different dont be naïve he tried to pull away from me but this time i was the one holding on stubborn it wasnt our fault i told him everything was out of our control not everything he replied and grabbed the back of my neck i made a bad choice crawled on my stomach back to what was familiar and normal i should have stayed instead stayed for good instead of returning to you only when something was wrong something was wrong almost once a week i reminded him i pushed you away we both needed time and now this henrys fingers slid into my hair what do you want amanda nothing i told him youre here only because you have to be youre like a fox smoked out of its den secret marriage secret life youre good at pretending to be something youre not ask yourself what you want henry but dont ask me i pulled his hand off my neck and walked toward the front door he didnt stop me i escaped into the sunlight i walked through the fields and ate a tomato fresh from the vine biting into the red flesh like it was an apple i ate a carrot too and then some raw ripe corn but threw down the cob after only a few bites restless aching heartsick a man in my house a boy in my barn and the world beyond the fence threatening me now in more ways than the woods could harm me i stood on the border of my land staring over the fence at the dense shadows beyond the trees cats twined around my legs and climbed the boards and posts watching the woods youre not free i told myself holding still holding my breath it had always been henry who was caughtin his own lies his confusion his conflict before after and me trapped in limbo waiting not for him but for myself years waiting to wake up from the haze and bad dreams waiting for a little peace i had built my fortress guarded it with guns and blood told myself it would help bit by bit help only nothing had changed until now what do you want amanda a cat hissed i glimpsed movement deep in the woods a flash of white twisted around two dark spots and a moving hole i saw it again never still but always facing me restless and hungry i stood for a long time staring prickly with heat burning up burning hardly breathing caught trapped caught trapped two words that filled my head droning on and on until i forced myself to grab the fence fingers digging into the wood what do you want amanda i climbed the fence stopped halfway up swaying on the rails and then kept going relentless i jumped down on the other side the wrong side tasting blood as i bit my tongue cats followed yowling ears pressed flat against their skulls i ignored them and walked across the grass toward the woods this was my neighbors land but his house was far away on the hill i heard his dog barking i didnt know if the old man ever entered the woods but his nights were safe he had not been marked like meand henry and steven it was late afternoon sun leaning west lines of light falling away from the trees only a matter of time before the shadows grew thick and long my feet bumped catsspitting hissing growling catsbut i kept walking sweating heart thudding stomach hurting so badly i wanted to sit down and vomit instead i stood on the other side of sunlight a golden barrier bathing the grass between the woods and me less than a stones throw from the dense tangle of branches vines knotting together like awful fingers an undergrowth that seemed made to scratch and bind and close around bodies like barbed clawed nets forests had become strange places after the plaguenot just here i had heard and not just around the dead cities but everywhere made me wonder sometimes if there were others out in the world like me and henry and steven others like them i forced myself to look at the pale monster that waited in the shadows holding my breath as it licked the edges of its lipless mouth with a long pink tongue no eyelids hardly a nose just a stub that looked partially melted as though it had frozen in middrip off that ashen face we stared at each other years rolled memories i remembered the woods and the coarse laughter and the fear i still felt those hands on my body i felt naked again without my shotgun i know you i breathed tremblingand then again louder i know you doesnt matter how much youve changed i still know who you were before i picked up a cat hugging its quivering body against mine no purrs just a deepthroated growl i watched that monster in the woods tilt back its head cutting its cheeks as those long curved nails sank into its thin skin that pit of a mouth made a rasping sound like a sob yeah you cry i whispered scrubbing my wet cheeks with the back of my hand living for night so you can finish what you started but im not going to let you cats pushed hard against my legs reaching up to claw my thighs i backed away from the woods gaze locked on the monster branches broke somewhere deeper behind it and wet coughs hacked the air followed by a faint whine sun was sliding lower the cat in my arms struggled free hitting the ground with a hiss i continued to retreat never breaking that gaze though the terror crept on me harder and heavier with each slow step something building in my throata scream until finally my back hit the fence i climbed it flew over it tumbling over the rails and landing on my ass i sat there lightheaded heart pounding sweatsoaked my finger throbbed and so did my wrist i looked down blood seeped through the white bandage and dotted the end of my index finger which i had been nicking all day all my fingers were lightly scarred i looked through the rails the monster was gone but i heard wet coughs and the struggling movements of slowwaking bodies men rotting rising from their daygraves pushing aside leaves and brush ripping the sod pulled over their bodies cats gathered close i petted heads and tried to stand took several attempts my knees were weak and my skull throbbed but i made it sun was sitting pretty on the horizon i walked slowly staring at the land and the fence and those long rows of crops i had planted with my own hands for a moment it didnt seem real i should have been somewhere else i didnt know whereall id had were books and pictures from old magazines conversations with my parentsbut i knew there had been universities and jobs onceall kinds of work that needed doing and that had to be easier than growing food to stay alive the world had been smaller beforeand brighter faraway cities that took only hours to reach endless streams of music and artso much brilliant colorand those neverending aisles in pharmacies and grocery stores where nothing ever ran out and no one ever went hungry a world with laws and justice and safety where being a little different was not a black mark on the soul the big death had stolen away that simpler life i saw the house long before i reached it small white just a box beneath the golden haze of the sky red roses grew in massive bushes that surrounded the neat rows of my herb garden henry stood on the porch dressed in my fathers clothes they looked strange on himalmost as odd as seeing him bald without a beard i stopped walking caught differently than i had been earlier when facing the monsteranother kind of heartache he saw me standing on the hill and strode to the edge of the porch he held a knife and small block of wood which he pushed into his pocket sun was almost down but not quite and i was too far away to stop him as he walked down the steps smoke rose from his skin i started running henry did not return to the porch shadows he teetered but kept moving toward me walking then stumbling he fell before i reached him fire racing across his smoking scalp i barreled into his body rolling us both into the grass fire went out before we hit the grounda little patch hidden from the sunlight by a lowrising knoll i lay on henry anyway covering him pressing my hands against his partially charred face blisters formed on his scalp and his lips were pressed together in a tight white line of painbut he stared at me stared as if none of it matteredjust me and him me and him like the old days stupid i whispered sometimes you make me hate you i hate myself he said grimacing as i pulled my hands from his headtaking some of his burned skin with me it was disgusting i tried to sit up but he touched my face sliding his other arm around me he was stronger than i remembered and i closed my eyes holding my breath as he brushed his lips over mine brief warm i relaxed just a little and the next time he kissed me i kissed back henry pulled me down beside him i lay against his chest listening to his heartbeat the sky had darkened i saw the first hint of stars in the purple east purrs rumbled as cats pressed near settling warm against our bodies you were in braids he murmured my first memory of you sitting on a white sheet in braids and a dress playing with a doll my mother told me to look after you i remember that i remember other things i fingered a button on his flannel shirt maybe we didnt have vows ordained by any minister but we made promises to each other which i broke henry said quietly i failed you not just that night or afterbut all those years before when i loved you and never said a word to anyone you deserved better than that and now im supposed to be dead i unsnapped a button and slid my hand inside his shirt to press my palm against his bare skin above his heart henry stopped breathing fumbling for my hand he held it tightly against his chest youre not dead to me i said but i dont know what to do henry if i was a better man i would take steven and leave bitter laughter choked me and my eyes started burning again dont start doing the right thing now i dont think i could take it neither could i he whispered and reached into his pocket he pulled out the small block of wood i thought it must be a scrap from the stove bin he had started carving into it i could already see the promise of what it would become its not much yet he said turning it around in his large hands its going to be a heart i reached out and touched the edge lightly henry cleared his throat i wanted to make you a new one a warm ache filled my chest i tried to speak lost my voice then whispered dont take your time henry exhaled slowly closing his eyes i kissed the edge of his jawonce twice when i kissed him again he turned his head and caught my mouth with his gentle at first then harder his sharp teeth cut my lip i tasted blood he broke away i grabbed his jaw dont henry shuddered twisting out of my grip amanda he stopped looking sharply to the east a moment later i heard the neighbors dog begin to bark distant urgent cats scattered i sat up henry following meboth of us holding still listening theyve left the woods i said hunting henry made a small dissatisfied sound hunting just us ive always wondered why they never actively sought out other families if all they wanted was to kill i cut him off thats all they want he frowned but made no reply simply tilted his head as though listening to something beyond us wheres steven he asked suddenly we stared at each otherand i stumbled to my feet running toward the house i called stevens name he did not respond my shotgun was on the table where i had left it i grabbed the weapon and the fanny pack full of shells henry appeared in the doorway i took one look at his face and knew hes not here i said breathlessly belting the ammunition around my waist henrys expression darkened he turned and disappeared by the time i reached the porch he was already at the gate i followed running hard down the driveway cats bounded alongside me henry glanced over his shoulder his eyes glinting red in the shadows i almost slipped went downand he was there in a heartbeat holding me up steven must have gone home he hissed why i asked even as henry dragged me to the gate why would he do that to warn our parents to make certain the fence is locked just in case those creatures dont follow us here on his own dad always left the gate open at night steven and i were the ones who made certain it was shut you should have told them the truth i muttered i should have they wouldnt have listened instead of fumbling with the lock and chain henry climbed the fence straddled the topand reached down to pull me bodily over i held the shotgun tight across my chest cats followed over and under i was ready when i hit the ground my finger on the trigger listening for monsters in the dark i heard nothing not a breath or cough or the dragging slough of bellies on the road we ran henry was faster than me but i did not tire cats raced at my side i lost count of them they had never left the land before this night and i did not know why now they came with me the wind was soft so was the night and the light of stars behind thin veils of gathering clouds henry was pale and his legs so quickjust a blur i heard the screams a long time before we reached the farm henry made a strangled sound and burst ahead of me i lost sight of him in moments somewhere distant that dog was barking i ran harder i could hear the roar of my blood and feel it pulsing like fire beneath my skin my wrist throbbed so did my fingers i felt more heat when i finally saw the bontrager farm real fire licking the shadows climbing wild up the sides of the barn horses were screaming and so were children i could hear those young shrill voices and part of me kept waiting for them to cut out in the same way petepete had the same way i kept expecting my neighbors dog to stop barking strangled and choking caught dead the gate stood open blood pooled beside the road trailing into a smear that covered the broken concrete toward the woods i glanced at it but did not slow smoke cut across me burning my eyes and lungs i rubbed my tearing eyes coughing searching out those screaming children something large came at me all i saw were ragged remnants of clothes and a bloated white bellybut that was enough i braced myself and fired the shotgun the boom was thunderous and i turned my face as hot blood sprayed across my body some got on my lips i scrubbed my mouth with the back of my hand and skirted the writhing mass of white flesh bleeding out on the ground in front of me i found the children behind the farmhouse near the open doors of the storm cellar doors blocked by hulking creatures with curved spines and odd joints that kept them low to the ground bellies and knuckles dragging others drifted near but these were upright closer in appearance to the men they had been pale puffy with holes for eyes feces covered their naked bodies i could smell it even with the smoke rachel stood with her three little girlssobbing all of themholding that ax in her shaking hands samuel lay in the dirt at her feet bleeding from a head wound he kept trying to stand but his legs wouldnt work he looked dazed terrified but the creatures were not staring at them their focus was on henry he stood so still barefoot in the dirt firelight made his face shimmer golden and the red in his eyes was more animal than man more demon than animal come away he said to them kill me first and me i whispered tightening my grip on the shotgun dont lose your chance the creatures hesitated swayinguntil one of them upright and shaped like a manmade a low rasping moan and looked straight at me i knew that pitted gaze i had stared into it this afternoon and years before that heavy hungry gaze and that hungry searching mouth i gritted my teeth gripping the gun so tight my fingers hurt finish what you started i thought at the creature and took a deliberate step back you know what you want i stepped away again lowering the shotgun playing bait cats pressed against my legs growling henry slid toward me his hands open at his sides neither of us looked away from the creaturesmonsters oncemenstill men trapped in those bodies with those instincts that continued to be murderous and hateful but i thought our distraction would work i was certain of it until rachel moved it should have been nothing she lowered the ax so slowly but the blade flashed in the firelight and one of the creatures at the cellar door snapped its jaws at her she flinched crying outand her little girls sobs broke into startled screams everything shifted twistedmonsters turning inward toward themall those glittering teeth and long fingernails those bloated rippling faces with those tongues that protruded from stinking mouths to lick the rotting edges i never saw henry move but he suddenly stood between his mother and a sharp handhis teeth even sharper as he leaned in and ripped out the throat of the creature i ran to help him cats swarming ahead of meleaping upon those awful bodies to tear at them with their claws i heard screamsnot humanand jammed my shotgun against a shitencrusted stomach i pulled the trigger blood drenched me and guts i didnt look i moved on reaching into the fanny pack for shells my hands were hot slippery i loaded the shotgun glancing up in time to see henry stand over his wounded father and punch his fist through a distended chest his hand disappearing through broken ribs and emerging beside a curved spine the creature screamed flailing backward as blood poured from the wound i heard a sucking sound as henry yanked free he stood there so calmand slowly deliberately licked his arm clean i wondered if he knew what he was doing his expression was monstroustotally utterly merciless and i didnt care i loved him for it i turned shotgun jammed against my shoulder ready to fire but the monsters were retreating staggering toward the front gate i ran after them skidding on gravel and shot one in the back i tried to shoot another but missed henry didnt seem to notice he knelt beside his father samuel could barely hold up his head and his eyes were dazed wild i wondered how he had gone years without acknowledging that anything was wrong beyond the borders of his land when even others in his community had warned him to be careful at night his only excuse was those monstersthose changed menhad never been consistent weeks could go by without seeing one i surveyed the yard nothing else seemed a threat cats sat in the dirt fur raised growls rumbled from their throats corpses everywhere and the air stank rachel dragged her daughters close as she crouched beside samuel but she stared at henry and not her husband youre alive she whispered to him and i could not tell if that was fear or wonder in her voice he gave her a helpless look marred by the blood around his mouth on his clothing and hands im not he began and then stopped looking past his mother at me im sorry if i frightened you rachel looked down samuel stirred pushing weakly at henry get away he mumbled oh my god get away henry stared at him and then stood i moved close and when his hand sought mine i gave it to him rachel saw and looked at me deep and long steven i said where is he gone rachel replied softly and her face crumpled hes gone they took him first he tried to fight and they dragged him away and then they came for us i knew that some of her despair had nothing to do with her missing son rachel its not like before its over dont lie to me she whispered harshly clutching her belly finally meeting my gaze i recognized him he might have changed but i know him him i leaned back unable to break her gaze unable to stop remembering her face years ago ravaged with cuts and bruises same as mine mirrors should have disappeared with the rest of technology i had buried two of them behind my barn unable to stand seeing my eyes every time i walked down the hall or entered my bedroom well find him henry said tugging on my hand well bring him he stopped before he said home but rachel gave him a sharp look samuel seemed barely conscious no said his mother wrapping an arm around her daughters all of whom clung to one another weeping quietly no dont bring him here if you find him henrys jaw tightened rachel tore herself from her daughters and stood staring up at her son searching his eyes with cold resolve it doesnt matter that i love you it doesnt matter that i would forgive you anything theres no place for you here any of you rachel looked at me you wont be free if you stay i touched my throat felt like it was too tight to breathe i wanted to protest fight arguebut i couldnt even speak rachel swayed and turned away henry squeezed my hand staring at his mother we left them i could hear distant shouts the sounds of horses help coming the fire would be visible for miles even the nighttime reputation of this stretch of road wouldnt be enough to stop the neighbors henry and i stood at the front gate staring at the trail of blood that led into the woods he could be dead henry said you should stay here i reloaded the shotgun it took all my concentration i wanted to say something brave but couldnt speak so i looked at henry and he looked at me and when i lifted my face to him he kissed my cheek and then my mouth cats rubbed against our legs we entered the woods it had been three years maybe i expected snakes instead of vines or razor blades in place of leaves but everything that touched me was as it should be a soft tickle of brush the snag of thorns on my clothing and skin i was almost blind in the darkness and i was too loud i crashed through the woods crunching leaves and breaking branches like a wounded creature breath rasping henry moved in perfect silence and only when he touched me did i know he was close i can smell my brother he whispered and then i wish id had more time to explain you had years i touched trees to keep from tripping time runs out when i saw you tonight i couldnt imagine how you had pretended for so long to be like everyone else and i dont know how they were so blind not to see that youd changed easier to believe he said quietly easier to pretend than face the truth even when i had you and steven helping me adjust to my new instincts i kept thinking i could be something else if i prayed hard enough if i stayed with the old ways my fingernails scraped bark and i felt heat travel through my skin into my blood simmering into quiet firea sensation similar to knowledge the same that guided me when blessing fences the world is remaking itself i found myself saying men die forests swallow the cities and bones and what remains changes life always changes not like this henry replied not like us youre wrong i wanted to tell him but heard a low distant cough all the calm i had been fighting for disappeared i reached down nearly blind and cats trailed under my shaking hand when we found the clearing it didnt matter that i couldnt see well i felt the open space i looked up and saw stars and my teeth began chattering i gritted them together trying to stop but the chills that racked me were violent sickening henry grabbed me around the waist and pressed his lips into my hair im here he murmured think about what you told my mother its different this time i squeezed shut my eyes i didnt think id ever have to come back to this spot it cant be the same one i pushed henry away i shouldnt have visited you that night i should have run and hid when i heard your mother screaming he froze so did i and then he moved again reaching out fingers grazing my arm i staggered backward clutching the shotgun to my chest amanda he whispered im sorry i breathed ashamed im so sorry i said that but even as i spoke my throat burned aching and when i opened my mouth to draw in a breath a sob cut free soft broken cracking me open to the heart i bent over in such pain shuddering so hard i could not breathe henry touched me i squeezed shut my eyes fighting for control not now not now but my mouth opened and words vomited out whispers my voice croaking when they saw me when they chased me into the woods you and steven shouldnt have followed you knew you knew you were outnumbered that they had weapons if you had just stayed behind no he said hoarsely and then again stronger no his hands wrapped around my waist and then my chest and he leaned over my body in a warm unflinching embrace his mouth pressed against my ear i couldnt protect my mother and i couldnt protect you but i had to try nothing else mattered i sensed movement on the other side of the clearing cats hissed so did i struggling to straighten henry let go but stayed close bodies detached from the dense shadows some on two feet others crawling over the ground bellies tearing the undergrowth i raised the shotgun but did not fire one of them separated from the others tall bloated head those black eyes i knew him rachel had known him she was rightthere was something about the shape of his face the lean of his body still the same still him leader of the pack the woods were so quiet around us a dull silence like a muted bell i expected to see a flash of light or feel that old fire in my veins but nothing happened i expected to feel fear too but an odd calm stole over melike magic all my uncertainty melting into my hands holding the shotgun down my legs into the soles of my feet i took a deep breath and tasted clean air i heard a muffled groan henry flinched steven give him to us no one moved i forced myself to take a step and then another certain i would trip or freeze with fear but i didnt i made it across the clearing henry and the cats close at my side those small sleek bodies that crowded into the clearing like swift ghosts i stopped in front of him just out of arms reach that lipless mouth opened and closed and his black eyes never blinked i wasnt certain he had lids nor did i question why i could suddenly see him so clearly as though light shone upon his rotting face my finger tightened on the trigger i let out my breath slowly my heartbeat was loud i could feel my pulse my blood bones beneath my skin but i still did not fire and the creature in front of me stared and stared motionless i tried to remember what he had looked like when he was still a man but that face was a blur dead now all of us had died a little and become something new i heard another groan henry strode past me bodies stepped in his path he did not stop i heard a snarl and a ripping sound followed by splashing i smelled blood the creature in front of me never moved though the others behind him swayed unsteadily amanda henry called out hoarsely i tightened my grip on the shotgun and sidled sideways never taking my gaze from the leader the onceman a rasping growl rose from his throat but that was the only threat and none of the others came near me henry stood beside a massive tree a giant with a girth that reminded me of a small mountain rising fat and rough from the earth roots curled thick as my forearmcradling a body steven he was pale wastedand bleeding so much blood dripping down his skin into the soil as though he was feeding the tree maybe he was i heard a sucking sound in the roots and when henry bent to pick up his brother i grabbed his shoulder stopping him watch our backs i murmured all the hairs on my neck standing up as i knelt beside steven and set down my shotgun the boys chest jerked with shallow rasping breaths his fingers twitching in a similar rhythm his wrists had been cut open as had his chest and inner thigh cats sniffed his body ears pressed flat my palms tingled i almost touched him but stopped at the last minute and laid my hand against the tree i didnt know what i was doing or why but it felt right or not a shock cut through me like static on woolbut with more pain deep inside my skull i tried to pull away but my muscles froze and when i attempted to call for henry my throat locked this is what you want whispered a voice reverberating from my brain to my bones this is what you need a torrent of images flashed through my mind open human mouths screaming echoing in the air of stone streets bordered by towers made of steel and glass men and women staggering falling slumped in stiff decaying piles as blood and rotting juices flowed between cracks in the road or in grass upon the roots of trees that grew in shady patches bodily fluids watering the earth heat exploded in my chest i could move again i grabbed awkwardly at stevens clothes hauling him off those roots henry helped my muscles were weak so was my stomach i leaned sideways gagging cats pressed close dozens surrounding me amanda he said i shook my head use your shirt to wrap his wounds we need to stop the bleeding he did as i asked but glanced over his shoulder at the pale bloated bodies waiting so still in the shadows what about them i hardly heard his question i stared at the spot where steven had been sprawleda cradle made of rootsand suffered the weight of all those trees bearing down on me as though full of watchful eyes and watchful souls and mouths that could speak stevens blood was invisible against the bark but i felt its presence something changed us that night i thought and those oncemen stirred as though they heard coughs and quiet groans making me cold they had laughed before laughed and shouted and sung little ditties and made hissing sounds between their teeth horror swelled inside memindnumbing screaming horror that i was here with them againbut i fought it down struggling to regain that spectral calm that had stolen over me henry touched my shoulder we can go steven hung over his shoulder like a dirty rag doll i picked up the shotgun but did not stand i held up my finger give me blood he hesitated glancing wildly at the monsters surrounding us i knew what he was thinking any minute now they would attack any minute they would try to rip us to pieces and feed on our bodies as in life so now in this twilight death i didnt understand why they waitedthough i had a feeling please i whispered henrys jaw tightened his gaze cold hardbut he leaned forward and bit my finger blood welled i touched the tree and went blind lost in total darkness i could feel the sharp tangle of vines beneath me and hear henry breathinglistened with a sharp chill to wet rasping coughsbut those sounds sensations might as well have been part of another world another world whispered a voice we are more than we were my finger throbbed i bowed my head pressure built in my stomach rising into my throatnausea but worse like my guts were going to void through my mouth instead of vomit my vision returned i saw those dead bodies again endless mountains of corpses sprawled on stone streets and the sunthe sun rising between towers glowing with crisp golden light beautiful morning with clouds of flies buzzing over blood that was still not dry we were born from this said the voice which i felt now in my teeth in my spine and ribs blood that killed made us live time shifted again i witnessed blood and the fluids from those decaying bodies flow and settle feeding the roots of grass and weeds and the trees that grew from stone inside the dead city i felt a pulse sink beneath the streets into soil and spread i felt heat a rushing sensation surrounded meas though i was being thrust forward like a giant fist was grinding itself between my shoulder blades faster faster and all around me inside me i felt a surge of growthmy veins bursting beyond my skin branching like roots bleeding blood into the darkness blood that became a forest a forest that swallowed a city many forests i thought every city swallowed and the blood spread whispered the voice the blood changed us all as it changed you i slammed down on my hands and knees as though dropped from a great distance fire throbbed beneath my skin a white light burning behind my eyes i remembered that night naked and bleeding on the groundhenry screaming my name steven sobbing both of them beaten bloodyand i remembered i remembered a terrible heat i remembered thinking the men had set me on fire that i would look down and find my skin burning with flames we tasted all your blood whispered the voice we tasted a change that needed waking so wake and feed us again i opened my eyes i could not see at first but the shadows coalesced and became men and trees and small furred bodies growling quietly my hand was still pressed to the bloodslick roots of the tree and something hummed in my ears i felt out of body drifting when i looked at henry i saw bloodand when i looked at the monsters who had been monsters too while they were men i also saw blood blood infected blood changed by something i still didnt understand the trees are alive i thought and felt like a fool the leader of the pack shuffled forward and dragged his clawed fingers over his face with a gapemouthed groan he cut himself so deeply that blood ran down his skin and dripped from his bloated cheek i heard it hit the ground with a sound as loud as a bell and i imagined beneath my hand a pleasurable warmth rise from the bark of the tree henry i said raggedly without breaking the gaze of the pack leader the first and last man who had held me down so many years ago henry put steven down youre going to need your hands amanda he whispered but i ignored him and picked up the shotgun i settled it against my shoulder my finger caressing the trigger and looked deep into those black lidless eyes feed us again i heard rising through me as though from the earth itself all we want is to be fed again i hated that voice i hated it so badly but i could deny it like instinct stronger than knowledge like my blood on the fence or henry burned by sunlight we had been changed in ways i would never understand but could only follow you know what youre doing i said to the creature which stood perfectly still bleeding staring waiting you know what you want what it had wanted all these years i realized living halfdead hungry for peace listening to voices that wanted to be fed like me but in a different way so i pulled the trigger and finished it i never did buy those pigs i found someone outside the amish who would trade with me and bargained for horses good strong clydesdales almost seventeen hands high four of them i had to travel a week to reach the man who bred them and all he wanted was four boxes of bullets we left at the end of summer no one bothered us but no one talked to us either we were alone on the hill though people watched from a distance as steven and i took down the fence board by board and used each rail to build the walls of two wagons real walls real roofs windows with solid shutters i had seen abandoned rvs and always admired the idea of a movable home even if it was something i had never imagined needing what we built was crude but it would keep the sunlight out we left at the end of summer i wrote a note and left it on the last post standing my land free for the taking i drove one wagon while steven handled the other one of them was filled with foodeverything we could store and canand the other held henry and our few belongings the goats followed without much prodding cats were good at herding when asked politely anyway henry rode in my wagon he had a bed behind the wall at my back and a hollow pipe he spoke through when he wanted to talk after a day or two i tied a long red ribbon around my wrist and trailed it through the pipe henry would tug on it when he wanted me to imagine our hands touching do you dream of them he asked one day his voice muffled as it traveled through sawedoff steel it was sunny and warm and birds trilled voices tangled in sweet wild music pasture land surrounded us but beyond the tall grass i saw the dark edge of a forest i looked at it as i would a narrowed eyewith caution and an edge of fear we had traveled more than a hundred miles which i knew because we followed old roads on my fathers maps and we calculated distances every evening around the fire i dream i said tell me you dont i cant he said quietly i still taste their blood and it makes me afraid because i feel nothing no regret no sorrow i pray all the time to feel sorrow but i dont my heart is cold when i remember murdering them and then i feel hungry sometimes i felt hungry too but in a different way i hungered to be back inside the forest bleeding for the trees hoping that they would give me knowledge again more answers not just why we had been changed but why we had been changed in so many different ways i told myself that the virus that had caused the big death had affected more than humans i told myself that maybe we had all been infected but some had livedlived ripe for some new evolution i told myself i was a fool that it didnt matter that i was alive starting a new life i told myself too that i was a killer i tugged on the ribbon and he tugged back do you feel cold when you think of protecting your parents and steven or me no he said never then youre fine i replied i love you henry was silent a long time does that mean you forgive me i closed my eyes and pulled the ribbon again there was nothing ever to forgive from the second wagon behind us i heard a shout steven i pulled hard on the reins untied the ribbon from my wrist and jumped down the cats that had been riding on the bench beside me followed i took the shotgun steven stood on the wagon bench still holding the reins fading scars crisscrossed his face and throat and his bared wrists were finally looking less savaged pale gaunt but alive he still wore his plain clothes and straw hat unable to let go if he was anything like his brother it would be yearsor maybe never his gaze as he stared over my head was farseeing someone will be coming soon he said someone important i stared down the road all i saw was a black bird winging overhead a crow i watched it an odd humming sound in my ears cats crowded the road surrounding the bleating goats i couldnt count all their numberstwenty or thirty i thought we seemed to pick up new ones every couple of days one of the windows in my wagon cracked open henry said are we in trouble not yet i replied but tightened my grip on the gun steven we dont need to hide steven murmured staring up at the crow staring though i wasnt entirely certain he saw the bird shes coming i didnt question him steven had become more enigmatic since that night in the woodsthat second bloody night or maybe he had stopped fighting the change that had come over him all those years before clear day but after a while i heard thunder a roar faint at first and then stronger ripping through the air i couldnt place it at first though finally i realized that it reminded me of the military caravans a gas engine a black object appeared at the end of the road narrow and compact sunlight glittered on chrome it took me a moment to recognize the vehicle i had seen only pictures i couldnt remember its name though i knew it had two wheels like a bicycle and that it was fast none of the cats scattered i steadied myself as the machine slowed stopped dug in my heels didnt matter that steven seemed unafraid i had no trust in the unknown a woman straddled the thing dark hair wild eyes her jeans and shirt looked new which was almost as odd as her gaspowered machine i saw no weapons thoughand was comforted by the sharp look she gave me as though she too had no trust your name is amanda she said i held steady made no reply watched waited the woman frowned but only with her eyes a faint smile quirked the corner of her mouth im maggie she added and tapped her forehead i saw you coming steven jumped down from the wagon i stepped in front of him but he tried to push past me and choked out are you like us high in the sky the crow cawed maggie glanced up at the bird and her smile softened before she returned her gaze to me and the boy no she said youre new blood im from something older i dont understand what that means i told her she shook her head rubbing her jaw itll take time to explain but there are others like you changed people ive seen them in my dreams im trying to find as many as i can to bring them someplace safe safe echoed henry from behind the wagon door maggie glanced sideways but didnt seem surprised to hear someone speaking the crow swooped close and landed on her shoulder cats made broken chattering sounds golden eyes locked on the bird something is coming said maggie reaching around to place a cautious hand on the crows sleek back i dont know what but we need to be together as many of us as possible i stared feeling the cut of her words cut like truth i knew it in my blood but i held my ground and said youre crazy amanda henry said and i edged sideways to the back of the wagon wife he said again more softly for my ears only what did we run from before and what are we running toward now possibilities i whispered pressing my brow against the hammered fence rail dotted with my blood i touched the wooden heart hanging from a delicate chain around my neck all those frightening possibilities i was never scared of loving you he murmured but i was a coward with the rest i dont want to be that man again and i didnt want to be that woman i scratched my fingers against the wagon door and turned back to look at steven who gave me a slow solemn nod i stared past him at the forestsilent and waiting and full of power power it had given usand maybe others i leaned against the wagon feeling henry on the other side of the wall strong in the darkness my blood hummed jacqueline carey jacqueline carey is a new york times bestselling fantasyromance novelist best known for her

promise between starcrossed lovers down through the generationsone with quite a high price in blood you and you alone dying is an ugly business i am dying anafiel delaunay born anafiel de montrève when i am dead they will call me the whoremaster of spies this i know and i deserve it there is blood too much blood i cannot count my wounds i only know it flows without ceasing and the world grows dark before my eyes pain is everywhere i failed and we have been betrayed attacked in my own home gods there were so many of them while i honored my oath honored the request the dauphine ysandre made of me and turned my attention to intrigue beyond the shores of terre dange so that she might wed her beloved alban prince i missed a dire threat closer to home my beautiful boy alcuin is dead or dying i cannot tell my vision is fading and i cannot hear him i told myself i was honoring my oath when i raised him and made him a member of my own household but i lied to myself i trained him and used him for my own ends he and phèdre both like a fool i failed to see that the work didnt suit him as it did her that alcuin took no pleasure in naamahs service in being an object of desire for the nobles of terre dange and yet he forgave me and loved me anywaya love far greater than i deserved i had forgotten that life could hold such sweetness even so i will fail him one last time here at the end as the darkness grows thicker there is only one man toward whom my thoughts turnone man loved lost and eternally mourned my lips shape his name and a faint whisper escapes me rolande i remember a day before i was to depart to begin my studies at the university of tiberium my fostersister edmée was nowhere to be found in the manor of rocaille but i knew her habits well enough to guess where she had gone and i rode out in search of her sure enough a half hours ride from the manor i spotted her mare tethered outside a lavender field idly cropping grass i tethered my own mount nearby and plunged into the field on foot the sun was high overhead hot enough that sweat began to trickle down the back of my neck i plaited my hair into a braid and persevered trudging past fragrant rows of lavender humming with honeybees until i came upon edmée lying on her back in the dusty soil arms folded behind her head eyes closed her face turned to the sun good day nearbrother she murmured without opening her eyes i sat beside her how did you know it was me she shaded her brow with one hand and peered at me no one else would have thought to look for me here you pay attention to things no one else does i studied her lovely face trying to gauge her mood are you angry with me for leaving me here she inquired or for agreeing to serve as my panderer to prince rolande a sharp comment from edmée was a rarity and i felt myself flush with anger if you dont want no no she sat up with alacrity reaching out to take my hand im sorry anafiel youre doing a service to the family and im grateful for it its just i dont know how i feel about being used to advance my fathers ambition she squeezed my hand searching my eyes i need you to be my advocate too i trust you if you think rolande de la courcel is someone i could come to love i will believe you but if you dont she shook her head i cannot wed a man i could never love heir to the throne or no never i assured her all traces of resentment fled i had known edmée de rocaille since we were children even as a girl she had a sweetness of spirit i had quickly learned to cherish and she was truly as dear as a sister to me dearer mayhap since i had no blood siblings of my own i promise if i dont find the dauphin to be kind generous wise warmhearted and perfect in every way not a word of pandering shall escape my lips edmée laughed well you might allow him a minor flaw or two he is allowed to be human oh no i said seriously perfect in every way for you i insist on it she eyed me fondly ill miss you i leaned over to kiss her cheek ill miss you too edmée tugged my hand lie with me here a moment and look at the sky when were apart and missing one another we can look at the sky and remember that the same sun shines on us both i obeyed the sky was an intense vivid blue the scent of lavender hung all around us so strong it was almost intoxicating mingling with the scent of sunwarmed earth the buzzing of the industrious honeybees was hypnotic making me drowsy closing my eyes i reveled in the feel of the sun on my skin thinking how much i would miss terre dange between my childhood at montrève and the seven years id been fostered at rocaille id lived all my life here in siovale province i couldnt imagine calling anyplace else home the beginnings of a poem a classic siovalese ode to the landscape teased at my thoughts do you think youll like him edmée murmured prince rolande i dont know i said they say hes highspirited i cracked open one eye and peered at her and handsome edmée smiled i hope he likes poetry i hope so too was i truly that innocent and carefree in those days yes i suppose i was remembering hurts prince rolande de la courcel the dauphin of terre dange did not like poetry i discovered this in a tiberian bathhouse approximately one hour before the recital that was meant to be my introduction to the dauphin my journey to the city of tiberium in the allied nationstates of caerdicca unitas had been long but uneventful i was accompanied by my tutor leon degrasse a gifted poet in his own right and a skilled diplomat who had long served the comte de rocaille once we arrived in tiberium he quickly secured appropriate lodgings hired a small staff to see to our needs enrolled me in the universitys curriculum and arranged the aforementioned recital down to choosing the verses i was to recite and the elegant poets robe i was to wear id developed an affinity for poetry early and was reckoned something of a prodigy even by dangeline standards my youthful body of work spanned a dozen styles many in the classic siovalese mode many others aping the work of poets before me and a few seeking to find my own voice messire degrasse gauged it best if i stuck to the classical forms and so it was that an hour before the event i luxuriated in the ministrations of the most skilled barber in tiberiums most prestigious bathhouse a warm damp linen towel draped over my face running through verses in my mind while the barber combed and trimmed my hair oiled my skin and buffed my nails with a pumicestone there i heard them enter but i paid no heed until one spoke folk were always coming and going in the bathhouse oh damn my luck a mans voice said in caerdicci then switched to dangeline cant you pull rank for once rolande id my heart set on a rubdown and a trim before this damned recital beneath the towel i startled isnt the point of this whole tiberian experience to teach me to understand the common mans concerns a goodnatured voice replied in dangeline behold the suffering of an ordinary citizen forced to wait his turn others laughed the first man grumbled theres no time to wait your highness are you quite sure we must attend sadly yes the princes goodnatured voice turned dry politics someone else said politics the prince agreed tonights prodigy is a fosterson of house rocaille handpicked by the comte father of the allegedly fair edmée possessor of strong ties to the royal line of aragonia and if i must suffer through this tedium so must my loyal companions you know what its going to be the other complained elua have mercy how often have you suffered through the like at court rolande some calfeyed siovalese lordling swanning around in fine silk robes his hair strewn about his shoulders droning on about springfed mountain lakes dreaming of meadows and tall nodding flowers oh yes fulsome heads bent tenderly on their slender stalks laughter rang in the bathhouse i gritted my teeth fighting a rising tide of humiliation and anger i know i know the princes voice was sympathetic and there was the sound of a hand clapping on a shoulder courage gaspar we shall endure as soon as their footsteps receded i sat upright flinging the damp towel away from me and scrambling for my clothes for your trouble i said to the barber fumbling for my purse and pressing coins into his hand he stared after me as i fled the bathhouse pelting through the streets of tiberium and arriving at our rented villa sweating and furious messire de montrève leon stared at me wideeyed as i tore through my clothes press ignoring the fine robe of green silk laid out on my bed what in the world is wrong a change of plans i said grimly hauling out a plain cambric shirt and my hunting leathers they would have to do i donned them in haste leaving the laces of the vest undone yanking at the fine fabric of the shirt to rend it i slung my sword belt with its gentlemans blade around my hips fastening the buckle anafiel no my tutor sounded horrified the senator may be appalled i finished twining my long hair into a plait and knotting it at the nape of my neck in a rough soldiers club but he is merely our host messire degrasse it is the dauphin i seek to impress or at the least not to bore senseless i glanced in the mirror trust me after a reluctant moment he nodded good ah gods you were so ready to dismiss me out of hand rolande and i was so unwilling to be dismissed mayhap it would have been better if id let it happen if i hadnt been so fierce and stubborn and insistent better for you better for me better for edmée to be sure i loved her as a sister and i will never cease to regret what befell her and yet i loved you i loved you so very very much and does not blessed elua himself bid us love as thou wilt i did gods help me i did in the study next to the dining salon i paced and ran through lines of the piece id chosen in lieu of messire degrasses selections aware of the murmur of voices exchanging pleasantries in the background of the sound of wine being poured as the prince and his guests fortified themselves against the tedium to come the thought fed my righteous indignation and i channeled my ire into the performance when senator vitulus introduced me i stepped forth to a polite smattering of applause it died quickly as they took in my unlikely appearance i identified prince rolande by the choice couch accorded to him and the description id been given his black hair hung loose save for two slender braids at either side caught back in a silver clasp strong brows were arched over dark blue eyes he had a generous mouth made for smiling but at the moment his wellshaped lips were parted in surprise i locked gazes with him shame my lord i uttered the opening words of the poem in a low agonized tone the dauphins high cheekbones flushed with unexpected anger and a shocked whisper ran around the room oh shame shame a thousandfold shame that you should dishonor your fathers name thusly one of the princes companions half rose from his couch the prince stilled him with a gesture his gaze not shifting from mine his mouth had closed and the line of his jaw was taut out of the corner of my eye i saw messire degrasse wince ignoring everyone but the prince i took a deep breath and continued ah my lord will you dishonor even my death for i say to you there is no honor in this vengeance you have taken this day in the battered and torn flesh of one who was a prince of troy bold and shining hector slain and dragged behind your victorious chariot rendered fodder for scavengers by your ignoble deed the hard line of the princes jaw eased on his couch he leaned forward his eyes lit with interest and curiosity i recited the piece in its entirety without ever breaking our locked gazes the others took it for a conceit a part of the performance a story out of an ancient hellene tale the ghost of patroclus rebuking his beloved achilles with me casting the dauphin in the latter role indeed id meant it to be nothing more and yet it was id had my work admired and praised but i had never known the sheer exhilaration of captivating a reluctant listener id chosen this piece for prince rolande and prince rolande alone i was reciting it to him and him alone it forged a bond between us as his face broke into a delighted grin my heart soared i let my voice take on a fiercer edge and i reveled in the sparkling approval i saw in his eyes when i finished the prince was the first to applaud taking to his feet his companions followed shouting praise i bowed deeply feeling as though id run a long race prince rolande came toward me well done anafiel de montrève id no idea poetry could be so stirring i bowed again my thanks your highness call me rolande his mouth quirked i am meant to be but a humble student here i gazed at his face the proud highboned features call me anafiel and at the risk of seeming importunate i daresay humble is a word seldom applied to you my lord rolande he laughed extending one hand ah mayhap any mind well done and well met i clasped his hand and felt his grip harden in the subtle way that men do when taking one anothers measure his hand was firm and callused clearly more familiar with a sword hilt than a scholars stylus i narrowed my eyes at him ever so slightly and tightened my own grip shifting my feet unobtrusively to settle into a siovalese wrestling stance rolande felt it and gave me a bright hard smile happy to find me equal to his implicit challenge will you share my couch for dinner this evening i suspect we have much to discuss i smiled back at him with pleasure oh edmée im sorry so sorry dying i find there are so many people living and dead to whom i owe apologies edmée alcuin mayhap even that bitch isabel lenvers all the gentry whose trust i have betrayed these long years while i have played the role of the whoremaster of spies phèdre my last pupil my anguissette all unwitting of the stakes of the game we play kushiels chosen on whom my dying hope rests i can only thank the gods that she was not here today and pray that she survives and yet would i have done anything differently no mayhap i dont know what did i know of love i was eighteen and i knew nothing i was dangeline id been instructed in the arts of pleasure id had casual dalliances here and there like any young nobleman i knew nothing but then neither did rolande there are those who think blessed elua is a gentle god but love is not a gentle thing it is urgent and insistent and it will not be denied it will level cities to attain its goal or destroy lives that night the first night at the senators villa rolande and i shared a couch and spoke of desultory things poetry academics gossip from home we did not address my true purpose in coming to tiberium i was glad i didnt want to speak of edmée to him not yet selfishly i wanted to keep this moment to myself when leon degrasse glowered at me i ignored him all the while two unspoken things lay between us the first of course was edmée and the comte de rocailles ambitions the second was the spark of undeniable attraction that had ignited between us casting a vast shadow over the other matter rolande did not flaunt his interest but neither did he try to hide it even though tiberian culture was more rigid than ours and did not look kindly on dalliances between men the desire in his gaze was frank and open firing my blood making the torches brighter and the wine sweeter never before had i thought to wonder why poets speak of falling in love that night i began to understand i felt as though id stepped off a high precipice the moment that i locked gazes with rolande de la courcel and i was sinking steady toward unknown depths the very ground beneath me felt unsteady i wanted gods wanted to kiss his generous mouth the line of his jaw wanted to slide my hands up his strong arms to feel the muscles working in his broad shoulders i wanted to take him up on that subtle challenge to pit my strength against his our naked bodies straining and wrestling together until one of us surrendered and the other claimed a sweet victory instead we made polite conversation until it was time to leave bidding our host a gracious farewell outside the villa the princes companions called to him badgering him to honor a pledge hed made will you renege on your word your highness one of them asked smoothly the fairhaired barquiel lenvers heir to a powerful namarrese duchy brother to isabel lenvers another contender for the princes hand in marriage i did not care for the dismissive way his gaze skated over me theres a first time for everything i suppose no rolande retorted stung of course not he gave me an apologetic glance i promised them a visit to tiberiums finest brothel such as it is in exchange for his voice trailed away i raised my brows enduring an evening of tedium he grinned well yes you exceeded expectations nonetheless i do keep my word come with us i wanted to say no id no desire to visit some tiberian brothel where the art of pleasure was treated as mere commerce not a sacred calling i opened my mouth and said of course would i have done anything differently no i couldnt have the brothel could have been worse but it could have been better too it catered to a dangeline clientele within the city i endured an endless parade of dancing girls and tittering catamites with kohllined eyes many found patrons among the princes companions starved for a taste of the luxury and licentiousness of home rolande nudged me with his hip bumping against the scabbard of my gentlemans sword you look disapproving young siovalese country lordling i shook my head not disapproving no its just i shrugged there is nothing sacred in their calling nothing sacred here no his dark blue eyes met mine nothing i swallowed hard my throat suddenly thick ah well as to that my lord i didnt know what to say if he had been anyone else i would have laughed and clasped the back of his neck yanking him down for a hard kiss honoring naamahs gift of desire countrybred or no id lived a life of privilege but he was the dauphin of terre dange and he outranked me by many many degrees i should not do this should not even think it he laughed softly deep in his chest then leaned over his lips close to my ear his breath warm ive kept my word lets go knowing i should say no knowing i should refuse i went with him nonetheless outside the night air was crisp and fresh i breathed deeply feeling the effects of wine and desire six guards in the livery of house courcel flanked us discreetly escorting us to the princes rented villa later i came to know the villa well that night i paid scant heed to it following rolande as he led me to its innermost chamber where the household staff had hastily lit many tapers there his callused hands cupped my face anafiel de montrève i grasped his taut sinewy wrists holding him at bay even though the time to refuse was long past rolande de la courcel his teeth gleamed in the candlelight shadows pooling in his eyes are we making love or war my warriorpoet i tightened my grip on his wrists brushing his lips with a kiss both with a swift decisive move rolande hooked one foot behind my right leg tugging me off balance and tumbling me toward the bed but i had anticipated it and i twisted my body sideways landing atop him and pinning his arms point to me i informed him taking advantage of the situation to kiss him again harder this time his full firm lips parted beneath mine i eased my grip on his wrists exploring his mouth with my tongue tentatively at first then with increasing hunger he tasted like wine sweet and heady strong and sure rolande flipped me over reversing our positions his legs trapping mine in a scissorlock point to me is this how siovalese country boys make love then he asked me his black hair hanging around his face i could feel the weight of his body holding me in place the hard length of his erect phallus pressing against mine beneath his breeches it was unbearably arousing sometimes he grinned and kissed me i like it we were well matched rolande and i he was taller and stronger but not by much i was quicker and more agile but not by much we played at wrestling stealing points and kisses until it was no longer a game until there were no victors or losers only the urgent drive to remove clothing to feel skin sliding against skin slick with sweat i kissed his bare chest bit and sucked his small hard nipples reveling in his groan of pleasure in the feel of his hands hard on the back of my head freeing my hair from its soldiers club i want you his voice was harsh and ragged his phallus throbbing in my fist there was no trace of humor in his words only raw demand and his eyes had gone deadly serious all of you a flare of gilded brightness and surety filled me so vivid i imagined i could see it reflected in rolandes pupils i am yours i heard myself say the unknown depths claimed me i would that dying brought clarity did blessed elua have some purpose in joining our hearts together in one swift lightning bolt of a night i want to believe it i have always wanted to believe it even after rolandes death even after i embarked on a path i half despised i believed it it is hard to believe now still i try in the aftermath of love i was selfconscious my body was ringing like a welltuned bell shivering with pleasure and i wanted nothing more than to sink into sleep tangled in linens beside the prince in his warm bed but he was the dauphin of terre dange and i did not know the protocol for this situation id been sent to woo him on edmées behalf not bed him on my own a canker of guilt gnawed at me stay gazing at me with halflidded eyes rolande saw my uncertainty he ran a few strands of my hair through his fingers russet he yawned like a foxs pelt you put me in mind of autumn stay i drew a line down his sculpted torso his fair skin the color of marble warmed by candlelight truly id cast him well as achilles rolande you felt it too he didnt ask what i meant i felt it the moment you stormed into the salon and charmed me into enjoying poetry eluas hand is in this you know why im here it wasnt a question id heard him say as much in the bathhouse sleep he rolled over and kissed me well talk on the morrow i slept in the morning everything was different the world was different i was different a spark of the brightness id felt the night before lingered within me tinting everything with a golden glow gods help me i was in love everything about rolande delighted me the way he smiled sleepily at me upon waking his face creased with pillow marks the breadth of his shoulders the shape of his hands his long legs and the muscles of his flanks the obvious affection he had for his household staff and the equally obvious way in which it was reciprocated he had an open easygoing manner about him which nonetheless managed to retain an element of royal dignity so he said at the table where we broke our fast with crusty bread drizzled with honey tell me anafiel de montrève why should i wed edmée de rocaille coached by my ambitious fosterfather i had a considerable array of compelling arguments at my disposal i abandoned them all frankly im not sure i can answer it surprised him why i shrugged you know the advantages as well as anyone your highness his mouth quirked rolande i flushed rolande marriage to edmée brings an alliance with the house of aragon and the promise of a strong ally on our southern border but i am here on her behalf too i promised her i would not press house rocailles suit unless i thought you were a man she could love he was silent a long moment you find me unworthy too worthy i said softly how can i advocate for edmée feeling what i feel today i have compromised myself i paused or do i attach too much significance to the matter no rolandes reply was swift and firm no but he leaned back in his chair gazing at the ceiling i dont have the luxury of choosing anafiel i am my fathers only child his sole heir no matter what i will i must wed and carry on my bloodline blessed elua says otherwise i murmured blessed elua was a god not a kings son he said dryly he had no concern for mortal politics i would not have you break edmées heart i swallowed i would not break her heart rolande studied me are you in love with her i shook my head i love her like a sister i too am an only child edmée is the nearest thing to a sibling i have she and her young brother david is she worthy of me stung i shot him a fierce glance of you or any man your highness i would not be here if she were not peace my warriorpoet rolande said in a mild tone raising his hands i suggest you counsel her honestly his broad shoulders rose and fell in a helpless shrug it may not be the course diplomacy recommends but i think it is the best one nonetheless you were right rolande but you were wrong too if the world had been a different place a kinder gentler place in which all of us obeyed eluas precept everything might have been different it wasnt you were too good for this world you and edmée alike i wrote honestly to edmée she wrote honestly in reply her letters tinged with affectionate dismay my father sent you to court a royal bridegroom for me and you seduce him instead either you found him so lacking you seek to protect me or so perfect you must keep him for yourself which is it anafiel meet him and decide for yourself i wrote to her so i shall in time she wrote in reply how can i not be intrigued by a man bold enough to capture your heart if there is room for both of us in his i can imagine far worse fates nearbrother those words freed me from the shackles of guilt that weighed at me freed me to enjoy my time in tiberium with rolande the weeks that followed the arrival of edmées second letter were some of the happiest i had known days were consumed with study nights were filled with revelry and love with the exception of barbtongued barquiel lenvers rolandes companions regarded our relationship well enough and i formed friendships with several of the others even the tiberians and the university masters were reasonably tolerant won over by rolandes good nature it was maestro gonzago de escabares an aragonian historian who began calling me antinous after the name of a young man who was once the beloved of a tiberian imperator the nickname spread and was meant more affectionately than not and then things changed again in the late days of autumn the great rhetorician master strozzi made me a most unusual offer young antinous he said to me in his private study stroking his beard you are in a position to provide a service of untold value for your prince rolande there is but one price you can never ever speak of it to him i stared at him in outright astonishment what in the world do you mean master strozzi lifted one hand in a portentous gesture i can speak no more unless you swear on rolandes life that it will never leave these walls i shook my head rejecting the offer without a thought no we keep no secrets from one another he and i he shrugged and lowered his hand as you wish be advised that you speak of this meeting at your peril and his that night i told rolande of the extraordinary conversation he heard me out patiently and when i had finished he said i think you ought to take him up on it i stared at him too are you mad think on it rolande said he takes a conspirators tone if there are those who seek to use you to get at me best to learn it now easier to avoid the serpent in the path before you than the asp at your heel the following day i begged another audience with master strozzi and told him id had a change of heart he listened impassively to me his hands folded on his desk you are here at the princes bidding i opened my mouth to deny it and he forestalled me with one lifted finger his gaze flinty did you imagine for one instant i did not know exactly what you would do when i made the offer weve had our eye on you ever since prince rolande left the brothel with you at my startled reaction a hint of a smile curled his lip ah yes it was noted whores make some of the best spies my skin prickled who is we master master strozzi rose from his desk and paced hands clasped behind his back who indeed we are everyone and no one we are everywhere and unseen did you think my warning in jest it is a simple matter to slip poison in someones food how well do you know prince rolandes household staff i didnt answer my thoughts racing oh of course you could dismiss them all he said following my unspoken thoughts even the cook whos known him since he was a babe but who would you hire to replace them who can you trust you are threatening the dauphin of terre dange i whispered in shock it is a dire business i will go to the ambassador his smile widened i am a respected scholar who would believe such a thing no one in a position to help you he waved one hand any mind i am not threatening the prince now that you understand what is at stake i am restating my offer to you he leaned over me youre a quickthinking young man observant too we can teach you to hone those skills the better to serve the prince would you like to be able to anticipate a mans actions as surely as i anticipated yours he paused to let the words sink in pricking my curiosity to read a mans thoughts on his face to catch a lie before its spoken at what price i asked master strozzi gave an eloquent shrug only your silence you will return to prince rolande and tell him that i offered to counsel you in the art of selling access to royalty bending a sympathetic ear to select causes for coins then you will begin your true lessons in the arts of covertcy easier to avoid the serpent in the path before you than the asp at your heel i made my choice i will do it was it the right choice or the wrong one i think it was the right choice the choice i made afterward that i will never know i lied to rolande who believed me without a second thought having no cause to do otherwise i kept my silence to protect him and began my lessons thinking to divine the nature of this omnipresent invisible menace i studied the arts of covertcy to my surprise my instructor was not master strozzi but maestro gonzago the aragonian historian who had dubbed me antinous he had a keen mind and i admired him when he asked me to aid him in compiling research for a treatise on the history of relations between aragonia and terre dange i was flattered less so when i learned the truth why maestro i asked him why this i gestured vaguely having no idea what this meant this vast scheme the currents of history may turn on a single branch he said in a pragmatic tone many branches together may form a dam the patterns of influence interest me do they not interest you i wasnt entirely sure what he meant i think so yes maestro gonzago gave me a shrewd glance i am a mere scholar but you are a wellpositioned branch i will teach you to leverage your placement wisely what you do with this knowledge is your choice all my life id been reckoned clever and observant but i never learned to see the world as i did until gonzago de escabares taught me to do so he taught me to look and to listen to distinguish a mans trade by his clothing his success at it by the set of his shoulders his origin and history by layers of accent and dialect to gauge a mans state of mind by his gait to gauge a womans happiness by the tone of her voice the tilt of her head he taught me to study faces to watch for the myriad minute expressions that we make unawares and the meanings thereof he taught me the nine telltales of a lie he quizzed me mercilessly about what i had seen throughout the day until observing and memorizing became a force of habit he sent me on errands with my ears filled with wax plugs forcing me to rely on my eyes and when i had mastered that skill he sent me out with drops of belladonna in my eyes rendering the world overbright and my vision blurred painful and useless forcing me to rely on my ears as i blundered my way across the city later both i had to trust my nose and i learned day by day week by week month by month all the while lying to rolande and feeling sick in my belly about it but i learned come spring maestro gonzago revealed the scope of the puzzle and the final price to me the unseen guild how much of what i was told was truth and how much lies that is another thing i will never know all these long years i saw no evidence of the unseen guilds hand in terre dange no sign that their reach extended as far as they claimed was as dire as they claimed but someone is behind the plot that took my life i may have made a terrible mistake if rolande had not been recalled to terre dange things might have fallen out differently i was there when he received the official missive from a royal courier clad in the dark blue livery of house courcel a silver swan on the insignia on his breast i watched rolande read the letter his face turning pale he raised his head and met my eyes father orders me to return forthwith the skaldi are raiding along the border of camlach and the realm takes it amiss that the dauphin gallivants in tiberium while dangelines die im to take command of the border patrol then you must go i said promptly knowing his sense of honor would permit nothing less and i with you rolande hesitated you would be safer dont even suggest it my voice was fierce would you dishonor me im a lords son trained to the sword my place is at your side he looked relieved ill have word sent to the university guilt pricked me ill tell maestro gonzago myself i owe him that much ah your research project rolande gave me a curt nod go but be swift about it anafiel were meant to leave in a days time maestro gonzago winced at the news so soon he said in dismay i knew it was a possibility but i prayed wed have more time with unwonted urgency he clutched my hands youve a choice facing you young antinous all that ive taught you is in the service of an organization committed to gathering and sharing information that might alter the paths of history do you swear loyalty to the unseen guild its resources will be at your disposal and if i dont i asked softly you can walk away from this as ever silence is the price his grip tightened if you break it death id come to love the lessons to love the insight into human nature id gained but i hated living a lie hated lying to rolande with sorrow i withdrew my hands from his grasp im sorry maestro i did not mean to waste your time but i think i think if i swear this oath i will come to regret it one day one day it will pit my oath against my love for rolande and there will be no winners in that battle so i choose silence there are a multitude of fleeting expressions that cross our faces unaware manifesting in the eye blink between reaction and thought i knew because maestro gonzago had taught me to see them and in that instance i saw the faintest hint of relief flit across his features so be it he said with apparent regret i will report your decision for my part my door will never be closed to you my dear antinous i hope you will remain in contact with me i bent my head and kissed his cheek i shall you kept your word maestro better than i did you were a good teacher and a good friend too i have valued our enduring relationship you tried to warn me the skaldi have found a leader who thinks mayhap that is why i am dying the memories come faster now faster and faster i am awash in their current i cannot stop them during the year i spent patrolling the camaeline border with rolande the skaldi had not yet found a leader who thought but they were tenacious and doughty warriors pouring through the high mountain passes to stage raids on vulnerable villages looting them and taking female captives rolande was a natural leader skilled at commanding men always willing to hurl himself into the forefront of a battle where he went we followed not a man who fought under him begrudged him his status as goodnatured as he was he kept strict discipline when word reached him that one of his men had gotten a young widow with child and abandoned her he dismissed the fellow in disgrace and took personal responsibility for the woman and her infant son promising they would never again lack for aught as ever his sense of honor demanded nothing less it was a difficult time but it was an exhilarating time too after my first battle i felt sick and strange to myself that never changed although i grew accustomed to the feeling in a sense i was glad not to lose it for it meant i had not become inured to the horrors of warfare but the fighting itself there was a certain terrible glory in it anyone who has lived on the daggers edge between life and death will know what i mean to those who have not i cannot explain it it brought us closer together all of us and especially rolande and i until i confessed the truth to him it came after a hardfought battle in the narrow winding passes above the village of liselet where horses were no use wed routed the raiders and i lost sight of rolande as he raced after them on foot around a hairpin turn ahead i heard a chorus of defiant roars and the sound of blades clashing three of the skaldi had made a stand safeguarding their fellows retreat and rolande was nigh overwhelmed my heart in my throat i threw myself at the nearest man raising my buckler hacking at his wooden shield driving him backward still it wasnt enough for the space of a few heartbeats our fates hung in the balance and then more of our own men arrived turning the tide we killed two of the skaldi and the third fled shall we go after them my lord gaspar trevalion inquired no rolande grimaced one hand pressed to his neck were too close to the border blood welled between his fingers and i fear ive need of attention it scared me the wound wasnt serious requiring only a few stitches to close but it could have been an inch or two higher and it could have severed the big vein in his throat the thought of coming so close to losing him made me dizzy and the lingering guilt of my deception was leaden in my belly i had to disgorge it that night in our shared tent i told rolande the truth about tiberium and the unseen guild speaking in a low whisper he rose and walked out into the starlit night without a word i followed him in anguish past the outskirts of our camp past the startled sentries along the verge of a dense pine forest well out of earshot of the camp he halted i did too he spoke without turning around you his voice was strained i dont even know what to say to you anafiel i trusted you with everything i am and you lied to me he gave a harsh ragged laugh is this how you honor what we are to one another no beneath the stars i dropped to my knees no i struggled to draw breath feeling as though my chest might crack open i thought it doesnt matter im sorry so very sorry more than anything i love you he was silent can you doubt it i was desperate and crazed the words from an ancient oath spilling from my lips unstoppable i swear on the blood of blessed elua himself that i love you and you alone by the blood that blessed elua spilled for so long as we both shall live i bind myself to you and you alone anafiel rolande was kneeling before me his hands hard on my shoulders eyes wide dont i felt the golden glow of eluas blessing wash over us both accepting my oath banishing my guilt i smiled wearily at rolande too late your highness he sighed leaning his brow against mine i have a duty to terre dange you know i cannot swear the same i know you and you alone rolande it is why i took no wife fathered no children it is why my own father disavowed me for throwing away my heritage on a romantic whim so he said my mother understood and gave me her name that is when i ceased to be anafiel de montrève and became anafiel delaunay edmée understood too i like him anafiel her fingers curled into mine as we strolled i do i like him very much i smiled at her im glad nearsister we were heroes in those days in those long winter nights in the city of elua the dauphin and his band of protectors guardians of the border after a year of hardfought skirmishes we had pushed the skaldi back rolande courted edmée she accepted his suit together the three of us accepted the arrangement a betrothal was announced a spring marriage planned shunned barquiels sister isabel lenvers glowered impotently i didnt care i was happy faster and faster memory comes edmée spring in terre dange a green haze of leaves on the trees there was a royal fete a hunt a prelude to a wedding she rode beautifully edmée did she always had i was behind her i saw the saddle lurch sideways as her mount leaped the hedgerow i heard her startled sound of dismay i saw her fall i do not remember jumping the hedge i do not remember dismounting i remember hearing the sound the crack of her slender neck breaking i remember kneeling beside her holding her hand and begging her not to die watching the light fade from edmées eyes as she did anyway sweet and apologetic just like that others had gathered i looked at their faces fast so fast i saw a mingled expression of guilt and furtive triumph cross isabel lenvers swiftly giving way to solemn grief then and there i knew but i could never prove it would it have made a difference if i had been able to prove it rolande ah gods why couldnt you just believe me you were angry i know furious with grief at edmées death and beneath it still angry at me for concealing the truth from you for lying to you you didnt want to hear my suspicions i was right though the girth on edmées saddle was frayed to the point of snapping it might have been tampered with but it might merely have been worn too several stable hands were dismissed for carelessness when i hunted them down to query them one had vanishedgone from the city of elua gone home to namarre according to rumor i tried to locate him and failed leave it be anafiel rolande said in disgust when i returned like as not the lads sick at heart over what his carelessness has wrought i shook my head someone put him up to it you didnt see isabels face ive known isabel lenvers for most of her life and shes as heartsick as all of us at edmées death he said in an even tone shes been a considerable comfort to me while youve been haring around the countryside chasing after shadows i was unable to keep the bitterness from my voice of that i havent the slightest doubt griefracked and angry we quarreled quarreled and hurt one another in intimate ways that only two people who know each others every weakness and vulnerability can do i had a sharp tongue i should have held it i didnt instead i pushed rolande away pushed him into isabels consoling arms i couldnt stop myself from lashing out at him amidst our quarrels we parted she played him skillfully while i and my aching heart my lost heritage my unproven suspicions and my forlorn oath were relegated to the outskirts of dangeline society come autumn he wed her it was a somber ceremony overshadowed by the memory of recent tragedy i was not invited to attend but i heard about it by all accounts it was lovely and appropriately solemn if i had done nothing mayhap their poignant tale of romance found in the wreckage of sorrow would have charmed the nation but i wrote a poem a satire a tale of a noblewoman who seduced a stable lad and convinced him to do a dire deed with terrible consequences i had to rolande my voice was all that was left to me here at the end i will admit that i dont believe isabel intended edmées death that she intended petty vengeance nothing more but edmée died and isabel was responsible for it so i had to folk in the city of elua were delighted by my allegations ever ready to be appalled and titillated by scandal isabel de la courcel was furious so was rolande so was his father the king ganelon de la courcel but they could no more disprove the rumor that the dauphins new bride was a murderess than i could prove it i was summoned to court i denied authorship of the poem but i was not believed i was declared anathema and all existing copies of my known poetry were destroyed with banked fury in her gaze isabel argued for banishment not looking at me rolande spoke against it his father concurred content with the punishment i was not banished only made miserable there are always those who relish beating against the currents and so i was able to eke out an existence in the city of elua as a former prodigy once beloved of the dauphin and sure to be named the kings poet now living in disgrace reduced to writing bawdy poems and satires on commission it was a bad yeara very very bad year it changed when ysandre was born rolandes daughter how is it that love always catches us unaware i see a lot of you in her rolande the relentless nobility the determination the firm sense of obligation although ysandre looks a great deal like isabel i do not see her mother in her only you standing on my doorstep surrounded by guards rolande swallowed hard the knot of his throat rising and falling you heard i stared at him wondering why in the world he was here yes of course congratulations anafiel he caught my hand and i let him i have no right to ask you anything but i am asking nonetheless my daughter ysandre the knot of his throat rose fell i begin to fear that you may have been right about certain matters i begin to fear that a good deal of intrigue may surround her i was silent rolandes eyes were so blue so earnest i have no right you have every right i said softly whats changed he smiled a little sadly mayhap youve heard my uncle benedicte is planning a visit he has grown children he wishes to introduce to the court isabel grows fearful and speaks of intrigues against me against our daughter there is a dark suspicious edge to her ive never known before i need to know ysandre has people who will protect her who will have her interests at heart like you did with edmée remember my heart ached i remember rolande squeezed my hand will you i lifted his hand to my lips pressed them against the signet ring he wore with the crest of house courcel emblazoned on it of course on the blood of blessed elua i swear it he sighed my throat was tight too will you come in i asked hoping against hope he didnt look away and there was hunger in his gaze yes it was good and glorious and terrible all at once a tempest and a homecoming an apology and a benediction afterward rolande wept i stroked his hair dryeyed although my love for him was undiminished i wasnt the innocent young siovalese country lordling hed fallen in love with anymore presently he whispered a question has there been is there anyone else anafiel i gazed at his beautiful face his eyelashes spiky with tears and pitied us both no rolande i murmured i swore an oath for so long as we both live i am bound to you and you alone he bowed his head i would release you from it if i could his voice was low and uncertain would you want that no i lifted his chin with one hand the memory of the golden warmth of eluas blessing spilling over me only dont shut me out again rolande smiled with relief never you kept that promise rolande and yet you left me anyway it hurts i dont want to relive it but i am dying and i cannot stop the memories from coming the city of elua buzzed with the news of our reunion isabel gnashed her teeth in fury what passed between them in private i didnt know but in public rolande held his head high and acknowledged me with quiet dignity i was not wholly absolved the ban on my poetry remaining but i was once again welcome at courtor at least tolerated even so i avoided it for the most part i had few friends there rolande and i spoke of those we trusted the most men we had ridden and fought with gaspar trevalion quintilius rousse who had accepted a naval commission percy comte de somerville kinsman to rolandes mother the queen and a prince of the blood in his own right based on what id learned in tiberium of the unseen guild a plan began to form in the back of my mind this time i was wise enough to keep my mouth shut on my thoughts and all too soon concrete concerns in the world displaced vague and nebulous ones once more the skaldi were raiding in strength angling for control of one of the major mountain passes rolandes uncle benedicte de la courcel was bringing a contingent of seasoned warriors from la serenissima on his impending visit king ganelon was minded to use the occasion to mount a largescale offensive and seize the pass for good once again i was to fight at rolandes side achilles and patroclus side by side once more rolande said lightly dallying in my bed hush i covered his mouth with one hand dont make illluck jests it didnt end so well for them i took my hand away any mind i fear i cast you wrong you would never sulk in your tent while your honor was at stake oh he raised his strong brows who then knowing you as i do now i smiled wryly noble hector mayhap but i dont like to speak of him either rolande folded his arms behind his head it ended badly for most of them didnt it it did i agreed he eyed me complacently youd have gotten away though wily odysseus thats who you would have been i shuddered lets not speak of it truly a date was chosen plans were made it was decided that the command should be shared among three men percy de somerville benedicte de la courcel and rolande princes of the blood all three even before we set out folk were calling it the battle of three princes but only two of them came home alive which is worse remembering or dying i cannot say the skaldi made their stand in a vast meadow high in the camaeline mountainsa green meadow in which thousands upon thousands of starry white flowers blossomed a meadow dotted with lakes and rocky outcroppings overhead the sky was a flawless blue and the white tops of the mountains where the snow never melted glistened the skaldi awaited us at the far end clad in furs and leather hair braided steel weapons and wooden shields in their hands a handful were mounted on shaggy mountain ponies but most were on foot they outnumbered us by half but we had steel armor better weapons and a sizable cavalry the air was thin and clear very very clear it reminded me of my childhood in the mountains of siovale i breathed slowly and deeply stroking my mounts withers she stood steady as a rock beneath me she was a good mare surefooted and battleseasoned rolande eyed me sidelong eyes bright beneath the brim of his helm all along the line of the vanguard leather creaked and metal jingled ready i frowned at the uneven terrain in private id argued in favor of sending the foot soldiers out first but the three princes none of whom were mountainborn had overridden my concerns rolande read my unspoken thoughts and lowered his voice anafiel im not willing to give up one of our greatest advantages if they dont break and flee by the third charge well fall back and let the infantry engage them while we regroup well enough i knew my duty well enough my liege and my love i murmured saluting him with my sword i added in a ringing tone ready he grinned his standardbearer raised his staff flying the silver swan pennant of house courcel some fifty yards to the right a second standard was hoisted flying the pennant of house courcel and the insignia of la serenissima on his uncle benedictes behalf to the left percy de somervilles standardbearer raised the apple tree of house somerville rolande lifted his sword and nodded at his trumpeter one trumpet blew two three ringing clear and brazen beneath the clear blue skies at the far end of the valley the skaldi roared and beat their blades against their wooden shields we charged charged hewed down men where they stood wheeled and retreated dodging ponds boulders and crevasses once twice i was hot beneath my armor sweating through my padded undertunic and breathing hard my sword streaked with gore and my sword arm growing tired the ranks of skaldi were growing ragged wavering a young lad with tawnybrown hair longlimbed and tall for his years rallied them urged them to hold fast at his tenacious insistence they did third times the charm rolande cried cries of agreement echoed across the meadow one again the trumpeters gave their brazen call once again we clapped heels to our mounts sides and sprang forward i know which is worse remembering oh gods by far dying is easier i was a siovalese country lordling and i knew mountains i rode a surefooted horse for a reason id made sure rolande did too not his standardbearer when the lads mount caught a hoof in a crevice and went down with a terrible scream left foreleg broken there was nothing i could do but check my mare uncertainty rippled down the line while rolande raced to engage the skaldi men and horses in the center of the vanguard hesitated those on the flanks men under command of percy de somerville and benedicte de la courcel had farther to travel rolande plunged alone into the ranks of unmounted skaldi his sword rising and falling his standardbearers mount rolled and squealed in agony crushing her rider sowing chaos cursing and sweating i yanked my mares head with uncustomary viciousness and rode around them putting my heels to her too late i saw rolande surrounded dragged from the saddle i saw the crude blades rise and fall streaked with blood his blood i fought others came and fought too too few too late oh it was enough to seize the pass enough to guarantee a victory in the battle of three princes still it came too late as soon as the line had pressed past us a handful of soldiers and i wrestled rolandes ruined body across my pommel retreating with him my good mare bore the burden without complaint behind the lines of skirmish i wept with fury unbuckling his armor trying in vain to staunch the bleeding of a dozen wounds damn you rolande you promised dont leave me beneath the blue sky his blood soaked the green grass drenched the starry white blossoms a faint sigh escaped him bringing a froth of crimson to his lips im sorry he whispered in a hoarse voice one gauntleted hand rose a few inches then fell back to the ground limp anafiel im sorry and then the light went out of his blue blue eyes just as it had faded from edmées he was gone why couldnt you have waited rolande you always had to be first into the fray why it was a bitter bitter victory won at the battle of three princes for a long time afterward i wished i had died with rolande once the initial crushing weight of grief had faded i flung myself into excesses of debauchery making a circuit of the thirteen houses of the night court sampling the highs and lows of all that carnal pleasure had to offer as though to mock the vow id never wished to be free of now broken with rolandes death it was the other vow id sworn that kept me alive the vow to protect his daughter ysandre now the infant dauphine of terre dange for rolande was right intrigue surrounded her from the moment of his death a dozen challengers set their sights on the throne slowly slowly i gathered my griefaddled wits and began to assemble a net of spies informants and a few trusted allies i remembered words spoken to me long ago by master strozzi in tiberium whores make some of the best spies i set out to cultivate them aided by goodwill generated during my period of debauchery i kept my finger on the pulse of the world learning that a wellplaced word at the right time could thwart the most ambitious plot the only one i failed to foil i did not regret in a fitting twist of irony isabel died by poison at the hand of one of prince benedictes scheming offspring but her daughter lived which was all that mattered to me here and there i had dalliancesalways with women for no man could compare in my eyes to rolande none were serious except mayhap for melisande shahrizai beautiful calculating melisande with a hunger for lifes sharper pleasures the only person clever enough to guess what i was about with my intrigues in a moment of weakness when the black grief was upon me i told her of the unseen guild and how i regretted betraying rolandes trust to this day she understood we were ill suited in many ways but melisande understood me too well mayhap even now i cannot believe melisande would have wished me dead but i have been wrong before the skaldi have found a leader who thinks and melisande knew his name the whoremaster of spies even as i wove my net among the pleasurehouses of the night court i never set out to become such a thing and yet it happened it began with the best of intentions there were six years of peace along the skaldic border after the battle of three princes when reports of renewed raiding came i did not volunteer instead mindful of a promise rolande had made i journeyed to the camaeline village of trefail where i found the widows son rolande had promised to care for his mother was dead and his halfskaldi nurse was preparing to desert him i took him home the skaldi sacking his village in our wake in the city of elua i adopted him into my household and gave him my nameor at least my mothers name if not the one i was born with alcuin alcuin nó delaunay when i began training him in the arts of covertcy id not thought to employ him to serve my ends it was merely a set of skills to teach him but ah gods he was so bright so eager to learn so grateful to have been rescued from the beginning alcuin simply assumed he would aid me in my work in whatever manner possible when he was grown somewhere along the path i began to assume it too i hardened my heart against any remorse phèdre was another matter from the beginning i knew what she was and why i chose her where are you my anguissette kushiels chosen marked by the scarlet mote in your eye bound by fate to experience pain as pleasure no wonder melisande delighted in you so i am grateful you were not here today anafiel delaunays last pupil i pray i taught you well and that i was meant to do so mayhap i sealed my fate when i paid the price of phèdres marque and took her into my household it can be unwise for mortals to meddle in the affairs of the gods but i was the only one who recognized her for what she was what else was i to have done alcuin and phèdre my beautiful boy and my godtouched girl i did not mean to use them and yet i did i should not have used them so especially alcuin i should have seen that the work did not suit him that he merely wished to please me when all is said and done naamahs service is a sacred calling but the goddess absolved him of any transgression and still and still alcuin found it in his heart to love me in a manner i never expected nor deserved one desperate mouthful of sweetness at the bottom of a bitter cup i owed him a better life than i gave him so many strands so many threads unraveling it is all falling apart a sharp sword can cut through the most intricately woven of webs i will die without knowing who plotted my death without knowing what it means that the skaldi have found a leader who thinks without knowing if ysandre found a way to cross the deadly straits and wed the alban prince to whom she was betrothed but i kept her safe rolande your daughter ysandre she is a grown woman now i kept my oath when she came to me for aid i gave it to her and yet there is something i missed but i can do no more now it is in the hands of the gods and their chosen did i cross the will of the gods here at the end i pray i have not offended mighty kushiel punisher of the damned in taking his chosen as my pupil i pray he will use phèdre to administer his cruel mercy and bring justice to those who have murdered me to continue the task of keeping ysandre safe i obeyed blessed eluas precept of that i am sure i loved you rolande while you lived i loved you with all my heart you and you alone even dying it is true all i can do is pray into the falling darkness hoping to find you on the other side and die lisa tuttle till death we do part says the familiar vowbut what about after that

behind the library it wasnt one of those big powerful northern timber wolves you see in the movies but the much smaller leaner actually kind of scrawnylooking gray wolf that was long ago native to texas at least id thought they were extinct but then i remembered stories the students told about panthers bears and other dangerous animals that had survived in patches of woodland they called the big thicket and the hairs on the back of my neck prickled i just knew this was a wild animal nobodys pet and yet i wasnt afraid instinct might have made my heart beat faster and charged my muscles but i didnt want to flee or fight i was purely thrilled by this strange meeting feeling as if id been allowed to walk into a different world i took a step lobo here a mans voice rang out sharp as a whip crack and the animal turned away my heart dropped and then i was annoyed of course somebody owned this animal some stupid posturing fool hitching my heavy book bag up my shoulder i folded my arms across my chest and checked him out ive heard it said that people resemble their pets and there was something a little lupine about himmaybe it was his lean rangy body or the way he stood as if ready to take off running or leap to the attack he wore a plain gray tshirt shorts and running shoes but nothing else about him looked either casual or modern his dark face had a keen hungry edge emphasized by the narrow blade of his nose his age i guessed to be near my own in that shadow line between youth and age he certainly wasnt a student and i didnt recognize him as a member of the faculty or the support staff id never seen him before and he didnt look like he belonged he was as out of place here as the wolf speaking quietly he said he wont hurt you do i look scared i snapped and what do you mean by calling a mexican wolf lobo doesnt he deserve his own name he smiled without showing his teeth what makes you think hes a mexican wolf because there havent been wolves in texas for a long timeunless they wandered across the border were a long way from the border here maam of course we were and the wolf hadnt exactly walked here by himself i realized that i was still clinging to my fantasy of a wild creature and embarrassment made me lash out yes of course you could have bought him anywherehouston new orleans these hybrids are popular because some people think theyre too special to just buy a dog gotta take a walk on the wild side whatd they tell you hes ninetyeight percent purebred canis lupus so you call him wolf like thatll make it true i didnt buy him i dont know what anybody says he is and i dont care why shouldnt i call him lobo its insulting imagine if people called you hombre the tight smile again they call me wolfman id heard that name before from snatches of overheard student conversation but didnt know its significance so i shrugged maybe but you have your own name doesnt lobo deserve as much the wolf gave a small groan and i saw that he was quivering as if longing to break free the man laughed a short bark and gave me a measuring look whatve you got in that bag barbecue i frowned books why im trying to figure whats the big attraction maybe he senses that i care why dont you let him come for a second i thought that he would refuse but he snapped go free immediately the wolf sprang at me i kept still not from fear but simply careful as i would be with any strange dog not to alarm him with any sudden moves and he was equally careful sniffing at me gently almost daintily before moving closer inviting me to stroke his head hes very friendly i said no hes not at my look he went on i dont mean hes aggressivehed never attack a human being and only fights dogs if hes forced to defend himself but hes always kept his distance from everyoneeveryone but me lobo had relaxed now he was leaning into me as i scratched behind his ears he was loving it i laughed youre kidding look at this big baby hes starving for attention he gets plenty i know you think im some kind of stupid badass hick but i do look after him the real hurt in his words took me aback of course its obvious you care about each other as i spoke i looked up straight into the mans eyes they were brown mostly dark but flecked with a lighter color the flashing gold of the wolfs eye and i was suddenly breathless in the unexpected intimacy of his gaze i didnt even know his name gathering my wits remembering my manners i put out my hand how do you do im katherine hills the barest flicker of hesitation then he gripped my hand cody cody vela listen i cant hang around ilobos waiting for his afternoon run the wolfs ears pricked oh well sure it was nice meeting you i said feeling flat want to come along my heart leaped like a crazy thing but i grimaced and gestured at my long cotton skirt and sandals im hardly dressed for running even supposing i could keep up with you two come along for the ride im going into the thicket ever been there no really he sounded astonished then you have to i rarely acted on impulse and hadnt gone off with anyone for the ride since i was fifteen but i agreed and followed after the lean dark man and the lightly stepping wolf as if it were a perfectly natural thing to do his car a big black newlooking suv was parked a short distance away on the street it wasnt a spot convenient to anywhere hidden away behind the blank limestone back wall of the library and since the visitor parking lot was never crowded on a weekday afternoon i wondered what had brought him here do you work on campus i asked as i buckled up what do you mean are you employed by the college he laughed sharply oh definitely not related to one of the students shaking his head he started the engine and pulled away from the curb are you saying youve never heard of the wolfman i only moved here in august so i havent had time to learn about all the local characters or go into the woods tsktsk what have you been doing with your time planning my classes teaching what department english you like books there was an understatement literature was the great passion of my life i murmured a restrained agreement and gazed out the window as we left the quiet shady college grounds expecting hed change the subject whats your favorite book oh i couldnt possibly name just one favorite author that was easier virginia woolf of course he turned his head and i met his gaze quickly nervously before he returned to watching where he was going smiling to himself what do you mean of course i knew you reminded me of somebody that long graceful neck beautiful deep eyes full lips i felt a warm flush of pleasure at his admiring words people must have told you that before dont they call you the woolfwoman he grinned that should be your nickname on campus around the english department at least i dont have a nickname not that ive ever heard nobody here was interested enough to give me a special name but i wasnt going to tell him that that he knew something about virginia woolf intrigued me so whos your favorite author dostoyevsky although i like stephen king a lot and james lee burke there ive surprised you you probably thought i dropped out of high schoolwell i did but that doesnt mean i dont read i like reading good books that is we passed the city limits sign and he picked up speed city limitsit struck me as a sick joke to apply the name of city to a town with a population that only brushed six thousand when college was in session almost every day i asked myself what i was doing here so what brought you to this neck of the woods i needed a job the college needed an english teacher it was all kind of lastminute wed both been let down i didnt feel like going into detail youre not from the south chicago wow ive never been there it must be different he went on to ask questions that were easy for me to answer without touching on anything too personal as i talked about weather and food and oprah he took the highway heading south driving past the turnoff to the poky little trailer i called home a few minutes later he turned east onto a road id never taken because it didnt go anywhere except deeper into the woods and swamps of rural east texas do you drive out to run in the country every day pretty much sometimes we stick closer to home but i prefer places where we wont meet anybody he needs at least two good runs a day its not natural for a wolf to be stuck inside a house or a car all day even if i have to be you take him with you we go everywhere together he said wolves are pack animals that thing people say about a lone wolf its just wrong maybe if i had some others and a big enough yard but i wont make him live like a prisoner id had a dog when i was a kid but not since one thing id had in mind when i moved to texas was to rent a place with a fenced yard and a landlord who wasnt opposed to pets and it was the detail that my new home had previously been used as a hunting cabin and included a sizable kennels that made me agree to a years lease sight unseen but when i saw the kennelsthe concrete floor the high chainlink fencethey looked like guantanamo you got a problem with that he challenged my silence not at all id love to have a dog but i couldnt leave it alone five days a week i guess its even more important if youre going to buy a wolf i didnt buy him i gazed ahead at the empty road dappled with long shadows and the dark depths of the forest on either side you found him he made a noise that might have been agreement and i said a fullgrown wolf he must have belonged to somebody couldnt you find his owner his face showed nothing but his hands tightened on the steering wheel if i could find the bastard who had him first id kill him slowly id make him die in agony do to him what he wanted to do to my wolf the icy malice in his voice chilled me what happened it was just after id gotten back fromhe hesitatedwell that doesnt matter id been away and then i came back about two years ago i grew up in these parts and when i was a kid i used to go hunting and fishing and camping in the thicket but not after i grew up i hadnt set foot in the woods for ten years at least until that day i suddenly got this urge i just wanted to get away from everybody and everything away from civilization so i drove east into the woods and turned off the highway onto one of the old timber routes and drove until it was too rough and grown over to drive any farther and then i left the car i kept to the trail of course everybody who grows up in these parts knows how easy it is to get lost if you dont there are stories about people getting lost for days within a couple miles of the road thats how thick and tangled it is you can be in the middle of a swamp before you know it with that kind of mud that sucks you down i knew how it was im not stupid but after id been walking for about an hour i started feeling that this old road wasnt going to take me where i had to go had to go i didnt know why or where it was but i felt more and more that there was some point to this trip and if i kept to the trail i was never going to find out what it was so i left the trail i used my knife to mark my path so i could find my way back id done it before only back then id had a reasona deer id shot but hadnt killed a duck or a quail id brought down into the brushand this time the only thing i was following was some kind of instinct or intuition he shook his head gazing out at the road ahead but seeing i was sure the forests in his mind im not somebody who gets feelings you know i never believed in that woowoo psychic spirit stuff i still dont except he scowled gripping the wheel harder and behind us lobo gave a deep sigh i cant explain why i left the trail and slashed my way deeper into the woods why i went that way and no other but i did and i reckon i walked at least a mile to a place so far off the map youd swear nobody else had been there in about a century except that there was this wolf chained by the neck to a tree and he damn sure hadnt done that to himself i thought he was dead at first i thought id come too late but then as i crouched next to him i felt his heart still beating it was a near thing though god knows how long hed been stuck there with no chance of freeing himself with nothing to eat or drink angry tears started to my eyes whod do such a thing a person he almost spat the word in the old days people told their kids stories about the big bad wolf and men who were especially cruel and horrible were said to be like animals maybe werewolves but the things ordinary men do every day are a million times worse than anything a wolf would do a wolf would never torture another animal to death or lock it up they kill out of instinct in order to survive because they have tonot because they just feel like it not because theyre evil not like us man is the scariest animal on the planet but from the beginning of time the wolf has gotten the bad rap weve tried to pretend that evil is out there lurking inside animals beyond the campfire and not where it really is in here he tapped his chest you saved his life yeah and he changed mine he shrugged dont they say if you save a life you take responsibility for it i guess i could have taken him to one of those animalrescue places but that would have been like leaving him to die in prison or risk him falling into the hands of some other sadistic bastard it was up to me to make sure that the life id saved was worth living its not that hard you know enough food plenty of exercise outdoors companionship lucky we like the same things as he spoke he took a sudden turn off the road hardly slowing as we moved onto a heavily rutted unpaved track i held on for dear life as we rocked and bounced deeper into the forest i thought this was a state park the way the trees loomed over us old and heavy with moss so thick they blocked the sun made me uncomfortable some of the thickets a national preserve but we tend to steer clear of their trails he said no pets allowed and if too many people start seeing a wolf they might come looking for the wolfman this old road here it was used for logging i think it winds up in some old ghost town theres all sorts of old forgotten stuff in here he parked offroad in a small clearing he opened his door got out opened the back door and stood looking in at the wolf who was standing on the backseat absolutely still utterly focused one charged moment passed in silence then cody barked go free and the wolf leaped out of the car the most beautiful graceful thing id ever seen he seemed to fly and in motion he was perfect so beautiful it made my chest ache you okay cody was staring at me i had to blink hard but managed not to sniff as i nodded and said hes just so amazing he went on looking at me for an uncomfortably long time before he nodded slowly and said more than you know will you be okay here by yourself i nodded but i really wasnt sure he handed me his keys if you get too hot run the air conditioner for a while listen to some music if you get bored does your phone have a camera sure why just if you see an ivorybilled woodpecker you want to be sure to get a picture it was only when he flashed me a grin that i realized he was teasing and managed to respond actually i was hoping to see bigfoot i watched him go light and strong and quick on his feet as he sprinted away into the deep shadowy forest and although his movements didnt have the amazing grace of the fleet fourlegged animal still he had his own male human beauty and when he vanished into the dark i felt something squeeze my heart it was still hot and almost unbearably humid even so late in the day even though it was already october but i was afraid of draining the battery if i ran the airconditioning so instead of curling up in relative comfort with one of my books i wandered i kept to the trail of course and peered into the undergrowth in hope of seeing one of the rare orchids or carnivorous plants that flourished in these parts i didnt find anything rare and i got bitten to pieces by mosquitoes before deciding fairly swiftly to turn back i didnt belong here once in the clearing again knowing that i had the option of locking myself inside the suv or even driving away i felt better there was a sinister atmosphere about this patch of southern woodland or maybe i just thought so after codys story everybody knows there are people who delight in cruelty to animals and if cody had told me hed rescued the wolf from starvation in somebodys garage or basement i would not have been surprised but why would anyone go so far into a trackless wilderness to chain and abandon to condemn to a lingering death such a beautiful innocent animal something about the mental image struck me as mythic a wolfprometheus bound to a rock but it had been a tree and the only classical myth about wolves that came to mind was romulus and remus abandoned babies nursed by a shewolf i was still brooding on the subject when the two of them came back the wolf panting but still full of energy bounding across the clearing to do a happy dance around me cody dripping with sweat his gray tshirt soaked and clinging to his muscular chest jogged raggedly after him he looked exhausted until he saw me when his face lit up and he carried himself differently with a new spring in his step the sight of him the way his expression changed the sheer joy in it as if hed half expected me to be gone sent a surge through me some sort of emotional electricity connecting us can these things be explained is there any reason in it sometimes once in a lifetime if youre lucky you see someone and you just know i was suddenly ridiculously happy neither of us said a word there was a cooler full of cold drinks in the back of the car cody poured water into a dish and set it down for lobo then stripped off his shirt and poured the rest of the bottle over his head shaking it off as unselfconsciously as if hed been alone i pretended not to notice but my eyes were drawn to his naked chest and i was standing so near that i could smell his clean salty sweat and feel the heat that radiated from him it was all suddenly too much the surge of pure lust that i felt was so powerful that i couldnt breathe i had to close my eyes and lean against a tree want some my eyes flashed open i saw that he was holding out a can of cold beer thanks i said and took a quick gulp he looked at me with a sly grin dont know why you should feel weak you been secretly working out with the weights in your bag no but the mosquitoes mustve got two pints out of me at least he laughed and i gulped down beer more quickly than usual but when he offered me a second i shook my head no i canti shouldnti i guess you need to be getting back i nodded we were silent in the car as he drove there was so much to say i couldnt think how to begin he seemed comfortable with the silence i listened to the steady regular panting from the backseat and the hum of the tires on the road and breathed in the musky scents of man and animal and as i relaxed into the moment i felt the hard tight knot that had been inside me for so long slowly loosen seeing my mailbox coming into view i remarked thats where i live right there and he turned hard cutting across the highway into my driveway i gave a little yelp of surprise whats wrong i thought you said we were bouncing and rolling along the badly rutted track when he stepped on the brake i didnt mean you should turn you didnt want me to take you home yes and stay with me forever i thought my cars on campus oh right of course well ill take you there no problem he said do i need to back out you can turn by the trailer i said and a moment later we were in the clearing where my shabby home stood in solitary splendor he looped smoothly around the clearing in front of it and in a matter of seconds we were back on the highway i felt sorry why hadnt i asked him in for a drink so i didnt have anything but a box of green tea and a couple of cherry cokes there was beer in his cooler then as i was trying to think how to rescue the situation he spoke listen do you want to go get something to eat i looked at him he was hunched forward staring at the road that would be nice his shoulders relaxed i dont know about nice id love to take you to a fancy restaurant but lobo wouldnt be welcome i laughed are you kidding you really dont go anywhere without him did you think i was lying whoa youre sensitive no but people exaggerate ive done it myself andwell to change your life that much why is that so hard to believe havent you ever changed your life to suit another person people do it all the time they do it when they fall in love you dont live like youre single when youre married women do it when they have kids every time so ive done it for an animalwhy not i like him better than anywell lets say better than nintynine percent of all the people ive ever met we went to whattaburger it felt very retro having a date at a drivein very oldfashioned teenage and that was pretty appropriate to the hormonal rush his presence caused a desire so strong it took away my appetite for anything but him he ordered three hamburgers and fed one of them to lobo bit by bit when the two of them were finished my own burger was still nearly untouched cody advised me to eat up youre driving him crazy he can have it something wrong with it no youre not hungry i shook my head the milkshakes enough go on then cement your friendship with a burger the whole thing i mean bun and lettuce and all unless you want it i enjoyed watching lobo wolf it down as i turned away wiping my fingers on a napkin i noticed some college kids walking past heading for either the taco bell or the eleven on foot because as freshmen they were required to live on campus and not allowed cars one of the girls gave the suv a sharp look as she walked by and i recognized her as one of my students she saw me through the lowered window just as i saw her and her eyes widened i couldnt help smiling as i raised my hand in a casual salute yes your boring english teacher does have a life outside the classroom she lowered her gaze without responding and hurried away cody said lets go unless you wanted something else no nothing i said and while it was true i had hoped we could sit and talk awhile i still knew almost nothing about this man except that he was happy to allow a wolf to set his schedule i guess lobo wouldnt be too happy about sitting in a drivein after the foods all gone not when he can smell more burgers being taken to other cars so now what i asked as he started the engine now i take you to get your car like you asked i didnt want our date to be over but i reminded myself there could be others and so as we headed toward campus i invited them to dinner at my place the next evening i felt codys happiness like my own and i think it was i was still feeling happy the next afternoon and even more excited as i anticipated the night to come when i got the message that nadia sorenko head of my department wanted to see me i wasnt worried not even when i saw how serious she looked as she gestured to me to take a seat and i was totally unprepared for her first question what is the nature of your relationship with cody vela i gaped at her stupidly what she leaned forward across her desk the kids call him the wolfman you know who i mean theres a disturbing rumor going around that you were seen sitting with him in his suv yesterday evening i bristled well so what if i was she repeated whats the nature of your relationship i was afraid i was blushing i only met him yesterday id hardly call that a relationship she nodded slowly not a business relationship what are you talking about what business and isnt it my business who i talk to on my own time not when hes the local drug dealer she smiled a bit grimly you didnt know oh yes and its not a parttime share the joy homegrown pot kind of thing have no illusionshe might be a local boy but the mans a criminal with connections to organized crime i tried to swallow my throat was sore ii had no idea how did you meet him i saw his wolf i was curious i guess his wolf she shook her head some wolf half coyote half german shepherd you ask me but the kids all believe his stories its purely wild he found the little cub in the woods the only survivor of a pack butchered by hunters or it saved his life when he was attacked by a pantherwhich one did he tell you he didnt say anything like that must have guessed you werent as gullible as your students they think the big thicket is more than a few scattered remnants that its primeval magical filled with wolf packs big cats and extinct birds not to mention ghost lights and hairy ape men her interest in me waning she stole a glance at her computer screen and sighed all right katherine now you know what he is youll steer clear and if you ever see him on campus call security leaving campus half an hour later i went to the grocery store and bought three steaks potatoes green beans a bottle of wine cheese and crackers grapes a frozen cheesecake i reasoned that since i didnt have his phone number i couldnt cancel and the least i could do was give cody a chance to defend himself maybe he could explain everything he was working undercover for the dea or the victim of identitytheft i was totally in denial when i heard his car i went outside and stood in front of the trailer my arms crossed holding myself lobo sensed my mood instantly and hung back by the car just watching as cody less aware only lost his smile and his jaunty swinging stride when we were in touching distance whats up i told him what my boss had said he didnt prevaricate bluster or deny the charge and he didnt make light of it either he sucked in his lips you didnt know like id get in a car and go for a ride with a drug dealer he sighed youre a good person im not used to being around good people i cant see you anymore i understand yet he didnt move he stared at the ground behind him lobo gave a low sad whine please go he raised his eyes ive done bad things most people would say that makes me a bad man buti could change if i stopped dealing drugs broke free of the people ive been working for promised to go straightwould you give me another chance what do you mean i was hedging scared you know what i mean i want to be with you i want to be with you too i said in a rush but only ifwell it has to happen first for real i cant just take your word for it you know that youre suddenly all straight and honest it has to be clear to everyone that youre not a criminal anymore or i lose my job of course just give me a chance thats all im asking i cant just snap my fingers there are people i have to deal with and to get clear really id probably have to leave the state ill go with you i blurted without thinking about it our eyes met what about your job the jobs not the most important thing im not asking you to change just so i can keep my job he nodded slowly i dont want mine anymore i didnt used to care it was easy money so i did it thinking it was my choice but lately especially since i found lobo ive started to change id like to make a clean start but well im so involved now i cant just walk away i know too much and theres a history theres people who wont want to cut me loose so whats going to happen i asked my stomach in knots will they let you go he gave a little shrug like it didnt matter but i saw from his eyes that he was scared as well as strong ill just have to make them i have to nowfor you i thought he would come forward and kiss mei wanted him tobut he moved back toward the car instead opening the door and snapping his fingers for lobo before he looked around at me again ill come back for you when its safe he said he shut lobo into the back and opened his door and got into the drivers seat and then he hesitated again and gave me a long burning look ill come back to you as soon as i can katherine i love you i stared back at him through repressed tears unable to say those words back to him too choked up to say anything at all although later my silence would haunt me and i hoped he read in my eyes what i felt a week dragged slowly by there were classes and meetings and other people to keep me occupied during the days but in the evenings i was lonely and plagued by fears about what danger cody was putting himself in for my sake and i hadnt even told him i loved him why hadnt i rushed over and kissed him at least another different fear also tormented me the idea that cody didnt really love me that he hadnt meant what hed said that hed just been playing with me saying what he thought id believe the way hed told different people different versions of how lobo had come into his possession what if none of it was true friday morning as i stepped outside the trailer turning toward my car i found the wolf waiting for me he looked thinner and scrawnier than ever his head hung down he was visibly trembling panting hard seemingly on the point of collapse naturally i looked for some sign of cody or his black suv but the shivering animal was my only earlymorning visitor here lobo i said softly patting my side he came at once pressing himself against my legs sending the vibrations of his fastbeating heart through me somewhere in the trees a mockingbird sang and there was the sound of a heavy vehicle grumbling away down the highway i told myself that cody could have paused beside my mailbox just long enough to let lobo out before making his escape but then i was sure even if hed driven away at top speed the wolf would have gone chasing after his masters car until his heart burst and if cody were able to command lobo to go to me surely he would have sent a note of explanation my hand digging into the thick ruff of fur at the wolfs neck discovered no collar cody had told me he would never chain him and the collar was for appearances only always notched loose enough for him to slip his head through i knew then that something terrible had happened lobo had escaped and come to me for help taking him inside with me i locked the flimsy door and called the police i stumbled through a story about finding a dog i thought belonged to a man named cody velaat the mention of his name i was put through to someone else who instructed me to tell him everything i knew about mr vela and his associates i told him i didnt know anything id just seen him around and when the dog turned up this morning obviously upset i was concerned he told me then that cody had been murdered but he couldnt give me any details because it was part of an ongoing investigation but you should be aware that animals more wolf than dog i advise you to call the county animalcontrol office and let them take care of it hearing that cody was dead was a terrible shock at least it should have been but somehow i couldnt feel it it didnt seem real what was real what i had to deal with immediately was the weary frightened animal that had come to me for help of course i didnt call the animalcontrol officer looking after his wolf was now the only thing i could do for the man id so briefly thought of loving and then lost i made just one more phone call that morning to the secretary in the english department to say i was suffering from food poisoning and my classes would have to be canceled then i devoted myself to my new responsibility we spent the weekend getting to know each other and learning to trust i was a bit apprehensive about letting him off the leash in case he simply ran off and got lost but he needed exercise and taking him out to the thicket where there was no one to stare or get scared and no other dogs to hassle him seemed the best option im a walker not a jogger and i knew i could never keep up with him the way that cody could arriving in the same clearing where cody had parked on the day we met i let him out of the car and told him go free he did but as soon as he was lost to view in the shadowy depths of the forest i got scared and shouted for him to come back he reappeared within seconds clearly alarmed by my alarm and after that unpromising start i had a hard time convincing him to leave my side so he could get the exercise he clearly needed it turned out that lobo was even more worried about losing me than i was about him he didnt like to let me out of his sight if i was in the trailer he wanted to be there too if i was outside he was happy to stay out but not on his own eventually we reached a compromise if the door to the trailer was open he knew he could reach me and so he became more relaxed about roaming around exploring the area at night he stretched out on the floor of my bedroom blocking the door with his body if i decided to go anywhere hed know about it just as he had with cody he was happy to jump into my car at any time and willing to wait for me when i ran errandsat least for a few minutes i didnt dare test his patience knowing that if he got anxious or bored he could destroy the interior of the car i was still paying for that first weekend i never left him for more than the five minutes it took me to dash into a convenience store to pick up some food for us both by the end of the weekend the wolf was part of my life and i understood what cody had felt there was no hardship in adapting my habits to fit in with his i wasnt interested in a way of life that had no room for this wolf i didnt think twice on monday morning of course i took him with me a ripple of excitement ran around the classroom as we walked in dont worry i said calmly hes had a good run this morning so hell probably just lie on the floor and go to sleep while i talk dont any of you guys copy him that got a laugh bigger than it deserved i was suddenly much more interesting to my students what kind of a dog is that one of the girls asked hes a wolf whats his name cody it just came out all through the weekend i had called him by various terms of endearment but hadnt thought about changing the name cody had given him but now quite suddenly i had done it the animal himself raised his head and looked at me when i spoke codys name recognizing it and it was obvious from the caught breaths and exchange of looks among the students that they had too everybody had heard the news of the death of the local drug dealer cody wolfman vela most of them in far more lurid graphic detail than id picked up from local radio i wondered if id just made a huge mistake and put my job on the line but i couldnt have done anything else luckily the kids loved him and werent going to do or say anything that would get him banned they were more attentive in class and although word must have spread fairly quickly around campus even if it caused nadia to wonder about my honesty i didnt get called into her office again maybe death had absolved me anyway nobody could blame an innocent animal for the sins of his master and somebody had to look after him i found out that my wolf wasnt the first animal to become an accepted fixture on campus there was a cat in the science department some teachers had brought their dogs and in one case a parrot without causing any trouble over the next few days i learned more about codys death than i really wanted to know probably no death by violence is easy but his had been especially hard it was referred to as a punishment killing with talk of mutilation and torture some people wondered if the wolfmans famous pet had managed to inflict any damage on his killersit might help the police if anyone was reported with unexplained animal bites it was widely assumed that codys wolf must now be dead too such is the fearsome reputation of the wolf few would believe that he would sooner hide or run away than attack armed men i knew better knew it was foolish to judge an animal by human values yet even i couldnt help feeling that lobo had let cody down his response seemed shameful and cowardly the man who had saved his life was dead and the wolf hadnt done a thing to stop his murder hadnt tried to rip his killers throat out and yet if he had attacked armed men hed be dead too and i couldnt bear that although i mourned the loss of the man i could have loved the truth was that id never really known him the wolf to whom id given his name was more real and now even more important to me maybe it was because i now had the responsibility for another life so i couldnt afford to indulge in feeling sorry for myself but the two weeks that followed codys death were rich and interesting full of life hardly a sorrowful time at all at the end of october a norther blew in and as i felt the cold for the first time since leaving chicago i put on my favorite sweater and rustcolored corduroy pants and felt my spirits rise codys mood changed too that day but not like mine for the better he seemed restless distracted and somehow aloof from me not his usual self at all despite a good long run he didnt snooze through class but sat with his ears pricked glancing at the door every now and then as if waiting for someone who never came when a couple of students tried to pet him he retreated under my desk after we got home it was worse he didnt want to stay in the trailer with me but every time i let him out i had to get up again a few minutes later to answer his anxious scratching at the door cody make up your mind i told him its too cold to leave the damn door open tonight a minute later he went out again i settled down to mark some essays and this time i wasnt disturbed for almost an hour when i heard a low but terrible sound outside a deep groan that sounded almost human i jumped up and flung the door open calling his name it was dark outside the profound darkness of night in the country but even deeper than usual because there was no moon a single lowenergy bulb fixed to the right of the doorframe cast a little murky light in a small semicircle around the steps but beyond that i was blind cody i called again my voice strained and cracking with worry cody sweetheart where are you come here cody i hurried down the steps katherine the voice came out of the darkness a voice id never expected to hear again then a man walked out of the darkness and it was cody vela alive stark naked and staring at me with a look that mingled confusion and longing he came closer still close enough to smell and the scent of sweat and musk took me back to the day wed met and stirred the same desire i thought you were dead i cried me too he shivered convulsively and he reached for me at the same moment i reached for him and then we were hugging each other and it was crazy but id never wanted anyone so much in my life and nothing else mattered i could feel that he felt the same way and when he started to nuzzle my neck and his hands moved down to squeeze and caress my bottom i almost fell onto the ground with him but even though he was naked i wasnt and the awkwardness of trying to get undressed was just enough to give me pause and so i managed to pull him inside where it was warm and we could make love in the comfort of my bed the first time was hungry and desperate but after that we were able to take things more slowly indulging in sensuality and exploration teasing and playing until finally resting we talked i expected an explanation a movieworthy plot involving doubles and disinformation or lies and kidnapping but there was nothing like that he had no idea how hed turned up naked and disoriented in the woods outside my trailer his last memory before that was of intense agonizing pain hed been on the edge of death horribly tortured by three men one of whom he knew two hed never seen before but id know them again he said darkly the traumatic memories made him break out in a cold sweat although he spared me the gory details his hands went convulsively to his genitals ears mouth knees chest seeking the remembered damage but he was whole there were no wounds not a trace of any injury as i had already so pleasurably discovered hed switched on the small pinkshaded light on the night table as we talked and it was clear to us both that his lean muscular body was unmarked except for the pale curved line of a very old scar on the side of his neck and a screaming face tattooed on his left bicep i thought about drugs hypnotism false memories but before i could say anything he continued i wanted to die after what theyd done to me i knew i couldnt live but dying was so hellishly slow but then i knew it was happening because the pain wasnt so bad and i couldnt see or hear those bastards taunting me anymorei realized they must have taken me somewhere and left me because i wasnt in my house anymore i wasnt tied to a chair i was curled up on my side on the ground outsidehard earthsticky with blood but not really hurting and lobo was licking my face he reared up in bed alarmed lobo i yelled at him to run when those guys grabbed mebut he must have come back if those bastards got him hes fine i said putting my arms around him and hugging him tight he came here to me the morning that that they said you were dead ive been looking after him hes outsidedo you want me to i started to get up but he pulled me back until we were both lying down again later long as i know hes okay so lobo found you i said and then what the police arrived they took you to the hospital i was struggling to make sense of it he made a small negative movement with his head on the pillow no cops no doctors no hospital just lobo but that wasnt right because he was hugeor i was really littleand he put his head down and picked me up very gently in his mouth i wasnt scared i was glad i relaxed and knew he was going to take care of me i thought id died and been born again as a wolf cubas one of lobos pups i thought i get to have another chance at life this time as a wolf and i thought maybe that would be better than what i was the first time around i said so you died and turned into a wolf he laughed and rolled on top of me does this feel like wolf to you is this fur are these claws is my nose cold he licked my face then kissed me and laughed again im not dead and i am definitely still a man i dont understand neither do i my love im just telling you the last thing i remember i guess it was a dream and i was asleep until i woke up in the dark out there and heard you call my name his face wrinkled in puzzlement how did you know i was there i didnt i thought you were dead i told you i closed my eyes and held on to him as tightly as i could feeling the unmistakable warmth and weight of him pressing me against the bed inhaling his scent yet even still fighting the fear that id lost my mind oh this must be a dream i said sadly does this feel like a dream he asked how about this hmmm surely no dream could ever be so real so physical we made love until sleep overwhelmed us both when i woke the little room was full of daylight and i was alone in a bed with tumbled sheets and the heavy cloying odor of sex he must have just gotten up to go to the bathroom i told myself but anxiety made me sit bolt upright and i couldnt keep it out of my voice as i called cody there blocking the doorway in his customary sleeping spot was the wolf he lifted his head in response to his name and sleepily blinked his amber eyes i recognized the animal i loved but this time i also saw a second awareness a different intelligence looking back at me and i knew i cant say that i understand even now but theres no doubt that the wolf cody rescued was no ordinary animal once upon a time a man called cody saved a wolf later when the man was about to die that wolf saved him taking his soul inside himself i called the wolf cody before i knew how true that was he comes out at the dark of the moon for me its wonderful life has been good to me i have my work the company of my wolf and four nights a month the undivided attention of my lover for him hes told me the wolftime passes like sleep hes conscious he can think like the man he was only during the moondark days and although he loves me dearly theres more to life than love im not afraid of him but there are some bad men out there who should be when you really think about it which is more frightening a man who turns into a wolf or a wolf who becomes a man linnea sinclair a former news

might just cost you your life courting trouble apparently there is nothing that cannot happen today mark twain captain serenity beck knew the very moment things went horribly wrong it happened right between the words confiscate and impound whichthanks to the translator encircling her left earshe heard twice first in nalshinian and the second time in tradestandard we repeat refusal to pay grants us license to confiscate your cargo the bulbous orange triped that bore the title of esteemed dockmaster of jabo station reached forward to stroke the bluetinged holoscreen hovering over his desk an image of the star of pandea appeared in the lower left and if necessary place your ship under impound its not a matter of refusal serri spoke slowly hearing the echo of her cadence through the dockmasters langtrans whichsince nalshinian ears were under the jawdangled around his blubbery neck were a dalvarrlicensed hauler under contract to widestar you have no authority to impose a tariff we have your ship in our bay filar jabbed one stubby digit at the pandeas image setting the metal rings on his billowing sleeves clanking possession captain beck it is eleven points of all law therefore we shall present ourselves at your airlock in thirty minutes to collect the cargo thirty minutes wasnt even enough time to alert the dalvarr trade collective or widestar corporate legal division and filar knew that just as he knew there was no way the pandea had the ability to pay a threehundredthousand credit tariff this wasnt lawful possession this was thinly disguised piracy extortion serri was out of options all she had left was her angerand nothing to lose by unleashing it she fisted her hands at her sides you motherless son of a garpion whore itll be a cold day in hell before ill allow you or your people access to my ship too late she realized the translators vocabulary was limited to trade technical and legal terms his esteemedness looked genuinely puzzled we do not see what climactic conditions have to do with the fact that we have in our possession an order of procurement authorized by the council of jabo station united he wheezed loudly and by the way we have three maternal parents none of whom reside in the garpion sector his four tiny eyes blinked rapidly thirty minutes captain beck serri strode from the office hands still fisted she had thirty minutes to collect her business partner quin and try to figure out why gop filar so desperately wanted the fortyseven containers from widestar that rez jonas assigned to them three shipdays ago she should never have trusted rez but one of quins favorite lectures was that personal grudges had no place at the trading tableespecially grudges with exlovers and exemployers rez and widestar fit both categories quins skoggi senses had picked up nothing duplicitous during the transaction though admittedly rez made only a brief appearance his assistant handling the details unless quin lied about what he sensed no she couldnt believe that quintrek james of daqkyrees detractors had many unkind names for the former high council administrator but liar wasnt one of them if anything quin could be brutally honest and his empathic ability tended to keep others honest as well the fact that quin could read her emotions never bothered herand had proved handy in more than one sticky trade negotiation business was growing enough that after six years as the pandeas pilot shed been able to buy a thirtypercent share of quins transport business two months ago the star of pandea was now her ship too so were the pandeas troubles she spotted quins felinoid form in a booth at the wretched beast one of jabo stations more popular multispecies bars he was large even for a skoggi his head and shoulders clearly visible above the glossy blue tabletop black fur covered his pointed ears wide side ruff and back all the way to his plumy tail but he had a triangle of white over his eyes and muzzle that extended down his chest in almost direct contrast to his fur and his bulk was the wraithlike silverskinned kor in bright yellow robes sitting across from him damn she didnt need an audience to their troubles worse the kor were chronic meddlers and thukzik was no exception if she even hinted something was wrong the yellowrobed male would latch on to her like a highsecurity docking clamp but thukzik was rising even as she approached i must be on my way good trading nom quintrek nomma captain beck he moved away the hem of his robe fluttering as his clawed feet tapped against the metal decking good trading nom serri called after him keeping relief at his departure out of her voice thank you saints and blessed vakare she slid into the booth quin was nudging his bowl of meat tea with one wide furry paw causing the gelatinous liquid to shimmer you should have been here five minutes ago he said with that lilt his voice held when he spoke tradestandard we had quite a chin wag about whos brassed off at whom at widestar trading she glanced over her shoulder to make sure no oneespecially another korwas within earshot then lowered her voice widestar is going to be brassed off at us filar has a grab order with our names on itunless you have a spare three hundred thousand to make him go away he knows damned well we dont hell be at our airlock in twenty minutes the white muzzle raised out of the bowl golden eyes narrowed tailless bastard pay your tab we need to get there before he does the voices in nicandro talligars head were talking to him again it came with the job status asked a familiar gravelly male voice nic tucked himself into the recesses of a maintenance alcove in the corridor outside the wretched beast and flexed his left wrist activating the tympanic implants transmitter filar took the bait any reason to believe he suspects im not brackton he almost told leonoso but held back his case agent didnt need to be reminded of the mission failure at abletrade but nic wasnt depvar brackton hed never blown his cover not in five years not even when threatened with death after what happened at widestar the job was everything to him the agency knew that andhe suspectedused that everythings clean keep it that way next contact in thirtyeight the transmission cut off with the usual sharp click he was about to move out of the alcove when a woman in a dark green flightsuit jogged by her long dark braid swinging across her back the ships patch on her left sleeve was emblazoned with a silver star a very large blackandwhite skoggi in a matching dark green cicommandinterfacevest bounded on all fours by her side the patch on his vest showed an identical silver star nics chest suddenly went tight he recognized and expected to see the skoggi quintrek jamesa familiar name in political circleswas owner of record of the star of pandea a jumprated shorthauler working the ass end of the dalvarr system along with the usual assortment of pirates mercenaries and con artists which was the reason nic talligar was heretracking cargo that the dalvarr intelligence agency had three days ago deliberately placed on board quintrek jamess ship but what in hell was serenity beck doing here the answer was in her green uniform with its silver star emblem on the sleeve she was ships crew very likely ships pilot death threats he could handle but serri beck was troublea seriously unexpected complication and one that made his chest go tight and his breath hitch if nic thought serri disliked him six years ago there was no doubt in his mind that she was really going to hate him now damned shame he couldnt return the favor but six seconds of watching her sprint past him just destroyed six years of his hardwon sanity and might well destroy his career he almost flexed his wrist to contact leonoso but he couldntnot for thirtyeight hours mission rules cursing himself silently he waited for a boxy antigrav cargo autopallet to whirr by before slipping out of the shadows to follow her some rules were about to be broken serri quickly tapped in the codes to open the freighter bays airlock quin bounded through ahead of her tail flicking as if to propel him forward the skoggi raced across the metal decking for the hulking deltoidshaped ship that nearly filled the bay rampway lights triggered by the thoughtreceptors in quins vest winked on as he approached try scrambling the airlock codes to give us time he called out ill bring main systems online theyll fire the ion cannons at us before we even hit the lanes she called back as the airlock door wheezed closed not many stations packed a full complement of ion cannons but jabo had a reputation for using them to prevent captains skipping out on dockage fees quin hesitated in the ships hatchway im not looking to escape but to obfuscate if they cant get in our cargo holds they cant rob us of our cargo there was that serri programmed in a second override to the corridor airlock pad then bolted for the rampway if the manifests were accurate filars interest in their cargo made no sense fortyseven containers of tillithian fermentation essence a small winery operating out of a hydroponics outpost was the documented recipient partial payment was in account on jabo it wasnt the usual setup but they needed to stop for fuel and water anyway even full payment wouldnt cover filars bogus importation tariff anything she asked quinn as she jogged onto the bridge the skoggi was hunkered down in the command sling lights on his ci vest blinking in syncopation with lights on the ships consoles as the vest translated his thoughts into actions on a ship made for humanoid hands not skoggi paws ive jammed the access doors to bays two and three one and four however are being enthusiastically uncooperative and filar wont find it unusual that we cant get into our own cargo holds her partners perfect plan suddenly held huge flaws not when we tell him the winery has the only unlock codes to prevent us from selling the essence elsewhere of course considering that we took prepayment yeah with an invoice for unpaid tariffs served on her as soon as she left the bank serri hated coincidence she just wished coincidence didnt like her so much she leaned her arms on the back of the command sling let me take a look quin knew his ship but serri had learned a few tricks from aonetimefriend whod worked security at widestar and had a talent for things less than legal but if it kept the pandeas cargo in her holds it was worth the heartache of resurrecting nic talligars memory she still didnt know what hurt more the fact that rez jonasher almosthusbandwas having an affair with his sultrybutstupid administrative assistant at widestar or that her closest friend since her university days provided excuses for her almosthusband and sultrybutstupid shed been in love with rez for over two years but shed been friends with nic for seven all rez gave her was heartache and shame at least from nic shed learned something useful like whom she could trust and whom she couldnt with a frustrated sigh she brought up ships schematics losing cargo would not only hamper their ability to get future hauling contracts but it would damage the reputation that quin had worked so hard to rebuild the past ten years if serri could have shed make quin dump the containers on jabos decking and bolt but jabo station packed ion cannons and she had no reason to believe leaving their cargo behind would ensure their safety she had cargo one jammed when the ramp alarms beeped shit the motherless son of a garpion whore is early not filar or his guards quin told her as she tapped on the ships exterior vidcams human male no intention of violence she glanced at quin he was using his skoggi senses to take a reading their visitor might not intend violence but i doublelocked the corridor hatchway how in hell she swung back to the monitors it was as if her illegal tinkering resurrected a ghost the scars on her heart suddenly felt fresh and raw her onetime close friend hadnt changed much in six years though his short dark hair looked a bit shaggier and he was definitely in need of a shave but instead of a light green widestar security uniform he was in a black spacer jacket and dark pants shed bet however that his infamous charm hadnt changed one bit his lockpicking skills certainly hadnt lapsed you know him she could tell by quins concerned tone that hed felt her surge of emotions he was friends with rez jonas when we all worked for widestar perhaps rez sent him or he needs a job let him in she hesitated her mind seizing on something so bizarre she couldnt discount it she couldnt believewell yeah she couldthat six years after she walked out on rez hed still hold a grudge but if rez jonas wanted to get revenge using his new position as widestars director of sector three exports was a terrific way to do it sector threethe outrim region of the dalvarr systemwas the pandeas main territory quin has it occurred to you that rez might have set us up all the more reason i wish to speak with this friend of yours she shoved herself out of the command sling if quin was hurt because of some juvenile plan of rezs to get back at her she swore shed hunt the man down and pummel him out of existence we have only ten minutes see if you cant jam cargo four she grabbed her z laser rifle from the bridges weapons locker then headed quickly down the corridor to find out just what nic talligar was doing on her rampwayand back in her life if youre here for a job were not hiring nic studied captain serri beck standing in the pandeas airlock and knew without a doubt that he was courting trouble it wasnt just her tone it was the lethal z in her hands best to get right to the point filars bruisers are on the way here he told her as she stared at him her dark eyes hard and cold he remembered lights dancing in those same eyes her demeanor playful impish that playfulness was gone but her ability to spark his emotions wasnt he forced his focus from her to the shadowy airlock we dont have much time you can shoot me when this is finished ammos pricey these days spacing you would be cheaper but she motioned him through the airlock with a hard jerk of the rifles tip he hesitated a thousand things he wanted to say dying on his tongue things he should have said six years ago things he still couldnt find a way to say now he stepped past her into the freighters interiorthe usual gray serviceable bulkheads with yellowstriped conduit crisscrossing overhead his bootsteps clanked in time to hers on the decking gridwork something trilled and beeped farther down the corridor i can help but you need to trust me he knew that was asking a lot thats up to quin not me he nodded and moved on with the feeling that if it had been up to her she would have shot him on the rampway it didnt surprise him that serenity beck had hooked up with quintrek james of daqkyree nic knew quintreks history and the rumors surrounding the former royal advisers resignation a decade ago he couldnt bring the details of the scandal to mind only that quintrek had walked away from a powerful and prestigious position on the skoggi high council serri like quintrek had a strong sense of justice but unlike quintrek she hadnt waited to review all the evidence if she had her life might well have been different nics life he pushed the thought away he couldnt change the past the only thing he could do was to help her and quintrek nowand try not to blow the mission in the process quin this is nicandro talligar serri said as they stepped over the hatch tread and onto the bridge nic inclined his head in respect to the skoggi perched in the command sling an honor esteemed of pride daqkyree a wide paw resplendent with furry white tufts waved dismissively piffle little honor in being caught in filars claws tell me what rez jonas should have but didnt quin turned toward serri cargo four wont lock on it she swung away pushing the rifle to one side as she dropped into a chair in front of a console wait you have to let filar take the cargo nic said as serri angled back toward him i know thats not what you want to hear think of it as a temporary inconvenience on the way to solving a larger problem dark narrowed eyes peered up at him the larger problem is filars threatening to impound this ship talligar he wont go that far trust me he will and i dont trust you neither does quin dumping cargo doesnt engender client loyalty quin intoned there wont be clients shipping anywhere in sector three if we dont find out what filars up to nic countered youre not the first to get hit with this scheme but we tagged your cargo and can track it to whoever filar sends it towhich is who we suspect is behind this quins whiskers twitched but he was nodding i take it we is more than you and rez jonas nic had briefly considered using that as cover and probably could have convinced the empathic skoggi that it was the truth that was after all part of his job but nics lies to serriand the way rez jonas used heralways haunted him she deserved honesty this time jonas has no idea im here im a special agent with the dias organized crime squad cover blown he could almost hear his boss roaring in anger from her plush offices at hq more than halfway across the dalvarr system adding his name next to bracktons on her list of incompetents he heard serris snort of disbelief instead thats a great pickup line but we dont have time for trouble quin said harshly pointing to one of the screens on an opposite console where a line of hulking redsuited breffans shoved through the freighter bays hatchlock ramcannons in hands filars bruisers have arrived serri listened as quinbeing typically quinpeppered the orangefreckled bruiser chief with questions but whether quin was playing the part that nic had asked him to or whether he discounted nics story and was actually trying to save their assesand their cargoserri couldnt tell serri being typically serri vacillated between righteous anger and an unexpectedand ridiculousfeeling of relief at nics presence by her side she didnt know what to make of nics story but the fact that she didnt trust him didnt blind her to other facts he was intelligent resourceful and had a definite talent for unorthodox solutions they needed one of thosedesperatelyright now quins arguments were changing nothing the breffans didnt care about the legitimacy of the order they served not surprising considering that the broadbodied leatheryskinned freckled breffans werent used in security for their empathy but for their multilimbed dexterity the purplefreckled female guard holding a rifle on serri and nic also held a pistol and a transcomm in two of her other three handsif serri as much as made a twitch for the rifle slung across her back the guard could shoot her dead with two different weapons the guards fourth hand scratched lazily at her left thigh the breffan chief finally stalked away clomping noisily up the pandeas rampway in counterpoint to the pandeas cargo flowing out of her holds with a shake of his head quin padded back over to where she and nic stood then sat on his haunches serri knew that he wouldnt discuss anything in front of the guard she glanced down at him he mirrored her frown with a slight narrowing of his eyes one ear twitched flattening quin was not happy neither was serri for all the things she didnt know there was one thing she did nic talligar knew more than he was saying about filar and rez jonas minutes later noise from the pandeas airlock drew her attention the orangefreckled breffan chief clomped back down the rampway cannon in one hand datapad in another his remaining two arms stiffly at his side with an annoyed grunt he went down on one knee so that his face and quins were almost level paw print here he held out the datapad i shall read it first quins voice held a haughty tone that serri knew went back to his council days if youd like to sit ill wait the chief said its only the basic onepage transfer of ownership transfer of ownership not transfer impound shock roiled through her theyd already given up the cargo as nic told them to and now this serri felt sick shed trusted nic again and been betrayed again quins whiskers quivered as his paw hovered over the screen this is beastly we shall be filing a criminal complaint against this station the chief shrugged boss says since we got the cargo he can be generous for a mere hundred fifty thousand hell drop impound charges and you can keep the ship quins paw jerked bugger nic stepped forward deal deal serris voice rasped as she swung toward him what kind of game was this now or maybe not a game at all but the truth coming out nic wasnt trying to help them he wasnt a dia agent trying to stop filar he was working for filar extorting as much as he could out of quin but we need time nic was saying to transfer the funds the breffan tapped his datapad fifteen minutes two hours thirty minutes hour and a half hour deal more taps on the datapad paw print here confirming payment at the dockmasters office in one hour the chief said to quin quin glanced at nic then with the slightest of nods slapped his paw down dont even think about trying to leave without paying the chief said shoving the datapad back into his utility belt cannonsll pick you off before youre even halfway to the outer beacon understood quinn said the chief nodded and with purplefreckles in tow and the rest of his team filing out behind them headed for the corridor serri waited until the airlock door groaned closed what in hells going on we dont have a hundred fifty thousand credits she glanced from nic to quinn then back to nic again they took the cargo deed done now go arrest them or whatever it is you do and get us our ship back discomfort colored nics features his brows angling down i cant do that ill catch hell as it is because you know who i am but it would jeopardize the entire mission if station admin finds out i take it that means the dia isnt giving us a loan i dont have the authority then what in hell are quin and i supposed to do rob a bank she didnt try to keep the sarcasm out of her words dont have to nic said filar cant extort money from you if youre not on station abandon the pandea youre asking us to walk away not walk climb six levels up to the auxiliary maintenance grid so i can disable the stations weapons system this was beyond unorthodox the man was insane youre going to dismantle an entire bank of ion cannons nope he pulled out a thin microcomp from an inside pocket of his jacket i just have to shut down the stations ability to fire them serris mind whirled not you she pointed to herself then to nic us i cant youre not trained weapons systems computers sure as hell am talligar or are you forgetting who was your study and sim partner in the university serri this is dangerous and this is my ship and quins my partner im not stupid enough to let you stroll out of here with only your word as guarantee i had a taste of your trustworthiness six years ago thank you very much she tugged her rifle forward im going with you or youre going nowhere he looked hurt quin trusts me i feel your plan has merit quin admitted and empathically i sense no duplicity from you but i agree with captain beck we have far more to lose than you do he nodded i trust you will do all you can to keep her safe and i trust she will do all she can to keep you honest serri raised her chin and looked at nic in triumph it meant something that quin believed him she wasnt ready yet to grant him that luxury though filar may have watchers out nic told serri as they strode for the stairwell he kept his voice low and even which was more than he could do for his emotions he was annoyed he was angry his own career be damned the one thing he did not want to do was put serri in further danger and now he had it didnt make him feel any better that he was armed and so was shethough shed left the larger rifle with quin opting for a more easily concealable pistol we need to let them see us enter the bank as if were securing a loan then we slip out the side door and use the maintenance core catwalks from there just like scoutandsnipe he huffed out a hard laugh at her comment a bit more dangerous but yeah hed met serri playing the holosim game while at the university impressed with her skills he recruited her to his teamthe best decision he ever made a year later he recruited rez jonas the worst decision he ever made why does the dia care about filar okay hes dirty but jabo stations had that reputation for decades what are you really doing here definitely not what hed been sent to doincluding blowing his cover he waited until two human dockworkers and a kortish male in garish yellow robes clambered down the stairs and out of earshot its one thing when pirates get into pissing contests with rival factions its another when legit haulers get hit with an extortion scam and yes i really do work for the dia they recruited me a few months after you left serri never even said goodbye never gave him a chance to explain why hed kept her busy and away from jonas all those months he glanced over at her as they climbed chancing a bit of honesty as painful as he knew it was going to be there was no reason for me to stay at widestar you were gone something flashed in her eyes im sure rez had other infidelities you could have helped him cover up theyd reached the next levelone more and theyd exit into the corridor then head for the bank nic kept his senses tuned to anyone coming up behind them it was in filars best interest to let them retrieve the supposed funds but this was jabo station filar wasnt the only thug just one of the bigger ones given that hed picked one hell of a time to initiate this discussion i never meant to hurt you well you did she pushed ahead of him he kept to the right side of the heavily trafficked passageway tucking them as much as possible between larger groups as they headed for the banks main entrance off corridor supreme if filar had his bruisers following them nic didnt see any that filar could be following them on security vidcams was a definite possibility it was the reason nic chose sector united the vidcams in corridor supreme were the least effective and not just because of the crowds but because two popular pleasure houses there paid good money not to be recorded sector united was crowdedit was the only bank onstation that was multispeciesfriendly including a private office for methane breathers and deckinglevel teller terminals for fourlegged patrons like skoggi he guided serri past the currencyexchange kiosk then spotted a vacant space along a side wall he nudged her quickly in that direction they needed to look as if they waited for a loan officer serri im sorry he said as she wedged herself between a fake redsprout tree on her right and a tall blinking advert pillar on her left she brushed a synthfrond off her head im okay no about rez and his affair with janna it was rez i wanted to hurt not you never you he didnt know why it was so important to tell her that now but it was he suddenly had a bad feeling about this mission and about what exactly hed have to do to make sure serri and quin got off station alive and in possession of their ship emotions played over her face her eyes darkening her mouth parting slightly he had to force himself to look away from all that from what it made him want to do because they now had fortythree minutes to get up four more levels pull the plug on station defenses and get back down to the pandea before alarms started wailing and before filars breffan bruisers figured out just what hed wanted that extra hour for suddenly she grasped his forearms pulling him closer nic was very aware that he had three minutes to spare and that three minutes wasnt nearly time enough to kiss serri like he wanted to people in hell want ice water his grandfather always used to say hed take what he could get but her face didnt hold a look of passion but concern a pair of bruisers just came in nic shot a quick glance over his shoulder time to disappear side exit go she threaded her way through the crowd of bank patrons he took one last look at guardsthe breffans hadnt seen them he was sureand then followed on her heels cursing silently he should have demanded more time there was a maintenance storage room about fifty feet to the left of the bank at least there had been two years ago which was the last time nic was on jabo station but when they came around the curve in the corridor something else had been added two more reduniformed bruisers one leaned against the bulkhead checking something on a transcomm in his upper left hand the other watched the crowd through narrowed eyes he pulled serri behind a pylon theyre looking for us she said it wasnt a question theyre also blocking access to the maintenance core where they would have been able to continue with much less chance of being seen there must be others thats the closest workable one on this level that i have the code for since when do you need a code for a lock since we only have forty minutes to do what we have to and get back one of the breffan guards raised his face peering over the crowd of stationers spotting them nic couldnt take the chance the guard was already heading toward them nic put his arm around her shoulders aware now of movement to their left a deep voice shouting then a sharp trill of high laughter looks like someones on his way to a party he told her turning her quickly toward the group of drunken revelers lets go crash it they stank someonemore than one someone serri guessed with fair accuracy wrinkling her nosehad spilled sour ale on his clothes and another someone standing far too close to her and nic had pissed on himself or herself crammed into the small lift as they werea nonstop to level tenthere was nowhere to get away from the stench and the harsh laughter and vakarebedamned if that bastard behind her patted her ass one more time she was going to ignore nics admonition to blend in and clock the drunk right across his drooling face she inched closer to nic regretting that too because he smelled clean like soap and leather and well like the nic talligar she remembered it was rez i wanted to hurt not you she played his words over in her mind as she listened to nic ramble on in an unintelligible conversation with several of the drunks his newfound friends there was no escape not from the drunken dockworkers headed for the crimson flask on level ten and not from nic talligar who never wanted to hurt her so he said he never hurt you before he was your best friend but how in hell was helping rez cover his affair with janna hurting rez if she lived through this she was going to sit nic down and demand an answer and have quin there to make sure nic didnt lie though she might suffocate from the noxious fumes before that happened she gave up and leaned her face against nics jacket and was surprised when his arms came tightly around her and even more surprised to feel his mouth brush the side of her forehead hes playacting were just another pair of drunks headed for someones party but being held by nic felt good and it wasnt just because he smelled good it was because he was nic her onetime closest friend she never wanted to see again ever this was definitely not good the lift shimmied to a stop doors opening the whooping and laughing increased along with general mayhem as the partygoers stumbled toward the bars entrance she and nic stumbled along with them suddenly he yanked her sideways hey partys this way someone called out be righ there nic called back words slurred as he swayed against her gotta puke that elicited a chorus of groans and epithets as nic bent over one hand braced against the wall arm around my shoulder block their view his voice was low urgent she steadied him and realized he didnt want his new friends to see the tiny decoder in his hand he was picking the lock on a door clearly marked no admittance i really dont think they care she said quietly meaning that he was accessing the door not that he was pretending to be sick anyone watching she turned slightly the line of dockworkers in the corridor had dwindled nope he shoved the door open and pulled her inside they care he said closing the door extinguishing all light then light flared nic with a small handbeam they were in a storage closet they care he repeated you ever know a jabo dockworker who could afford drinks on the house for fifty people at the first bar and now a second party here someones rich relative died he shook his head and played the beam around the room the woman with the long white braids on the lift with us is our hostess got paid good money for doing something interestingly illegal and it involves filched cargo and bogus tariffs she works for filar no rez jonas he focused the beam on another door on the left wall this way her mind frantically processed the information and refused to let her feet move but why would he risk his own cargo hes working with you isnt he he grabbed her wrist and pulled her forward i dont know and no hes not he said putting the decoder against the door jonas had no idea were tracking his cargo yours is one of several shipments the dia tagged at the source some ended up at abletrade some went to fortune exports and some to widestar the door unlocked with a low pinging sound we didnt know where the problem was now i think we do but why would he want his own cargo stolen he ushered her through the door into a dimly lit room that wasnt a room at all but an open hangarlike area crisscrossed with catwalks ladders maintenance tunnels and accessways that comprised the stations core i can think of a dozen reasons ranging from kickbacks to idiotic corporate backstabbing nic said shoving his handbeam and decoder back onto his utility belt but what worries me more is whether jonas knew you were piloting the pandea she followed him toward a descending catwalk that she hoped was sturdier than it looked he was at the depot when we took consignment but he didnt stay long i thought he was still uncomfortable around me my guess is he was uncomfortable with your skoggi partner who might sense something was wrong like the fact jonas was targeting you targeting she grasped the handrail on the catwalk to steady herself why would he target us we need to keep moving he touched her shoulder gently again i dont know it could be hes still pissed because you walked out in the middle of his fancy engagement party after shed tossed photos around the party of rez and janna writhing on top of a widestar boardroom conference table shed heard later he almost lost his job and she never did figure out who to thank for sending her the damning images and yours is the only ship under threat of impound nic was saying that could be filars doing all our intelligence to date shows that filar is just the front end rez wanted you and quin to do the jabo run he wanted you here today serri saw that so clearly filar had the seizure papers waiting for me my point rez knows youd fight forfeiting your ship and also knows you dont have the money to pay filars ransom the banks were probably told to deny you a loan our mistakeand it was a big onewas that we didnt even try to get the funds filar now knows you have no intention of paying so hes wondering if youre going to break dock and take a chance the ion cannons just might miss he hesitated then or maybe thats exactly what jonas wants you to do rez wants me dead her voice sounded suddenly hollow he turned and looked back at her his eyes dark i have no intention of letting that happen she realized that shed stopped again she quickened her steps to catch up to him her boots clanging dully on the metal gridwork saints help them quin what if filar or whoever rez had here on station made a move against the pandea but quin could sense anyone entering the bay sense their intentions granted only in a general capacity he was skoggi not some magical mystical creature but serri had to believe that someone intent on killing would be broadcasting very intense emotions still i need to warn quin if theyre monitoring transmissions you might be endangering a sudden clanking sounded above them serris heart rate spiked nic shoved her to her knees then dropped down beside her pistol out she drew hers and stared up toward the sound peripherally aware of nic checking all around them he was right this was far more dangerous than scoutandsnipe and immeasurably more important the security training widestar put all their pilots through seemed woefully insufficient a few more clanks and pings punctuated by bootsteps through the uneven lighting dotting the stairlike catwalks serri could discern a form moving on a platform about two levels above she didnt know whether to hunker down and make herself appear smaller or tense her body and get ready to run after another series of pings nic leaned toward her mouth against her ear repair worker should leave a loud clang now he rose one hand on her arm bringing her with him if youre going to contact quin make it quick she pulled out her transcomm as nick trotted carefully back down the catwalk she moved as he did and kept her voice low quintrek captain beck here ran into thukzik i think youve locked up the market on gossip you were deadon right about those rumors she cut the transmission praying quin would pick out the keywords in her unlikely and uncharacteristic message praying he was still alive and on board to even receive it three minutes well maybe five but no more than that nic had five minutes to open the auxiliary maintenance compartment without setting off any alarms he went down on one knee running the small decoder over the doors locking mechanism which was housed about six inches below the palm pad and ident reader anything serri asked softly behind him its a drammond sixkone he swept the decoder in an arc good antipick deterrents doubleback code verifier nice nic weve got twenty minutes we have four if i cant get this open in four the rest of those minutes wont matter he brought up a sequence but the k wasnt interested damn it he tried a second then a third he could feel serris concern and impatience she was worried about quin he was worried because he was working blind and not just because he couldnt get a damned code fix on the damned k it was because he had no clear concept of what rez jonas was up to only that it wasnt what either he or his boss had expected but without filing a sitrep he couldnt get answers from agency intel of course filing a sitrep now would set off more alarms than sloppily picking the damned lock would pay attention nicandro reverse those two parameters he glanced to his right and almost bumped noses with serri what those two she pointed to the small screen have you forgotten what you taught me back at widestar thats a loop created by an inaccessible exit command he wasted another second to stare at her in amazementand admirationthen reversed the two parameters and got to work were in the snickclick of a wellpicked lock never sounded so good he would have kissed her but there was no time plus she was angry enough at him as it was ten minutes max the room was little more than a dimly lit narrow closet about twelve feet wide it wasnt the usual auxiliary control system but an unmanned maintenance substation that serviced nonenvironmental systems newer stations no longer used them because of their potential overall vulnerability but jabo had been here for more than a half a century and filar and his predecessors were kept busy with rival pirate factions zapping each other in the corridors the fact that someone might be able to compromise a few of the stations nonenvironmental systems was farther down on the list of concerns nic hoped serri had already angled a console screen around that displayed system status three intruder traps i see them can you first ones already diverted he realized then that she had a slim strafer pen in her fingers later hed ask her just what a nice girl like serenity beck was doing with such a delightfully illegal device he prayed they had a later for now he let her work her record for unraveling code traps in scoutandsnipe had been damned near flawless shit she pulled the pen back abruptly angling it away from the screen a searcher worm someone had upgraded the stations security programs recently i can create a subprogram to distract it she said if we have enough time they didnt frustration flooded him options serri let the ship go ill do everything i can to get you and quin safely back insystem her lips thinned thats no option i could get another job but quin put everything he had into the pandea she hesitated the bad guys must have the cargo by now case solved just go tell station admin who you are make them give me my ship back it sounded so easy it would be so easy there was a dia stealth ship full of enforcement agents two hours out that could definitely provide the muscle but that was something else he wasnt permitted to reveal for at least another thirtyfive hours serri if i could i would i cant please the desperation in her voice tore at him he wiped one hand over his face the best i could do is release some data so that you can prove a case against jonas you could get an attorney to file a civil case for damages when a year two three didnt you hear me quin has no resources left financially and emotionally ive worked with him for six years hes the kindest most honorable most decent being ive ever met but since those death threats death threats he knew the entire file on the skoggi it didnt contain any threats or the agency would have pulled the tagged cargo off the pandea knowing a secondary problem would muddy the investigation because of old news his resignation from the council he said it was probably just a sick joke especially after all this time damn it nic spun for the door angry at hq for sloppy research angry at serri for not telling him sooner and angry at himself for not asking all the questions he knew that he should have but didnt finding serri again restarted his heart but shut down his brain this could be the real reason jonas assigned the cargo to your ship but why would rez care about skoggi politics because rez jonass maternal grandfather was manton suthis the details on quintrek james that eluded him earlier came back now with blinding clarity suthis was the attorney for a dalvarrian mining cooperative that allegedly funneled illegal political contributions to key skoggi administrators ten years ago in exchange for government contracts she stared at him quin never mentioned names just that he had proof but the court refused to investigate that didnt stop suthis from committing suicide and rez nic remembered had always been devoted to his grandparents his devotion might now have taken a deadly twist serri stepped toward him quin ill take care of quin i need you to skew that weapons program when youre on your way down to the ship comm me if i dont give you the allclearand he hesitated then pulled out his transcomm knowing that she wasnt going to like this option knowing that his boss would like it even lesscontact director jessamyn emory at dia headquarters he rattled off a private comm number sending it to serris transcomm at the same time shell get you offstation her lips parted fear and something else flickering across her features a concern a compassion that reminded him of the old serri his closest friend the woman hed loved in secret for years nic his chest tightened youre still my best friend would make him deliriously happy maybe then hed have a chance but hed settle for i dont hate you as much as i used to i be careful comm me and keep the safety off your pistol he slipped out the door then bolted for the catwalks serri hated searcher worm code more than that she hated that shed left quin alone and vulnerable and that nic might even now be too late she could lose them both the thought came and went because she didnt have time for pity though her heart ached and her throat felt tight she had a searcher worm to choke and a weapons guidance program to screw up it took ten minutes before the worm choked the program freezing up long enough for her to launch a worm of her own into the ion cannons guidance system it wasnt her best work it would unravel in about an hour leaving station techs swearing at yet another inexplicable program malfunction that suddenly restored itself but it bought her quin and nic time she slipped out of the maintenance compartment into the shadowy cavernous core of catwalks and access tunnels twenty minutes had passed since nic left she sent nic a brief on my way then moved as quickly as she could down the rickety catwalk stairs transcomm still in hand as she listened for a confirmation back from him she needed to know that quin was safe and nic his reappearance after all this time set off emotions in her she wasnt sure what to do with maybe he hadnt been trying to hurt her when hed covered up rezs infidelity maybe he was simply caught between two people he cared about and didnt know what to do or maybe her transcomm pinged nic but no it showed quins ident then the signal disconnected if it was an error hed call back but she didnt for a moment think thats what it was she quickened her pace abandoning her intention of using the main corridors shed stay in the relative safety of the maintenance rampways and tunnels until she was sure what was going on why hadnt nic confirmed back to her another ping quin again this time the screen stayed lit there were the low sounds of someone talking many of the words distorted quin must have activated his transcomm through his ci vest and was letting her know what was going on in the pandeas bay without others in the bay realizing that hed done so still moving quickly she strained to catch snippets of conversationno threatsbetween quin and gop filar then heart pounding she broke into a run because there was one thing she didnt hear along with the threats nics voice he should have reached quin by now and she didnt know if she was more worried that he hadntor that he had because filars you are out of options went right to the pit of her stomach it sounded as if someone had tried and failed nic couldnt fail he was a dia agent he was trained he was someone she cared ohsodeeply abouteven if she didnt want to admit that to herself she reached the first level of freighter bays if she exited through the yellowringed maintenance panel on her right shed be about thirty feet from the pandeas airlock though the only voices she could hear through quins open transcomm were his and filars filar could have the bay full of his bruisers barging in was a move she wouldnt even do in scoutandsnipe let alone in real life but she could take advantage of the way the freighter levels were structured with maintenance pits underneath each bay she bolted down half a level quin was still arguing that gave her hope she found the pit for the pandeas bay checked it for alarms and finding none pocketed her transcomm then turned the manual lock the panel was heavy but she only needed it open far enough to slip through she went into scoutandsnipe mode listening sensing nothing but the creak groan and whoosh of the station and the lingering scent of grease she stepped into the shadowed pit her eyes picking out pinpoints of light from the various control consoles on the far bulkhead a slight exhalation of breath whispered behind her she flinched fear spiking her fingers fumbling for her pistol just as a hand covered her mouth an arm wrapped hard around her midsection pinning her arms heart pounding she twisted trying to free one arm so she could serri her name hushed in her ear nics voice nic the arm loosened the hand pulled away she spun right hand fisted her breath coming in hard gasps as she stared at the familiar lines of nics face in the dim lighting relief poured through her why didnt you answer my message your transcomms off line he kept his voice low not off line she yanked it out quin she whispered handing it to him he listened for a moment nodding then tugged her forward his free hand on her wrist all right well come up underneath the ship use the rampway as partial cover did you get the targeting programs skewed we have about fortyfive minutes before theyll reset what happened with quin filar and three guards were in the pandeas airlock when i got there he explained as they trotted toward the far side of the bay quin refused to leave the ship until about five minutes ago thats when he called me he should have stayed onboard she heard worry and frustration in the tight tone of his voice hes skoggi he can sense you he doesnt want us locked out of our own ship if hes on the ramp then hes telling us its time to break dock and leave i have every intention of granting his wish hed just better not mind an extra passenger she didnt want to know why his words made her heart beat faster i assumed you were coming not just me filar he slowed as they neared a set of tall servostairs then motioned her behind him im on point set your pistol to stun only i want that bastard alive and spilling everything he knows about rez jonas they were going to kidnap the jabo station dockmaster you cant possibly be the crystal flame scenario scoutandsnipe she remembered nic we never got past level seven in that one this time though were going all the way his wry grin was confident even in the low lighting trust me she had to they were out of options and almost out of time the ion cannons would come back online in forty minutes the servostairs were rickety and once nic reached the halfway point no longer lit by the dim illumination of the pits emergency lights overhead a series of movable hatchways were crisscrossed by cables and pulleys and dangling things thatin spite of the narrow light offered by his handbeammanaged to gouge his shoulders and his back serri didnt fare much better more than once he heard her sharp intake of breath he was leading a civilian into a potential firefight violating a halfdozen dia regs he could quote from memory but his distinct uneasiness had nothing to do with those regs it wasnt that he doubted serri serenity beck could be tough when tough was needed it was that she was serri and he would do everything he could to protect her even if it meant his own life there was a reason the crystal flame scenario was so difficult to complete it was because level eight set up a doordie situation sacrifice a team member or go back to level one the top of the servostairs widened into a platform he clambered up then guided serri next to him she had the transcomm to her ear status quins switching between trade and skoge its making filars translang crazy but it sounds like quins trying to bribe him keep listening some of what hes saying is likely aimed at us he ran his fingers over the gritty pitted metal panels inches over his head feeling for a manual release he found it pulled and was rewarded by a soft double click it was open his heart hammered he took a deep breath he had to forget for now that serri was serri this was the mission he was a professional personalitieshell his hearts desirecould not come into play quins telling filar that he has a collection of nonga vases he can show him onboard nic glanced at her it was exactly where he wanted the nalshinian dockmaster locked in the pandeas brig you sure quins not telepathic you know as much about the skoggi as i do is filar going she was silent then sounds like it heres what we do crystal flame level seven we stun whatever bruisers are outside the ship then you watch in case backup arrives ill take care of filar and his escort wrong talligar its my ship we take out the guards then im on point i think i know where quins leading filar so we can trap him you could tell me were wasting time thirtyfive minutes before those cannons come back on line shit hed forgotten about that he pointed to her transcomm anything more she was frowning signals disconnected i dont like it neither did he but rushing into this could be fatal he carefully slid the portal panel to the left pinpointing the locations of at least two guards by their noises now he whispered and shoved himself through the freighter bay seemed almost dirtsidedaylight bright to his eyes even with the large ship hulking above him he assessed his position immediately spotting the two guards about twentyfive feet from the end of the rampway just inside the bays safe zone good theyd be locked behind a blast wall when the ship powered up he crouched quickly next to a landing strut feeling serri behind him he motioned for her to take out the one on the left a quick glance showed her pistol raised he took aim they had to fire at the same time or risk retaliation now he whispered again he fired aware of the low hum from her pistol in tandem with his he hit the guard on the right center mass but serris guard turned and her stun charge hit him in the shoulder his guard dropped like a crate of unsecured cargo but hers twisted falling to one knee as one hand raised a pistol and another punched something on his transcomm serri fired again taking the guard center mass this time the big breffan landed on his back pistol and transcomm clattering beside him nic lunged to his feet swearing silently we have to assume he set off an emergency signal he said as serri appeared next to him tell me where quin no time she pushed ahead of him and ran up the rampway he caught up with her at the airlock stand clear her fingers tapped a pattern into the lockpads small screen filars got a bruiser with him then hes coming for a ride too the airlock doors groaned shut behind him he grabbed her arm we could end up with a hostage standoff just like scoutandsnipe theyve got quin and the nalshinian and the breffan were both much larger than the skoggiprobably the sole reason other than greed that theyd agreed to come onboard i know how to handle this he continued tersely you dont where are they she hesitated for half a breath either his quarterslower deck starboard forwardor cargo two starboard aft i vote for the latter it has a nullfield generator for hazardous cargo kills transcomm signals so filar cant call for help quins signal had ended abruptly he hoped that it was because of the nullfield he moved past her for the ladderway then she was right beside him damn it reaching the small compartment at the base of the ladderway before he did she poked at a control panel set into the bulkhead and motioned him forward she kept her voice low cargo holds have a refrigeration option and freezing temperatures put breffans into hibernation mode how long until five minutes on temperature thirty on cannons he could hear tension in her whispered words saw anxiety in the thin line of her lips he held up one hand we go barreling down that corridor we could both get killed wait he crouched down and edged around the corner the corridor ran most of the length of the ship with access to cargo four the closest to their location he damned the fact that he hadnt brought a thermal sensor or miniature spybots but this was just supposed to be a preliminary mission to make sure the tagged cargo left the station amazing how many things could go wrong in so short a span of time and so right he glanced back over his shoulder serri he drew a quick breath any noise hit the deck understand she nodded though he doubted shed comply he softfooted across the corridor serri at his back he hesitated in the hatchway for cargo four then with a sharp wave of his hand to serri moved again ten fifteen strides watching back and front closer now he heard sounds hard sounds but definitely voices which meant the hatchway to cargo two was open which meant serris hibernation ploy wouldnt work oh the cold would slow the breffan down but he wouldnt be woozy on his feet and nic wanted him woozy multilimbed breffans had an obvious advantage in a firefight a sharp clank like the top of a metal container slamming down echoed nic hesitated no more time a voice boomed filars we have not seen anything of value your ship a few more moments your esteemedness that was quin definitely if i cant find the matched set of thirtyninth century nonga vaseswhich i swear are in here somewherethen i know i can find yes here they are look now serri whispered urgently but nic was already moving forward quin was skoggi so quin knew they were there and if he had filar peering inside a cargo container this was going to be the bestand possibly onlychance theyd get to make a surprise entrance nic charged through the open hatchway adrenaline spiking pistol primed and ready as he took in the location of everyone and everything in the hold quinhunkered down on a low set of servostairs to the right of a very large open cargo container the orangefreckled breffan guard on the left on tiptoe half leaning over the edge in the middle were enormous buttocks draped in purple diaphanous trousers that ended in three booted feet firmly planted on the top of a second set of servostairs the breffan jerked back from the edge of the container eyes wide one arm rising but the rapidly chilling air made his movements sluggish freeze nic bellowed wishing it actually was freezing in the hold or your boss wont be sitting anytime soon its not like you could miss serri intoned on his left a loud wheeze vibrated in the container as the purple trousers wriggled and filar struggled to right himself we demand to know filars words ended in a shout of surprise as the servostairs under his feet collapsed nic caught lights flashings on quins ci vest and a quick twitch of whiskers as filar legs flailing pitched headfirst into the container your esteemedness the breffan angled one arm over the edge dont move serri took a few steps closer pistol grasped securely in both hands if hes hurt piffle its mostly quilts and draperies in there quin said a short kip would do him good a roar of unintelligible nalshinian served as filars contribution to the conversation quin clambered down the stairs tail flicking on your knees nic aimed his pistol at the guards head then on your stomach arms out youre crazy the breffan said switching a threatening look between nic and serri and you and your boss are in a shitload of trouble nic continued down now the breffan charged a hulking multiarmed form one hand snagging serris arm she stumbled but there was no clear shotand no choice nic fired his stunner the guard fell taking serri with him arms and legs tangled thrashing serri nics heart felt as if it were in his throat he grabbed a handful of red fabric and yanked the breffan backward the guard rolled on the decking with a soft gurgle and flailing of limp arms shit serri angled up on one elbow coughing as nic holstered his pistol he dropped to his knees by her side guess he played scoutandsnipe too guard takes agent as hostage is level seven crystal flame and in level seven the hostage often died but nic didnt give a damn about simgames right now you all right ill have some interesting bruises tomorrow she swung her legs around but nic had her arms lifting her easily he wanted to hold her tightly against him so that he could feel her heartbeat nic eighteen minutes he released her with undisguised reluctance bridge get moving quin and i will be right behind you she holstered her pistol and darted out into the corridor as her bootsteps faded nic pulled handcuffs from his belt and secured the breffans upper arms quin trotted over with a packing strap to bind the lower ones nic pulled two pistols and a laserblade from the guards weapons belt stuffing them into his own thumping thudding and wheezing noises sounded from inside the large container filar jumping but unable to reach the top a cargo net should keep him secure a small light flashed on quins vest a grinding noise from above heralded a suspended sheet of metallic mesh dropping over the container and the chill temperatures would keep the cuffed breffan from waking too soon the ship rumbled under nics boots serri bringing the engines online quin bounded for the corridor nic followed keeping pace so you intend to tell her quin asked as they neared the ladderway to the bridge deck nic slowed tell a heartfelt talligar she needs to know unless you want to wait another six years he shot a suspicious glance at quin mind reader maybe nic wasnt the only one with voices in his head i dont think she wants to know piffle quin leaped up the stairs two at a time leaving nic wonderingand running to keep up quin was already at communications when nic slipped into the seat at the nav console the skoggis ci vest blinked rapidly sending and receiving commands noisy chatter sounded in spurts from the speakers mostly perfunctory warnings from station traffic control then quin pulled on a headset and the voices quieted strap in serri called out over her shoulder this is going to be rough through the forward viewports lights flashed the bay doors parted revealing blackness dotted with lights from other ships somewhere out there was the agencys stealth ship it would be so easy to contact it for assistance and hed spend the rest of his career chained to a deskin the remotest sector in the dalvarr system where no sane sentient would ever want to be quin broadcast an emergency getclear on the freighter channels serri was saying without turning from her console we need to get as far away as we can in ten minutes i dont want to plow through anyone in the process sending quin said nic did a quick mental calculation as quins vest flickered will we be out of range of the cannons in ten minutes itll be close serri fired the lifting thrusters the ship vibrated plumes of dust and debris swirled past the viewscreens close could be fatal and nic again damned the fact that his hands were tied by his undercover status it looked as if this plan could fail as miserably as the one six years ago that was meant to keep serri in his life we could always tell the chuffers that filars onboard without mentioning you of course quin added with a quick nod to nic then wed be dealing with pursuit craft serri pointed out id rather take my chance dodging the cannons they have a finite range serri redirected the thrusters easing the freighter out of the bay nic silently lauded serris skill as she wove her way around bulky tankers that didnt have the pandeas maneuverability then three shrill bleats erupted from her console short range incoming her voice was tense not cannons security drones could be standard procedure she continued or theyre realizing that the cannons dont work and this is their secondbest nic hoped that was it unmanned security drones werent difficult to evade with someone of serris expertise at the controls plus drones lasers had limited range increasing aft shields to counter serri said those chuffers at traffic control are getting quite vitriolic quin sounded amused the pandea shuddered another alarm trilled serri slapped the disconnect as she checked ships status drone just bit us in the ass shields are holding she had the ship dodging and darting trying to avoid any more hits from the drones but they were persistent shield down to seventytwo percent three minutes to outer beacon suddenly the bridge filled with a rapid highpitched series of tones shit serris fingers moved with new intensity over her console targeting sensor warning theyve got a lock on us its the cannons nics heart hammered against his ribs theyd misjudged or someone had overridden serris program why and how no longer mattered staying alive did hang on serri dropped the freighter into a roll and after that into a curving dive nic could feel artificial gravity straining to maintain stability little pockets of weightlessness making his ass rise off the seat as the shields power draw drained ships systems serris screensand the wailing of alarmsconfirmed two nearmisses but the second was close enough to damage the shields shields down to sixtyone percent quin patch me in to the comm nic said suddenly angling the consoles mic toward him serri shot him a quick glance you tell them filars onboard theyre going to send pursuit ships i cant outrun those and avoid the cannons they wont send ships when i tell them hes in dia custody but you said your mission screw the mission he meant that this was about choicesand not just lifeanddeath ones he made his quin patch me in mic and speakers are live quin said jabo station hold fire this is special agent nicandro talligar dalvarr intelligence agency onboard the star of pandea cease fire or well put your station under full lockdown talligar this is jabo we have no proof nic was already working the console transmitting identification now his console clicked and beeped his heart pounded he could hear quin breathing heavily and though she tried to hide it by dropping her hand into her lap he could see serris fist clench talligar this is jabo ident confirmed were holding fire however we should have been informed of your presence and any investigation you can take it up with the agency in the meantime be advised that i have your stationmaster gop filar onboard and under arrest a dia enforcement ship is at your outer beacon and will counter any moves against this ship talligar out the alarms cut off in midwail jabo had stopped firing nic leaned back in his seat and scrubbed at his face with his hands when he opened his eyes serri had swiveled her seat partway around and was looking at him youre going to be in real trouble over this arent you yeah he said and flexed his left wrist time to talk to those voices in his head again they were not going to be happy serri swiveled the highbacked chair around in the ready room very glad that the room was now empty she hadnt been through a debriefing since she left widestar but that had been the corporate version the dia version was frighteningalmost as frightening as their shadowy stealth ship she swiveled back the rooms viewports were small she couldnt tell where she wasdisconcerting for a pilot but she knew they were headed back to jabo station with the pandea in tow she and quin had permission to retrieve their cargominus whatever tracking gizmos the dia had addedand deliver the fortyseven cartons to the winery and get the rest of their payment she should be overjoyed she wasnt nic was in trouble more than troublehed sacrificed his career for them for her a soft chime signaled the door behind her opening she swiveled again expecting quin whod gone in search of some meat tea for himself and coffee for her she saw nic instead hands shoved in pants pockets mouth grim her heart sank but at least they hadnt locked him in the brig yet she rose i told them you saved our lives but theyshe waved her hand toward the empty chairs as if the dia officers were still theredidnt seem to care there must be someone else i can talk to someone higher up ill do anything i can nic just tell me what you need me to do ill do it he stepped up to her as the door closed behind him i need your ship and i need you to lose your cargo again you what jonas had filar pulling cargo forfeitures so that when he hired quin and sent him to jabo the pandeas accident wouldnt stand out but filar had no idea that jonass plans involved murder thats why hes cooperating so willingly with dia interrogators right now but the stations cannons have never destroyed a ship theyre set to disable and the drones tow you back in then how was rez going to kill quin there was a bomb in one of the containers filar was supposed to leave onboard but filar being filar and being greedy took them all jabo station just informed us that one of the bruisers found it while taking inventory the bomb was set to detonate while you were trying to get a loan evidently jonas never meant to kill you serri collapsed back into the chair she realized her mouth was hanging open she closed it but why do you need the pandea they had filar and his confession theyd probably have rez jonas in custody very soon the dia was not something you could easily run from because someones still pulling cargo thefts on other stations and in some dirtside ports we thought that jabo station was part of that larger crime ring its not so we need to do this all over again but this timehe eased down into the chair next to her and clasped his hands together on his kneeswe dont want to lie to the ship or her captain its not worth the risk quin is calling it a grand adventure the director hasnt been able to get more than a few words in edgewise so youre not in trouble nic sighed oh im in deep trouble he splayed his hands the director though is willing toeventuallyforgive me but youre the one im really worried about youre the one who really matters nic i serri he folded her hands in his and she was surprised by how badly she needed his touch right now i made a huge mistake six years ago i kept silent when i shouldnt have believing it was the right thing to do and i almost made that same mistake again he shook his head i knew jonas was cheating on you but i was afraid that if i told you what was going on youd reconcile because jonas could always talk his way out of anything before i needed for it to get to the point where you wouldnt take him back ever i just waited too long because by the time that happened you hated me as much as you hated him and id lost the chance to tell you how much you mean to me how much i love you shock confusionand hopeswirled through serri you were in love with me a wistful smile played over his mouth still am but we were friends i hope we still are nic tell me its impossible that there can never be anything between us and ill go away ill get the director to assign another agent to the pandea but if its not impossible id like that chance i wanted and lost six years ago his fingers tightened on hers shock and confusion dissolved there was only hope and there was nic her best friend a man she could trust a man she could love are you applying for the position as the captains lover special agent talligar i am she leaned forward until their lips almost touched youre hired mary jo putney new york times and wall street journal bestseller mary jo putney is a graduate of syracuse university with degrees in eighteenthcentury

impossible to resist but one that youd better resist if you want to stay alive the demon dancer i studied the homeless mans corpse he was the fifth id seen this day ragged clothes so dirty theyd clog a washing machine a battered and long outofdate tennessee drivers license giving the poor sods name and age and a great big smile on his lined face my partner jamal johnson shook his head i cant believe how all these guys died smiling dave i suppose its some new street drug maybe i said but i didnt believe it besides being a new york city detective im a guardian from a family that has the kind of powers that used to be called magic witch burnings a few centuries back persuaded guardians to live under the radar most of us lead normal lives gravitating to work that suited our magical talents me im a guardian hunter im very very good at tracking people down especially criminals equally good at dealing with them after i found them not surprising that i ended up a cop my boss is a hardass new yorker who would scoff at the very idea of magic but hes learned to send me out to the weird deaths like this one five smiling corpses no signs of violence it could just be coincidencestreet people arent the healthiest cohortbut my guardian instincts were screaming have you noticed that theyve been getting younger the first guy must have been in his seventies each has been a few years younger than the one before this poor devil is in his late fifties jamal considered hes no guardian but hes a damned good cop probably coincidence but if some dealer has been going around handing out highdose samples they might be taking out the weak more quickly it will be interesting to see the tox report i checked my watch it was midevening and technically i should have been off duty two hours ago maybe after we cleared up this scene jamal and i could grab some texmex at the restaurant down the block i was about to get back to work when a very very bad feeling struck me the kind where you drop everything and run i didnt quite do that but i said jamal i have to be somewhere else asap can you wrap up here and get a ride back to the station with one of the uniforms he gave me a quizzical glance but said only sure see you tomorrow weve been partners a long time no need to explain things i pivoted and headed for my car wondering what could have set off such loud alarm bells i parked right in front of my east side destinationa guardian talent thats useful in new york is being able to find parking when neededthen took the steps of the neat brownstone three at a time i felt as antsy as if i were the only one who could save a room full of kindergartners from certain death instead i was responding to the silent distress of bethany sterling one of my favorite people in the world bethany swung the door to her apartment open before i could knock no surprise there since shes also a guardian she looked her normal selfpetite and straightbacked despite her years her silver hair pulled into an elegant twist but her deepset blue eyes showed the anxiety that had brought me running giving thanks that she seemed all right i asked lady beth whats wrong she smiled wryly as she stood back and ushered me in apparently i wasnt shielding my worries as well as i thought you always could read me better than anyone else she closed the door behind me youre worried too tell me about it while i make a nice pot of tea briefly i described the dead street people while bethany filled her electric kettle its one of the british types that serious tea drinkers use because it heats water to boiling in seconds after pushing the on button she stood on tiptoe for the tin of my favorite darjeeling tea i reached over her head to take it from the shelf she isnt a lady in the sense of an english title but she was named for an ancestor called lady bethany fox so my brother charlie and i like to call her lady beth not only was she english born but the title suited her classy nature she warmed the teapot then added tea leaves and poured boiling water on them i suspect our worries are related david early this morning i sensed a strange menacing energy sweeping into the city and its getting stronger something is very wrong and i have the corpses to prove it any idea what the cause might be she set out two teacups and produced a cookie jar filled with her rich crumbly scones as she set them on a dainty china plate she said i think a demon has come to new york i experienced a moment of severe cognitive dissonance at the contrast between the sweet silverhaired widow and the words shed just said but though bethany sterling was indeed sweet she was a guardian hunter like me with special abilities to track the ungodly and enforce justice i glanced across the kitchen at the old photo that hung over the neat computer table it showed a young bethany dressed in parachute gear early in world war ii shed trained as a secret agent and parachuted behind nazi lines in france singlehandedly freed a jail full of maquis and done a lot of other heroic things but she hadnt managed the rescue that mattered mosther equally young husband had been a guardian healer like my brother charlie and he died in a prisonerofwar camp treating fellow prisoners right up to the end so bethany malmain sterling was one formidable woman even at her present advanced age though she refused to divulge the actual number of her years shed also in her youth been one very hot babe with cool blond hair and dangerous blue eyes i wish id known her then but im damned lucky to know her now a demon i repeated this is new the city has plenty of them starting on wall street this isnt a joke david she said with mild reproof theentityis no metaphor but a malicious noncorporeal being a demon that feeds on human energy have all the victims been male when i nodded she said so its a succubus a succubus i repeated oooookay at least that would explain why the men were smiling she judged that the tea had steeped long enough and poured the steaming liquid into the mugs then knowing me she added a dollop of rare and expensive highland single malt to my tea there are worse ways to die but i imagine that most of the creatures victims would prefer to live i took a long appreciative swig of tea and whiskey is there any way to get rid of this demon or will it keep feeding indefinitely i dont know i was about to do a search on magematrixnet when you thundered in here good idea i took my mug and the plate of scones and followed her to her desk she opened her laptop and used her fingerprint id to enter magematrixnet the site is a very very private database and social network for guardians who are spread all over the world these days i dont think there is a better source of information on magic and impossible events anywherethough im not sure any equivalent stash of knowledge would be just as secret lady beth typed succubus into the search engine then scrolled through the results not a very large entry she murmured some of this data goes back centuries i peered over her shoulder to read the oldest entries had been translated into modern english with links to the original text if someone wanted to consult that so these demons steal human life force through dream sex until they become powerful enough to acquire physical bodies she clicked through to a section of original text this seventeenthcentury report claims that sex demons are escapees from hell they long to acquire human bodies because that makes the pleasure of their wickedness so much more powerful how do we get rid of this one a sufficiently powerful mage might be able to dismiss a sex demon from the body its taken over but there are no details bethany started clicking links at the bottom of the page to see if they led anywhere interesting so maybe we could do an exorcism if we knew how this is beginning to sound like a lowrent horror film truth is stranger than fiction she murmured the earliest account says that when the demon is dismissed from the body it inhabits its sucked down to hell forever no way of checking that part of course lady beth leaned back in her computer chair and eyed the computer thoughtfully our ancestors were happy to assume that demons came from hell but today we want different explanations these beings are quite rare are they space aliens from another dimension that lies alongside this one or have we been watching too much star trek probably i said pragmatically a parallel dimension is just as much jargon as saying that these critters are from hell lets bag this one before we worry about tagging it her silver brows arched time to scout out the demon the sooner the better i agreed bethany nodded and swiveled her chair to face me so we could hold hands we always did this for particularly difficult cases as i touched her thin slightly arthritic fingers with mine i felt energy spark between us its been amazing to work with lady beth certain guardian talents follow gender and most hunters are male but bethany could hunt with the best of us i closed my eyes and visualized a map of the city the mental image was like an aerial photo enhanced by my own experience of many of those streets when i had visited the scenes of the suspicious deaths id picked up traces of disturbing energy and with bethanys help that came sharply into focus theres a nasty twisted red energy spike not far away can you feel it thats our demon lady beth said all cool focused hunter and shes become very powerful let me see if i can learn more i felt my partners energy stretch out as delicately as a budding flowerand faster than thought her probe was seized like a swimmer chomped by a killer crocodile lady beth tried to yank free but the scarlet energy roared hungrily along the trail and stabbed into us like a lightning bolt bethany screamed and i blacked out every cell in my body shocked as if i were being electrocuted i regained awareness to find that wed both been blasted to the floor bethany lay beside me her face paper white and blood splashed around her lady beth as i scrambled up i saw that the blood was pouring from a vicious slash in her left arm i grabbed a tea towel and turned it into an impromptu tourniquet at the same time i gave a furious mental shout charlie my younger brother charlie is my best friend except for lady beth hes also the most powerful guardian healer in new york and he works as an er resident in a hospital only a few blocks away my mind touched his and i felt his fatigue he was just leaving work after a twentyfourhour shift and more than ready to get home to his apartment and his gorgeous guardian fiancée but he came alert when we connected sensing his question i shot back lady beth her place shes hurt bad it wasnt really telepathy and not really words but we knew each other so well that he understood the gist of it on my way echoed in my mind most guardians have at least a little healing power and im no exception i used what talent i had while desperately trying to staunch the flow of blood bethany was cold and shocky and it looked like a sizable chunk of flesh had been torn out of her arm was the demon an eater of human flesh her lashes fluttered up she looked so damnably frail dont worry david she whispered her voice scarcely audible ive had a good life it sounded perilously like dying words weve made a good team damn it you cant die on me bethany sterling i swore dont you dare die luckily charlie arrived then like me he had a key to bethanys house since were the closest thing she has to family in new york hed brought a backpack of first aid supplies with him but his first move was to drop to his knees by lady beth and put one hand on her wounded arm and the other on her forehead i could feel the healing energy like a tidal wave of white light at first it was a struggle light against dark i sensed the moment when his healing drove off the shadow of death he gave a ragged sigh and sat back on his heels as he reached for his backpack what happened i gave him a quick rundown of the situation while he cleaned and bandaged the wound nasty he said were lucky lady beth is still with us i want to check her into the hospital overnight at least at her age this is a dangerous injury nonsense charles bethany said in a surprisingly strong voice hospitals make me ill ill stay here thank you very much a cup of tea will fix me up quite nicely i put an arm around her shoulders to gently help her to a sitting position her bones were as delicate as a songbirds maybe we should take you there just in case there was nothing wrong with her willpower she fixed my brother with a basilisk stare im in better shape than you charles you saved my life for which im suitably grateful but youre so tired youre a menace to society until you get at least twelve hours sleep now give me some nice drug to dull the pain and go home unlike me charlie knows when argument is pointless yes maam he said meekly but i want you to stay with her tonight dave just in case will do not that he needed to ask no way would i leave bethany alone after an attack by a demon charlie zipped up his first aid gear his scrubs were bloody and not just from lady beths injury wearily he got to his feet almost falling i caught his arm ill call you a cab he didnt argue about that either i helped bethany onto the sofa and refilled the electric teakettle since charlie was gray with fatigue i carried his backpack outside thanks for coming i said as we reached the sidewalk ive never been so scared in my life lady beth wont be with us forever dave my brother said quietly shes very old if you hadnt bandaged her up and called me we could have lost her tonight i know i said brusquely not wanting to think of a world where there wasnt a bethany sterling to laugh with id had my share of ageappropriate girlfriends but none were as easy to be with as lady beth or as much fun but this wasnt her time for which im glad but her time cant be too far off i knew that just as i knew that her inevitable death would devastate me but pain was better than not caring a cab turned down the quiet residential street and i raised an arm to flag it down my guardian abilities included summoning taxis as well as finding parking spots when i need a cab the nearest available cab will suddenly decide to turn my way clearly i was born to be a new yorker after sending charlie home i climbed the steps back to the brownstone id make bethany her tea then roll out a sleeping bag in her bedroom so id know if she took a turn for the worse it wouldnt be the first time id stayed here lady beth had not only recovered enough to make a pot of tea but shed also changed into a fancy black sweat suit with sequins scattered around the shoulders and long sleeves that covered her injured arm it was a dressy version of the sweats she wore when we exercised together a couple of times a week wed go to battery park at dawn summer or winter shed walk along briskly while i ran circling back regularly to catch up with her again when wed both had our fill of exercise wed grab bagels or croissants or a hot breakfast good times i frowned what are you up to bethany i can make hardened drug dealers tremble with that frown but she just said calmly we have to go after the demon tonight david the assault created a link between her and me she is preparing to go out and feast on as many lives as she can claim before shes stopped she almost killed you i exclaimed youre in no shape to go after a demon get some rest i can find her without your help you can find her but i dont think you have the power to take her down on your own neither do i but togetherwe have a chance bethany poured tea this time without adding any single malt we must act quickly if the entry on magematrixnet is correct there will be many more deaths by morning because killing is ecstasy for a sex demon who has taken on flesh i felt a cold chill the kind that says something really bad was about to go down do you think that stealing highoctane guardian energy from us gave her what she needed to get a body i believe thats exactly what happened bethany said soberly now she can cause tremendous carnage and were the only people who might be able to stop her in other words duty called lady beth was a fragile precious old lady and every instinct i have screamed to protect her but she was as much a hunter as i am and we were both sworn to stop evil whenever possible okay well go get her i pulled my gun from the shoulder holster and did a ritual check to be sure it was in firing condition it always was will regular bullets stop her silver bullets something else her body is human and vulnerable its her mental power that is dangerous bethany bit her lip she will have acquired the body of a beautiful desirable woman you might have trouble bringing yourself to attack her my mouth hardened i take no pleasure in the prospect of killing people especially not a woman but id do what was necessary is there any way to drive her out of the body shes taken over so the original owner can regain possession bethany sighed her years showing in the near translucence of her pale skin i simply dont know david all we can do is try i nodded regular criminals might be scumbags but they were scummy in human ways metaphysical threats like succubi were largely unknown quantities if either of us survived tonight wed have new information for the database on magematrixnet the deep sense of dread i was feeling suggested that survival was a very open question i escorted lady beth outside to my car as we belted ourselves in i studied my companions profile she looked calm relaxed she looked like a woman who was prepared to die once again i fought down the impulse to protect her we were equals and she had as much right to face danger as i did the excitement of the hunt was beginning to rise in me and from the brightness of her eyes the same was true for my companion we hunt because warrior skills are always needed and were careful how we use them but theres nothing wrong with enjoying ourselves in the process i started the car then closed my eyes to tune into the demons exact location brooklyn right right near the waterfront it was late after midnight and the streets were mostly empty but the city pulsed with life still crazy and exciting and unmistakably new york my town and i was sworn to protect the people in it we sped over the brooklyn bridge city lights sparkling ahead and behind i turned north when we reached brooklyn and headed into a rundown waterfront area of old industry and warehouses by the time we reached a looming warehouse that backed right up to the water i knew our destination was a huge and infamous afterhours club the place had been shut down repeatedly only to reopen with a new name and what was officially new ownership the clubs current incarnation was called bizarro at this hour on a weekend night it would be packed with dancers most of them young and high on drugs alcohol dancing or all three a fertile field for a monster who craved human life force my parking magic held the streets around the warehouse were lined with the cars of clubbers but one pulled away in front of the building just as i arrived i glided to the curb the name bizarro was a scrawl of red neon over a plain door flanked by two bouncers the demon was insidei could feel her i glanced at bethany and she nodded confirmation hoping it would all be over in a few minutes i climbed from the car after i helped bethany out i locked the doors and we headed to bizarros entrance bethany gestured with her right hand and one bouncer took out a pack of cigarettes while the others bored gaze slid over us though magic couldnt make guardians invisible a good dontlook spell means that people tend not to notice us the pounding bass beat was audible even on the sidewalk and when i opened the door music exploded into a paralyzing bludgeon of sound even more overwhelming than the music was the fierce sexually charged energy radiated by hundreds of intoxicated gyrating young bodies instantly my mental shields clamped down to protect me from the intensity the blackpainted entryway led into the vast highceilinged club as the floorboards vibrated underfoot we moved to the edge of the dance area to study the crowd the writhing mass of humanity looked surreal under coruscating lights of crimson violet and electric blue smoke of the illegal variety drifted toward the ceiling of the warehouse the dontlook spell was still in effect and no one took any notice of us as we scanned the crowd somewhere in that bubbling stew of lust and feral hunger was the demon it was hard to pin down her location in such psychic chaos warily i opened my senses to search even without bethanys mental link i could sense the demon growing ever more exhilarated as she fed off the massed energy of the other dancers she was taking her time savoring the slow buildup of lust but soon shed move on to the ultimate kickconsuming death energy she would become a ravenous killing machine sucking down young lives until we stopped her where where bethany squeezed my hand and nodded to the left there she was too short to see over the crowd so she must have used her psychic link to the demon i followed her gaze and spotted our quarry the creature was turned away from us but that was enough to confirm that shed acquired the body of a highlydesirable young woman waves of pale blond hair cascaded down her back swaying to the beat of the music as she ground her pelvis against her partner her skimpy black dress looked sprayed on and the skirt barely covered her lovely ass her sensual gyrations were enough to arouse any straight man who saw her i was no exceptionbut hunters are trained to control lust at least until after the mission is accomplished i clamped down on my lower nature and studied the demons dancing partner a tall young man with dark floppy hair since i was running hot psychically i had a swift flash of knowledge he was midwestern a student in new york to interview at a grad school and having the time of his life in the wicked big city a lamb for the slaughter the succubus whispered something in her victims ear he nodded with dazed enthusiasm and wrapped an arm around her shoulders as they pivoted and headed toward an exit at the back of the ballroom she was taking him outside for sex and death i beckoned for bethany to follow me as i forced my way through the buffeting crowd of dancers there were advantages to having played football in college i moved fast bethany in my wake as i cleared a path but the demon had a head start and she vanished outside with her prey before i could catch up i reached the exit door maybe fifteen seconds after the happy couple stay inside i ordered bethany knowing shed be safer here she took my hand i felt the surge of her power flowing between us blending with my magical talent to create a force that was more than the sum of our individual abilities dont touch the demon she warned her sexuality is a powerful weapon touch always intensifies the transmission of power as lady beth was proving now being male id be particularly vulnerable to a succubus ill be careful i strengthened my shields and opened the door it led directly onto a cracked slab of concrete that covered the strip between the warehouse and a battered wharf that pointed across the east river to manhattan that opposite shore blazed with lights the big apple in all her beckoning glamour in this shabby backwater the only illumination came from a lamp behind an adjoining warehouse just enough light to reveal that the demon and her victim were locked in a feverish embrace her hips grinding and one raised leg wrapped around his his life force was surging into her like orange flame soon that flow of vital force would end and the poor sod would be dead with a smile on his face they were so engrossed that neither of them noticed me i mentally reviewed what needed to be done touching my pistol in its holster in case i had to draw quickly i hoped a weapon wouldnt be needed but its always best to be prepared i took a deep breath then stepped forward and grabbed the boys shoulders to wrench him out of the demons embrace though i didnt dare touch her skin to skin i planted one booted foot against her shapely hip and shoved hard she lost her balance and pitched sideways so i was able to separate the demon from her victim bethany was right it was hard to strike a woman even a demon the kid made a choked sound then collapsed on the filthy concrete his aura was weak but steady though hed be dead tired for a few days from having so much vital force stolen at least he wouldnt be dead but i had no time for a closer examination the demon shrieked with fury at being deprived of her victim and swirled around her glorious blond hair obscuring her face as soon as she saw me she hurled an energy blow that was the magical equivalent of a tactical nuke arrowing the destructive power dead center at my heart it almost flattened me heart pounding and gasping for breath i backpedaled fast glad that bethanys strength was combined with mine otherwise id have been a goner wondering if i could drive the succubus away without killing the host body i pulled out my beretta and aimed it at her heart one step toward me and i shoot id rather save your body so the original owner can regain possession youve had your fun and now its time to go since you cant win why not just depart quietly the demon looked startled that i was still standing then she laughed with rich sexy pleasure a tall dark and dangerous guardian hunter youre going to taste delicious my lad ill have you for dinner then your ancient friend for dessert usually i prefer young males but guardian energy is too rare to waste when i have absorbed the life force of two hunters ill be unstoppable still laughing she raised her hand and a sphere of mage light glowed in her palm illuminating her with soft golden rays i froze in my tracks i was aiming my gun at bethany not my beloved silverhaired lady beth who was safely inside the building but a young vibrant bethany she looked like her world war ii photo with cool blond hair and hot blue eyes now updated to full color and twentyfirstcentury club clothes she wasnt my bethany but she was still bethany despite her glittering destructive power or was this an illusion spell could a succubus pluck an image from my mind and take on the form of my deepest most secret fantasy she tossed her long blond hair back over her shoulders then began strolling languidly toward me every curvy ounce of her was undulating in ways that stabbed directly into my lizard brain its a scientific fact that men lose intelligence when talking to attractive women and a succubus is designed to drive men wild no wonder theyre so damned dangerous lady beths sharp voice interrupted my neartrance david shoot her shes not me shes the demon we came to destroy i should have known that no hunter would stay inside where it was safe when there was danger afoot i struggled to pull the trigger yet though i knew lady beth was right and i could feel her power enhancing mine i could not make myself shoot not even to save my life not even to save her life i felt the demon gathering power into a killing stroke drawing magic to her like a tsunami waves of energy rippled through the darkness most of it drawn from the people inside bizarro she stretched a graceful hand toward me my pistol fell from my numb fingers and clattered on the concrete despite my furious attempts to counter her power i could no longer control my own body my hand was lifting reaching out toward my doom lady beth smashed my arm down and stepped between me and the demon catching the succubuss hand she cried no the fiercest magic id ever experienced exploded as lady beth slammed the torrent of demonic energy back at the succubus adding the full force of her own vast and highly trained magical power i was knocked backward falling onto the cold concrete horrified i saw lady beth vanish in a blaze of annihilating power one instant she was there a silverhaired warrior of light then she was gone gone bethany i cried in anguish i knew charlie was right in saying she wouldnt be here forever but i hadnt really expected to lose her tonight i had thought that i would be able to save her at least if not myself i had failed and now she was utterly gone i wanted to howl to the heavens but that was for later now i had a mission to complete i collected my gun from where it had fallen and lurched to my feet the demon lay collapsed on the cracked concrete bitterly i hoped she was dead but the false bethanys perfect breasts still rose and fell with her ragged breathing it was damnably unfair that this creature still lived while my lady beth was gone i could remedy that not caring if i destroyed my career as a cop or was jailed for murder i raised my gun her eyes flickered and she whispered in a dazed voice what what happened it added to my anguish that her voice was a rich youthful version of lady beths crisp british accent i said grimly you killed lady bethany and i am about to send you back to hell her disorientation cleared and she gasped david dont shoot the succubus is gone im bethany the one you know i hesitated wondering if the demon was enchanting me the creature looked just like bethany had when she was young and the force of her sexuality was plenty strong enough to scramble my remaining wits its really me david she said with a shaky laugh cautiously thewoman demonpushed herself to a sitting position look at me with your inner vision doing my damnedest to block my attraction i scanned her no sign of demonic energy but maybe the succubus had the power to baffle even an experienced hunter how did you find a body that looks just like a young version of lady bethany i asked harshly still unable to trust my senses i im not sure she ran her hands over herself experimentally this doesnt seem like a strange body it feels like me watching her run her hands over her breasts and hips made my mouth go dry how do i know you arent faking me out with an illusion spell her brows arched for heavens sake david youre a hunter have i ever been able to fool you with an illusion her tartness was exactly like the bethany i knew realizing that i was still clutching my pistol i lowered it to point at the ground but i didnt put the safety back on lady bethany couldnt fool mebut maybe a succubus could she gave a wry smile perhaps but with the demon gone im sure the ability to scramble your wits with a glance is gone too unfortunately it wasnt not wanting to admit how vulnerable i was to her i sought an explanation the succubus attacked and ripped away a piece of lady beths arm could this body be cloned from the dna and matured in a such a brief time she frowned that seems impossible but i cant think of any more plausible explanation i dont feel any lingering traces of a different human soul here or demonic energy either theres just me feeling much as i did in my youth her gaze moved to my gun are you going to let me stand without shooting me go ahead i stepped back though still doubtful no way could i shoot if there was a chance this was the real bethany she got unsteadily to her feet did i imagine it or was my old body consumed by the power involved in dismissing the demon my lips tightened you didnt imagine it its strange to think that the body i occupied for so many years is gone she stared at the faint scorch mark where lady beth had been standing it was a good body for a hunter to die fighting is a good death but i still hadnt decided whether i was facing the real bethany or a very very clever succubus who wasnt wearing anywhere near enough clothing i wonder am i actually dead and my spirit is just hanging out here for a bit before moving on she was shivering hard no surprise given the cool night and her minimalist dress her fishnet stockings were torn and goose pimples showed on her arms and legs or am i really me and properly installed in a healthy young body i have no idea i pulled off my black trench coat and tossed it to her careful to stay out of touching distance im better at field work than theory thank you she pulled on the coat which fell almost to the ground and could have wrapped twice around her how is the demons victim doing i drew a deep breath relieved that most of her was covered made it a little easier to think i think hes okay but ill check keeping a wary eye on her i knelt by the college kid and spread my hand out on his chest after a moment i said no permanent harm done he probably wont remember what happened when he wakes up which is just as well so we succeeded in tonights mission though the price was high her vivid blue eyes caught my gaze what will it take to convince you that im really bethany not a demon i dont know i said bluntly when the big battle went down i sensed the powers of the demon and lady bethany but there was also an intense alien energy i didnt recognize what the hell was going on she tied the belt of the trench coat around her slim waist with shaking fingers as i blocked the succubuss death magic and turned it back on her i used a soultransfer spell to exchange our spirits i thought back trying to analyze the hurricane of power that had blasted us all so the unfamiliar magic was that spell she nodded very unusual energy wasnt it i frowned where the hell did you find a soultransfer spell she bit her lower lip her full lush lower lip shed have to drop a bag over her head not to be alluring and maybe not even then while you were taking charles downstairs for a taxi i followed more links on the succubus page one of them led to a very ancient spell that supposedly would switch souls between two different people i swore you tested an unknown spell in combat conditions thats crazy dangerous i didnt have a lot of choice she said mildly i was going to die anyhow this way i had a chance of surviving souls are eternalevery guardian knows that i had the impression that lady beth had no fear of death i didnt her gaze caught mine i had other reasons for wanting to live longer in a young body my heart began beating faster why you know why david she said softly the allure she radiated was a fire in my blood despite her being covered with a trench coat from her chin to her ankles demon magic or was it pure bethany you need to be more specific she drew a deep breath ever since i met you ten years ago when you were just out of the seals and paying a courtesy call on an old guardian lady because your mother told you to ive wished that i were a few decades younger you never said or did anything to suggest that you felt that way my throat was tight as my desire to believe warred with the fear that she was still a succubus and wickedly adept at convincing a man to believe in what he wanted to hear she smiled wryly its unseemly to be a lecherous old woman yearning for a man young enough to be my grandson i was grateful that we became good friends how could we possibly be anything more then this demon showed up wearing my body her voice hardened i thought she owed me something for that certainly she could not be allowed to stay in possession of it and use it to kill innocent young men if she was acting it was a brilliant show that she was putting on knowing that i needed the courage to risk my emotions as she was doing i said haltingly its also unseemly for a man to be lusting after a sweet little old lady so i didnt but ive never met a woman whose mind and spirit fit mine as well as yours if youre really bethany and not the cleverest damned demon in the universe shed been tense as the brick wall but she eased into a smile i dont think that succubi are particularly clever this one was all selfish hunger maybe shes clever enough to know what i havent wanted to admit even to myself i said slowly if you cant be sure what i am by reading my energy theres only one solution david she reached out a hand touch me if she was still the succubus one touch would probably turn me into mental mush and her next meal but there was no other way to find out id always been a risk taker i took her hand and energy flared between us like wildfire not succubus stealmysoulandconsumemylife energy though this was ten years of caring and affection transmuting into fierce true love the woman i pulled into my arms was my bethany no doubts and questions forever and ever amen our kiss wasnt the affectionate peck on the check that is exchanged between friends but a hot needy lovers kiss bethany i whispered when i could breathe again i never thought we could be together not this way nor did i she laughed a little its such a cliché to fall in love with a man whos tall dark and handsome but as soon as you showed up on my doorstep i was head over heels proof that age doesnt bring wisdom i smoothed back her silky hair touching her as id never touched her before its also a cliché to fall in love with a hot blond babe the hard part was knowing that that babe was seventy years in the past not anymore she rested her forehead against my cheek her soft breath warming my throat ive always dreamed of a guardian alchemical marriage two souls blended as one i loved my first husband but we didnt have that i thought id missed my chance yet here we are i kissed her forehead her vibrant young body was a little taller than her old one had been i think we were meant to be together but we got the timing wrong time kept us apartbut the demon inadvertently gave us a chance to reset that timing she slid an arm around my waist and gave me a shining smile lets go home david im in a hurry for us to have some privacy so

find them in another underabove the water part onetime and tide going to the lake either in her head or in the soft hovering drone of the flybus she heard this refrain repeating over and over going to the lakewas someone singing it zaeli refused to look around all these people smiling at or talking to each other or reading guide books or gazing earnestly hungrily from the windows at the exquisite ghosts of ruins littered all over the tawny folds and featherings of landscape but all i can see all she can see behind her eyes whether closed or open is angelo all she can hear apart from the tinnitus of the going to the lake refrain is his voice dark and beautiful what it said that evening four years ago when they were both of them twentythree years old there in that far distant ultramodern city that lay along the shores of that other lake and then of course in sequence she will see the other lake too the first lake glimmering in the darkness and all the spiteful lights of the people hurriedly gathered there how can it still stab into her like this she must have reseen it reheard it all so many times now hundreds thousands sometimes she also dreams it the pain never eases it never can no one can help her she is a fool to have listened to the relentlessly caring advice which eventually has brought her here into such a different environment across so many miles and through so much time and tomorrow it will bring her to shores of the second lake that lies waiting in those palacescattered ancient hills the colors of tobacco sand and turquoise there was a halt around midday at a picturesque roadhouse a copy of palatial architecture done small and perched on a high terrace the view was spectacular below lay forests now the vastly tall and slender trees with their smoky foliage were alight with the fiery flickerings of indigenous parrots and fondsoiseaux at the horizon the mountains had appeared melting out of the bluegreen sky everyone kept saying how sensational it all was and it was there was a lot of discussion of legends and questioning of the guides that faroff peak shaped rather like an uprisen serpent was that mt sirrimir where the mythic prince naran had shot his arrows up into the third moon killed it and brought it crashing downdeadonto the land and how long before they reached the lake to which they were going would they be there by sunset naturally of course the lake of loss that was its name zaeli felt a sudden hot rage perhaps fresh camouflage for the neverending pain but she gave no outward sign she leaned on the railing and gazed miles away over the trees an intermittent upland wind lifted strands of her hair and blew it across her green eyes the hair was coppery red she brushed it away with her hand and the hair seemed alien to her and then the hand did too and when she rested it again on the rail it lay there her hand pale and slim like a separate object she had set down which could now scurry off on its own going to the lake it would not matter it like her hair and her hand and herself and everything could mean nothing she would simply have visited and seen a bit of water and listened obediently to the local legends and then she could catch the returning flybus and go back back to the place called home home where the heart was not you see i did what you suggested another lake i tried my best it will have done you good yes thank you she would answer politely someone really was speaking to her now and zaeli glanced at them distractedly it was time to move on to the lake of loss the bus glided smoothly out between the hills just as a crimson solar disc dropped among the mountains the upper air turned purple and beneath it as if held in an enormous bowl a purple mirror copied every shade and aspect of the sky it showed how darkness came too with the rising on it of a pair of lavender moons and the tidal star sunev pinned in the east like a boiling diamond every person on the bus stared downward now into the mirror of the lake as they crossed above it and saw the spangle of their own lighted passing but that was all reflections and night surface the depths were not revealed staring also zaeli told herself that the lake was made only of solid glass nothing was below the surface nothing was in it neither living nor dead when the golden bug cruised by above heading toward the farther shore the fisherman looked up at it a moment such vehicles made very little noise and sometimes their lights enticed the fish to rise he doubted this fisherman that the passengers would notice him or his little wooden insect of a boat tucked in as they still were against the eastern beach but soon the sail was up propelled by a night wind the boat ghosted off through the water breaking the mirrored star and moons with her silver net from the hotels by the lakeshore came a loud and mingled noise many diverse musics played and many unmatched voices human and mechanical were raised the multitude of windows and entrances glowed sending twisted corkscrews of brightness down into the water trailing away like glowworms into the hills the largest remaining area of the ruined city stood up there but it had left its markers too all down the shore and all about the groups of elegant contemporary hotels thousandyearold columns rose as well as broken stairs or walls or lattices no hotel garden did not possess at least one fragment of the ruins adjacently ancient trees lifted lit lanterns delicately swayed in the low wind from the lake zaeli had walked down to and then about a mile along the pebblecluttered beach at this time of year the lake was tidal its ripples had lapped up as far as they would climb tonight in an hour perhaps it would begin a melodious retreat though lights still glinted at the waters edge the hotel complex seemed a long way off the omnipresence of the ruins had grown dominant inevitably so for once the greater part of the city had been herethere down there beneath the lake itself she had stayed in the hotel for dinner and then a lecture on the legends of the city the guides gave this with the assistance of a recreationist docudrama shown on two wide screens then the rest of the party and the guides went smugly off to the bar i dont belong with these others she had thought i never have or willzaeli had found a door and stepped out into the night for a while she stood at the waters brink overhead all the stars had burst their shells blazing sunev was now halfway over to the west pulling at the lake as it went one moon had hidden behind the other something was moving out on the water zaeli looked to see what it was a fishing boat its sail now furled a man rowing strongly in to shore he was a local obviously and would not be like the efficient and probably falsely friendly staff who worked in the hotels an indigenous man oldish yet toughened wound in a tightbelted robe his lower face swathed in the masking scarf that men affected here more often than women zaeli decided that she had better leave the beach go back to the hotelher proper place a sort of zoo built to contain the foreigners where the local people could be amused by them but not have to put up with them too much abruptly she felt sullen she had begun to feel a little better not happy not secure but less stifled out here alone listening to the pulse of the water but now her mood had darkened again she should go back but just then the boat surprising her slightly with its abrupt fleetness nosed in on the shingle the man stood up and raised one hand in a traditionally courteous greeting good evening he said he spoke ameren but almost everybody did and it would be a facet of his courtesy to extend the foreign womans language to her hello she said did you catch many fish none he answered gravely he had a deep and musical voice wellpitched and calm im sorry ah no he said and oddly from the creasing movement of the scarf she saw that he smiled i never even try now zaeli said nothing he was an eccentric or he did not speak ameren as well as he thought or she had misheard him but then he drew up one end of the net his boat had trailed it was empty he told her i fish for other things what the lake may give up from the world beneath he must mean the drowned city is it really there she asked the city how childish i sound presumably it was or something was and did everyone here believe the legend how when prince naran had cloven and brought down the third moon waters under the earth had erupted to meet it and falling back covered the metropolis leaving only its outer suburbs along the hills above the water but the fisherman simply looked at her he had dark eyes blacker than the sky they seemed and she thought of angelo his face his body his life were entirely there before her standing between her and the fisherman and between her and all things it was always worse when it came like this the memory the despair after some brief and so very hardwon interval of respite the fisherman was watching her he would not be blind to the alteration of her face he might think she was ill consigned to die in a few months or that she had recently lost a child or a parent or a lover that something loved beyond reason had without reason been wrenched away from her she said well i must go and he spoke over her immediately let me take you across the lake in my boat there is a special spot where you can see down into the water all the way to the city i have seen it very often and in the past i have sometimes shown others visitors like yourself no thank you she said i must that is up to you and he made again a most respectful almost a courtly gesture one now that indicated his departure and turned to leave she thought he might take me out on the lake and drown me is that what im scared of or rape and drown me what do i care what does anything matter angelo wont come back out of the water not this water not the way he came back then not like that wait she called the fisherman paused how much should i pay you she said then he turned again and the scarf creased again for his smile no payment i am rich please the boat is ready let us go because of the star do you see he said as they drifted over the water sunevla who draws the tide the star is only present for a month twice a year but at those seasons the tide may flow strangely near the center of the lake have they told you of this they told me the legend she answered she did not watch him but gazed down into the black glass of the lake she resisted the urge to trail her hand in the water he did not row now nor had he reset the sail somehow the water itselfor the tide or the stardrew the boat forward and therefore helped to retain for zaeli the illusion that the fluid of the lake was solid glassor polished obsidianthe ripples a fake impenetrable she could swim of course but she had not done so since that evening long ago and far away he said one region of the city rises from the lake that is the legend not all of the city by no means it is the palace of the king they say that rises did they tell you his name he was called zehrendir and naran was his brother but there was no longer a bond between them for they had quarreled over a woman she was betrothed to zehrendir but or so the legend says naran stole her oh yes said zaeli absently she could see nothing in the water but darkness and a faint reflection of her own paleness and the pallor of the fishermans clothing two ghosts when the moon fell the waters covered the city and ambathis was her name the woman both naran and zehrendir had wantedknowing her deserted betrothed had drowned concealed herself in a high cave of the mountains there she stayed and although a streamlet ran through the cave she would drink none of it she died of thirst because the king had died of too much water so they say zaeli raised her eyes after all and stared at him what was it in his voice but the laval silver star was now behind his head and she found it difficult to make out his already mostly hidden face for a bitter moment tears pushed at her eyes wanting to pour into them and through but she had not been able to cry during the past four years and could not now another kind of thirst maybe instead words flowed out of her mouth and she listened in astonished shock as she told him the unknown fisherman i was in love once when i was young he was he used to be unhappy i didnti never got to know him wellhe scarcely saw mei didnt know him well enough to know why he was so unhappy he never allowed me near enough but i think it wasas much in his mind as in his life and one afternoon i met him in the dreary place where we both worked and he started to talk to me only i could barely hear him and i had to keep asking him what he had said and then he said i hate them and i said whowas it the people he worked with and he said i hate my friends i hate them i hate my friends and then he walked away her voice was low and intense they say you cant love someone you dont know but you can oh you can i wondered if i was included in his hatred but then we had never even been friends that evening i went to the lakethere was a lake there too i went because i had to go somewhere i couldnt stop thinking of him or what hed saidthe sort of thing a child says but he was twentythree and when i got to the beach it was getting dark and there were a lot of extra lights and a medical vehicle and hehis name was angelowas lying on the ground and they were trying to revive him he had swum out and thenno not suicide he had a heart attack they said even though he was so young someone had seen and got him in to shore but he died he died on the beach in front of me i saw him just before they put him into the medicare his eyes were open they were dark as this lake this one not the one where he died his eyes were darkeror less darkthan yours i cant decide isnt that odd zaeli stopped talking and after all lowered her hand into the water which was wet and cold and curiously electric she said quietly to the water my life was so restricted and dull only love made it worth anything even though he never loved me only i loved him but its no good is it to go on loving somebody dead not this way being in love with the dead but it doesnt end love i mean life ends and then the fisherman said as quietly as she look now just there look and youll see the palace shining under the lake like a cliff of apricot marble the great city stood on the plain on all sides hills rose away from it and to the west the mountains towered into a sky that was by day the color of the iris of the eye in the fan of a peacock and by night the color of that eyes purple pupil the hills save where palaces and temples occupied themthe overspill of the city with its gardens and planted forestswere bare the mountains were arid but the valley plain was rich with trees and shrubs grasses and grains fruits and flowers water courses coiled through the valley they formed pools and tiny pleasure lakes and fountains in glades to this idyllic spot he had brought his bridetobe he gave her a suite of rooms that ran the entire length of his palace a complex and miniature palace itself three floors in height and having it was said two hundred and seventy windows each like a long dagger of purest glass in the topmost floor of the suite was a private garden open to the sky vines and the slenderest and lightest trees that bore blue blossoms and golden fruits surrounded an oval pool where swam blue and silver fish here in the evenings the king would visit his betrothed among her maidens who were all deliriously charmed by him for he was dark and handsome and gracious the young woman who was to be his queen however came from the paler races beyond the mountains her skin was light in tone and her hair like the gemresin for which they named her amber zehrendir the king was very fine and so was she they seemed made for each other by higher powers and certainly he found himself in love with her from the moment he saw her but naturally amba was already much included in the life of zehrendirs court and in that way she met often too with his halfbrother naran naran was soon smitten by amba while she who had looked at her intended husband with admiration and liking but no particular passion gradually became infatuated by naran instead one night all caution abandoned these two with a small company of narans followers slipped out in disguise from the palace and the valley and rode their chariots away across the hills toward the western mountainwall here then ambawho naran had not stolen at all or at least only her heartlived as narans lover under the shelter of the serpent peak sirrimir which then had another appearance the story that naran next shot down the third moon by means of arrows and sorcery and vast rage was quite untrue he had no need to rage only perhaps to feel guilt and maybe he had never felt that either some alien unknown element caused the moon to crash on the world conceivably it was not a moon at all but some awful voyager off its course a meteorite or a comet or a piece of other debris from space yet strike it did and then the waters upsurged as do the waters of a pond when a stone is thrown into it and drowned the city but amba never heard of this nor naran for the mountains too were riven and in the tumult both he and she died between the loss of amba and the deluge there had been a space of time quite longor not long at all perhaps merely seeming so to zehrendir the king during this intermission the city continued to bloom and prosper and he himself went about his duties with faultless attention he regularized laws performed every ritual he visited among his people and listened patiently to any who required either his help or his council doing always his best and the best of this king was they said much better than that of any other man this was natural to him he could not lose the knack though he had lost everything else but not even the city or its people could comfort him or make him happy nothing could one song which later passed into legends about him told how one day he had stood alone in some private room and said aloud to its walls my friends are gone amba had offered a sweet friendliness at least instead of her love and until the day naran met amba naran also had been a true friend to zehrendirthey were in fact his only real friends it was not that zehrendir had come to hate either of them let alone the city he had created and which till that time had been like his friend too thrilling and heartening him with its loveliness but all these friends were lost to him forever amba naran the city also because it had ceased to mean anything beyond sheer duty it was as if all of them had died in a single night was the flood thenthe drowner the toppler the destroyerto be his friend one day was left before the moonstrike would throw itself into the earth like a fist sending up a column of blackness and fire on this penultimate day an old woman was brought into the court of zehrendir about the fabulous audience chamber where the king sat in a white chair people were going up and down late sunlight sprinkled in jewelry clusters and splashing the coats of six tame tigrelouves it changed them to the color of ambas hair the days business for now was over zehrendir sat apparently serene as if deep in thought but all i hear all he can hear is the echo of faroff hoofs and wheels retreating and the single word loss whispered again and again no one can soothe him nothing will ever alter his sadness this appalling moment which has already stretched into an eternity will continue forever unabated one of the palace aides approached zehrendir dutifully raised his eyes the man informed his king that a crone had wandered down into the valley she had said she was gifted with certain magical abilities and had a message for the king now zehrendir turned his head and saw an old woman who was as thin as a stick and muffled from the crown of her head to her skinny feet in veils and scarves her eyes could not be seen at all she looked like a corpse wrapped in garments for its burial or cremation zehrendir had no wish to let her near him but he felt compassion for her feet which like her hands were the only things visible of her they were so old and filthy and scarred all over as if all her days she had walked barefoot on them across burning rocks being struck by scorpions that had never quite killed her so he beckoned to her good evening mother said the king to her and then even through the windings of her scarf he thought he could see a pair of eyes that despite her evident age were bright and piercingly green just as those of amba had been it shocked him this and he briefly believed that he had now lost his mind in addition to all else but of course green eyes were not unknown in the west had she walked here all that way the old woman nodded perhaps she read his thoughts after that she spoke to him in the most inaudible of voices which only he he supposed could hear attend was all she said the aide had drawn aside but zehrendir was well aware that all the court were now always praying anxiously that some supernatural assistance would be sent to heal the kings dishonor and grief and that too wounded him since he wanted happiness for others even for amba and naran and this perverse kindness which he could not help any more than another man could have helped his fury and thirst for revenge wore him out almost to the same degree as his pain the king said to the crone let me ask them to bring you a chair and some food and drink my feet are my chairs she answered crankily i feed on the air i have nothing therefore i have everything but you she said have too much and so are among the poorest in the world no doubt youre quite right said zehrendir equably and he smiled at her as if she really were his old granny the one that he had always liked best of his relatives when he did this needless to say the charm and innocence of his smile showed up like a lightning flash every gash that sorrow had carved into his young face the crone studied this with vast concentration it transpired that she could see him as no other could compared to his hurts her blighted feet were nothing they did not trouble themselves or her but he was in ribbons and could never mend attend she said again obediently he waited lift your head lord king and see up there in the roof above you how that round mirror is positioned yes exactly there she is insane poor thing he thought theres no mirror of any sort hung in the ceiling but when he looked he saw there was it hung directly above him like a huge drop of water in a bowl but an upended bowl that did not spill and as he gazed into it noting that it seemed to reflect nothing not even the westering light it curiously grew quite black like the blackest glass two or three ripples passed across its face and then its face held another face a long distance away not the kings face nor the cronesbut still it was one he knew very well mistakes are made said the powdery voice of the crone men and women intuitively look for those they expect to meet on the paths of existence sometimes there is no meeting at all or worse much worse a mistaken meeting what can be done about these errors look up into the water look and you will see your wife gazing back at you from above the lake which is yet to come as zaeli did as the man told her as she gazed down into the water she did not for an instant credit what he had said vaguely it occurred to her that now was the preordained time when he would bash her over the head and then spring on her or else simply sling her straight over the boats side he might have a lunatic theory that she would be a sacrifice to some lake demon or to the ghosts of the drowned king and his people but she did not really believe in his violence either he seemed rather mystical a mage from some uphill village and he had said he was rich said it with such modest proud indifference the tidal star sunev or sunevla as he had named it was now descending between two mountains its sidelong light lingered in a vivid mercury trail interrupted only by the boats shadow zaeli thought that the light of the star had dazzled her then she saw that the round mirror of gold that had appeared just beyond the vessel there on the waters surface was neither a reflection nor an afterimage it was really there it shone up into her face and staring suddenly she saw right through it as if through a lamphung tunnel and a medley of luminous lattices and iridescent pillars and lacy gilded branches into a golden room in the room which resembled a large golden cave sat a man who had raised his face to look up at her his head and shoulders were hooded about by a wave of blueblack hair he was a man of incredible goodlooks but with strain and torment in his face it seemed as if he had undergone some recent and unspeakable torture soon to be repeated his imageso familiar and yet so utterly unlike anyone she had ever knownfilled zaeli with a sense of anguish and of falling although she no longer feared being thrown out of the boat she was sure that to fall down toward him would be both the most fearful depth and the most sublime apex of all chance he appeared very definitely to see her in turn could he see too that she saw him his eyes were darker than any night a whistling note hardly audible wavered through the silence perhaps it was only in her head or perhaps it was a song that tidal eruptive sunev sang as it vanished between the mountain peaks zaeli was half aware she had risen to her feet as she sprang weightlessly forward kissed the water with her entire body passed through its upper skin paraphrasing the motion of the sinking star she knew only that she was about to die she was equally glad and mournful at such a mandatory solution part twohistory as water she was born again old and lying on her back in a toffeebrown country under a peacock sky the sun was just beyond its highest station a black snake was coiled around her right ankle some faint disturbance in the air gave her the peculiar idea that the life force of the body she now occupied had departed only seconds before her own arrival the driver had left the driving seat now she zaeli was in it she sat up cautiously this body not formerly her own was an antique stiff as warped wood none of that not even the snake upset her she was not even surprised a flood of memories also not her own quivered over the old minds sky like a flight of birds though she acknowledged them she did not really need them zaeli thought it was like glancing hurriedly at a map and list of directions that already she had been briefed on she got to her feet at this the limber snake uncoiled from her it slid out of sight into a narrow seam in the ground and zaeli wondered if the animal was where the former driver of this human vehicle had taken herself the soul must be she perhaps foolishly thought delighted at such new flexible freedom for with every step the thin and elderly human body took it creaked and ached on these wrecked feet she must walk down through the hills toward the city in the valley and there address a king showing to him some sorcerous mystery she would know what to say only when she came into his presence what must be revealedand also what must be hidden the body of the old woman dead of ordinary old age for a handful of minutes then reanimated by zaelis consciousness started gamely out upon this trek zaeli it was already unfussily absorbing gentle as sleep it soon tidied away her personality behind its own it would tell her how to place the crablike feet for safety and speed how to search recesses of the barren land for little wisps of sustenance or water it would find her shade in which to rest it knew the route and the rules and all about the king and indeed it knew the real story of amba and naran too for one dusk many days before it had watched them fly by in a blaze of chariots cloaks and ambercopper hair nothing pursues or hunts the crone as she journeys always descending with the mountains at her back once a wild tigrelouve pads out on to the track then the crone a talented magician in life speaks to it a soft mantra and of course speaks it in her own language so in a way zaeli speaks it too the tigrelouve responds by purring and rolling in the dust like a house cat if any of zaelis personal awareness remainsand surely there must be some atom left however repressedit like the tigress is subsumed she is hypnotized so they walk as one to the city drink from a well and pluck a fruit from a tree to refresh themselves and go through gates of marble and bronze and up an avenue paved with flat stones of thirty colors and guarded either side by rearing mythic beasts sculpted from basaltsouci in a porch of the palace the old woman confronts a guard a servant a steward but the kings people have always had at the kings behest a liberal admittance policy without undue delay an aide leads her through the lateafternoon halls and so to the audience chamber here the tame tigresses pay her no attention but the king says to her in his dark and musical voice good evening mother attend she tells him i have nothing therefore everything you are among the poorest in the world no doubt quite right he answers she sees his beauty with her own compassion as an undead dead wisewoman will she being already beyond life and deep within zaeli stirs for an agitated instant a butterfly in the web of her cocoon which will not quite yet release her but then the crone forms her magic mirror in the ceiling up there amid the jewels and even the trapped butterfly of zaeli notices her own previous young womans face that ten minutesor ten months before or a thousand years in the futureleaned or will lean down to gaze into the waters of the lake of loss it is amba says the king that is all he says the crone sighs the body and memory and magical power which are now are all she humanly is have noted something else a terrible catastrophe hangs above the city and her sorcery knows that it is already too late to warn of it there is no time leftshe has been too long upon her journey to empty the huge metropolis would be impossible the panic and clamor would themselves slaughter in droves and still the moonor the meteorite or the comet or the piece of space debriswill crash down and the flood rise up she does not even think they would believe her only he is capable of believing her the king zehrendir and only in one way since he has seen ambas face looking in at him from the mirror how still zehrendir sits in the white chair he seems less outwardly collected now than static his head stays tilted up his eyes wide to meet the eyes of the one he had loved and whom he had mistaken for one who would love him it had not occurred to him she was no longer amba and had never been but instead was a woman from a future a hundred decades off in the history of the world when he and his love and the falling moon and the flood are only dim muddled legends the body of the crone steps jerkily forward it is more of an automaton now because the consciousness of zaeli is returning quickly beating and beating its wings to get through like a sort of wooden puppet badly moved the crone goes to the king and stares into the night of his eyes though young and strong he is quite dead she of all things can recognize the state she sadly speaks a single phrase my love she says still in the language of the city my angelo then the outer shell of her physical flesh and bone drops to the floor and lies there still at last not for her the unstoppable cataclysm to come nor for him and for the doomed city there will be one last night of peacebut even this is to be marred for in another hour they will learn that their king is dead the fisherman had watched the flying bug of the bus cruise by high overhead such transports did not make enough noise to disturb the fish their lights might even entice a catch to the surface he had doubted this man that the bus passengers would take any note of him soon after he raised the sail and the boat propelled by the vital night breeze ran along the water trailing the silver net he was very old the fisherman tough still and never sick but he had seen so much of life and time and how they came and went away he could remember back before the foreigners first traveled here in any numbers with their sugarcake hotels and airborne buses he did not mind them but sometimes the thought of them tired him he felt that tiredness tonight it was not unpleasant for a while he sat quietly thinking of his wife who had been dead now seven years he missed her and the son they had lost but he had never supposed they would not all three meet again above the stars burned fierce as foreign neons sunevla most of all the moons were pale by comparison he checked for fish none had been tempted his thoughts strayed to the legend of the shattered moon and the realm beneath the lake he drifted asleep as he mulled the legends over and in his sleep without shock or pain he died but his body lay there lifeless for only a few moments before a blade of phosphorescence seemed to sheer up out of the water it flowed across the idle net it sank into the body of the fisherman in that way zehrendir too was born again old but he was born so under the peacockpurple of the night like zaeli he found that to have an elderly body was a startling handicap but zehrendir was both a romantic and a pragmatist he knew that he must utilize what lay to hand nor did he lose himself in the fisherman the fisherman had not been any sort of mage had not had that special talent and inclination to inhabit his brain and absorb its memories and contents was an education rather than an obscuration of self nevertheless zehrendir proceeded without haste he tried out the newold body for its fitness and acumen and found how well it could reef the sail and employ the oars of the boat unlike the fisherman however zehrendir cut a hole in the net he had accepted that he had been transferred into a place which from the knowledge left behind in the fishermans brain he knew to be centuries into the future at some stage of rowing toward the western shore zehrendir also accepted the legendary remnants which were all the fisherman had known of the cataclysm then he ceased to row it was both too dark on the lake and too idiosyncratically lit by moons and tidal star to see if he wept but the boat meandered some while and the fish swam in and out of the broken net like blue and silver tears eventually hours on with zehrendir its motive force the old mans body rowed in to the shore where glints and splinters of hotel lights zigzagged on the starpulled tide he had known where she would be the woman whose face he had seen he had known she would be here beside the lake he knew she was not ambaand knew that she was she was the one that he had mistaken amba for zehrendir yet a king and a young man inside the swathing of the fishermans flesh felt a surge of ecstatic laughter at this divine and cosmic jest there was no trepidation in him it was rather as if a stranglers cord had been cut from his throat he had rowed the last of the distance very fast and the old arms ached and gnawed but what did he care he let go the oars and stood up raising his hand in a traditional greeting which had stayed current through time he spoke in ameren since the fisherman had had a good command of it it was her language good evening he said hello she said like a sleepwalker did you catch many fish he knew that she had not yet seen him within the lake time had been bent to anothers will to the will of something frightening in its powerand yet benign none he replied with the gravity of a riotous joy concealed im sorry she said oh my beloved thought zehrendir the king be sorry for nothing for here you are before me your hair like crimson copper and scarlet amber your skin like ivory your eyes the color of a leaf in rain and somehow nownow you will be mine and i yours though i have no knowledge how or why even her strange foreign dress did not concern him let alone her youth contrasted to his present old age even the gulf of history and deluge between them he showed her the empty net for zehrendir it was all at once the symbol of an endless possibility i fish he said for what the lake may give up from the world beneath he did not understand quite what he meant by that or he did for what the lake gave up was himself and her too and here the opened net of destiny had captured them both not long after this he sees her recognize him her face fills with such despair and hurt he knows it is her loss of him which has torn her to pieces and now stands between them let me take you across the lake there is a spot where you can see all the way down to the city i have seen it very often he adds glorying in the cunning of a lie which is also a truth for truly he has seen the city in his past then she denies him he respectfully turns away this is flirtatious etiquette like that of a dance he is aware that she will instantly call him back and she does how much should i pay you i am rich he tells her he is he has nothing now and so has everything she enters the boat and he takes them out on to the mirror of the lake the blackandsilver coffinlid drawn over his world and under hers and which must mean everythingand therefore is nothing at all they are both by now distracted abstracted but they talk about the legend and then she talks of the trauma in her own past the past of this present time as he attends to her zehrendir realizes very well what she has confessed to him she as he had done had mistaken another for the one who would love her the expected one himself but the mistake is over and here and now are only they when the golden round of mirror evolves from the water zehrendir watches as she gazes into it it corresponds to the moment so long ago when he had looked up and seen her looking back when their eyes had met he does not attempt to bar her flight into the lake they have already passed each other in his time now again in hers she sinking like the star he rising like the star passing through each other crossing between past and future then and now life and death nullity and love as soon as she vanishes which really does coincide exactly with the vanishing of sunev between the mountains the old mans body lapses back in the casket of the boat just as it had those hours earlier the vessel swings about mildly again for a while then guided by a wind visible only in its firm effect skims off toward the eastern shore in fact the water felt only cool to her which was lucky as she had discovered herself far out in the lake and swimming strongly if without any particular urgency and all this in a sort of half darkness even though dotted by indefinite lights zaeli stopped swimming she trod water and looked around she could not see the strident glare of the hotels above only one moon loitered low in the sky the tidal star had also set it had been setting she recalled when she dropped into the lake the currents of the water swirled and furled about her not causing her any difficulty more as if trying to persuade her to something what had she meant to do to drown herself had she really meant to do that but they said that for a good swimmer it was usually very difficult to drown it took a lot of selfdiscipline and exhaustion zaeli did not feel even slightly tired in fact the lake seemed to refresh her then she remembered the boat and the gracious old man his mostly swathed face and extraordinary eyes she was certain that he had not pushed or thrown her overboard yet he and the boat were gone there was no trace of him had she dreamed him in some kind of trance when first she began to swim out from land surely not in her prison of despair she had never dreamed such things only of angelo his words his death on the beach very curiously too zaeli thought she did not feel despair not now despair had been her constant and only companionwhere was it it was almost annoying that it was gone the last moon turned to a dense purple and seemed to dissolve into the night zaelis memory flipped like a leaping fish she saw the country below the lake the brown hills the tigress purring in the dust at her old and distorted feet the groves and gardens and the high gates of the palace she saw herself as then she had been clothed in the carapace of the old woman and then the form of her lover face and body hair and eyes a young king in that country and she heard his voice known to her dark and beautiful a hill seemed to have risen just then when she was not looking over there across the lake it was blacker than the sky and had blotted up the stars but in a few moments every star in the galaxies instead flamed out all through it stupefied she asked herself if this were the western shoreline the neon lights of the hotels but such ignorance passed he recognized the night in itself this was a bizarre realization for after all why should the night which he had known since infancy be unrecognizable in the first place yet it was as if he had come a vast way through alien landscapes and unaccustomed scenes where the moons and stars even the darkness itself had other shapes and natures and now he knew at last where he was and the sky and the dark were his familiar associates which too was quite at odds with the fact he still did not grasp what place it was where now he found himself the darkness grew for the second moon was setting the other two must already be down by starlight then he went on walkingit seemed he mustalong the slope of a great hill and glanced sometimes to his right at the huge inchoately flickering body of water that lay below and unfolded itself to the western horizon he could just make out the mountains beyond one of them was not as he remembered it now resembled a serpent risen on its coils probably zehrendir had walked for a couple of miles before he began to sense that the appalling pain of loss no longer dragged on him once a weight of lead his heart was nearly weightless and so he paused and cast about in his thoughts after amba actually searching for the misery and hurt which were all she had left him of herself they had become his familiars too his constant companions where had they taken themselves then he saw again in retrospect an old woman who had said to him attend and a mirror floating through shadow to night to show him the face of amba and after this he beheld himself as a fisherman clad in the body of the dead and he played over in his mind the music of his meeting with the other woman there on the farther shore the woman who was not amba but was amba she for whom amba had been by him mistaken memory showed how she had slid into the lake and disappeared like the setting star in his former time that star had never existed but here he had known and named it just as he had come to know and might have named everything he considered again the deluge and the city but he did not weep not now just then from the hilltop light blazed out like a funeral pyre brighter than a sun partblinded he stared at it so many miracles had happened one more was only a commonplace in any event the fire dimmed and then faded altogether following which there was left only the night to walk through toward the summit of the hill above the water the night was hot zaeli shook her hair and kicked off her soaking shoes her clothes were torn and clung to her the landmass was dark again now it was not the mainland shore some island perhaps something had risen in the east it cast her shadow in front of her at first she took the glowing round for a belated flybus but it was not moving its light guided her up the slope and began to chalk in a phantom architecture above her it was a ruin large and complex strung over with what must be a tangle of vines she thought he said one region of the city rises from the lake they were not vines but water weeds that roped through the colonnades twisted in the lattices a softwater shell shone like a pearl in the corner of a glassless window slender as a dagger a tall man stood on the other side for a while having reached the ruined building zehrendir paced about in it a quiet almost reverential tinkling and dripping of spent waters filled it in spots he identified features still recognizable that he had seen often a statue of a maiden with an urn an arch of elephs an avenue where gold studs green now as limes had been set into the stone this palace was or had been hislong long before when the third moon tiny as the tidal star had flown high in the east he saw through a narrow window the figure of a woman standing out on the hill spent waters trickling and tinkling and vines that are water weeds and green gold and substance passed into ruin and a risen moon lighting the way like a lamp both of them standing in the echoing hall speak at once you she says you he says they hesitate and attempt a second introduction i she says i he says then they become silent again and wait there with some yards of stone and iridescent shade between them each knows the other completely returned into their own young bodies the stress and marvel of this is terrifying and since she has learned to speak his language and he hers he is speaking her language and she is speaking his language even inside their heads then he speaks to her in his own tongue which she understands she will answer him in hers and he will understand that you are not amba i know this im not amba and youare not angelo my name is zehrendir zaeli she says my name is zaeli they look at each other have never looked anywhere else the water trickles like silver like history or time trickles away through the stone fingers of the columns the little moon burns like a gold mirror through the broken roof in its spotlight he laughs suddenly she knows his laugh although never until now has she heard it which makes her laugh in turn her laugh is ambas it is the laugh amba never gave him and which now zaeli does it is simple to cross the space the moon is already doing itlookits easydo you see they cross the space their hands touch they swim together as if beneath deep water until every surface of their flesh and hair their lips is magnetized to contact they breathe each other like oxygen they are each others air and earth water and fire and some other element too which is profoundly nameless they are each others world endless slips of time and place their bodies lie together on carved beds clouded by silk or on mattresses lying bare as a bone on a concrete floor or on velvet grasses or on tussocky sands weaponed with shingle in baths of marble and blue cascade and shower cubicles in rented rooms with geometric signs on the sensible plastic curtaining the feast of this single lovemaking takes in all the uncountable meetings they have missed been cheated of flesh to flesh whirling through diamonds and thunders like the leap and fall of suns the traveling of planets the true world goes out in the explosive flame and the little last moon dissolves like an ember then they are lying in the foundation of the dead palace in utter blackness and total peace but where now where next can they go his world is ended hers has never begun they are together yes yet for how long a couple of hours before morning some of the tourists who came to the lake on the flybus were still wideawake four of them were wandering along the shore from which by then the tide had drawn the water off to almost a quarter of a mile another staving off an impending hangover leaned at an open window high in his lakefacing hotel room drinking an iced mineral water and stuffing himself with deep breaths various others were due to be awakened certain of the hotel staff too had stayed deliberately unsleeping and watchful there were always a few who kept this vigil either inadvertently or with forethought frequently nothing happened tonight it did to start with the effect was subtle a dilute sheen appeared far out as if another moon were up or some premature prelude to the dawn it was not in the sky however and as the radiance gradually intensified morphing from platinum to ormolu and so to a nearly radioactive gold no one could mistake that the sun if such it was was rising deep down inside the vast body of the lake the light then sped up and soon reached a savage climax this maintained itself everything else caught and flared up in its gleam the shores the hills the scattered ruins even the distant mountains took on a metallic blush as they did at sunrise only the hotels dulled to insignificance the lake was itself by then a composite incandescent marigold and from it though the dazzle made them rather hard to define outcrops of brilliance had seemed to rise up from the water they resembled buildings of ancient design sumptuous with windows that flashed off their own daggered highlights down on the lakeemptied shore the four astounded tourists heard faint sounds of voices perhaps of singing and music a rolling noise of wheels and once a catlike purring too large and close to be possible the older woman in the party was afterward always sure she had seen a chariot from legend dart through just under the water the two younger men found a fishing boat that was lying on the pebbles and tried to row it out over the effulgent firefly soup of the lake but the light confused them completely they rowed in a circle and careered defeated but giggling back to the beach up in his window the drunken man was cured by astonishment and a slight worry that he had gone mad not had a glimpse into another dimension where the deluge had never occurred and the city lived foreverdecidedly not as for those who had watched on purpose they too were thrilled by fear and amazement but they did not think that they had lost their minds the show as some of the visitors later referred to it lasted about twenty minutes by the clocks of the hotels about thirteen by any accurate and consulted wristwatch when finally the light went away which it did very quickly merely fluttering and going out like an ordinary candle oras someone saidas if an electric connection had fused there was only absolute blackness briefly muddled with afterimages and then the east began to kindle legitimately for morning by the breakfast hour almost everybody apart from the specific watchers had become or been convinced that the glow in the lake was all a clever trick put on by the area sponsors they joked about it all day and for days and months and years after they told people back home that they too really should go to see the lake below sirrimir the lake with the legend and look out for this fantastic performance that was laid on for your last night but the guides they professed to have slept all through the event they always did they always would meanwhile the body of the young redhaired woman was not discovered until it washed up on the noon tide it seemed that she had gone for a swim and though so young her heart had stopped she had not drowned perhaps you might care for some kvah madame sir oh yes thank you he replied before he knew quite what he said or where he was for both of us please the attentive voice that had called through the door acquiesced and went away then he turned and looked at her his new wife just waking from slumbering beside him in the overland sleeper as the pullcar rattled gruntingly southward outside the woods were thinning to wide blue fields while overhead the bluepink sky was prettily decorated by birds he knew now where he was just as he knew the language for a moment he studied her too making certain that she as he was not entirely bemused but she only kneeled up by the window and said the sky is always that color am i right zeh yes zaeli how do we know she inquired but then she looked at him and they moved into each others arms and were to each other the flawless completion of all known havens lands and states one exquisite constant in an everdismantling chaos over there some clothes of an inventive cut awaited them and some luggage lay in its cubby that he and she too instinctively recognized just as they did the quaint trees and the blueblossoming fields and the sky like a painting on china but only as if they had been briefed on such things a few minutes before arrival none of this would matter anyway they knew each other we speak this language now it seems he said smiling i suppose it will seem less odd quite soon she sagely assured him or more so zeh is kvah coffee i think it is or milk or beer they ceased to talk about the kvah they had met only recently and were soon married in some city to the north the train rattled on the hard rails real as all reality it was carrying them home to her tall old house by the blue and evertidal lake with every second they remembered moreand forgot more too already they had almost forgotten their former lives those other things they had lost since both heart and mind had been refilled to the brim they were changing smoothly into those people that now they were this now was the reality and everything else any other lives quite likely some sort of dream this was real two lovers going homeward to a lakeshore while behind the painted china sky the stars crossed unseen peter s beagle learning to operate a computer can be difficult for the uninitiated some computers however may be trickier to run than others peter s beagle was born in new york city in although not prolific by genre standards he has published a number of wellreceived fantasy novels at least two of which a fine and private place and the last unicorn were widely influential and are now considered to be classics of the genre in fact beagle may be the most successful writer of lyrical and evocative modern fantasy since bradbury

fanfavorite star trek the next generation episode sarek and a popular autobiographical travel book i see by my outfit his most recent book is the new collection mirror kingdoms the best of peter s beagle kaskia even afterward martin never could bring himself to blame the laptop rather he blamed his foolishness in buying a computer at once so far beyond his means his needs and his abilities goddamn bells and whistles lorraine told him scornfully at the time leds apps plugins backup gadgetsyouve always been a fool for unnecessary extras you think people will look at that thing and think youre a real computer geek an expert she gave that little sneezelaugh hed once found endearing and went off to call her buddy roz and relate his latest idiocy in detail sucking a forefinger cut while he was struggling to open the box he heard lorraine saying on the phone and on top of that he bought the thing from his cousin barry that asshole you rememberright right anything that falls off a truck is legally barrys i am telling you roz the trouble was of course that shed been right martin was fond of barryif he thought about it hed have to say that barry had been his closest friend since childhood given a very limited experience with close friends but he had few illusions about his cousins probity or loyalty even in the first flush of his infatuation with the new computer hed known that nothing barry told him about it was likely to be true the brand was completely unfamiliar the keyboard had too many function keys beyond the usual twelve and there were other keys and markings with strange symbols that barry never even tried to explain to him its one of a kind absolutely unique same as you i feel like im in shakespeare bringing two great lovers together directions had not been included but jaroslav the amiable graduate student two doors down the hall who actually did know quite a lot about computers came over to set up martins laptop for him it took considerably longer than expected due in part to jaroslavs unfamiliarity with the operating system and in equal measure to his fascination with the computers programs and connections no that cannot be it that makes no sense well i suppose that would work it seems to work but i cannot understand yes that works but why he made no more sense out of the keyboard than barry had and was clearly only halfjoking when he muttered with this thing i am lucky to know to set the clock where to plug in the mouse by the time he was done his iron man tshirt was sweated through and he was talking to himself in serb afterward martin noticedon the occasional times they passed in the lobby or hall or outside the buildings laundry roomthat jaroslav avoided meeting his eyes despite martins vast ignorance of the workings of his new computer however it functioned better than any machine he had ever owned since a beloved bathtub motorboat that ran up a flag and fired pellets at his rubber ducks lorraine had once commented that electronic devices seemed to commit suicide in martins presence and it was a hard point to argue yet the strange laptop never misbehaved never froze never crashed never devoured work he had forgotten to back upnever in short treated him with the kind of spitefulness that had always been his lot from anything involving electrons and wires he realized that he was actually grateful and from time to time found himself thinking of it not as a machine but as a quiet and singular friend often now when he came home in the evening from the large chain grocery where he was the produce manager he would sit at his worktable dinner having long since evolved into a solitary pursuit for both lorraine and himself and let the computer talk to him either onscreen or through the excellent earphones that barry had grandly thrown into the deal the computer had a sound system with builtin speakers but lorraine complained about the noise and martin liked the earphones better anyway they gave him a curious private peacefulness that made him feel as though he were at the bottom of the ocean in an oldfashioned diving suit talking with a companion he could not see not that he had ever worn any sort of diving suit or actually been in water deeper than his high school swimming pool martin had not been to very many places in his life he did no store work on the new computer there was an intimidating unforgiving desktop model in his backroom cubicle for that the laptop was for telling him stories at the swirl of a mouse it was for bringing him news delivering such email as he ever receivedwhile most considerately eliminating all junk and spamand for showing him not only the old films noir and television episodes of his youth but a wider richer world a world he had resigned himself early in life to seeing in snippets at best but never to know in all its sprawling vulgar magnificence the laptop seemed genuinely to care for him him martin gelber fortyone years old balding and lonely spending his days with fruits and vegetables and his nights with a wife long since a stranger absurdlyand he knew bitterly well just how absurd it wasmartin began to feel cherished he was also aware that he had no more than scratched the surface of the laptops talents and capacities there were keys he carefully avoided touching software settings he never once changed from how jaroslav had left them areas of the screen where he never let the mouse wander now and then he was tempted to click on some mysterious buttonjust to seebut martin had the sad virtue of understanding his own capacity for disaster and the allure of adventure always faded quickly he was more than happy with the computer the way it was and the way they were together except for the one key martin called it that having seen the lord of the rings and read tolkiens books as well the one key lived alone on the upper right corner of the keyboard well past print screen and scroll lock and pausebreak past the tiny blue lights indicating that num lock or caps lock or scroll lock again were engaged an ordinary key no different from any other except for being without a letter a number oras far as martin could discernany obvious purpose it was simply the one key it was just there like a wisdom tooth and it drew him from the first as the little closet had drawn bluebeards seventh wife or the chest full of plagues had enticed pandora martin being martin and aware that he was martin left it strictly alone and left it alone and went on leaving it alone until the afternoon of his day off when there was nothing on tvnot that he ever watched television much anymoreand lorraine was away with this or that shopping friend and the one key was now somehow looking as big as the lordly backspace or enter martin stared at it for quite a while and then said suddenly loudly and defiantly what the hell and pushed it nothing happened martin had of course no idea what he had expected to happen he had a reasonable assumption that there wouldnt be an explosionthat the computer wouldnt either levitate or fall completely to piecesand that a cuckoo wouldnt pop out of the screen with a message from something eternal in its beak but he had rather anticipated that a deeptoned bell would ring somewhere surely and that it would be answered every key has a function he told himself a programmed reason for existing there would be a response martin waited a green spark appeared in the center of the computer screen slowly swelling and swirling taking on the aspect of a sparkling pinwheel galaxy as it filled the screen martin clapped the earphones on his head hearing a staticky crackle that was not at all like static but fell into rhythmic distinctly repetitive patterns that seemed to be trying to form words the green galaxy revolved dizzyingly before his eyes i dont understand martin said aloud startled to hear himself speak suddenly frightened he considered turning off the laptop but he didnt and the vision continued to dazzle his eyes and sizzle in his ears on an impulse he moved to the keyboard and typed the same words i dont understand this time the response was immediate the sparkling scene vanished to be replaced by the image of a face it was not a human face martin knew that immediately for while it provided the usual allotment of features they were arranged in a configuration that could only be described as shockingly impossibly beautifulmartin actually lurched back as though hit in the stomach and made a softer version of the sound that one makes on such occasions words formed under the face martin recognized them as words they were the equivalent in pixels of the sputtering that had been shaping itself into language in his earphones to him dazed as he certainly was it seemed the speech of space the common dialect of planets and comets alike all he could think to do was to type his own words over once again staring at the lovely terrifying utterly perfect alien face as he did so i dont understand nothing changed on the screen for some time martin occupied himself primarily in praying that lorraine would not return just then but also in marveling that a face so beautiful could simultaneously reveal itself as obviously unhuman yet lose none of its appeal nor could he pinpoint the exact reason he knew what he knewbut he knew and he went on waiting for an answer the laptop screen changed again the face vanishedmartin found himself reaching helplessly toward where it had beenand the screen filled once more with the characters of that otherworldly language martin groaned but in almost the same moment the words dissolved and reformed themselves into something approximating english he leaned close to the computer squinting to read them me what you hel who lolo me me first contact martin had seen enough sciencefiction movies to know about first contact the ludicrousness of a computera laptop at thatconnecting a suburban produce manager with another world and another life form was not lost on him as stunned and overwhelmed as he was why me he demanded aloud why not a scientist an astronomer whatever come on for goodness sake but all the same he typed into the screen where are you what is your name there was no response for what seemed a very long while as excited and impatient as he was he tried to calm himself thinking that he and the alienhis alien if he was the first to discover her like an island or a mountainmight likely be communicating over lightyears not mere miles this was hardly instant messaging after all even so he was fidgeting like a child unable to sit still by the time the reply came back you what talk who no gone gone me the next word which martin thought must have been an attempt at a name dissolved back into a flurry of wordsor sounds or mathematical symbols or plain lunatic gibberishin the original possibly cosmic tongue in turn he went back to his own first contact cry i dont understand story of your life gelber he said aloud to the computer find a girl to go to the prom with she lives too far away for a cab ride and she doesnt speak english your life in one line i swear the computer said back to him in what was still a braver try at his language than any attempt he had yet made at hers me belong kaskia belong who you kaskia her name was kaskia or else shebelonged a slaveto someone of that name martin refused to believe that anyone who looked like that could be anyones servant let alone a slave he took a long breath and typed back martin my name is martin he heard nothing back for the rest of the day even though he forlornly pressed the one key again and again lorraine came home in a good mood the one benign side effect of her shopping expeditions and they enjoyed a relatively placid evening practically together martin yearned to get back to the laptop and lorraine clearly had phone calls to makemartin knew the lookbut instead they watched a publictelevision documentary on the history of the empire state building even sitting still through the semiannual fundraising supplications maybe having a special secret makes you nicer martin thought easier to get along with he wondered what lorraines secret might be when lorraine went to bed he booted up the laptop and tried cautiously and apprehensively to contact the being who called herselfitselfkaskia but to no avail applying the one key repeatedly summoned no starry crackle to his screen nor did appealing directly to the computers elaborate messagetracing systems produce any unearthly footprints at all the entire contactthe entire visionmight never have occurred martin mourned it all through the next days work at the supermarket unlike the protagonists of any number of films and stories he never for a moment took his encounter with the unearthly for a hallucination or a dream there had been a connection however fragmented with a creature from another place or reality and the idea of such a wonder never occurring again for the rest of his life made that life seem to him even duller and more pointless than he already knew it to be i wont stand for it he said aloud to himself while showing jamil the proper way to stack the red cabbages i wont jamil took it as a slight to his cabbagestacking technique and was deeply wounded three further days passed during which martin spoke less and less both at home and at work and spent more and more time trying to coax the strange laptop to find kaskias world for him again the computer remained not so much mutinous as regretfully firm almost parental as though it had decided that passing the borders of his own understanding was simply bad for him the one key remained so unresponsive that he came to fear that he might have damaged it by punching it in frustration when he lost contact with kaskia during that time he could hardly endure to look at the laptop which lorraine noticed teasing him about it what happened novelty wear off barryll sell you a new toy anytime if you can find him martin hardly heard her on the fourth night sleepless he finally wandered to his worktable sat down at the laptop and played several games of solitaire as he could have done at any of the store computers then he reread his email browsed a favored newsletter played a round of battleship against himself and tapped the one key almost diffidently with his head turned away from the screen he had not even put his earphones on when he heard the static of the spheres he did not turn immediately but moved very slowly as though that other place were a wild bird he was trying not to startle away the screen was as before aswarm with wheeling green sparks and though martin waited patiently neither words nor the image of the wondrously alien beauty appeared finally he was unable to resist typing once again my name is martin and then after some thought adding boldly your name is kaskia the reply was long in coming leaving him to fear that he really had frightened her off and then to speculate on whether an astronomer or mathematician could work out just from the time it took his electronic missive to receive an answer how distant kaskias world actually might be he vaguely recalled barry as having been good with algebra and trigonometry in high school and thought about setting him the problem words shivered into place on the screen kaskia you martin where you martin slapped his palms exultantly on the table and then quickly deadened the vibrations for fear of waking lorraine its real he whispered raising his head to look toward the ceiling and far past it oh sonofabitch its real and either her english or the transmission was clearly improving along with her comprehension she must have one of those universal translators like on star trek and those other shows or maybe she was just a fast learner he was up most of that night happily reenacting all the first contact scenes and dialogue he remembered from movies and television he placed himself and his planet in the universe for her as best he could though she seemed to his chagrin to have little knowledge of her own worlds relation to any other and even told her out of his own small store something of the earths history and geography kaskia was rather less informative which he put down to her continuing difficulties with the language and her consequently understandable reticence he did learn that she lived in some sort of grandly sprawling extendedfamily setting that she was a singer and musicianapparently quite wellknown as far as he could make outand that she felt happy and fortunate if that was what the word she used meant to find him a second time the galaxy was very big the contact began to break up toward morning presumably due to the rotation of both worlds and the slow endless drift of the entire cosmos but he understood by now when it would be possible for them to speak again and when he asked her shyly if he might see her image once moreit took her some little time to grasp the meaning of the requestthe face that had so literally made him forget how to breathe reappeared for a moment sparkling against the stars then it was gone and the screen of the laptop went blank sleep was neither an issue nor an option he lay down on the livingroom couchnot for the first timeand stared at the ceiling consumed by a need to tell someone about his discovery whether or not he was believed lorraine was out of the question for a good many reasons while jaroslav was still avoiding him in the hall and shopping elsewhere as for his fellow workers matters of authority forbade his taking any of them into his confidence except perhaps for ivan the black security guard ivan read on the job whenever he could get away with ithe had often been seen reading as he walked through the parking lotand martin as management should not have sympathized with him or protected him for a moment but he did most of the books ivan read were science fiction and martin had a growing feeling that out of all the people he knew ivan might very well be the only one who might sympathize with him for a change ivan did ivan said wow man that is a good story he slapped martins shoulder enthusiastically thats like niven writing bradbury i didnt know you were into that stuff you got any others martin did not waste time protesting the complete truthfulness of his account he said well im not a writer you know thatim just fooling around you think i ought to change anything i mean if you were writing it ivan considered one thing id find a way for them to meet up not rocket ships no buck rogers shit like that im thinking transporters or some such i mean thats exciting manthats risky yeah hes seen her picture hes seen somebodys picture but what if she turns out to have a tail and horns and sixinch teeth mailorder brides you know well i dont think the guys thinking about getting together with her i mean shes sort of famous on her world and hes married and he could be a lot older or she could he dont know how long it takes her planet to get around the sun or anything about the biology she could be seven hundred or something you never know ivan patted martins shoulder again tell you one thing id sure like to have a laptop like the one you thought up dell ever makes that puppy im first in line martin spent a good deal of time looking at the computer himself even when the link to kaskia was not open his growing sense of the laptops true potential had paradoxically begun to distance him from the machine that he still believed loved and cared for him you scare me he said aloud to it more than once youre with the wrong guy we both know that to his mind the one key employed skillfully by someone who knew what he was doing could probably open channels quite likely beyond the reach of the hubble telescope but thats just not me martin said sadly i wish it were i really do he did finally get in touch with barry who as expected claimed absolute ignorance of the laptops provenance and could offer no clues toward tracing its history i told you everything i know the day i put it in your hands kid he gave martin the warm confiding smile that not only attracted new victims every day but continued to reseduce the old ones who knew better i told you you belonged together was i wrong tell me i was wrong martin sighed its like the time you sold me the motorcycle barrys grin widened the triumph the bonneville t you looked great on it i almost killed myself on it it was way too much power for me i sold it two weeks later and only got half what i paid you for it martin rubbed his left shoulder reflectively this computers the same way i cant take it back barry said quickly he looked alarmed which was exceedingly rare for him and it was martins turn to smile reassuringly i dont want to sell it i just wish i could live up to it he sighed again i wish we really did belong together lorraine came home from work then and barry promptly disappeared without a further word martin thought those two understand each other better than i understand either one of them he wondered whether lorraine had heard the last thing he said to his cousin he wondered whether he cared the link or channel or the hailing frequency or whatever it actually was seemed to be open to wherever kaskia was every five days sometimes in the afternoon like that first time but most often at one or two in the morning he often asked kaskia what time it was there but she seemed to have no concept of measuring time that martin could translate into his mind they usually spoke through the good offices of the laptop screen until nearly dawn when martin would slip quietly into bed beside lorraine and try to catch at least two or three hours of sleep before heading off to work it was a wearying regime but generally manageable kaskias english had improved further each time they communicated when martin questioned how she could be learning the language so fast since she had not known of its existence until a few weeks before she replied lightly must be good teacher you asked whether martin could possibly learn her language in the same way her answer was a somewhat puzzled how could you she had not yet mastered question marks or else there was a translation issue involved that he did not understand which did not mean that she did not ask questions she asked constantly and charminglyif sometimes startlinglyabout the smallest details of martins life from when and where and how he slept to the names of every fruit and vegetable he handled in his work and whether there were nildrys on his planet martin never found out what nildrys were but retained the distinct impression that a planetor did she mean a housewithout nildrys was beneath contempt she herself liked best to talk about her pet whose name on the computer screen was furtigosseachfurt and who sounded in kaskias description like a cross between a largish ferret and a squirrel he was quick and affectionate liked to have his back scratched and his belly tickled and on occasion he hid from her behind a rock or high in a tree and then she had to find him her messages regarding the creature took up so much time that martin would rather have spent on many other matters and he even found himself skimming a bit over writing from the stars but they were also so tender and guilelessly touching that they brought martin just as often close to tears once she wrote sometimes he is all i have sometimes not you because of the lack of question marks you could imagine if you wanted to that she might be saying that martin was at times all she had martin wanted to think so one day the green sparks on the screen formed one word and nothing more dead martin never thought for a moment that she was speaking of anything but the ferretsquirrel she never mentioned family at all and only rarely spoke of friends or acquaintances he wrote as earnest a condolence as he knew how sent it off into space expecting no reply and got none he wrote another not being an obsessive person by nature it never occurred to him that his concern for the sorrow of a person infinitely far away across the galaxy might in any way affect his work or concern anyone else but in fact his increasing distraction had indeed been noticed by his superiors at the market and by lorraine as well this was less of a worry for her than it might have beenlorraine had survived far worse disasters and had already chosen her parachute and a cozy landing strip but she retained a certain rough fondness for martin and actually wished him well so when she confronted him for the last time it was without much malice that she said i have a bet with myself twelve to seven that when i walk out of here you wont notice for three days want to cover it martins response was as distant as kaskias planet though of course lorraine couldnt know that he said quietly you left a long time ago i did notice somewhat off balance lorraine snapped well so did you im not even sure you were ever here stop playing with that damn computer and look at meyou owe me that much im at least more interesting than a blank screen for martin had the laptop open and was indeed staring at the empty screen only now and then cutting a quick peripheral glance at her lorraine demanded what the hell are you looking at theres nothing there no martin agreed nothing there at all goodbye lorraine my fault i know it im really sorry but the last words were entirely by rote and he was looking at the computer screen again while he was speaking them lorraine who had not planned to leave quite this soon gave a short sneezelaugh and went to make a phone call she would have collected on her bet for martin was too occupied with the one key to be paying attention when she did leave the next day they were into the second fiveday cycle since his last communication from kaskia and he was growing anxious as well as frustrated he had reached the point lately of stepping outside when the night was at its darkest and staring until his eyes blurred and burned up at the black empty sky currently just as much help to him as the empty computer screen he would never have saidand never once didthat nothing else mattered but hearing once again from a nonhuman woman unimaginably far away on the other side of the other side and he could not make anything else be real all he could do at this point was simply to keep saying her name as though that would make her appear and when he returned to the laptop she was there rather the green sparks were crowding his screen leaping this way and that like salmon fighting their way home and there was that unchanging alien face that chilled and haunted him so and there was a message as the sparks flew upward into words i miss so much so much i miss help me it was as though her grief had driven her language back to the basics with which their conversation across the night had begunhow long ago it seemed now to martin nevertheless the cry for comfort was clear and he whom so few had ever truly needed or called on for aid would respond he began to type letting the words come without reading over them dear lovely kaskia i too know something about loss i never had such a pet as yours i cannot have pets because i have always been allergic to animals do you know what that means allergic it means that the skin and the fur and the hair of most animals makes you ill sometimes very ill indeed i think sometimes that i have been allergic to people even to my customers in the produce department and to my fellow workers i think i would do better with animals than people if i were not so allergic you have lost a great friend but at least you let yourself have him you took the risk of having a friend and he had you so you cannot ever really lose each other the words rolled steadily up the screen and disappeared into the night and the stars beyond martin wrote on haltingly but never looking back i have not been as brave as you so i have no friend like that except you we cannot really know each other and i suppose we never will but i have come to think of you as a dear friend and i cannot bear to think of you so unhappy he took a deep breath here paused just for a moment and went on i am very lonely i have always been lonely it is my fault do not let your grief shut you off it is too easy and it lasts too long oh kaskia so far away the screen with his last words still on it went abruptly blank martin stared the laptop was vibrating under his hands making a sound like an oldfashioned sewing machine or a car about to throw a rod it stopped presently and new words began to appear on the screen they were like the sparkling pixel words that kaskia had first tried before she began to absorb english but the handand somehow the tonewere definitely not hers martin typed as before my name is martin gelber and added with a touch of defiance i am kaskias friend that got somebodys attention immediately he was answered by what came across the screen as a bellow of fury you martin repeated my name is martin gelber i am a friend of kaskias i know you the laptop seemed to shiver in the face of such outrage however faraway the one tries command my child martin stared at the screen in bewilderment and horror he typed back child im talking about kaskia the new voice was slower to reply this time and not quite as accusatory my child my daughter martin thought of ivan at the supermarket then he typed i didnt know the voice on the laptop screen still resolved in capitals but the tone no longer came across as menacing would not kaskia likes talk stories likes stories yes martin said softly remembering and then typed yes so then she is not a famous singer and musician likes singing of course he replied the sad story about her pet dying dead yes older sisters martin said oh dear good girl good girl yes martin typed again smart girl dont punish please the voice did not answer martin wrote slowly now your daughter changed me i dont know how or in what way but i am different because of her better perhapsdifferent anyway tell her so still no answer martin was no longer sure of the voices presence but he asked one other question every time we spoke kaskia and i there was an image of the most beautiful woman i have ever seen i thought it was a picture of her not goodbye kaskia friend goodbye martin said softly goodbye kaskia the laptop went dark and still martin touched the one key but nothing happened he had an odd feeling that nothing would again the computer had served its purpose at least for him he shut it off unplugged it wrapped the power cord around it and put it in a drawer after two cups of strong percolated coffee he called barry when his cousinhungover and grumpy by the sound of himanswered the phone martin said barry do you remember the old prince albert sting prince albert barry was definitely hungover say what you remember big fun for bored kids on rainy afternoons call up a smoke shop a candy store ask them if theyve got prince albert in a can remember now a hoarse chuckle right sure yeah they say yes and we say well let him out right now he cant breathe in there then we giggle like mad and they call us little motherfuckers and hang up what the hell put that in your head just memory lane i guess hey i heard about lorraine that really sucks you okay i guess not really sure what okay is right now i guess so okay means theres better out there lots better seize the weekend like they say in romeold cousin barrys going to hook you up with one of his midnight specials meanwhile youre crazy free right crazy anyway to his own surprise martin realized he was smiling well see about the free part there were bathroomsink noises at the other end scuse metrying to make an alkaseltzer onehanded hey you still happy with that computer i sold you i got a buyer if youre not martin hesitated only briefly no im fine with it great little machine barry cackled triumphantly told you itd change your life didnt i no you didnt but thanks anyway martins smile widened slowly standing alone in the

rambling around the house for years in a fog so thick that he could no longer count the years that had passed chained to the house by a chance meeting in a mirror he was a shadow of his former self a whisper on the wind a glint of light against the glass the house had sat empty for ten years although his mother still came in to clean every now and then but mostly there was silence the only way he kept up with what was happening in the world was to listen to the conversations between may his mother and the rare friends she brought with her hed come to believe hed never have another chance to laugh to smile to be grateful for what existence he had and hed been lonely so lonely wondering if hed ever have the chance to speak to anyone again if nothing else he wanted outwanted to move on but today something shifteda breeze echoing through the empty rooms swept with it the hint of perfumethe fragrance of hesitation of angerand desire and the scent touched him woke him fully someone new had arrived someone he once hated but now who promised him the chance of life again the house would become a home again and perhapsperhaps he would have a chance sometimes the only way to exorcise old ghosts is to pack your bags and move in with them and so on one of those rare clear mornings in the pacific northwestbefore the clouds had a chance to gatheri loaded my pathfinder and left seattle for what i hoped would be the last time for all its beauty the city was a constant reminder of the nightmare that had haunted me for over a year three hours and two pit stops later i pulled up in front of the rainbowarched trellis straddling the drive leading to breakaway farm wild rose canes wound around the latticework waiting for spring sparkling with early dew the trellis guarded an iron gate barring the road to the house and in the moments just before sunrise mist rolled silently along the ground an ankledeep shroud obscuring the path i let the motor idle as i slipped out of my seat and wandered over to the gate staring at the lock the key dangled like a promise from my key chain a glimmer of hope that maybe just maybe i could find some semblance of peace on the other hand now that i was actually here the idea seemed a little crazy maybe i was just stirring up trouble for myself it was simple really all i needed to do was gather my courage unlock the gate and drive in breakaway farm was mine now and nobody but my lawyer knew that i was moving here there was nothing to stop me nothing but my own fear the question was was i ready to face the past and conquer my demons or maybe a little voice in the back of my mind whispered the question i should be asking myself was really was i ready to face the future could i accept what id done learn to live with it and get on with my life even harder could i accept what had been done to me its one thing to live with your own sins quite another to be forced to relive the sins of another every time you looked in a mirror i rubbed my throat where the scars lingered their crimson brilliance had long faded but the thin white lines were still visible and when i touched them they burned i knew it was all in my mind it had taken only a few weeks for the actual slashes to heal but every time i thought about them the images that flashed through my mind were as fiery and painful as they had been that night a loud mew from the backseat startled me out of my thoughts i turned around circe wanted out of her carrier youve been such a good girl i stroked her ears between the bars of the cage shed slept for most of the drive over from seattle what a good girl as i stared into her emerald eyes the calico chirped her squeaks intermingled with the rumble of a purr she trusted me maybe it was time that i learned how to trust myself again taking a deep breath i looked at the gate it was now or never either go forward and risk the unknown or admit failure i couldnt very well return to the deadend life id left behind in seattle my stomach in knots i fit the key into the lock the gate creaked open protesting years of disuse as it swung wide i latched it to the post to keep it from crashing shut and then with one last look at the highway behind me climbed back into the suv and slowly edged along the graveled road bordered by tall cedar and fir trees huckleberries littered the ground along with fallen trees covered with moss and toadstools a flicker of movement caught my eye a fox a coyote a neighbors dog it had been a long time since id set foot in the country unnerved i rounded the curve the drive opened into a semicircle parking space in front of a footpath leading to a threestory house hidden behind a veil of tree limbs and bushes i turned off the ignition and squinted at the tangle of vegetation it would be nice if my muse would give me a signany signthat i was doing the right thing i waited nothing why couldnt she reassure me that i was making the right decision but no lightbulbs appeared over my head no sibyl sang her song for me this was my journey and my journey alone as i climbed out of the car exhausted by the turmoil of the past few months all i wanted to do was to sleep but i hadnt slept through the night since hasty backpedal no not ready to go there not yet a glance at the eastern sky showed dawn giving way to day thin clouds blended into the pale blue that passed for morning i poked my head into the backseat hold on for just a few more minutes longer babe ive got to check out the house first circe stared at me blinked slowly sniffed the stirring of fresh air then promptly curled up and fell asleep slinging my purse over my shoulder i set out for the house the path was crowded on both sides by a thick row of lateblooming herbs they grew wild and tall gone to seed but still their fragrance lingered in the air musty and old dizzy from the scent i stumbled and almost blundered into a spiderweb that an orange and black striped argiope had spun across the path it reared crooking its jointed legs in the air and i pulled back as it scuttled away into the lilacs spiders made me nervous with their quick darting movements breathe deep calm the soul thats what the doctor had ordered i inhaled slowly holding my breath for a count of four then let it out in a slow stream as the stirrings of panic subsided i plunged through the arbor to the end of the drive and out and there it was breakaway farm framed by two spectacular cedars the house looked part castle part cottage toss in a southern front porch and five acres of thickly wooded land and bingo breakaway farm i sucked in a deep breath staring up at the old house she might be lonely and abandoned but she still had life to her that much i could feel the morning light reflected off an unusually clean pane of glass on the second story as a gust of wind elicited a ringing peal from a set of wind chimes a flash was someone staring at me from behind one of the thirdfloor windows i squinted looking closer but the image vanished if it had ever been there in the first place i made my way around back wading through the kneehigh grass and ferns that blanketed the ground another glance at the upper stories told me that there had to be a roof up there somewhere beneath the thick layers of moss and lichen but the vegetation was so thick it was hard to see ivy wound around the chimney tendrils waving down at me i completed the circuit and returned to the porch staring up at the door the key clenched in my hand it all came down to this could i go through with it unlock the door and go in i glanced back at the driveway where my pathfinder sat crammed with everything i possessed no there was no going backbut how could i go forward i held the house key up to the sky when the lawyer had given it to me it had rested in a black velvet box large and oldfashioned an engraved r curled down the shaft surrounded by delicate roses and it hung on a black satin ribbon r for rose r for jason rose the man who had almost ended my life a woman was on the porch with difficulty he pulled himself out of his foggy cocoon and by sheer habit dusted off his jeans his shirt was a cardigantoo warm for the summer but he felt neither warmth nor cold a glance in the mirror told him that he was probably out of style but with his straight back slightly gaunt but not unappealing face wheatcolored shoulderlength hair he cleaned up pretty good the pallor in his cheeks would be a giveaway but only in the brilliant light if he kept to the shadows she need not notice at first and she would be his ticket out his ticket to freedom he had reached the point of no return and like the others had been trapped in the house the mirror had kept his spirit here chained to the walls in which hed once lived the others walking in his world didnt like him they stayed away finding him strange and unnatural in their dark and endless night but he he was just who hed always been except he was alone or had been until his dark twin had returned now he had hope something hed never thought hed have again hed spent a lot of time watching the seasons pass as the years went by when his mother came to clean each week hed pray shed see him and yet when it came time to make himself known hed hide shed try to free him and to free him shed risk her own life so he watched from a distance and listened now and then shed talk to him like she had before the accident before hed unleashed the djinn once it was unleashed you could never recork the bottle that much hed learned the hard way after a quick calculation he headed for the mirror he hated the thing and yet from here he could travel to any room with mirrors or windows he could look out on the world and watch the world pass by but the living couldnt look in unless they were gifted with the sight they could see only the shallow surface the image reflected in them as the tumblers of the lock began to turn he slipped into the antique mirror that stood against one wall in the bedroom after all what better place to first lay eyes on your new bride excuse me startled i turned almost twisting my ankle i found myself facing an elderly woman who might have been fifty might have been eighty her hair shimmered white under the early streaks of sun and she wore it in a tight chignon held by a butterfly barrette her dress was a tidy periwinkle with an apron tied at her waist she smiled and i caught a glimpse of myself in her brilliant blue eyes im sorry i didnt mean to startle you she said her gaze flickering over me again but are you laurel rose she held out her hand a smile creasing the ancient topography of her face wary i nodded and glanced around wondering where shed come from i hadnt heard her approach as if reading my mind she said out of the woods where else for a moment i stood disconcerted uncertain what to say next i had the feeling that she could see right through me as if i were made of light fractured by a prism i gathered my wits enough to say hello im may may oconner with a gentle bob of her head she added jasons aunt i leaned against the newel post a stab of pain knifing through my forehead the headache that had been looming all morning suddenly hit fullforce jasons aunt was not who i needed right now the man who almost murdered me had never been complimentary when he spoke of his family but then again hed never said a good word about anybody but himself i searched mays face scanning for a resemblance but to my relief found nothing how do you do i stammered oh fit and tidy fit and tidy may winked at me then pointed to the door ive come to welcome you to the neighborhood i fingered the key surprised by her friendliness id expected a stormy confrontation when i finally met her accusations for defending myself tearful threats but not this welcoming matteroffactness she motioned to the door shall we go in ill show you around this was it no more room for procrastination either i claimed breakaway farm or left defeated and if i left here i held my breath and inserted the key into the lock the door carved with figures too weathered to discern swung open with a faint creak i stepped back allowing may to enter first our eyes locked as she drew me in and flipped on the lights i was relieved to see them flicker to lifethe lawyer had said hed take care of the utilities but you never knew whether tasks would get done when you delegated them to other people breakaway farm is a solid house and will take you through the years mays words echoed through the long hall shes been empty for around nine years since since my galen died ive kept the house up hoping that perhaps jason might change his mind and want to return home but i think i knew he never would then when i found out that you were moving in i came over and spiffed it up with a lick and a spit she turned to study my face and added i hope you dont mind mind why would i mind i wanted to hug her in relief no brewing storms no callous remarks just that unrelenting smile im just grateful that i wont be facing corners filled with cobwebs and mold growing on old furniture im glad someone took care of it all these years instead of letting it go to ruin then it hit mehow did she know id be moving in the lawyer had promised he wouldnt tell anyone so much for confidentiality may stopped in the hallway where photographs lined the walls people i didnt know places id never been but they were beautiful and melancholy and incredibly sad in a way i couldnt define i raised a finger and hesitantly traced the frame of one that stood out among the rest protected by glass a man and woman were curled together on an iron settee in the middle of a garden they loved each other very much didnt they who were they may gave me a gentle smile my brother daneen and his wife ellen jasons parents my inlaws you never got to meet them did you i gave her a sidelong glance not sure of how much she knew i wanted to but no i never had the chance may reached out and tipped up my chin you are far too pale for such a pretty young woman she dipped into one of the voluminous pockets on her apron and brought out an apple and tucked it in my hand you need some color in your cheeks to match that fiery hair of yours this will help she pointed to another photograph daneen and ellen stood in front of a lush garden overflowing baskets filled with tomatoes and lettuce carrots and cucumbers surrounded them breakaway has many treasures daneen and ellen were its rarest they loved this farm they loved their son they never looked at the flaws in anything or anyone what she left unsaid hung between us like thick fog i wondered just how much i could tell her jason seldom spoke of his parents it wasnt totally true but i felt a sudden desire to spare her feelings that i do not doubt she held my gaze jason seldom divulged anything relating to his past come let me show you the living room we entered the living room and once again light flooded the room at the touch of a switch a velveteen sofa and love seat looked new but the rest of the furniture stood ponderous weighty oak solid and stern a bay window glittered as may drew open the floorlength drapes a window seat upholstered in the same green velvet as the curtains overlooked the side yard facing the trunk of an oak that had seen far more years than i a dizzy feeling that we were being watched hit me but it was swept away in the next moment when i realized that id fallen in love with the house i spun around clapping my hands i never dreamed it would be so lovely the room took a deep breath as a splash of sunlight filtered in through the sparkling glass and the light transformed every corner newly potted ferns and ivies draped down from shining brass hooks on the ceiling and i realized that may had brought them for me then i stopped rooted to the floor as i spotted a picture hanging low on the north wall the man in the photo was young but there was no mistaking the face jasons eyes glittered at me with the same cruel assessment id known throughout my life with him i pulled my sweater tighter suddenly cold and the scars on my throat began to itch again i glanced over at may shed been watching me as i rubbed them gently flushing i waited for her to comment im sorry laurel she murmured i should have taken that down i just wasnt thinking please forgive me trembling i reached out stopping just short of touching the photograph would i ever be able to face his image without shaking may silently stepped in front of me and turned the picture to face the wall i slowly let out my breath breathe deep calm the soul a companion photo hung next to it a man as fair as jason had been dark though somewhat older whos that i asked mays face lit up that was my son galen jasons cousin pride rang in her voice i miss him dreadfully was he older i asked examining the photograph the mans face was robust but not red and he had sandy blond hair gathered into a short braid that hung down his back he sported a reddish beard and i found myself unable to look away his eyes radiated the same gentle firmness as mays beneath her wrinkles i could tell that may possessed the same definite bone structure not nearly as angular as jasons may nodded she fingered the portrait and her prints remained faintly on the glass galen was six years older than jason was her eyes sparkled he was nothing like his cousin they were the sun and the moon he died in this house she glanced at her watch my word i didnt realize so much time has passed ive got pies in the oven she edged towards the door i just wanted to meet you how did you know i was here i walked her to the door may smiled and i suddenly felt exposed jason had called her a nosy old bitch and now i knew why at least from his standpoint shed make keeping secrets as hard as keeping your hand out of the cookie jar and jason had kept a lot of skeletons locked in that dark closet that was his mind she laughed faintly i knew i just knew galen and i never thought anyone in the family would ever live at breakaway again thats why he moved in here we never told jason she gave me a keen look and added im pleased youre giving it a try this house belongs to you and you belong to it you dont know how much i needed to hear that i said swallowing a sudden swell of tears it had been so long since anybody had been nice to me had acted like i wasnt tainted i almost believed her words can be powerful allies or enemies may glanced up at the sky its going to be hot this afternoon my garden can use the warmth let me walk you to the path i need to bring in circe circe my cat shes been in the carrier for several hours we took several breaks along the way but im afraid shes probably fighting mad by now she hates to travel i dont blame her come lets get her settled then as we headed toward my car she said my galen was a veterinarian did you know that i shook my head im afraid not jason never said anything about his life here or his family he told me breakaway farm was a moldering dump jason had more problems than his parents wanted to admit may said as we reached my pathfinder i had to pull out a couple of the suitcases first but i finally had circe in hand may picked up the bag containing the new litter box and bag of litter i protested you dont have to do thatyour pies remember laurel i can carry an empty litter box the pies will keep for another few minutes theyre huckleberry by the way thank you i said may led me to the half bath on the first floor why dont you lock her in here until you get your unloading done shell be fine if you set up her box and fetch her some water circe let out a yowl staring indignantly from her cage with a laugh may said what a pretty calico and shes a lively one ill bet there are lots of mice and shrews out here shell have fun hunting we put her in the bath and i unpacked her litter box and filled it then set out food and water before walking may down the path as she passed the car she pointed to my portfolio you paint dont you you dont have much else with you she added i shook my head i travel light easier that way well then goodbye ill bring you over one of my pies and just like that the fey woman vanished down a side path quiet as a whisper he could feel the cats presence before he could find her when he was hiding in the mirrors he would travel from one to the next and so forth and now he peeked out of the bathroom mirror to look at the calico who stared up at him eyes glowering with a hiss you may not pass she said shes mine i wont let you hurt her he laughed and a thousand chimes blew in the wind low and reverberant inclining his head with respect he said mistress of cats little protector in life i tended to your kind i mean no harm to you what can you tell me about her and circe her emerald eyes glinting in the light that filtered through the window whispered one word lonely and then pleading dont hurt her the man smiled softly then and the calico backed away hunching down hissing at the mirror but he passed and after a while she curled up and went to sleep and he went back to waiting after i finished unloading the car i let circe out of the bathroom and dropped into a chair in the kitchen with a cup of peppermint tea luckily the place was fully furnishedi wouldnt have to buy much as i relaxed floating in the diffused light that flooded the room the scent of peppermint drifted up to clear my mind finally i forced myself to pull out my compact may hadnt asked but there was no way she could have overlooked them i ran my fingers along the fading lines that crisscrossed my throat how many times had i defended myself against the accusations that id asked for it and yet inside i could hear my own voice loudest of all if only youd left early enough if only youd called for help the scars would fade from my throat in time but theyd burn forever in my memory wearily i wandered into the living room where i turned jasons picture back around the glittering man how hed first sparkled into my life suave sophisticated the mysterious stranger of all young girls dreams the dark knight who rushes in to sweep us away i lifted the frame off the wall and stared deep into those eyes and then i slammed it into the fireplace smashing it to bits youre dead i thought youre dead and you cant hurt me anymore but deep in my heart i didnt really believe it he remained hidden for a few days watching her from mirror to mirror keeping quiet talking only to the cat the calico had set up a cautious conversation with him in return he reached out of the mirrors petted her tummy offered her a chin scratch by the time he was ready to approach the woman he had a pretty good idea of what had happened jason always had been a hardnosed son of a bitch hed been cruel and vindictive and at times downright dangerous but jason was dead and cruel or not had brought galen the key to his manacles he tried to make sense of what his cousin told him but so much seemed confusing but from what he understood the woman had killed jason and like his cousin or not murder wasnt the most desirable option circe told him a different story but like all cats she lived on a different time line she seemed to think the mess went down during the blooming of the daffodils before the daffodils this timein other words a year ago spring and so he watched laurel from the mirrors in the house watched her alone and quietly turned away when he felt he was intruding on her private moments she was beautiful in an autumn sort of way cloaked in red hair and fair skin laurel reminded him of a woman made of burning leaves but he could see the scars on her throat and they made him wonder jason kept silent on the matter a noise caught my attention that was one thing about breakaway farmthe house was filled with creaks and shudders and all the requisite noises that attend old houses id gotten used to most of them but now and then i couldnt shake the feeling that i was being watched i put down my embroidery and listened this noise had been loud enough to really hear and it sounded like it was coming from my bedroom circe was sitting on the rocking chair you hear that baby she slowly turned her gaze to me and mewed shed been responsible for my rescue from jason knocking a vase within reach so i could grab hold of it and hit him once twice and the final third time that ended both his attempts to kill me and his life shed meowed in my ear keeping me conscious till i managed to drag myself over to the phone to call there it was againlouder circes ears twitched and she sat up looking anxious even if it was just a squirrel or raccoon in the attic i needed to know so i picked up the baseball bat that id left in the corner of the room and started upstairs as i approached my bedroom i heard the noise again the door was open and i crept inside my cell phone in my pocket ready in case i needed to call the cops out here in the country though it would take them precious time to reach me i had to learn how to take care of matters on my own the fourposter bed stood silent the window was closed nothing looked out of place slowly i lowered the bat and squinted in the dim light the closet door was off its hingesid removed it first thing out of habit the door to the master bath was open and i inched over peeking inside nothing what the hell maybe it had just been the house maybe old houses settled more than i thought they did shrugging i turned around and found myself facing the antique mirror that rested against one wall id moved it away from my bed because something about it made me nervous a man stared back at me from my reflection whirling i raised the bat but there was no one standing behind me i jerked back to the mirror sure enough he was still there gazing at me from inside the glass i slowly lowered the bat what the hell was going on was i hallucinating overtired or is it a ghost whispered a little voice in my mind ghost a ghost i tried the word on my tongue as i gazed into the mans eyes and then i recognized him from the photo in the living room i was staring at mays son galen who was long long dead now that he had her attention how could he keep her from running scared he pressed one hand against the glass and smiled softly the last thing he wanted to do was chase her away as he watched her struggle to believe he noticed circe saunter up to her mistress the cat casually leaped onto the vanity and stretched up her front paws leaning against the frame of the mirror she gazed into the mirror at him her luminous eyes almond shaped and glowing and then let out a hiss and lightly leaped into laurels arms laurel stared at him then at the cat in her arms she whispered somethinghe couldnt fully hear being stuck in the mirrorbut when she looked at him again her gaze was soft and a flicker of a smile rested on her lips she shifted the cat to her left arm and raised her right hand slowly bringing it up to meet his on the other side of the glass a shiver raced through hima whisper of song on the wind it was enough for one night he flashed her a pale smile then faded from sight at first i only saw him in the mirror but as i got used to his presence galen began to show up in other places id turn around and hed be in the corner of the kitchen id be out in the garden and see him watching from the attic window he never left the house though and i had the feeling he was trapped circe didnt like him but cats and spirits didnt mix so i wasnt too worried she followed me around the house seldom leaving my side at night as the weeks went by i kept meaning to broach the subject with may but i wasnt sure how to begin hey i see your dead son rambling around my house what gives with that just didnt cut it and whenever may came over galen made himself scarce meanwhile i pumped her with questions if galen was going to hang around my house i wanted to know as much as i could about the ghostly man who always had a cheerful smile for me how did galen die i asked one day after wed been talking about the renovations hed made on the house she pressed her lips together the doctor the doctor said he had a heart attack but galen was strong he was in shape and kept his health up one day her voice cracked but she waved away the tissue i offered her one day i came over to see why he hadnt shown up for breakfast it was the morning after halloween his body was on the floor in the bedroom he just died im sorry i whispered wondering if that was why hed come back maybe he wanted may to know something what was he like may sniffed back her tears as she picked up the rolling pin she was attempting to teach me how to make pie crust baking wasnt one of my strong suits but with a tree full of apples growing ripe in the side yard it just seemed wrong to let them go to waste he was a good man she finally said he was the son every mother dreams of having strong handsome good hearted loved animals he never had a date because all the girls wanted to just be friends theyd cry on his shoulder about the men who treated them badly then go right back for more abuse she shook her head ill never understand she added then stopped abruptly looking at me im sorry i stared at the pie crust as she gently flipped it over the rolling pin then spread it over the deep pie dish how could i explain id been explaining for months to people and making excuses for years to myself sometimes you believe what youre told that nobody else will ever want you that youre worthless you believe it because you grow up hearing it over and over jason was a god in my eyes he actedhe told mehe was doing me a favor by loving me none of my mothers string of boyfriends were role models and i was so shy that nobody else ever asked me out how could i avoid falling for a man who i thought could actually love me who promised to love me forever i busied myself with the teakettle then gave up and looked at her bleakly it ended the day after our honeymoon and i was so embarrassed i could never tell anyone just how bad our marriage was may laid a gentle hand on my arm i know child i know i understand not all of us are strong i whispered dropping several tea bags in the chintz pot not all of us know how to be strong after that may came over a lot she taught me how to bake she strolled with me through the gardens and showed me which were weeds and which would blossom into flowers come spring and always always in the background galen hovered at the edge of my vision at night i talked to him sometimes he showed himself others not but i always knew he was there id tell him about my day while i folded laundry or brought out my paints or thumbed through the newspaper and meanwhile i did research on ghosts to find out just what i was dealing with but for all my research i still couldnt figure out what galen wanted he wouldnt talk to mei didnt even know if he couldand he never ventured outside if he wanted to resolve some lingering issue with his mother he would have been falling all over himself to appear when she came over all the books did was to confirm that some ghosts were benign others werent and that some might just be memories trapped in a spacetime continuum but as the weeks wore on i did know one thing for certain i enjoyed his company galen was the perfect roommateundemanding quiet and there every night and he really listened to meeven though i didnt know if he could actually hear me eventually i began to feel more than just friendship enough to start undressing in front of the antique mirror where he appeared in my bedroom on a morbid note it occurred to me that i was probably standing right where he had when hed died but i pushed the thought away and when he stared at me as i let my clothes drop to the ground i made it worth the look he had her and he knew he had her jason had been rightshe was pliable and before long hed have his freedom the house had held him chained for years but he always knew there was one way out he didnt dare show himself to his mothershe might offer herself and that would never do hed never be able to live with the guilt but this girl this woman she would make it possible for him to slip out from behind the mirror to walk into the light he had to win her trust had to convince her that he was safe and so he listened to her night and day and no one was the wiser except for the cat circe planted herself on laurels lap or on the floor between them whenever he showed up whatever the case he wasnt afraid there was no way she could expose him even though she could see right through his smiles gradually laurel began to let down her guard galen found himself mesmerized by the sight of her as she stood naked caressing herself through the dark sultry nights autumn wore on and instead of growing more excited about his impending release he began to dread the turn of the days each night he hesitated a little bit more the sound of her voice staticridden though it may be filled him with the urge to smile galen began to live for the evenings when they could spend time together at the end of each day they bid each other good night with hands pressed against the glass touching through the veils and galen began to question his plan because there was something in laurels eyes that gave him pause that made him think that maybe she really could love him and no woman had ever fallen for him before halloween i stood by the window watching the sun slowly lower itself below the treeline the season was turning autumn had arrived may was due over tomorrow we were going huckleberry picking and she was going to teach me how to make jam as i took a deep breath a tangy chill settled into my lungs and i felt incredibly sad the smell of wood smoke and crackling leaves reminded me of some lurking sorrow just what it wasi didnt know but whatever it was it hovered in the shadows i turned back to the bed circe was sitting there staring at me with her brilliant green eyes she let out a little chirp and i sat beside her scratching her under the chin her eyes were closedcat blissand i let out a long sigh looking over at the mirror galen was late tonight he usually appeared an hour or so before i went to sleep and we spent the time together quietly pressing hands through the mirror or i would read to him wondering if he could hear me right now i was reading to him from tennyson and was set to read the lady of shalott next circe suddenly hissed her hackles rising as she stared at the mirror poised for a fight i slowly stood wondering whether galen was coming even though i knew she didnt like him shed never acted like this before i slowly approached the mirror and there he was standing his hand against the glass he looked upset and i leaned closer bringing my hand up to the cool glass is something wrong i stared into his eyes my hand against his whats wrong he stared at me his gaze fastened on mine as the clock chimed the hour at the first stroke of midnight the mirror began to melt as his hand closed over mine startled i screamed as circe leaped into my other arm the looking glass vanished and i became alice galen shook his head dazed had it really happened was he free from the mirror could he move on out of the house to whatever afterlife waited for him and then memory hit he let out sharp gasp no no please no dont let it be true his heart spoke before his mind and he turned toward the mirror dreading what he knew he would see there behind the glass pounding against it stood laurel circe at her feet her body and the cats lay in front of the mirror near him both seizing im free suddenly became mingled with i just killed the best thing that ever happened to me galen shook his head no no please it came out a whimper lost in the silence of all hallows night it came out a scream from the back of his throat laurel laurel he tried to pound on the mirror but here he was spirit unable to touch the glass except except for one way please tell me i didnt do this to you and then he stopped the clock was chiming the final strokes of midnight he slammed his hand against the pane and motioned for laurel to do the same a look of terror in her eyes she obeyed as their hands met he could feel her fingers sliding through the glass behind her he caught a glimpse of jason watching them seething you cant have her with all his strength galen yanked laurel by the wrist and she tumbled out back into her body circe following suit and just as quickly he was swept into the mirror his spirit captured once more the clock fell silent midnight was over the veils between the worlds had closed for another year and he was still trapped but this time it was his choice hed made the decision that his own captor chose not to make galen turned as his cousin came up behind him there would be no forgiveness jason had been whispering in his ear too long galen let out a single laugh and as the mists swirled he grappled jason who slipped out of his grasp and faded from sight you didnt win galen whispered you wont ever win because ill always watch out for her as long as she lives in this house ill be there to watch over her i woke up on the floor aching and feeling bruised what the hell had happened as i rubbed my head vague images drifted through my mind touching the glass feeling galens delight as he traded places with me but if that was true then what was i doing sitting on the floor circe was sitting next to me nosing me with her sandpaper tongue i scratched her between the ears hey baby what happened did i pass out maybe i was more tired than i thought she stared at me unblinking then walked over to the mirror as she reached up to scratch it she yowled startled i fell forward knocking the mirror to the floor the glass broke into shards and i leaped away to avoid getting cut circe raced off her tail high in the air its okay baby its okayits just an old mirror but as i looked for the dustpan and broom an odd feeling settled in my stomach i looked back at the mirror the nerves were gone i walked into the bedroom and swept up the glass for a moment i thought i saw galens image in the broken shards but then it vanished once my floor was free from glass slivers and the broken frame i headed into the bathroom to brush my teeth as i looked into the mirror a mist formed on the other side and there he was my beloved i pressed my hand against the glass galen i whispered i wish there was a way we could touch he gazed back sadly and pressed his hand against the glass on the other side diana gabaldon international bestseller diana gabaldon is a winner of the quill award and of the corine

leaf on the wind of all hallows it was two weeks yet to halloween but the gremlins were already at work jerry mackenzie turned dolly ii onto the runwayfullthrottle shoulderhunched bloodthumping already halfway up green leaders arsepulled back on the stick and got a choking shudder instead of the giddy lift of takeoff alarmed he eased back but before he could try again there was a bang that made him jerk by reflex smacking his head against the perspex it hadnt been a bullet though the off tire had blown and a sickening tilt looped them off the runway bumping and jolting into the grass there was a strong smell of petrol and jerry popped the spitfires hood and hopped out in panic envisioning imminent incineration just as the last plane of green flight roared past him and took wing its engine fading to a buzz within seconds a mechanic was pelting down from the hangar to see what the trouble was but jerryd already opened dollys belly and the trouble was plain the fuel line was punctured well thank christ he hadnt got into the air with it that was one thing but he grabbed the line to see how bad the puncture was and it came apart in his hands and soaked his sleeve nearly to the shoulder with hightest petrol good job the mechanic hadnt come loping up with a lit cigarette in his mouth he rolled out from under the plane sneezing and gregory the mechanic stepped over him not flying her today mate greg said squatting down to look up into the engine and shaking his head at what he saw aye tell me something i dont know he held his soaked sleeve gingerly away from his body how long to fix her greg shrugged eyes squinted against the cold wind as he surveyed dollys guts half an hour for the tire youll maybe have her back up tomorrow if the fuel lines the only engine trouble anything else we should be looking at aye the left winggun trigger sticks sometimes gie us a bit o grease maybe ill see what the canteens got in the way of leftover dripping you best hit the showers mac youre turning blue he was shivering right enough the rapidly evaporating petrol wicking his body heat away like candle smoke still he lingered for a moment watching as the mechanic poked and prodded whistling through his teeth go on then greg said in feigned exasperation backing out of the engine and seeing jerry still there ill take good care of her aye i know i justaye thanks adrenaline from the aborted flight was still surging through him thwarted reflexes making him twitch he walked away suppressing the urge to look back over his shoulder at his wounded plane jerry came out of the pilots wc half an hour later eyes stinging with soap and petrol backbone knotted half his mind was on dolly the other half with his mates blue and green were up this morning red and yellow resting green flight would be out over flamborough head by now hunting he swallowed still restless drymouthed by proxy and went to fetch a cup of tea from the canteen that was a mistake he heard the gremlins laughing as soon as he walked in and saw sailor malan malan was group captain and a decent bloke overall south african a great tacticianand the most ferocious most persistent air fighter jerryd seen yet rat terriers werent in it which was why he felt a beetle skitter briefly down his spine when malans deepset eyes fixed on him lieutenant malan rose from his seat smiling the very man i had in mind the devil he had jerry thought arranging his face into a look of respectful expectancy malan couldnt have heard about dollys spot of bother yet and without that jerry would have scrambled with a flight on their way to hunt s over flamborough head malan hadnt been looking for jerry he just thought hed do for whatever job was up and the fact that the group captain had called him by his rank rather than his name meant it probably wasnt a job anyone would volunteer for he didnt have time to worry about what that might be though malan was introducing the other man a tallish chap in army uniform with dark hair and a pleasant if sharp look about him eyes like a good sheepdog he thought nodding in reply to captain randalls greeting kindly maybe but he wont miss much randalls come over from ops at ealing sailor was saying over his shoulder he hadnt waited for them to exchange polite chat but was already leading them out across the tarmac heading for the flight command offices jerry grimaced and followed casting a longing glance downfield at dolly who was being towed ignominiously into the hangar the rag doll painted on her nose was blurred the black curls partially dissolved by weather and spilled petrol well hed touch it up later when hed heard the details of whatever horrible job the stranger had brought his gaze rested resentfully on randalls neck and the man turned suddenly glancing back over his shoulder as though hed felt the stress of jerrys regard jerry felt a qualm in the pit of his stomach as halfrecognized observationsthe lack of insignia on the uniform that air of confidence peculiar to men who kept secretsgelled with the look in the strangers eye ops at ealing my aunt fanny he thought he wasnt even surprised as sailor waved randall through the door to hear the group captain lean close and murmur in his ear carefulhes a funny bugger jerry nodded stomach tightening malan didnt mean captain randall was either humorous or a freemason funny bugger in this context meant only one thing mi captain randall was from the secret arm of british intelligence he made no bones about it once malan had deposited them in a vacant office and left them to it were wanting a pilota good pilothe added with a faint smileto fly solo reconnaissance a new project very special solo where jerry asked warily spitfires normally flew in fourplane flights or in larger configurations all the way up to an entire squadron sixteen planes in formation they could cover one another to some extent against the heavier henckels and messerschmitts but they seldom flew alone by choice ill tell you that a bit later firstare you fit do you think jerry reared back a bit at that stung what did this bloody boffin think hethen he caught a glance at his reflection in the windowpane eyes red as a mad boars his wet hair sticking up in spikes a fresh red bruise spreading on his forehead and his blouson stuck to him in damp patches where he hadnt bothered to dry off before dressing extremely fit he snapped sir randall lifted a hand half an inch dismissing the need for sirs i meant your knee he said mildly oh jerry said disconcerted that aye its fine hed taken two bullets through his right knee a year before when hed dived after a and neglected to see another one that popped out of nowhere behind him and peppered his arse on fire but terrified of bailing out into a sky filled with smoke bullets and random explosions hed ridden his burning plane down both of them screaming as they fell out of the sky dolly is metal skin so hot it had seared his left forearm through his jacket his right foot squelching in the blood that filled his boot as he stamped the pedal made it though and had been on the sick and hurt list for two months he still limped very noticeably but he didnt regret his smashed patella hed had his second months sick leave at homeand wee roger had come along nine months later he smiled broadly at thought of his lad and randall smiled back in involuntary response good he said youre all right to fly a long mission then jerry shrugged how long can it be in a spitfire unless youve thought up a way to refuel in the air hed meant that as a joke and was further disconcerted to see randalls lips purse a little as though thinking whether to tell him they had it is a spitfire ye mean me to fly he asked suddenly uncertain christ what if it was one of the experimental birds they heard about now and again his skin prickled with a combination of fear and excitement but randall nodded oh yes certainly nothing else is maneuverable enough and there may be a good bit of ducking and dodging what weve done is to take a spitfire ii remove one pair of wing guns and refit it with a pair of cameras one pair again that slight pursing of lips before randall replied you might need the second pair of guns oh aye well then the immediate notion as randall explained it was for jerry to go to northumberland where hed spend two weeks being trained in the use of the wing cameras taking pictures of selected bits of landscape at different altitudes and where hed work with a support team who were meant to be trained in keeping the cameras functioning in bad weather theyd teach him how to get the film out without ruining it just in case he had to after which i cant tell you yet exactly where youll be going randall had said his manner through the conversation had been intent but friendly joking now and then now all trace of joviality had vanished he was dead serious eastern europe is all i can say just now jerry felt his inside hollow out a little and took a deep breath to fill the empty space he could say no but hed signed up to be an raf flier and thats what he was aye right will imaybe see my wife once before i go then randalls face softened a little at that and jerry saw the captains thumb touch his own gold wedding ring in reflex i think that can be arranged marjorie mackenziedolly to her husbandopened the blackout curtains no more than an inch well two inches it wouldnt matter the inside of the little flat was dark as the inside of a coal scuttle london outside was equally dark she knew the curtains were open only because she felt the cold glass of the window through the narrow crack she leaned close breathing on the glass and felt the moisture of her breath condense cool near her face couldnt see the mist but felt the squeak of her fingertip on the glass as she quickly drew a small heart there the letter j inside it faded at once of course but that didnt matter the charm would be there when the light came in invisible but there standing between her husband and the sky when the light came it would fall just so across his pillow shed see his sleeping face in the light the jackstraw hair the fading bruise on his temple the deepset eyes closed in innocence he looked so young asleep almost as young as he really was only twentytwo too young to have such lines in his face she touched the corner of her mouth but couldnt feel the crease the mirror showed herher mouth was swollen tender and the ball of her thumb ran across her lower lip lightly to and fro what else what else what more could she do for him hed left her with something of himself perhaps there would be another babysomething he gave her but something she gave him as well another baby another child to raise alone even so she whispered her mouth tightening face raw from hours of stubbled kissing neither of them had been able to wait for him to shave even so at least hed got to see roger hold his little boyand have said little boy sick up milk all down the back of his shirt jerryd yelped in surprise but hadnt let her take roger back hed held his son and petted him until the wee mannie fell asleep only then laying him down in his basket and stripping off the stained shirt before coming to her it was cold in the room and she hugged herself she was wearing nothing but jerrys string vesthe thought she looked erotic in itlewd he said approving his highland accent making the word sound really dirtyand the thought made her smile the thin cotton clung to her breasts true enough and her nipples poked out something scandalous if only from the chill she wanted to go crawl in next to him longing for his warmth longing to keep touching him for as long as they had hed need to go at eight to catch the train back it would barely be light then some puritanical impulse of denial kept her hovering there though cold and wakeful in the dark she felt as though if she denied herself her desire offered that denial as sacrifice it would strengthen the magic help to keep him safe and bring him back god knew what a minister would say to that bit of superstition and her tingling mouth twisted in selfmockery and doubt still she sat in the dark waiting for the cold blue light of the dawn that would take him baby roger put an end to her dithering though babies did he rustled in his basket making the little wakingup grunts that presaged an outraged roar at the discovery of a wet nappy and an empty stomach and she hurried across the tiny room to his basket breasts swinging heavy already letting down her milk she wanted to keep him from waking jerry but stubbed her toe on the spindly chair and sent it over with a bang there was an explosion of bedclothes as jerry sprang up with a loud fuck that drowned her own muffled damn and roger topped them both with a shriek like an airraid siren like clockwork old mrs munns in the next flat thumped indignantly on the thin wall jerrys naked shape crossed the room in a bound he pounded furiously on the partition with his fist making the wallboard quiver and boom like a drum he paused fist still raised waiting roger had stopped screeching impressed by the racket dead silence from the other side of the wall and marjorie pressed her mouth against rogers round little head to muffle her giggling he smelled of baby scent and fresh pee and she cuddled him like a large hotwater bottle his immediate warmth and need making her notions of watching over her men in the lonely cold seem silly jerry gave a satisfied grunt and came across to her ha he said and kissed her what dye think you are she whispered leaning into him a gorilla yeah he whispered back taking her hand and pressing it against him want to see my banana dzienń dobry jerry halted in the act of lowering himself into a chair and stared at a smiling frank randall oh aye he said like that is it pierdolić matka it meant fuck your mother in polish and randall taken by surprise broke out laughing like that he agreed he had a wodge of papers with him official forms all sorts the bumf as the pilots called itjerry recognized the one you signed that named who your pension went to and the one about what to do with your body if there was one and anyone had time to bother hed done all that when he signed up but they made you do it again if you went on special service he ignored the forms though eyes fixed instead on the maps randall had brought and heres me thinkin you and malan picked me for my bonny face he drawled exaggerating his accent he sat and leaned back affecting casualness it is poland then so it hadnt been coincidence after allor only the coincidence of dollys mishap sending him into the building early in a way that was comforting it wasnt the bloody hand of fate tapping him on the shoulder by puncturing the fuel line the hand of fate had been in it a good bit earlier putting him in green flight with andrej kolodziewicz andrej was a real good bloke a good friend hed copped it a month before spiraling up away from a messerschmitt maybe hed been blinded by the sun maybe just looking over the wrong shoulder left wing shot to hell and hed spiraled right back down and into the ground jerry hadnt seen the crash but hed heard about it and got drunk on vodka with andrejs brother after poland randall agreed malan says you can carry on a conversation in polish that true i can order a drink start a fight or ask directions any of that of use the last one might be randall said very dry but well hope it doesnt come to that the mi agent had pushed aside the forms and unrolled the maps despite himself jerry leaned forward drawn as by a magnet they were official maps but with markings made by handcircles xs its like this randall said flattening the maps with both hands the nazis have had labor camps in poland for the last two years but its not common knowledge among the publiceither home or abroad it would be very helpful to the war effort if it were common knowledge not just the camps existence but the kind of thing that goes on there a shadow crossed the dark lean faceanger jerry thought intrigued apparently mr mi knew what kinds of things went on there and he wondered how if we want it widely known and widely talked aboutand we dowe need documentary evidence randall said matteroffactly photographs thered be four of them he said four spitfire pilots a flightbut they wouldnt fly together each one of them would have a specific target geographically separate but all to be hit on the same day the camps are guarded but not with antiaircraft ordnance there are towers though machine guns and jerry didnt need telling that a machine gun was just as effective in someones hands as it was from an enemy plane to take the sort of pictures randall wanted would mean coming in lowlow enough to risk being shot from the towers his only advantage would be the benefit of surprise the guards might spot him but they wouldnt be expecting him to come diving out of the sky for a low pass just above the camp dont try for more than one pass unless the cameras malfunction better to have fewer pictures than none at all yes sir hed reverted to sir as group captain malan was present at the meeting silent but listening intently got to keep up appearances heres the list of targets youll practice on in northumberland get as close as you think reasonable without risking randalls face did change at that breaking into a wry smile get as close as you can manage with a chance of coming back all right the cameras may be worth even more than you are that got a faint chuckle from malan pilotsespecially trained pilotswere valuable the raf had plenty of planes nowbut nowhere near enough pilots to fly them hed be taught to use the wing camerasand to unload the film safely if he was shot down but was still alive and the plane didnt burn he was to get the film out and try to get it back over the border hence the polish randall ran a hand through his hair and gave jerry a crooked smile if you have to walk out you may need to ask directions they had two polishspeaking pilots he saidpoles whod volunteered and an englishman with a few words of the language like jerry and it is a volunteer mission let me reiterate aye i know jerry said irritably said id go didnt i sir you did randall looked at him for a moment dark eyes unreadable then lowered his gaze to the maps again thanks he said softly the canopy snicked shut over his head it was a dank damp northumberland day and his breath condensed on the inside of the perspex hood within seconds he leaned forward to wipe it away emitting a sharp yelp as several strands of his hair were ripped out hed forgotten to duck again he shoved the canopy release with a muttered oath and the light brown strands caught in the seam where the perspex closed flew away caught up by the wind he closed the canopy again crouching and waiting automatically for the signal for takeoff the signalman wigwagged him and he turned up the throttle feeling the plane begin to move he touched his pocket automatically whispering love you dolly under his breath everyone had his little ritual those last few moments before takeoff for jerry mackenzie it was his wifes face and his lucky stone that usually settled the worms in his belly shed found it in a rocky hill on the isle of lewis where theyd spent their brief honeymoona rough sapphire she said very rare like you hed said and kissed her no need for worms just now but it wasnt a ritual if you only did it sometimes was it and even if it wasnt going to be combat today hed need to be paying attention he went up in slow circles getting the feel of the new plane sniffing to get her scent he wished theyd let him fly dolly ii her seat stained with his sweat the familiar dent in the console where hed slammed his fist in exultation at a killbut theyd already modified this one with the wing cameras and the latest thing in nightsights it didnt do to get attached to the planes anyway they were almost as fragile as the men flying themthough the parts could be reused no matter hed sneaked out to the hanger the evening before and done a quick rag doll on the nose to make it his hed know dolly iii well enough by the time they went into poland he dived pulled up sharp and did dutch rolls for a bit wigwagging through the cloud layer then complete rolls and immelmanns all the while reciting malans rules to focus his mind and keep from getting airsick the rules were posted in every raf barracks now the ten commandments the fliers called themand not as a joke ten of my rules for air fighting the poster said in bold black type jerry knew them by heart wait until you see the whites of his eyes he chanted under his breath fire short bursts of one to two seconds only when your sights are definitely on he glanced at his sights suffering a moments disorientation the camera wizard had relocated them shite whilst shooting think of nothing else brace the whole of your body have both hands on the stick concentrate on your ring sight well away to fuck then the buttons that operated the camera werent on the stick they were on a box connected to a wire that ran out the window the box itself was strapped to his knee hed be bloody looking out the window anyway not using sightsunless things went wrong and he had to use the guns in which case always keep a sharp lookout keep your finger out aye right that one was still good height gives you the initiative not in this case hed be flying low under the radar and not be looking for a fight always the chance one might find him though if any german craft found him flying solo in poland his best chance was likely to head straight for the sun and fall in that thought made him smile always turn and face the attack he snorted and flexed his bad knee which ached with the cold aye if you saw it coming in time make your decisions promptly it is better to act quickly even though your tactics are not the best hed learned that one fast his body often was moving before his brain had even notified his consciousness that hed seen something nothing to see just now nor did he expect to but he kept looking by reflex never fly straight and level for more than thirty seconds in the combat area definitely out straight and level was just what he was going to have to do and slowly when diving to attack always leave a proportion of your formation above to act as a top guard irrelevant he wouldnt have a formationand that was a thought that gave him the cold grue hed be completely alone no help coming if he got into bother initiative aggression air discipline and team work are words that mean something in air fighting yeah they did what meant something in reconnaissance stealth speed and bloody good luck more like he took a deep breath and dived shouting the last of the ten commandments so it echoed in his perspex shell go in quicklypunch hardget out rubbernecking they called it but jerry usually ended a days flying feeling as though hed been cast in concrete from the shoulder blades up he bent his head forward now ferociously massaging the base of his skull to ease the growing ache hed been practicing since dawn and it was nearly teatime ballbearings set for the use of pilots one he thought ought to add that to the standard equipment list he shook his head like a wet dog hunched his shoulders groaning then resumed the sector by sector scan of the sky around him that every pilot did religiously three hundred and sixty degrees every moment in the air all the live ones anyway dollyd given him a white silk scarf as a parting present he didnt know how shed managed the money for it and she wouldnt let him ask just settled it round his neck inside his flight jacket somebodyd told her the spitfire pilots all wore them to save the constant collarchafing and she meant him to have one it felt nice hed admit that made him think of her touch when shed put it on him he pushed the thought hastily aside the last thing he could afford to do was start thinking about his wife if he ever hoped to get back to her and he did mean to get back to her where was that bugger had he given up no hed not a dark spot popped out from behind a bank of cloud just over his left shoulder and dived for his tail jerry turned a hard high spiral up and into the same clouds the other after him like stink on shite they played at dodgem for a few moments in and out of the drifting cloudshe had the advantage in altitude could play the comingoutofthesun trick if there were any sun but it was autumn in northumberland there hadnt been any sun in days gone he heard the buzzing of the other plane faintly for a momentor thought he had hard to tell above the dull roar of his own engine gone though he wasnt where jerryd expected him to be oh like that is it he kept on looking ten degrees of sky every second it was the only way to be sure you didnt miss any a glimpse of something dark and his heart jerked along with his hand up and away it was gone then the black speck but he went on climbing slowly now looking wouldnt do to get too low and he wanted to keep the altitude the cloud was thin here drifting waves of mist but getting thicker he saw a solidlooking bank of cloud moving slowly in from the west but still a good distance away it was cold too his face was chilled he might be picking up ice if he went too hithere the other plane closer and higher than hed expected the other pilot spotted him at the same moment and came roaring down on him too close to avoid he didnt try aye wait for it ye wee bugger he murmured hand tight on the stick one second two almost on himand he buried the stick in his balls jerked it hard left turned neatly over and went off in a long looping series of barrel rolls that put him right away out of range his radio crackled and he heard paul rakoczy chortling through his hairy nose pierdolić matka where you learn that you scotch fucker at my mammys tit dupek he replied grinning buy me a drink and ill teach it to ye a burst of static obscured the end of an obscene polish remark and rakoczy flew off with a wigwag of farewell ah well enough skylarking then back to the fucking cameras jerry rolled his head worked his shoulders and stretched as well as could be managed in the confines of a iis cockpitit had minor improvements over the spitfire i but roominess wasnt one of themhad a glance at the wings for iceno that was all rightand turned farther inland it was too soon to worry over it but his right hand found the trigger that operated the cameras his fingers twiddled anxiously over the buttons checking rechecking he was getting used to them but they didnt work like the gun triggers he didnt have them wired in to his reflexes yet didnt like the feeling either tiny things like typewriter keys not the snug feel of the gun triggers hed only had the righthand ones since yesterday before that hed been flying a plane with the buttons on the left much discussion with flight and the mi buttonboffin whether it was better to stay with the right as hed had practice already or change for the sake of his cackhandedness when theyd finally got round to asking him which he wanted it had been too late in the day to fix it straight off so hed been given a couple of hours extra flying time today to mess about with the new fixup right there it was the bumpy gray line that cut through the yellowing fields of northumberland like a perforation same as you might tear the countryside along it separating north from south as neat as tearing a piece of paper bet the emperor hadrian wished it was that easy he thought grinning as he swooped down along the line of the ancient wall the cameras made a loud clunkclunk noise when they fired clunkclunk clunkclunk okay sashay out bank over come down clunkclunk clunkclunk he didnt like the noise not the same satisfaction as the vicious short brrpt of his wing guns made him feel wrong like something gone with the engine aye there it was coming up his goal for the moment milecastle a stone rectangle attached to hadrians wall like a snail on a leaf the old roman legions had made these small neat forts to house the garrisons that guarded the wall nothing left now but the outline of the foundation but it made a good target he circled once calculating then dived and roared over it at an altitude of maybe fifty feet cameras clunking like an army of stampeding robots pulled up sharp and hared off circling high and fast pulling out to run for the imagined border circling up again and all the time his heart thumped and the sweat ran down his sides imagining what it would be like when the real day came midafternoon it would be like this the winter light just going but still enough to see clearly hed circle find an angle that would let him cross the whole camp and please god one that would let him come out of the sun and then hed go in one pass randall had said dont risk more than oneunless the cameras malfunction the bloody things did malfunction roughly every third pass the buttons were slippery under his fingers sometimes they worked on the next try sometimes they didnt if they didnt work on the first pass over the camp or didnt work often enough hed have to try again niech to szlag he muttered fuck the devil and pressed the buttons again onetwo onetwo gentle but firm like youd do it to a ladys privates the boffin had told him illustrating a brisk twiddle hed never thought of doing that would dolly like it he wondered and where exactly did you do it aye well women did come with a button maybe that was itbut then two fingers clunkclunk clunkclunk crunch he reverted to english profanity and smashed both buttons with his fist one camera answered with a startled clunk but the other was silent he poked the button again and again to no effect bloody fucking arsebuggering he thought vaguely that hed have to stop swearing once this was over and he was home againbad example for the lad fuck he bellowed and ripping the strap free of his leg he picked up the box and hammered it on the edge of the seat then slammed it back onto his thighvisibly dented he saw with grim satisfactionand pressed the balky button clunk the camera answered meekly aye well then just you remember that he said and puffing in righteous indignation gave the buttons a good jabbing hed not been paying attention during this small temper tantrum but had been circling upwardstandard default for a spitfire flier he started back down for a fresh pass at the milecastle but within a minute or two began to hear a knocking sound from the engine no he said and gave it more throttle the knocking got louder he could feel it vibrating through the fuselage then there was a loud clang from the engine compartment right by his knee and with horror he saw tiny droplets of oil spatter on the perspex in front of his face the engine stopped bloody bloody he was too busy to find another word his lovely agile fighter had suddenly become a very clumsy glider he was going down and the only question was whether hed find a relatively flat spot to crash in his hand groped automatically for the landing gear but then drew backno time bellylanding where was the bottom jesus hed been distracted hadnt seen that solid bank of cloud move in it must have come faster than he thoughts flitted through his mind too fast for words he glanced at the altimeter but what it told him was of limited use because he didnt know what the ground under him was like crags flat meadow water he hoped and prayed for a road a grassy flat spot anything short ofgod he was at five hundred feet and still in cloud christ the ground appeared in a sudden burst of yellow and brown he jerked the nose up saw the rocks of a crag dead ahead swerved stalled nosedived pulled back pulled back not enough oh god his first conscious thought was that he should have radioed base when the engine went stupid fucker he mumbled make your decisions promptly it is better to act quickly even though your tactics are not the best clotheid he seemed to be lying on his side that didnt seem right he felt cautiously with one handgrass and mud what had he been thrown clear of the plane he had his head hurt badly his knee much worse he had to sit down on the matted wet grass for a bit unable to think through the waves of pain that squeezed his head with each heartbeat it was nearly dark and rising mist surrounded him he breathed deep sniffing the dank cold air it smelt of rot and old mangelwurzelsbut what it didnt smell of was petrol and burning fuselage right maybe she hadnt caught fire when she crashed then if not and if her radio was still working he staggered to his feet nearly losing his balance from a sudden attack of vertigo and turned in a slow circle peering into the mist there was nothing but mist to his left and behind him but to his right he made out two or three large bulky shapes standing upright making his way slowly across the lumpy ground he found that they were stones remnants of one of those prehistoric sites that littered the ground in northern britain only three of the big stones were still standing but he could see a few more fallen or pushed over lying like bodies in the darkening fog he paused to vomit holding on to one of the stones christ his head was like to split and he had a terrible buzzing in his ears he pawed vaguely at his ear thinking somehow hed left his headset on but felt nothing but a cold wet ear he closed his eyes again breathing hard and leaned against the stone for support the static in his ears was getting worse accompanied by a sort of whine had he burst an eardrum he forced himself to open his eyes and was rewarded with the sight of a large dark irregular shape well beyond the remains of the stone circle dolly the plane was barely visible fading into the swirling dark but thats what it had to be mostly intact it looked like though very much nosedown with her tail in the airshe must have plowed into the earth he staggered on the rockstrewn ground feeling the vertigo set in again with a vengeance he waved his arms trying to keep his balance but his head spun and christ the bloody noise in his head he couldnt think oh jesus he felt as if his bones were dissolv it was full dark when he came to himself again but the clouds had broken and a threequarter moon shone in the deep black of a country sky he moved and groaned every bone in his body hurtbut none was broken that was something he told himself his clothes were sodden with damp he was starving and his knee was so stiff he couldnt straighten his right leg all the way but that was all right he thought he could make shift to hobble as far as a road oh wait radio yes hed forgotten if dollys radio was intact he could he stared blankly at the open ground before him hed have sworn it wasbut he must have got turned round in the dark and fogno he turned quite round three times before he stopped afraid of becoming dizzy again the plane was gone it was gone he was sure it had lain about fifty feet beyond that one stone the tallest one hed taken note of it as a marker to keep his bearings he walked out to the spot where he was sure dolly had come down walked slowly round the stones in a wide circle glancing to one side and then the other in growing confusion not only was the plane goneit didnt seem ever to have been there there was no trace no furrow in the thick meadow grass let alone the kind of gouge in the earth that such a crash would have made had he been imagining its presence wishful thinking he shook his head to clear itbut in fact it was clear the buzzing and whining in his ears had stopped and while he still had bruises and a mild headache he was feeling much better he walked slowly back around the stones still looking a growing sense of deep cold curling through his wame it wasnt fucking there he woke in the morning without the slightest notion where he was he was curled up on grass that much came dimly to him he could smell it grass that cattle had been grazing because there was a large cowpat just by him and fresh enough to smell that too he stretched out a leg cautious then an arm rolled onto his back and felt a hair better for having something solid under him though the sky overhead was a dizzy void it was a soft pale blue void too not a trace of cloud how long a jolt of alarm brought him up onto his knees but a bright yellow stab of pain behind his eyes sat him down again moaning and cursing breathlessly once more he waited till his breath was coming steady then risked cracking one eye open well it was certainly still northumbria the northern part where englands billowing fields crash onto the inhospitable rocks of scotland he recognized the rolling hills covered with sere grass and punctuated by towering rocks that shot straight up into sudden toothy crags he swallowed and rubbed both hands hard over his head and face assuring himself he was still real he didnt feel real even after hed taken a careful count of fingers toes and private bitscounting the latter twice just in casehe still felt that something important had been misplaced torn off somehow and left behind his ears still rang rather like they did after a specially active trip why though what had he heard he found that he could move a little more easily now and managed to look all round the sky sector by sector nothing up there no memory of anything up there and yet the inside of his head buzzed and jangled and the flesh on his body rippled with agitation he chafed his arms hard to make it go horripilation thats the proper word for gooseflesh dollyd told him that she kept a little notebook and wrote down words she came across in her reading she was a great one for the reading shed already got wee roger sitting in her lap to be read to after tea roundeyed as bonzo at the colored pictures in his rag book thought of his family got him up onto his feet swaying but all right now better yes definitely better though he still felt as though his skin didnt quite fit the plane where was that he looked round him no plane was visible anywhere then it came back to him with a lurch of the stomach real it was real hed been sure in the night that he was dreaming or hallucinating had lain down to recover himself and must have fallen asleep but he was awake now no mistake there was a bug of some kind down his back and he slapped viciously to try to squash it his heart was pounding unpleasantly and his palms were sweating he wiped them on his trousers and scanned the landscape it wasnt flat but neither did it offer much concealment no trees no bosky dells there was a small lake off in the distance he caught the shine of waterbut if hed ditched in water surely to god hed be wet maybe hed been unconscious long enough to dry out he thought maybe hed imagined that hed seen the plane near the stones surely he couldnt have walked this far from the lake and forgotten it hed started walking toward the lake out of sheer inability to think of anything more useful to do clearly time had passed the sky had cleared like magic well theyd have little trouble finding him at least they knew he was near the wall a truck should be along soon he couldnt be more than two hours from the airfield and a good thing too he muttered hed picked a specially godforsaken spot to crashthere wasnt a farmhouse or a paddock anywhere in sight not so much as a sniff of chimney smoke his head was becoming clearer now hed circle the lakejust in casethen head for the road might meet the support crew coming in and tell them ive lost the bloody plane he asked himself aloud aye right come on ye wee idjit think now where did ye see it last he walked for a long time slowly because of the knee but that began to feel easier after a while his mind was not feeling easier there was something wrong with the countryside granted northumbria was a ragged sort of place but not this ragged hed found a roadbut it wasnt the b road hed seen from the air it was a dirt track pocked with stones and showing signs of being much traveled by hooved animals with a heavily fibrous diet wished he hadnt thought of diet his wame was flapping against his backbone thinking about breakfast was better than thinking about other things though and for a time he amused himself by envisioning the powdered eggs and soggy toast hed have got in the mess then going on to the lavish breakfasts of his youth in the highlands huge bowls of steaming parritch slices of black pudding fried in lard bannocks with marmalade gallons of hot strong tea an hour later he found hadrians wall hard to miss even grown over with grass and all sorts like it was it marched stolidly along just like the roman legions whod built it stubbornly workmanlike a gray seam stitching its way up hill and down dale dividing the peaceful fields to the south from those marauding buggers up north he grinned at the thought and sat down on the wallit was less than a yard high just hereto massage his knee he hadnt found the plane or anything else and was beginning to doubt his own sense of reality hed seen a fox any number of rabbits and a pheasant whod nearly given him heart failure by bursting out from right under his feet no people at all though and that was giving him a queer feeling in his water aye there was a war on right enough and many of the menfolk were gonebut the farmhouses hadnt been sacrificed to the war effort had they the women were running the farms feeding the nation all thathed heard the pm on the radio praising them for it only last week so where the bloody hell was everybody the sun was getting low in the sky when at last he saw a house it was flush against the wall and struck him somehow familiar though he knew hed never seen it before stonebuilt and squat but quite large with a rattylooking thatch there was smoke coming from the chimney though and he limped toward it as fast as he could go there was a person outsidea woman in a ratty long dress and an apron feeding chickens he shouted and she looked up her mouth falling open at the sight of him hey he said breathless from hurry ive had a crash i need help are ye on the phone maybe she didnt answer she dropped the basket of chicken feed and ran right away round the corner of the house he sighed in exasperation well maybe shed gone to fetch her husband he didnt see any sign of a vehicle not so much as a tractor but maybe the man was the man was tall stringy bearded and snaggletoothed he was also dressed in dirty shirt and baggy short pants that showed his hairy legs and bare feetand accompanied by two other men in similar comic attire jerry instantly interpreted the looks on their faces and didnt stay to laugh hey nay problem mate he said backing up hands raised im off right they kept coming slowly spreading out to surround him he hadnt liked the looks of them to start with and was liking them less by the second hungry they looked with a speculative glitter in their eyes one of them said something to him a question of some kind but the northumbrian accent was too thick for him to catch more than a word who was the word and he hastily pulled his dog tags from the neck of his blouson waving the red and green disks at them one of the men smiled but not in a nice way look he said still backing up i didna mean to the man in the lead reached out a horny hand and took hold of his forearm he jerked back but the man instead of letting go punched him in the belly he could feel his mouth opening and shutting like a fishs but no air came in he flailed wildly but they all were on him then they were calling out to each other and he didnt understand a word but the intent was plain as the nose he managed to butt with his head it was the only blow he landed within two minutes hed been efficiently beaten into pudding had his pockets rifled been stripped of his jacket and dog tags frogmarched down the road and heaved bodily down a steep rocky slope he rolled bouncing from one outcrop to the next until he managed to fling out an arm and grab on to a scrubby thornbush he came to a scraping halt and lay with his face in a clump of heather panting and thinking incongruously of taking dolly to the pictures just before hed joined up theyd seen the wizard of oz and he was beginning to feel creepily like the lass in that filmmaybe it was the resemblance of the northumbrians to scarecrows and lions at least the fucking lion spoke english he muttered sitting up jesus now what it occurred to him that it might be a good time to stop cursing and start praying london two years later shed been home from her work no more than five minutes just time to meet rogers mad charge across the floor shrieking mummy she pretending to be staggered by his impactnot so much a pretense he was getting big just time to call out to her own mum hear the muffled reply from the kitchen sniff hopefully for the comforting smell of tea and catch a tantalizing whiff of tinned sardines that made her mouth watera rare treat just time to sit down for what seemed the first time in days and take off her highheeled shoes relief washing over her feet like seawater when the tide comes in she noticed with dismay the hole in the heel of her stocking though her last pair too she was just undoing her garter thinking that shed have to start using legtan like maisie drawing a careful seam up the back of each leg with an eyebrow pencil when there came a knock at the door mrs mackenzie the man who stood at the door of her mothers flat was tall a dark silhouette in the dimness of the hall but she knew at once he was a soldier yes she couldnt help the leap of her heart the clench of her stomach she tried frantically to damp it down deny it the hope that had sprung up like a struck match a mistake thered been a mistake he hadnt been killed hed been lost somehow maybe captured and now theyd found hithen she saw the small box in the soldiers hand and her legs gave way under her her vision sparkled at the edges and the strangers face swam above her blurred with concern she could hear thoughhear her mum rush through from the kitchen slippers slapping in her haste voice raised in agitation heard the mans name captain randall frank randall hear rogers small husky voice warm in her ear saying mummy mummy in confusion then she was on the swaybacked davenport holding a cup of hot water that smelled of teathey could only change the tea leaves once a week and this was friday she thought irrelevantly he should have come on sunday her mum was saying they could have given him a decent cuppa but perhaps he didnt work on sundays her mum had put captain randall in the best chair near the electric fire and had switched on two bars as a sign of hospitality her mother was chatting with the captain holding roger in her lap her son was more interested in the little box sitting on the tiny piecrust table he kept reaching for it but his grandmother wouldnt let him have it marjorie recognized the intent look on his face he wouldnt throw a fithe hardly ever didbut he wouldnt give up either he didnt look a lot like his father save when he wanted something badly she pulled herself up a bit shaking her head to clear the dizziness and roger looked up at her distracted by her movement for an instant she saw jerry look out of his eyes and the world swam afresh she closed her own though and gulped her tea scalding as it was mum and captain randall had been talking politely giving her time to recover herself did he have children of his own mum asked no he said with what might have been a wistful look at wee roger not yet i havent seen my wife in two years better late than never said a sharp voice and she was surprised to discover that it was hers she put down the cup pulled up the loose stocking that had puddled round her ankle and fixed captain randall with a look what have you brought me she said trying for a tone of calm dignity didnt work she sounded brittle as broken glass even to her own ears captain randall eyed her cautiously but took up the little box and held it out to her its lieutenant mackenzies he said an mid oakleaf cluster awarded posthumously for with an effort she pushed herself away back into the cushions shaking her head i dont want it really marjorie her mother was shocked and i dont like that word posposthdont say it she couldnt overcome the notion that jerry was somehow inside the boxa notion that seemed dreadful at one moment comforting the next captain randall set it down very slowly as though it might blow up i wont say it he said gently may i say though i knew him your husband very briefly but i did know him i came with this myself because i wanted to say to you how very brave he was brave the word was like a pebble in her mouth she wished she could spit it at him of course he was her mother said firmly hear that roger your dad was a good man and he was a brave one you wont forget that roger was paying no attention struggling to get down his gran set him reluctantly on the floor and he lurched over to captain randall taking a firm grip on the captains freshcreased trousers with both handshands greasy she saw with sardine oil and toast crumbs the captains lips twitched but he didnt try to detach roger just patted his head whos a good boy then he asked fith roger said firmly fith marjorie felt an incongruous impulse to laugh at the captains puzzled expression though it didnt touch the stone in her heart its his new word she said fish he cant say sardine thar deem roger said glaring at her fitttthhhhh the captain laughed out loud and pulling out a handkerchief carefully wiped the spittle off rogers face casually going on to wipe the grubby little paws as well of course its a fish he assured roger youre a clever lad and a big help to your mummy im sure here ive brought you something for your tea he groped in the pocket of his coat and pulled out a small pot of jam strawberry jam marjories salivary glands contracted painfully with the sugar rationing she hadnt tasted jam in hes a great help her mother put in stoutly determined to keep the conversation on a proper plane despite her daughters peculiar behavior she avoided marjories eye a lovely boy his names roger yes i know he glanced at marjorie whod made a brief movement your husband told me he was brave you told me suddenly something snapped it was her halfhooked garter but the pop of it made her sit up straight fists clenched in the thin fabric of her skirt brave she repeated theyre all brave arent they every single one even youor are you she heard her mothers gasp but went on anyway reckless you all have to be brave and noble andandperfect dont you because if you were weak if there were any cracks if anyone looked like being not quite the thing you knowwell it might all fall apart mightnt it so none of you will will you or if somebody did the rest of you would cover it up you wont ever not do something no matter what it is because you cant not do it all the other chaps would think the worse of you wouldnt they and we cant have that oh no we cant have that captain randall was looking at her intently his eyes dark with concern probably thought she was a nutterprobably she was but what did it matter marjie marjie love her mother was murmuring horribly embarrassed you oughnt to say such things to you made him do it didnt you she was on her feet now looming over the captain making him look up at her he told me he told me about you you came and asked him to dowhatever it was that got him killed oh dont trouble yourself he didnt tell me your bloody precious secrets not him he wouldnt do that he was a flier she was panting with rage and had to stop to draw breath roger she saw dimly had shrunk into himself and was clinging to the captains leg randall put an arm about the boy automatically as though to shelter him from his mothers wrath with an effort she made herself stop shouting and to her horror felt tears begin to course down her face and now all this time later you come and bring meand bring me marjie her mother came up close beside her her body warm and soft and comforting in her worn old pinny she thrust a tea towel into marjories hands then moved between her daughter and the enemy solid as a battleship its kind of you tove brought us this captain marjorie heard her saying and felt her move away bending to pick up the little box marjorie sat down blindly pressing the tea towel to her face hiding here roger look see how it opens see how pretty its calledwhat did you say it was again captain oh oakleaf cluster yes thats right can you say medal roger mehdul this is your dads medal roger didnt say anything probably scared stiff poor little chap she had to pull herself together but shed gone too far she couldnt stop he cried when he left me she muttered the secret into the folds of the tea towel he didnt want to go her shoulders heaved with a convulsive unexpected sob and she pressed the towel hard against her eyes whispering to herself you said youd come back jerry you said youd come back she stayed hidden behind her floursacking fortress while renewed offers of tea were madeand to her vague surprise accepted shed thought captain randall would seize the chance of her retreat to make his own but he stayed chatting calmly with her mother talking slowly to roger while her mother fetched the tea ignoring her embarrassing performance entirely keeping up a quiet companionable presence in the shabby room the rattle and bustle of the tea trays arrival gave her the opportunity to drop her cloth facade and she meekly accepted a slice of toast spread with a thin scrape of margarine and a delectable spoonful of the strawberry jam there now her mother said looking on with approval youll not have eaten anything since breakfast i daresay enough to give anyone the wambles marjorie shot her mother a look but in fact it was true she hadnt had any luncheon because maisie was off with female troublea condition that afflicted her roughly every other weekand shed had to mind the shop all day conversation flowed comfortably around her a soothing stream past an immoveable rock even roger relaxed with the introduction of jam hed never tasted any before and sniffed it curiously took a cautious lickand then took an enormous bite that left a red smear on his nose his mossgreen eyes round with wonder and delight the little box now open sat on the piecrust table but no one spoke of it or looked in that direction after a decent interval captain randall got up to go giving roger a shiny sixpence in parting feeling it the least she could do marjorie got up to see him out her stockings spiraled down her legs and she kicked them off with contempt walking barelegged to the door she heard her mother sigh behind her thank you she said opening the door for him i appreciated to her surprise he stopped her putting a hand on her arm ive no particular right to say this to youbut i will he said lowvoiced youre right theyre not all brave most of themof uswere just there and we do our best most of the time he added and the corner of his mouth lifted slightly though she couldnt tell whether it was in humor or bitterness but your husband he closed his eyes for a moment and said the bravest are surely those who have the clearest vision of what is before them glory and danger alike and yet notwithstanding go out to meet it he did that every day for a long time you sent him though she said her voice as low as his you did his smile was bleak ive done such things every day for a long time the door closed quietly behind him and she stood there swaying eyes closed feeling the draft come under it chilling her bare feet it was well into the autumn now and the dark was smudging the windows though it was just past teatime ive done what i do every day for a long time too she thought but they dont call it brave when you dont have a choice her mother was moving through the flat muttering to herself as she closed the curtains or not so much to herself he liked her anyone could see that so kind coming himself to bring the medal and all and how does she act like a cat thats had its tail stepped on all claws and caterwauling thats how how does she ever expect a man to i dont want a man marjorie said loudly her mother turned round squat solid implacable you need a man marjorie and little rog needs a father he has a father she said through her teeth captain randall has a wife and i dont need anyone anyone but jerry northumbria he licked his lips at the smell hot pastry steaming juicy meat there was a row of fat little pasties ranged along the sill covered with a clean cloth in case of birds but showing plump and rounded through it the odd spot of gravy soaking through the napkin his mouth watered so fiercely that his salivary glands ached and he had to massage the underside of his jaw to ease the pain it was the first house hed seen in two days once hed got out of the ravine hed circled well away from the milecastle and eventually struck a small cluster of cottages where the people were no more understandable but did give him some food that had lasted him a little while beyond that hed been surviving on what he could glean from hedges and the odd vegetable patch hed found another hamlet but the folk there had driven him away once hed got enough of a grip of himself to think clearly it became obvious that he needed to go back to the standing stones whatever had happened to him had happened there and if he really was somewhere in the pastand hard as hed tried to find some alternative explanation none was forthcomingthen his only chance of getting back where he belonged seemed to lie there too hed come well away from the drovers track though seeking food and as the few people he met didnt understand him any more than he understood them hed had some difficulty in finding his way back to the wall he thought he was quite close now thoughthe ragged country was beginning to seem familiar though perhaps that was only delusion everything else had faded into unimportance though when he smelled food he circled the house at a cautious distance checking for dogs no dog aye fine then he chose an approach from the side out of view of any of the few windows darted swiftly from bush to plowshare to midden to house and plastered himself against the gray stone wall breathing hardand breathing in that delicious savory aroma shite he was drooling he wiped his sleeve hastily across his mouth slithered round the corner and reached out a hand as it happened the farmstead did boast a dog which had been attending its absent master in the barn both these worthies returning unexpectedly at this point the dog at once spotted what it assumed to be jiggerypokery taking place and gave tongue in an altogether proper manner alerted in turn to felonious activity on his premises the householder instantly joined the affray armed with a wooden spade with which he batted jerry over the head as he staggered back against the wall of the house he had just wit enough left to notice that the farmwifenow sticking out of her window and shrieking like the glasgow expresshad knocked one of the pasties to the ground where it was being devoured by the dog who wore an expression of piety and rewarded virtue that jerry found really offensive then the farmer hit him again and he stopped being offended it was a wellbuilt byre the stones fitted carefully and mortared he wore himself out with shouting and kicking at the door until his gammy leg gave way and he collapsed onto the earthen floor now bloody what he muttered he was damp with sweat from his effort but it was cold in the byre with that penetrating damp cold peculiar to the british isles that seeps into your bones and makes the joints ache his knee would give him fits in the morning the air was cold but saturated with the scent of manure and chilled urine why would the bloody jerries want the damn place he said and sitting up huddled into his shirt it was going to be a frigging long night he got up onto his hands and knees and felt carefully round inside the byre but there was nothing even faintly edibleonly a scurf of moldy hay not even the rats would have that the inside of the place was empty as a drum and silent as a church what had happened to the cows he wondered dead of a plague eaten sold or maybe just not yet back from the summer pasturesthough it was late in the year for that surely he sat down again back against the door as the wood was marginally less cold than the stone walls hed thought about being captured in battle made prisoner by the germansthey all had now and then though chaps mostly didnt talk about it he thought about pow camps and those camps in poland the ones hed been meant to photograph were they as bleak as this stupid thing to think of really but hed got to pass the time till morning one way or another and there were lots of things hed rather not think about just now like what would happen once morning came he didnt think breakfast in bed was going to be part of it the wind was rising whining past the corners of the cow byre with a keening noise that set his teeth on edge he still had his silk scarf it had slipped down inside his shirt when the bandits in the milecastle had attacked him he fished it out now and wrapped it round his neck for comfort if not warmth hed brought dolly breakfast in bed now and then she woke up slow and sleepy and he loved the way she scooped her tangled curly black hair off her face peering out sliteyed like a small sweet mole blinking in the light hed sit her up and put the tray on the table beside her and then hed shuck his own clothes and crawl in bed too cuddling close to her soft warm skin sometimes sliding down in the bed and her pretending not to notice sipping tea or putting marmite on her toast while he burrowed under the covers and found his way up through the cottony layers of sheets and nightie he loved the smell of her always but especially when hed made love to her the night before and she bore the strong musky scent of him between her legs he shifted a little roused by the memory but the subsequent thoughtthat he might never see her againquelled him at once still thinking of dolly though he put his hand automatically to his pocket and was alarmed to find no lump there he slapped at his thigh but failed to find the small hard bulge of the sapphire could he have put it in the other pocket by mistake he delved urgently shoving both hands deep into his pockets no stonebut there was something in his righthand pocket something powdery almost greasy what the devil he brought his fingers out peering as closely at them as he could but it was too dark to see more than a vague outline of his hand let alone anything on it he rubbed his fingers gingerly together it felt something like the thick soot that builds up inside a chimney jesus he whispered and put his fingers to his nose there was a distinct smell of combustion not petrolish at all but a scent of burning so intense he could taste it on the back of his tongue like something out of a volcano what in the name of god almighty could burn a rockand leave the man who carried it alive the sort of thing hed met among the standing stones that was what hed been doing all right with the not feeling too afraid until now but he swallowed hard and sat down again quietly now i lay me down to sleep he whispered to the knees of his trousers i pray the lord my soul to keep he did in fact sleep eventually in spite of the cold from simple exhaustion he was dreaming about wee roger who for some reason was a grown man now but still holding his tiny blue bear minuscule in a broadpalmed grasp his son was speaking to him in the gaelic saying something urgent that he couldnt understand and he was growing frustrated telling roger over and over for christs sake to speak english couldnt he then he heard another voice through the fog of sleep and realized that someone was in fact talking somewhere close by he jerked awake struggling to grasp what was being said and failing utterly it took him several seconds to realize that whoever was speakingthere seemed to be two voices hissing and muttering in argumentreally was speaking in gaelic he had only a smattering of it himself his mother had had it buthe was moving before he could complete the thought panicked at the notion that potential assistance might get away hoy he bellowed scramblingor trying to scrambleto his feet his muchabused knee wasnt having any though and gave way the instant he put weight on it catapulting him facefirst toward the door he twisted as he fell and hit it with his shoulder the booming thud put paid to the argument the voices fell silent at once help help me he shouted pounding on the door help will ye for gods sake hush your noise said a low annoyed voice on the other side of the door ye want to have them all down on us here then bring the light closer this last seemed to be addressed to the voices companion for a faint glow shone through the gap at the bottom of the door there was a scraping noise as the bolt was drawn and a faint grunt of effort then a thunk as the bolt was set down against the wall the door swung open and jerry blinked in a sudden shaft of light as the slide of a lantern grated open he turned his head aside and closed his eyes for an instant deliberate as he would if flying at night and momentarily blinded by a flare or by the glow of his own exhaust when he opened them again the two men were in the cow byre with him looking him over with open curiosity biggish buggers both of them taller and broader than he was one fair one blackhaired as lucifer they didnt look much alike and yet he had the feeling that they might be relatedsome fleeting glimpse of bone a similarity of expression maybe whats your name mate said the dark chap softly jerry felt the nip of wariness at his nape even as he felt a thrill in the pit of his stomach it was regular speech perfectly understandable a scots accent but mackenzie jw he said straightening up to attention lieutenant royal air force service number an indescribable expression flitted across the dark blokes face an urge to laugh of all bloody things and a flare of excitement in his eyesreally striking eyes a vivid green that flashed sudden in the light none of that mattered to jerry what was important was that the man plainly knew he knew who are you he asked urgent where dye come from the two exchanged an unfathomable glance and the other answered inverness ye know what i mean he took a deep breath when the two strangers were much of an age but the fair one had plainly had a harder life his face was deeply weathered and lined a lang way from you he said quietly and despite his own agitation jerry heard the note of desolation in his voice from now lost lost oh god but still jesus and where are we now whwhen northumbria the dark man answered briefly and i dont bloody know for sure look theres no time if anyone hears us aye right lets go then the air outside was wonderful after the smells of the cow byre cold and full of dying heather and turned earth he thought he could even smell the moon a faint green sickle above the horizon he tasted cheese at the thought and his mouth watered he wiped a trickle of saliva away and hurried after his rescuers hobbling as fast as he could the farmhouse was black a squatty black blot on the landscape the dark bloke grabbed him by the arm as he was about to go past it quickly licked a finger and held it up to test the wind the dogs he explained in a whisper this way they circled the farmhouse at a cautious distance and found themselves stumbling through a plowed field clods burst under jerrys boots as he hurried to keep up lurching on his bad knee with every step where we going he panted when he thought it safe to speak were taking ye back to the stones near the lake the dark man said tersely that has to be where ye came through the fair one just snorted as though this wasnt his notionbut he didnt argue hope flared up in jerry like a bonfire they knew what the stones were how it worked theyd show him how to get back howhow did ye find me he could hardly breathe such a pace they kept up but had to know the lantern was shut and he couldnt see their faces but the dark man made a muffled sound that might have been a laugh i met an auld wifey wearing your dog tags very proud of them she was yeve got them jerry gasped nay she wouldna give them up it was the fair man sounding definitely amused told us where shed got them though and we followed your trail backward hey he caught jerrys elbow just as his foot twisted out from under him the sound of a barking dog broke the nightsome way away but distinct the fair mans hand clenched tight on his arm come on thenhurry jerry had a bad stitch in his side and his knee was all but useless by the time the little group of stones came in sight a pale huddle in the light of the waning moon still he was surprised at how near the stones were to the farmhouse he must have circled round more than he thought in his wanderings right said the dark man coming to an abrupt halt this is where we leave you ye do jerry panted butbut you when ye came through did ye have anything on you a gemstone any jewelry aye jerry said bewildered i had a raw sapphire in my pocket but its gone its like it like it burned up the blond man finished for him grimvoiced aye well so this last was clearly addressed to the dark man who hesitated jerry couldnt see his face but his whole body spoke of indecision he wasnt one to dither thoughhe stuck a hand into the leather pouch at his waist pulled something out and pressed it into jerrys hand it was faintly warm from the mans body and hard in his palm a small stone of some kind faceted like the stone in a ring take this its a good one when ye go throughthe dark man was speaking urgently to himthink about your wife about marjorie think hard see her in your minds eye and walk straight through whatever the hell ye do though dont think about your son just your wife what jerry was gobsmacked how the bloody hell do you know my wifes name and whereve ye heard about my son it doesnt matter the man said and jerry saw the motion as he turned his head to look back over his shoulder damn said the fair one softly theyre coming theres a light there was a single light bobbing evenly over the ground as it would if someone carried it but look as he might jerry could see no one behind it and a violent shiver ran over him tannasg said the other man under his breath jerry knew that word well enoughspirit it meant and usually an illdisposed one a haunt aye maybe the dark mans voice was calm and maybe not its near samhain after all either wayye need to go man and now remember think of your wife jerry swallowed his hand closing tight around the stone aye aye right thanks then he added awkwardly and heard the breath of a rueful laugh from the dark man nay bother mate he said and with that they were both off making their way across the stubbled meadow two lumbering shapes in the moonlight heart thumping in his ears jerry turned toward the stones they looked just like theyd looked before just stones but the echo of what hed heard in there he swallowed it wasnt like there was much choice dolly he whispered trying to summon up a vision of his wife dolly dolly help me he took a hesitant step toward the stones another one more then nearly bit his tongue off as a hand clamped down on his shoulder he whirled fist up but the dark mans other hand seized his wrist i love you the dark man said his voice fierce then he was gone again with the shoofshoof sounds of boots in dry grass leaving jerry with his mouth agape he caught the other mans voice from the darkness irritated halfamused he spoke differently than the dark man a much thicker accent but jerry understood him without difficulty why did ye tell him a daft thing like that and the dark ones reply softspoken in a tone that terrified him more than anything had so far because he isnt going to make it back its the only chance ill ever have come on the day was dawning when he came to himself again and the world was quiet no birds sang and the air was cold with the chill of november and winter coming on when he could stand up he went to look shaky as a newborn lamb the plane wasnt there but there was still a deep gouge in the earth where it had been not raw earth thoughfurred over with grass and meadow plantsnot just furred he saw limping over to have a closer look matted dead stalks from earlier years growth if hed been where he thought hed been if hed truly gone back then hed come forward again but not to the same place hed left how long a year two he sat down on the grass too drained to stand up any longer he felt as though hed walked every second of the time between then and now hed done what the greeneyed stranger had said concentrated fiercely on dolly but he hadnt been able to keep from thinking of wee roger not altogether how could he the picture he had most vividly of dolly was her holding the lad close against her breast thats what hed seen and yet hed made it he thought hed made it maybe what might have happened he wondered there hadnt been time to ask thered been no time to hesitate either more lights had come bobbing across the dark with uncouth northumbrian shouts behind them hunting him and hed hurled himself into the midst of the standing stones and things went pearshaped again even worse he hoped the strangers whod rescued him had got away lost the fair man had said and even now the word went through him like a bit of jagged metal he swallowed he thought he wasnt where he had been but was he still lost himself where was he now or rather when he stayed for a bit gathering his strength in a few minutes though he heard a familiar soundthe low growl of engines and the swish of tires on asphalt he swallowed hard and standing up turned away from the stones toward the road he was luckyfor once he thought wryly there was a line of troop transports passing and he swung aboard one without difficulty the soldiers looked startled at his appearancehe was rumpled and stained bruised and torn about and with a twoweek beardbut they instantly assumed hed been off on a tear and was now trying to sneak back to his base without being detected they laughed and nudged him knowingly but were sympathetic and when he confessed he was skint had a quick whipround for enough cash to buy a train ticket from salisbury where the transport was headed he did his best to smile and go along with the ragging but soon enough they tired of him and turned to their own conversations and he was allowed to sit swaying on the bench feeling the thrum of the engine through his legs surrounded by the comfortable presence of comrades hey mate he said casually to the young soldier beside him what year is it the boyhe couldnt be more than seventeen and jerry felt the weight of the five years between them as though they were fiftylooked at him wideeyed then whooped with laughter whatve you been having to drink dad bring any away with you that led to more ragging and he didnt try asking again did it matter he remembered almost nothing of the journey from salisbury to london people looked at him oddly but no one tried to stop him it didnt matter nothing mattered but getting to dolly everything else could wait london was a shock there was bomb damage everywhere streets were scattered with shattered glass from shop windows glinting in the pale sun other streets blocked off by barriers here and there a stark black notice do not enterunexploded bomb he made his way from st pancras on foot needing to see his heart rising into his throat fit to choke him as he did see what had been done after a while he stopped seeing the details perceiving bomb craters and debris only as blocks to his progress things stopping him from reaching home and then he did reach home the rubble had been pushed off the street into a heap but not taken away great blackened lumps of shattered stone and concrete lay like a cairn where montrose terrace had once stood all the blood in his heart stopped dead congealed by the sight he groped pawing mindlessly for the wroughtiron railing to keep himself from falling but it wasnt there of course not his mind said quite calmly its gone for the war hasnt it melted down made into planes bombs his knee gave way without warning and he fell landing hard on both knees not feeling the impact the crunch of pain from his badly mended kneecap quite drowned out by the small blunt voice inside his head too late ye went too far mr mackenzie mr mackenzie he blinked at the blurred thing above him not understanding what it was something tugged at him though and he breathed the rush of air in his chest ragged and strange sit up mr mackenzie do the anxious voice was still there and handsyes it was handstugging at his arm he shook his head screwed his eyes shut hard then opened them again and the round thing became the houndlike face of old mr wardlaw who kept the corner shop ah there you are the old mans voice was relieved and the wrinkles in his baggy old face relaxed their anxious lines had a bad turn did you i speech was beyond him but he flapped his hand at the wreckage he didnt think he was crying but his face was wet the wrinkles in wardlaws face creased deeper in concern then the old grocer realized what he meant and his face lit up oh dear he said oh no no no notheyre all right sir your familys all right did you hear me he asked anxiously can you breathe had i best fetch you some salts do you think it took jerry several tries to make it to his feet hampered both by his knee and by mr wardlaws fumbling attempts to help him but by the time hed got all the way up hed regained the power of speech where he gasped where are they why your missus took the little boy and went to stay with her mother sometime after you left i dont recall quite where she said mr wardlaw turned gesturing vaguely in the direction of the river camberwell was it bethnal green jerrys mind had come back though it felt still as though it was a pebble rolling round the rim of some bottomless abyss its balance uncertain he tried to dust himself off but his hands were shaking she lives in bethnal green youre sureyoure sure man yes yes the grocer was altogether relieved smiling and nodding so hard that his jowls trembled she leftmust be more than a year ago soon after shesoon after she the old mans smile faded abruptly and his mouth slowly opened a flabby dark hole of horror but youre dead mr mackenzie he whispered backing away hands held up before him oh god youre dead the fuck i am the fuck i am the fuck i am he caught sight of a womans startled face and stopped abruptly gulping air like a landed fish hed been weaving down the shattered street fists pumping limping and staggering muttering his private motto under his breath like the hail marys of a rosary maybe not as far under his breath as hed thought he stopped leaning against the marble front of the bank of england panting he was streaming with sweat and the right leg of his trousers was heavily streaked with dried blood from the fall his knee was throbbing in time with his heart his face his hands his thoughts theyre alive so am i the woman hed startled was down the street talking to a policeman she turned pointing at him he straightened up at once squaring his shoulders braced his knee and gritted his teeth forcing it to bear his weight as he strode down the street officerlike the very last thing he wanted just now was to be taken up as drunk he marched past the policeman nodding politely touching his forehead in lieu of cap the policeman looked taken aback made to speak but couldnt quite decide what to say and a moment later jerry was round the corner and away it was getting dark there werent many cabs in this area at the best of timesnone at all now and he hadnt any money anyway the tube if the lines were open it was the fastest way to bethnal green and surely he could cadge the fare from someone somehow he went back to limping grimly determined he had to reach bethnal green by dark it was so much changed like the rest of london houses damaged halfway repaired abandoned others no more than a blackened depression or a heap of rubble the air was thick with coal dust stone dust and the smells of paraffin and cooking grease the brutal acrid smell of cordite half the streets had no signs and he wasnt so familiar with bethnal green to begin with hed visited dollys mother just twice once when they went to tell her theyd run off and got marriedshe hadnt been best pleased mrs wakefield but shed put a good face on it even if the face had a lemonsucking look to it the second time had been when he signed up with the raf hed gone alone to tell her to ask her to look after dolly while he was gone dollys mother had gone white she knew as well as he did what the life expectancy was for fliers but shed told him she was proud of him and held his hand tight for a long moment before she let him leave saying only come back jeremiah she needs you he soldiered on skirting craters in the street asking his way it was nearly full dark now he couldnt be on the streets much longer his anxiety began to ease a little as he started to see things he knew though close he was getting close and then the sirens began and people began to pour out of the houses he was being buffeted by the crowd borne down the street as much by their barely controlled panic as by their physical impact there was shouting people calling for separated family members wardens bellowing directions waving their torches their flat white helmets pale as mushrooms in the gloom above it through it the airraid siren pierced him like a sharpened wire thrust him down the street on its spike ramming him into others likewise skewered by fright the tide of it swept round the next corner and he saw the red circle with its blue line over the entrance to the tube station lit up by a wardens flashlight he was sucked in propelled through sudden bright lights hurtling down the stair the next onto a platform deep into the earth into safety and all the time the whoop and moan of the sirens still filling the air barely muffled by the dirt above there were wardens moving among the crowd pushing people back against the walls into the tunnels away from the edge of the track he brushed up against a woman with two toddlers picked onea little girl with round eyes and a blue teddy bearout of her arms and turned his shoulder into the crowd making a way for them he found a small space in a tunnel mouth pushed the woman into it and gave her back the little girl her mouth moved in thanks but he couldnt hear her above the noise of the crowd the sirens the creaking the there was a sudden monstrous thud from above that shook the station and the whole crowd was struck silent every eye on the high arched ceiling above them the tiles were white and as they looked a dark crack appeared suddenly between two rows of them a gasp rose from the crowd louder than the sirens the crack seemed to stop to hesitateand then it zigzagged suddenly parting the tiles in different directions he looked down from the growing crack to see who was below itthe people still on the stair the crowd at the bottom was too thick to move everyone stopped still by horror and then he saw her partway up the stair dolly shes cut her hair he thought it was short and curly black as sootblack as the hair of the little boy she held in her arms close against her sheltering him her face was set jaw clenched and then she turned a bit and saw him her face went blank for an instant and then flared like a lit match with a radiant joy that struck him in the heart and flamed through his being there was a much louder thud from above and a scream of terror rose from the crowd louder much louder than the sirens despite the shrieking he could hear the fine rattle like rain as dirt began to pour from the crack above he shoved with all his might but couldnt get past couldnt reach them dolly looked up and he saw her jaw set hard again her eyes blaze with determination she shoved the man in front of her who stumbled and fell down a step squashing into the people in front of him she swung roger down into the little space shed made and with a twist of shoulders and the heave of her whole body hurled the little boy up over the railtoward jerry he saw what she was doing and was already leaning pushing forward straining to reach the boy struck him high in the chest like a lump of concrete little head smashing painfully into jerrys face knocking his head back he had one arm round the child falling back on the people behind him struggling to find his footing get a firmer holdand then something gave way in the crowd around him he staggered into an open space and then his knee gave way and he plunged over the lip of the track he didnt hear the crack of his head against the rail or the screams of the people above it was all lost in a roar like the end of the world as the roof over the stair fell in the little boy was still as death but he wasnt dead jerry could feel his heart beat thumping fast against his own chest it was all he could feel poor little bugger must have had his wind knocked out people had stopped screaming but there was still shouting calling out there was a strange silence underneath all the racket his blood had stopped pounding through his head his own heart no longer hammering perhaps that was it the silence underneath felt alive somehow peaceful but like sunlight on water moving glittering he could still hear the noises above the silence feet running anxious voices bangs and creakingsbut he was sinking gently into the silence the noises grew distant though he could still hear voices is that one nay hes gonelook at his head poor chap caved in something horrid the boys well enough i think just bumps and scratches here lad come up no no let go now its all right just let go let me pick you up yes thats good its all right now hush hush theres a good boy what a look on that blokes facei never saw anything like here take the little chap ill see if the blokes got any
